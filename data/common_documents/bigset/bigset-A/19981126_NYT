RUN ON CIGARETTES FORESHADOWS TOBACCO PRICE HIKE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Folks who deal in smokes are calling it the
biggest cigarette rush of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by a whopping 45-cent hike by tobacco makers in the
per-pack price of cigarettes, large wholesalers like Costco were
invaded Monday and Tuesday by small retailers looking to stock up
before the new rates kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold more cigarettes in the last two days than I've sold
in the previous six weeks,'' said company Vice President John
Eagan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's 30 Southern California stores are already
sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you smoke Marlboros you'll have a hard time finding them in
my buildings. In 20 years I've never experienced this type of sales
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, the window of opportunity had closed as
Costco increased its price per carton from $18.09 to $22.59. Those
retailers who bought before the price increase could win big, Eagan
said, since they don't have to pass on the reduced price to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure for every carton they buy they can make (an extra)
$4.50,'' Eagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Area liquor stores and gas stations raised their prices in line
with the price hike by Wednesday morning. At an Arco station,
manager Robby Kalek said he raised his price from $2.40 to $3. It's
the first time he's ever charged $3 for a pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Petrou, owner of a Chevron Station in Van Nuys, was selling
cigarettes for $3.35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are refusing to buy them. They think it's my price
only,'' Petrou said.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies raised their prices to pay for a $206
billion settlement signed last week with 46 states that's supposed
to reimburse the nation's municipalities for the cost of treating
smoking-related cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst called the price hikes historic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest tobacco price increase in dollar terms in
the history of the United States,'' David Adelman, a tobacco
analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, told The Associated Press
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris USA, the nation's biggest tobacco company and the
first to raise prices, offered no explanation for its increase.
``We never comment on our pricing strategy,'' said spokeswoman Mary
Carnovale.
</P>
<P>
   But Adelman said the main reason was ``to fund the settlement
payment. That is a significant increase in the cost of doing
business and they have to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of the tobacco companies' increase, California's new
50-cent-a-pack tax goes into effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Will those prices persuade more people to quit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying I would never pay $2 for a pack of
cigarettes and here I am still smoking,'' said Gina Geraci, a
38-year-old homemaker who smokes Marlboro Reds.

DISNEY SHELLS OUT FOR LEADER

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ On the day the Angels made their most
significant transaction of the '90s, that which was missing seemed
as important as what one could see.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels Wednesday signed All-Star first baseman Mo Vaughn to
a massive six-year, $80 million contract Wednesday, and the press
conference attendees included two Vaughn representatives, two
Angels lawyers, Angels general manager Bill Bavasi and Mo via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the top floor of Disney Sports could be found. Team
president Tony Tavares was not there to elaborate on his
now-infamous comment that no player is worth $10 million a year.
Michael Eisner did not drop by to digress about brand-name
identity.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before Thanksgiving, the Angels let their baseball
people make two bold moves with one swing _ sign Vaughn and give
the organization some much-needed credibility among its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Vaughn fits in the Angels lineup and
clubhouse. He's a power-hitting left-hander whose commitment to
winning separates him from a lot of other well-paid baseball
players. But no one should overlook the credibility issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' last major free-agent acquisition before Wednesday
was pitcher Mark Langston in 1991. In the years since, the Angels
earned a reputation as a small-market team with small-market goals.
Their boldest move between Langston in 1991 and Vaughn in late 1998
was convincing players like Tim Salmon to trade short-term
free-agent money for long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's arrival, with its flinty bottom-line reputation, only
reaffirmed the image of the Angels guarding their wallet like a
tourist in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hope people would take us a little differently now,'' said
Bavasi at the press conference. ``I think people would be making a
mistake if they think that we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are still in the hunt for Randy Johnson, and the
Vaughn signing might lead to a large trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a change in action. It's not necessarily a change
in philosophy,'' Bavasi continued. ``We're not trying to make a
statement as much as making the ballclub better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people who believe players are not worth $10
million a year than those who do. But the market is what it is.
Disney is not afraid to get in. It just wants to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers of the '98 Angels would agree the team needs
pitching help. But the view from inside focused on the team's need
for a leader, a player who can make a difference in all of those
intangible areas. The Angels' clubhouse last September was
determined but inert. In the last weeks of the season, there was no
one around capable of seizing the moment from within. It is not a
criticism in the least to say that Salmon, Darin Erstad and Gary
DiSarcina are not emotional, kick-butt types of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn brings Kirk Gibson-like qualities to the Angels in
addition to his .304 average and 230 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some (players who are leaders),'' Bavasi said. ``But
after the season, I talked with (coach) George Hendricks, and he
felt we needed to get a guy who is willing and able to say, `Get on
my back and let's go.'
</P>
<P>
   ``From his first season, Mo was a guy who took a leadership role
on a team and in a city where there is a lot of pressure. When I
first met with Adam Katz (Vaughn's agent), I told him that. We said
upfront that we wanted Mo to take a leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   And those were words Vaughn wanted to hear. In Boston, he
watched the Red Sox let Roger Clemens walk away and suffer through
several managerial debacles.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels conveyed the right message: We want to win and we
want you to lead us. That might be as much of an ego stroke as
anything else in sports, but it's preferable to those free agents
who view the system as their personal lottery, or those who sulk
because they can't feel the love.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will love Vaughn to the tune of $13.3 million a year.
In return, they expect a new warmth in the clubhouse. If he loves
them back just a little, Disney's team, not Disneyland, might be
the happiest place on earth.

SPORTS COLUMN: ALL IT TAKES IS ONE TEAM TO ANTE UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To understand how badly George Steinbrenner
miscalculated Bernie Williams' worth, we should remember that he
threatened to trade his center fielder last winter when Williams'
agent, Scott Boras, laughed off a reported five-year, $37.5 million
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The agent said he would take not a million less than $70 million
over seven years, and it was immediately suggested by many
supposedly knowledgeable sources that Boras seek help for a
mysterious condition that affects only the brains of sports agents,
rendering them unable to know a franchise player when they
represent one.
</P>
<P>
   No one in his right mind would pay Bernie Williams that kind of
money, Boras kept hearing, and one afternoon, he returned a
telephone call and offered his own self-assured insights into the
panic-stricken mind of the typical power-franchise owner. ``We know
what the market will be for him,'' Boras said that day. ``And we
just need one team to make that market.''
</P>
<P>
   One team, which turned out to be the hated Boston Red Sox, sure
did empty the Boss of his negotiating bluster. Williams said on
Wednesday night that he was ``very close'' to signing with the Red
Sox but wanted to give the Yankees, the team he signed with as a
skinny teen-ager out of Puerto Rico, one last chance to not make a
mistake that would have been bigger than Steinbrenner's ego.
Williams made a phone call at 1 a.m. on Wednesday to the Yankees'
general manager, Brian Cashman, to more or less plead: don't make
me surrender baseball's most hallowed turf, Yankee Stadium's center
field. Don't make me run out on my roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to the fact,'' Williams could claim on Wednesday
night, with the comfort of $87.5 million tucked under his pillow,
``that I wanted to be a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   We can only imagine how Steinbrenner responded when Cashman
relayed this heart-tugging news. Perhaps the new-age Boss had a
good, cathartic cry, as he did in the winning World Series
clubhouse. What we do know is that Steinbrenner forgot two years'
worth of hardball, Albert Belle and, most commendably, his
resentment of the insidious Scott Boras. He did the smart thing for
his team, and the right thing by rewarding a player whose character
can be counted on, as opposed to outbidding Baltimore for the Belle
of the free-agent ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that is special, the chance to defend with
the exact same team,'' Cashman said, delivering the Yankees'
11th-hour spin.
</P>
<P>
   The $87.5 million over seven years with a club option for
another year was far more than the five-year, $60 million deal the
Yankees had defiantly offered. It was less than the $91 million the
New York Mets guaranteed Mike Piazza. Less than what the Red Sox
offered. Williams obviously did not want to play in Boston. Nothing
personal, just business. If Steinbrenner had the same deft touch,
he would right now be dropping a few rival network names in the
halls at Cablevision, worrying Charles Dolan sick with the
possibility of the Boss eventually peddling those valuable
television rights elsewhere. As Williams now knows, leverage
doesn't hurt the score of your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy that the whole thing is over with,'' he said,
in a voice so typically subdued, he sounded more asleep than
astonished.
</P>
<P>
   The worst that can be said about Williams is that he used the
Red Sox, which is not the same thing as trying to run over some
kids with your car. It was noble of Manager Joe Torre to express
confidence that he could integrate Belle into the Yankees'
harmonious clubhouse, but the prospect of such an addition was
ominous, regardless of how Belle ultimately behaved.
</P>
<P>
   What would young stars such as Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera
have thought when they gazed upon the highly paid personage of
Belle, not Williams, who played under a string of one-year
arbitration deals, performed gallantly, conducted himself
professionally, with the hope that the Boss would one day pay him
fair market value?
</P>
<P>
   This would have been a primer on how Steinbrenner takes care of
his own, setting the kind of work environment that inevitably chips
away at dedication and effort. It was no surprise, then, that
Williams reported a Tuesday night phone conversation with Jeter.
``There really wasn't anything more to say,'' he said. His
teammates had done all their ``recruiting'' before the season's
end.
</P>
<P>
   No, Jeter was just checking in to see if Steinbrenner would ante
up, all the way up from last winter's $37.5 million to $87.5
million. ``Let's just get this done,'' Steinbrenner told Cashman,
when it was clear that Williams was holding the cards. Amazing how
one year later, he was worth $50 million more.  &QL;

   MERGER TALKS REPORTED BETWEEN EXXON AND MOBIL
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon Corp. has discussed a possible merger with the Mobil
Corp., a person involved in the talks said. Such a combination
could create the largest American industrial company and would be
one of the biggest corporate marriages ever.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon-Mobil deal would also bring back together two parts of
John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, dismantled by the Supreme
Court in 1911. The merger discussions come as oil prices have sunk
to the lowest level in almost 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SIGNS OF ECONOMIC STRENGTH
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose a
half-percent last month, led by purchases of durable goods like
cars and computers, after having increased seven-tenths of 1
percent in September. Personal incomes rose at a slower rate of
four-tenths of 1 percent in October after climbing two-tenths of 1
percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS RALLY FURTHER
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in the United States rose as investors helped send the
Dow Jones industrial average to its fifth advance in six days. The
Dow rose 13.13 points, to 9,301.15. Broader market indexes also
advanced. Citigroup and Advanced Micro Devices were the biggest
gainers.
</P>
<P>
   Bond Prices Rose, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury down
to 5.18 percent, the lowest this month.
</P>
<P>
   IMF OVERTURE TO PAKISTAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund agreed to resume assistance to
Pakistan, which had been cut off earlier this year after it
detonated nuclear devices. The agreement came after a decision by
the United States to support the fund's resumption of aid to
Pakistan, which has been on the verge of default.
</P>
<P>
   NESTLE HURT BY GlOBAL WEAKNESS
</P>
<P>
   Nestle, the Swiss food giant, has become the latest European
company to feel the bite of the emerging-markets meltdown,
announcing that food sales in its Africa, Asia and Australia
regions had slumped by 8.7 percent in the first 10 months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping world markets caused Britain's trade deficit to nearly
double in September to $4 billion, the highest since the country
began recording the data.
</P>
<P>
   DEUTSCHE TELEKOM RESULTS IMPROVE
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest phone company, said that it
had improved third-quarter earnings by narrowing losses in cable
television and other divisions even as rivals took a bigger bite
out of its long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   GABELLI AMENDS PUBLIC OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   Alpha G, the holding company for Gabelli Funds, which is run by
the New York money manager Mario Gabelli, has filed an amended
initial public offering registration with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, saying it plans to offer six million class A
common shares that may be priced between $16 and $19 a share. After
the offering, Gabelli will indirectly own shares of common stock
having about 97.6 percent of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   NIPPON REDUCING JAPANESE HOLDINGS
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's biggest life insurer, said it
wanted to reduce its holdings of domestic securities in favor of
higher returns abroad. The company said it would buy more
securities denominated in foreign currencies, while monitoring
exchange rates.

HUD STARTS INSPECTIONS OF TROUBLED SUBSIDIZED HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The high-rise building at 5929 E. Capitol St. here
is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Capitol View Plaza II, it is a 12-story collection of
300 one- and two-bedroom apartments, many of which are government
subsidized, with leaks in the roof, broken plumbing, inoperable
boilers, interior walls covered with graffiti, carpets pock-marked
with cigarette burns, exposed wiring, missing fire extinguishers,
no sprinkler system and air-vent chutes filled with garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps worst of all is this: Until recently, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, which oversees subsidized and public
housing across the country, had no idea that the conditions at
Capitol View Plaza had deteriorated to such a miserable extent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after 30 years in the housing business, HUD is still
not certain just how many other federally subsidized buildings
around the country housing low-income people have problems
threatening the health and safety of the 12 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   All that is about to change. A new $24 million enforcement
initiative is under way to inspect all 372,800 properties that HUD
is involved with, like Capitol View Plaza, through subsidies,
guaranteed mortgages and local public housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a toothless system in which banks and property owners
were responsible for their own inspections to maintain federal
contracts, the new procedures will require the owners of troubled
properties to fulfill all the terms of their contracts by fixing
problems. If conditions are not repaired, the owners will face
action by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're asking for is what we have already paid for,'' HUD
Secretary Andrew Cuomo said of a system in which the federal
government provides incentives to landlords and housing authorities
to maintain safe and decent housing. ``And this is the problem the
American taxpayers have with HUD. They have paid for a product, and
we haven't delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspection program is one of the most ambitious efforts
undertaken by Cuomo since he took office last year. He said it
would not only lead to the department's first computerized
inventory of housing nationwide but also its most complete profile
of troubled housing projects and guaranteed action by the federal
government against problem landlords and property managers.
</P>
<P>
   By protocols of the program, data from each site is sent to the
department's new Real Estate Assessment Center for analysis and
disposition. HUD officials said a pilot program of 4,000 properties
conducted earlier this year found that about 30 percent of them
required significant repairs, most of which were needed to correct
problems that exposed residents to health and safety risks. No
repairs have yet been made or action taken against owners and
landlords.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight the importance of the inspection system to the
department and the millions of people who live in subsidized
housing, Cuomo invited a reporter to accompany him and other senior
housing officials Wednesday as an inspector toured Capitol View
Plaza, noting on his hand-held computer all the problems he found.
</P>
<P>
   But some skeptics question whether the program will ultimately
lead to real improvements in the governments' housing program or
merely shine a spotlight on Cuomo, a son of former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, who has made no secret of his greater political
aspirations, including the possibility of running for the Senate
seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., plans to retire from in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory is good,'' Denise Muha, executive director of the
National Leased Housing Association, said of the initiative. ``The
secretary is trying to accomplish better data and better reaction.
But the proof is in the pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brigl, director of governmental affairs for the Public
Housing Authorities Directors' Association, expressed concerns over
the objectivity of the inspectors and the department's analysis of
the data, saying, ``Good quality physical inspections are a good
idea, but the jury is still out on the vehicle he is using.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the possibility that some of Cuomo's motives might
be political, Brigl added: ``Like anybody else in Washington, the
secretary wants to do a good job, which will give him some
political headway.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of a House housing
subcommittee, welcomed the new inspections but said their
effectiveness ``depends on what H.U.D. does with the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1968, HUD has spent billions of dollars
though a variety of programs for poor and working-class families.
Many of the programs involve private investors, taking advantage of
tax credits or federal subsidies to manage large apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One such landlord is Allan Rozansky of Rockville, Md., whom
housing officials identified as the owner of Capitol View Plaza.
But reflecting one of the major problems with the building _ and
subsidized housing, in general _ housing officials say Rozansky is
virtually impossible to find.
</P>
<P>
   He is not listed in any Maryland telephone directory. The
telephone number that HUD officials have for his company, Capitol
View Plaza Phase II Associates, has been disconnected. The managing
agent for the building, H.R. Crawford, provided a number but said
he was not sure if it was Rozansky's. A message left on an
answering machine at the number was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very awkward system,'' Crawford said of his efforts to
coordinate repair efforts with the owner. As a result, he added,
``We are resigning at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Williams, a 70-year-old great-grandmother who has lived
in Capitol View Plaza for five years, welcomed the group in to see
her cramped two-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor with water
damage along her walls and cockroaches in the kitchen. Despite
that, she said, ``I'm all right with it here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible, for now, to know how many other buildings
around the country present the same kinds of problems posed by
Capitol View Plaza. The inspections are not expected to be
completed for another year, and forcing landlords to act could take
years beyond that.

SHERIFF'S OFFICE TARGET OF FEDERALINQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office has agreed to look into allegations
that Maricopa County Sheriff's administrators used false witness
statements, threats and bribery in a campaign to squelch internal
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders from two deputy associations ripped Sheriff
Joe Arpaio, with one of them condemning him for employing ``Gestapo
tactics'' against deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The double-barreled assault on Arpaio stems from internal
investigations of deputies who were suspected of being
``dime-droppers'' _ those who leak information to the media.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley sent a letter
to federal prosecutors concerning suspected criminal violations
within the Sheriff's Office. Romley was forced to refer the case
because of conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Bill FitzGerald, a county attorney spokesman, confirmed that the
letter was prompted by a sworn affidavit from former sheriff's Lt.
Robert Wetherell, once head of Arpaio's Internal Affairs Division.
</P>
<P>
   In the sworn statement, Wetherell says sheriff's director David
Hendershott ordered him to alter a deputy's memo during the probe
of Sgt. Mark Battilana, a suspected dime-dropper.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell also says Hendershott told him to root out other
leakers by offering plum assignments to those who helped, and by
threatening those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell's affidavit also says Hendershott and Chief Deputy
Jadel Roe were ``less than truthful'' in merit board testimony on
the Battilana case.
</P>
<P>
   Battilana's attorney, Phil Fleming, said those allegations
suggest criminal wrongdoing, and he applauded the U.S. Attorney's
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Under Arizona law, it is a felony to commit perjury or
improperly influence a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he has no information on the federal probe but is
confident his management staff has done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He said the controversy stems from ``a few disgruntled
employees'' who were removed for misconduct. He said he does not
believe Wetherell's charges, and has no intention of conducting an
internal probe of them.
</P>
<P>
   Romley declined to comment. His office refused to release a copy
of his letter to federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Colbert, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney, confirmed
that an inquiry is under way but would not discuss details. She
said Tom Hannis, chief criminal prosecutor, probably will handle
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal interest comes after years of complaints from
sheriff's employees who claim Arpaio is so obsessed with his image
and popularity that anyone identified as disloyal is subjected to
unscrupulous investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Battilana became a target several years ago after ``New Times,''
a Valley newspaper, published a scathing article on Arpaio.
Wetherell was placed in charge of an internal investigation which
led to Battilana's firing, and testified against Battilana during a
protracted civil service hearing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Wetherell himself became the target of an internal
probe by the Sheriff's Office. He retired after receiving a
termination notice, then filed his affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Tupper, one of the deputies used by Wetherell in the
Battilana investigation, said Wetherell's affidavit is a pack of
lies.
</P>
<P>
   He disputed the assertion that false statements were made
against Battilana and that officers who cooperated were given
choice assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He perjured himself when he wrote that affidavit,'' Tupper
said of Wetherell. ``It's revenge against the sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   But other deputies visited Romley to corroborate Wetherell's
story and provide additional information.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Lt. James Mann, recently was transferred to an
unwanted post and subjected to an internal investigation. While
being questioned by Internal Affairs, Mann produced a letter from
Romley saying he was a ``whistle-blower'' _ protected under Arizona
law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, charges against Mann were ruled unfounded by Roe,
chief deputy for Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   The county attorney passed the Wetherell allegations to federal
prosecutors because of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Romley's office represents Arpaio in some civil matters,
including the Battilana case.
</P>
<P>
   After Wetherell wrote his affidavit, Assistant County Attorney
Ron Lebowitz submitted a sworn statement denying the charges and
characterizing Wetherell as paranoid, disgruntled and a perjurer.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio and Romley also have bitter differences personally and
professionally; sheriff's officials have a state Bar complaint
pending against Romley for alleged ethical violations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders of two deputy associations blasted Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Barnes, president of the Deputy Law Enforcement
Association, said the cases against Mann, Wetherell and Battilana
are part of a chilling formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is being run with Gestapo tactics,'' Barnes said.
``The deputies in this office are being treated just like the
inmates. We're being plotted against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Arpaio consistently tries to discredit critics by
calling them ``disgruntled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have nearly 300 deputies in our association. Are they
all disgruntled?''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gerberry, secretary-treasurer of the rival Maricopa County
Deputies Association, also criticized Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with his treatment of employees,'' Gerberry
said. ``This isn't random. It's a method of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the sheriff knows about it, I don't know. But he ought
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's baloney,'' Arpaio said. ``I don't know what they're
talking about. . . . There is no union, and we don't recognize the
associations. These people have no standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said anyone with a complaint is free to file a grievance.
He said the Sheriff's Office has 2,000 employees, deputies recently
got a pay raise, and ``morale has never been as high as it is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Roe, who announced her retirement this week, was not so quick to
dismiss the criticism. Conceding that Arpaio has a hard-headed
attitude toward allegiance, she said, ``I can't deny there appears
to be something of a pattern there. . . . You know Joe. You
understand that high premium on loyalty he places.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerberry and Barnes said they are afraid of retaliation for
their public statements, but had to speak out on behalf of
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous deputies claim they were fired, transferred or forced
out of the Sheriff's Office after facing dubious charges of
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Reyer said his loyalty was questioned in 1994 after he wrote
an internal memo complaining that the sheriff's 2,000-member posse
was overloaded with ``Rambos'' and ``washedout cop wannabes.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo warned that poorly screened volunteers could cause a
tragedy. It told of posse badge-toting volunteers who came to work
drunk, carried concealed weapons and had criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Reyer says he had impeccable reviews before that. He was named
Deputy of the Year several times and organized an annual sheriff's
toy collection for needy kids. Then a newspaper reporter obtained
the memo, Reyer says, and Arpaio gave him ``the ass-chewing of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyer says he was subjected to a scene reminiscent of
McCarthyism: interrogations, threats and demands that he snitch on
other deputies who talked to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling me I'm going to be terminated if I don't give
these people up,'' he recalled. ``I get polygraphed, threatened
about my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyer was transferred from a job supervising 50 deputies to a
cubbyhole in the basement of Madison Street Jail: ``That's all I
do, sit there and look at the telephone all night, playing
solitaire,'' he said. ``My heart and soul were in the Sheriff's
Office . . . the pride, the identity.''
</P>
<P>
   After 19 years as a deputy, Reyer said he found himself weeping
in a corner of the basement office. He went on leave from stress,
and took a medical retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   The list of critics also includes Tom Bearup, once an Arpaio
confidant and apologist, who now describes the sheriff as
``paranoid'' about traitor deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Bearup says the sheriff's motive in all this is simple: ``Joe
never wanted anyone _ anyone else _ to get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the DLEA president, said Arpaio's obsession with leaks,
politics and publicity diverts manpower and money from basic law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the citizens don't realize is, they pull from the guys
who are out there handling 911 calls,'' Barnes said. ``It's an
officer safety issue. It's a citizen service issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said his posse and other innovations have attracted
international praise and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we serve the people of this county,'' he
said. ``And we do a tremendous job.'' &QL;

HELLO, GOODBYE  
 D-BACKS GREET STOTTLEMYRE, LOSE B. WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball's free-agent dominoes started to fall Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams reconciled with the New York Yankees. Mo Vaughn
was fitted for the Anaheim Angels' golden halo. The Diamondbacks
and Todd Stottlemyre made it official.
</P>
<P>
   And Randy Johnson . . . wherefore art thou?
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who visited with Diamondbacks officials at Bank One
Ballpark on Nov. 12, agreed to return to the World Series champion
Yankees with a seven-year deal for $87.5 million and an option for
an eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited deal between the Angels and Vaughn, the
power-hitting first baseman, is for six years and $80 million and
an option for a seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   After signing a four-year deal for $32 million, Stottlemyre
vowed to bring an intensity level to the mound that would allow
Arizona to be in the thick of the National League West race.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves four teams _ the Diamondbacks, Angels, Los Angeles
Dodgers and Texas Rangers _ hoping that their Thanksgiving wishbone
doesn't splinter into a million pieces while awaiting the decision
from Johnson, a flame-throwing, 6-foot-10 left-hander. He is
expected to announce his choice by the end of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnson must decide on whether his desire to remain at home
in the Phoenix area is out weighed by the chance to reach the World
Series faster with Texas, Anaheim or the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, Angels and Rangers all have made offers to
Johnson for four years in the $50 million range. The Dodgers raised
the bar with a four-year offer for $52 million.
</P>
<P>
   Managing general partner Jerry Colangelo remains confident about
the Diamondbacks' chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary interest was and is Randy,'' he said. ``The
decision is in his hands now. If it's meant to be, it's meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he wasn't surprised to hear the news about
Williams. As much as Williams enjoyed his visit here and
reacquainted himself with Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter, his
former skipper with the Yankees, Colangelo had a sense that
Williams would stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that Arizona was on the outside looking in was the
fact that Colangelo had not spoken with Williams' agent, Scott
Boras, in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what Bernie had, it made all the sense in the
world for him to return to the Yankees,'' Colangelo said. ``We are
trying very hard to be as competitive as soon as we can, but they
just won the World Series. That's a difficult thing to walk away
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Steve Finley, the other center fielder who appeals to
the Diamondbacks, has received an initial offer to return to the NL
champion San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had a conference-call negotiating session with
Finley's agent, Tommy Tanzer, on Wednesday, and owner John Moores
emerged to say that he was optimistic about keeping Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre is optimistic about Arizona's outlook in 1999 and
beyond. He said he received about six offers from other clubs, some
identical to the Diamondbacks, but said he sensed Colangelo is
committed to building a winner.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his intensity, Stottlemyre related a story that
began a few years ago with a conversation with his mother, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked me, `How much longer do you think you'll pitch?' ''
Stottlemyre said. ``I said, `I can't tell you. I don't know if I
could ever find anything to fill that void.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Game day is a special day. . . . I go out as if each game were
my last one. During the regular season, some people say, `Settle
down. This isn't the seventh game of the World Series.' Well, I
don't want to have to get there and have to push that button. I
want to pitch that way all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said he will donate $1 million to the United Way,
with an emphasis on leukemia research. One of his brothers, Jason,
died of the disease. &QL;

CHANDLER REPORT BLASTS IMMIGRATION ROUNDUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANIE MAGRUDER  
 and CALEB CORREA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chandler's police were inadequately prepared and poorly
supervised when they unlawfully stopped and quizzed U.S.-born
Hispanics and legal immigrants during a five-day roundup of
undocumented workers last year.
</P>
<P>
   But police did not set out to violate the civil rights of
Hispanic residents and legal immigrants during the controversial
operation, which caused a groundswell of outrage and resulted in
the filing of two multimillion-dollar lawsuits. Nor was the city
trying to rid the downtown of Hispanics to make way for an
ambitious redevelopment plan.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the conclusions of a 9-month-long, $145,000
investigation, which was ordered by the City Council in January,
and released Wednesday by city officials.
</P>
<P>
   For downtown resident M.R. Diaz, the investigators took too long
to say what everybody already knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic community knows it, the Anglos know it, but some
people just wanted a document out saying, `It is wrong,' '' Diaz
said. ``Some people say, `Let's get over it,' but for me, I'll
still keep my eye on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-member investigation team, led by former ``Arizona
Republic'' reporter John Winters, focused on a joint operation
between police and the U.S. Border Patrol, which was supposed to
address citizens' complaints about undocumented workers causing
problems down town.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a rush job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police say they weren't told by the Border Patrol when the
operation would begin until five or six days before it started,
giving them little time for preparation,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mike Kelly, who was second in command to Lt. Cliff
Anderson, told investigators, ``It threw me, it threw Lt.
Anderson.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the investigators' findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Before the operation, officers received no training and were
not briefed about department policy on suspected illegal
immigrants, which states police may not stop them without probable
cause. Department regulations state that officers are required to
be familiar with the policy, but they were not.
</P>
<P>
   _Chandler police stopped a substantial number of citizens they
thought might be illegals and questioned them about their
citizenship. Based on dozens of interviews with many credible
witnesses, the investigators said it was unlikely they could
conspire to say they were questioned, when they were not.
</P>
<P>
   _The Hispanic population bore the brunt of the operation, and
largely Hispanic areas were scrutinized by police and the Border
Patrol. A squad car was positioned to watch vehicles entering or
leaving one neighborhood. The officer would radio ahead if any
violation, such as failing to signal, was committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when the spotter would mention that a vehicle
was loading up with people,'' the report stated. ``This would then
become an item of special interest to the officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler Mayor Jay Tibshraeny called the report ``very
thorough,'' and said he was not surprised by its primary
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said in the past, there were some problems in this
operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tibshraeny declined to comment about what effect the report
might have on the two lawsuits, nor would he say whether it will
cause anyone to lose his or her job. The report doesn't single out
any individuals as responsible for the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But City Manager Lloyd Harrell, who praised the investigation as
``pretty balanced,'' said no one should be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen to date, there were some mistakes, but
they weren't malicious in intent, and nothing would indicate that
anyone should lose their job over this,'' Harrell said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said police didn't know their lawful limitations in
dealing with undocumented immigrants and may have been overzealous
because they believed they were performing a vitally needed
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a blip on the radar screen in terms of what is and
has been a good police department,'' Tibshraeny said. ``We're all
human, we all make mistakes, and we all learn from our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix lawyer Stephen Montoya, who represents Hispanic
plaintiffs in a $35 million civil-rights lawsuit pending in U.S.
District Court, said the investigators bent over backward to be
fair to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They criticized the Attorney General's Office for not giving
the Police Department the opportunity to respond, and in some ways,
the converse criticism could be made,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey a year ago by Attorney General Grant Woods' office
included comments from many Hispanics who said their civil rights
were violated by police, but no interviews with police. Woods
issued a stinging criticism of the city and recommended an internal
investigation be done.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya said the investigator's report dovetails with Woods'
report and his clients' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to written city policy, the city engaged in an
orchestrated, multiday operation to somehow reduce the number of
undocumented workers, and in the process, because of a lack of
training and a lack of supervision and a lack of knowledge,
people's rights were violated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya said the report implies responsibility for the mistakes
made and that the police chief be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Joe (Harris) screwed up seriously, and he's in charge of
the Police Department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the report amounts to ``Monday night quarterbacking,
'' but he doesn't disagree with its findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, we should have done things differently,'' he
said. ``But this operation, to me, wasn't a big deal. It literally
shocked me how many people were arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators didn't buy the notion that Chandler is trying
to push Hispanics from downtown. They found most of the
low-interest and no-interest loans and grants from the city have
gone to inner-city Hispanics to fix up their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Tibshraeny, Harrell and Harris pointed to steps the city has
taken to heal wounds opened by the roundup, including the
re-establishment of the Human Relations Commission and more
diversity training for police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But some Chandler Hispanics say it's far from enough.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Encinas of the Chandler Coalition for Civil and Human
Rights said it's time for the City Council to admit they were wrong
and step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voted for them to protect us and they aren't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the city and its police force want the issue to go
away. However, Encinas said, ``The more they prolong this, the
longer it's gonna take to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Grocery stores like Southwest Supermarkets on North Arizona
Avenue and Food City on Alma School Road were targeted by police,
she said. ``All the areas where the Hispanics live. Why didn't they
go to the north side?''
</P>
<P>
   Leobardo Espinoza, owner of Botas El Bandido, a downtown boot
and clothing store, said his business has never been the same since
the roundup. Espinoza's business, 95 percent of which is generated
by Hispanics shoppers, has dropped by about 90 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza said he plans to move his store to Mesa or Phoenix to
get away from the racism and discrimination in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to move ahead, but we found ourselves in an area where
they don't want Hispanics to move ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalia Garcia, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and downtown business
owner, said the investigators' findings were expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is from investigators hired by the city. This is pretty
much a cop out,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Gomez, president of the Arizona Civil Rights Movement
Inc., disagreed that police did not have time to train. Gomez said
officers wanting to enforce immigration should quit their jobs and
join the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``They screwed up, and it's going to take more than a lawsuit to
fix it,'' said Gomez, a plaintiff in another lawsuit against the
city. ``I want them (city officials) to be removed, settle the
lawsuits and be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Martin Sepulveda, a critic of Harris and the roundup,
said he hopes the report will push the city to settle the lawsuits
and take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some special plan of action will come out of this report,'' he
said. ``We had a problem, and unless we handle the problem, we will
still have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is monetary compensation for plaintiffs in
the lawsuit, Montoya said, and a city-funded center where Hispanic
residents can learn how to better their lives. &QL;

NBA CANCELS NEXT BARGAINING SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This dispute is beginning to play out like the final
scene of the bitter divorce movie ``War of the Roses,'' in which
the couple fight until they are left sprawled and dying in the
debris of a crystal chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the players and the owners are leaning on the
banister, just a few false steps from a tumble into that
chandelier. On Wednesday, on the 147th day of the National
Basketball Association lockout, the two sides continued to sharpen
their banter and hone the art of mental rug-snatching when the
league canceled the full bargaining session that was set for
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this change of heart were the familiar signs of
distrust and suspicion that have characterized these negotiations
from the start. Feeling as though the union was going back on its
word, league officials canceled Saturday's meeting after they said
Jeffrey Kessler, the union's chief outside counsel, told them on
Monday that the players association had misunderstood the key
element to an escrow proposal. This element had prompted optimism
that a deal was close to getting done after a 10-hour bargaining
session on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said on
Wednesday that there was no misunderstanding. He said that the
union's negotiators were prepared to toil this weekend to get an
agreement, but that they were not willing to bargain under
``ultimatums'' outlined in a letter by Russ Granik, the deputy
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this latest stalemate, the players will be
surrounded by their families for Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday
not knowing what is next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we sit here and try and analyze why they've done
what they've done at this late stage, the only conclusion I can
arrive at is they're trying to play head games with our players,''
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we agree on something in a meeting Friday, and then we
are told a few days later that that was not what the union meant,
that's not an acceptable way to proceed,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin,
the league's chief legal officer. ``That makes a mockery of
bargaining. So we told them we don't see any point in meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest snag centers on the figures that would apply to the
escrow tax, a fund that would go toward paying back the owners once
players salaries had surpassed an agreed-upon percentage of
revenue. But there are other differences, as well. After making
progress Friday, the players sifted through the league's proposal
and recoiled at a new ``timing rule,'' under which teams that sign
another team's free agent would not be able to re-sign their own
free agents under the Larry Bird exception, which allows teams to
exceed the salary cap to pay their own players.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to him by Granik, Hunter said, the league
explained there was no need for a meeting unless the players agreed
to: 1. back off the 57 percent share of revenues the union wants
and announce a bottom-line figure; 2. soften their stance on the
proposed timing rule, and 3. submit to the league's version of a
backup tax, which would supplement any money collected from the
players' paychecks under a previously agreed-upon escrow plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to negotiate with a gun to our head,'' Hunter
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Hunter's remarks, the league released this
statement by Mishkin on Wednesday night: ``Three developments have
occurred in the last few days. First, Mr. Hunter informed us that
the union would not negotiate a revenue sharing percentage lower
than the 57 percent at which the owners terminated the last
agreement; second, Mr. Kessler announced publicly that the union's
rejection of the NBA's proposal regarding the timing of free-agent
signings was not negotiable, and third, we were informed that the
union's agreement to an escrow proposal, over which the parties had
negotiated for hours last Friday, was withdrawn. In light of the
union's positions, we fail to understand Mr. Hunter's new assertion
that the N.B.A. is issuing ultimatums and hindering the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The jousting has seemed unending during the lockout, which has
wiped out the first two months of the season. If the two sides can
resolve their differences next week, the earliest the season can
begin will be January. Commissioner David Stern is hurtling toward
a date _ probably mid-December _ when he will have to decide if the
season can be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he would wait to hear from Granik about plans to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're going to have to hear that there is a change of
view and that these things are not nonnegotiable,'' Granik said.
``We have to hear that our deal is back on the table, or something
like that.''  &QL;

D-BACKS' FOCUS BACK ON JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The somewhat stunning news that Bernie Williams will return to
the New York Yankees sent a wave of optimism crashing through the
Diamondbacks' front office late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling emanated from Managing General Partner Jerry
Colangelo's refocused desire not to lose the one prized free agent
he has singled out as his must-have player for the winter _ Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Word from within the inner circle of Camp Johnson had just about
everyone agreeing that the Diamondbacks should be Johnson's pick.
He basically has four identical offers from the Diamondbacks,
Anaheim, Texas and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   All four have said they are willing to pay in the neighborhood
of $50 million to secure the Big Unit's talents for the next four
seasons. That said, Johnson is looking beyond the dollars to his
real desire, winning.
</P>
<P>
   Like most players who have been in the game awhile without
realizing the ultimate prize, Johnson wants a crack at the World
Series. Veteran players have testified that no amount of money is
enough to equal the exhilaration that comes from being on the field
when your club secures the final out of a World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The logical step would be to analyze the clubs in Johnson's
final four. Since he's doing that, let's try and scale up the
6-foot-10 pitcher's body and creep inside his head:
</P>
<P>
   Texas: Nice ballclub with two-time Most Valuable Player Juan
Gonzalez and perennial All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez. It's a club
that has been in the playoffs twice in the past three years but
managed just one victory in seven games. The strong belief is that
Johnson's wife, Lisa, is not a particularly big fan of the
Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. She didn't even make the trip to the
area with her husband last week, which revealed more than the
Rangers would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles: The Dodgers have been on the verge of having a
monster club for years and failed miserably every time. They're
considered one of the biggest underachievers in the game. In
addition, Johnson's personality doesn't seem likely to blend in
well with some of the Dodgers' more rebellious-type players. Also,
Johnson does not necessarily enjoy stepping into the batter's box,
a must if he's in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim: The Angels have been extremely proactive in their
desire to sign Johnson. Even Disney Chief Executive Officer Michael
Eisner, a stranger inside the Angels' clubhouse, has been involved
in the negotiations to woo Johnson to Orange County. Mo Vaughn, who
signed with the Angels on Wednesday, has also lobbied Johnson.
Playing for the Angels would also give Johnson the chance to stick
it to his former club, Seattle, on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the Diamondbacks: Johnson has privately said
all along how important it is for him to play near where his family
lives. Well, the Johnson clan lives in Paradise Valley. Only one
big-league club plays within 300 miles of his home and it's the
Diamondbacks. Johnson's biggest concern, understandably, seems to
be competing.
</P>
<P>
   That subject took up most of the conversation when Johnson met
with Colangelo two weeks ago. At the time, Colangelo asked that
Johnson sit back and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the Diamondbacks, arguably the most active of
the 30 clubs this winter, have added starters Todd Stottlemyre and
Armando Reynoso, reliever Greg Swindell, jack-of-all-trades Greg
Colbrunn, and speedy center field prospect Dante Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Diamondbacks are a much better club today than they
were when the season ended. They are not as far along as Anaheim.
Then again, the Angels began playing in 1961 and have yet to reach
the World Series. How many people honestly believe the Diamondbacks
will never have reached a World Series by 2036?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been about money for me,'' Johnson said during the
final week of the regular season. ``I could quit today and be
content for the rest of my life. There's a lot that comes from
winning. You relish it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding Johnson to a starting five that would include
Stottlemyre, Andy Benes, Omar Daal and Reynoso would formulate the
best rotation in the National League West. It's the type of
rotation that could easily contend for the NL West title in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Johnson's arrival would also allow the Diamondbacks
to trade Brian Anderson, whose name comes up when other clubs want
to talk trade with Arizona. Anderson could go back to Cleveland for
Richie Sexson, a big and powerful first baseman the Diamondbacks
are convinced could play right field. It's a trade that has been
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've attempted to demonstrate to Randy our commitment to
becoming competitive as quickly as we can,'' Colangelo said.
``We've tried to let the signs be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sign the Diamondbacks need now would be a phone call
from Paradise Valley telling them he's ready to come on board. It's
a call the Diamondbacks would love to hear. &QL;

PRANKS OFF ICE A BYPRODUCT OF WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know times are good on a hockey team when the assistant
equipment manager suffers a black eye during some friendly
horseplay in the locker room, and the players can't wait to talk
about it to the media.
</P>
<P>
   When you're winning like this in the NHL, the pranks and the
practical jokes come as fast and furious as the obligatory body
check, which, oh, only happens about a gazillion times during your
average season.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is a potential target this season on the Coyotes, who
can improve to a 11 games over .500 for the first time since
1984-85 with a victory tonight over the New Jersey Devils at
America West Arena. Almost everyone has been had so far this young
season _ even black-eyed Tony DaCosta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, I think he fell down some stairs,'' Coyotes forward Shane
Doan said with a sinister smile, referring to DaCosta.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the truth, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he started the war and we just took it to the next
level,'' Doan said, trying again.
</P>
<P>
   That's not true, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Doan said. ``He sewed our wallets and our keys into our
pants and stuff like that. Then he hid all our clothes and our
shoes and cut our (skate) laces. We just said, ``Enough is enough.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Again, another lie.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, DaCosta simply wandered too close the other day to
Doan and his good friend, fellow forward Brad Isbister. The two
players were shadow boxing, when one of them grabbed DaCosta and in
the equipment man's rush to break free, he rammed his face into one
of Doan's clenched fists.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a moment that DaCosta, in his third season
working for the Coyotes, won't get Doan and Isbister. With his
needle work, their wallets and their car keys aren't the only
things that aren't safe.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody's safe. That's what happens when you burst out to a
12-2-2 start, a franchise record, and you go 12 straight games
without a loss, one shy of another club mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they got me already,'' 22-year-old defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky said, refusing to name names or a particular incident.
``Let's just say I think I know who did it, so I'm not going to
blow it now and let them know in the paper so I can't get them back
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said it had something to do with a dinner invitation,
but the snitches wouldn't tell the whole story. That's part of a
good prank, too _ getting away with it without being found out.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the spoofs are simple. Someone sneaks into the
equipment room, borrows a pair of scissors and starts cutting the
laces on your skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do that to a guy today because he was a couple
minutes late for practice,'' defenseman Jyrki Lumme said last week.
``He'll learn. He was late, and we made him even more late.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times, the foils cooked up by the Coyotes take a little
more imagination. Like the ``toboggan ride,'' the origin of which,
we regret to report, can't be revealed in order to protect the
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to answer to Mr. X if you print that one, and
he'll ``kill'' you,'' one of the players said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fun goes on. Just ask Jason Doig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, we had a hardest-shot competition and picked `Doiger' to
be the guy,'' one of the players said, requesting anonymity. ``We
took a hacksaw and cut every one of his sticks before he went out
there. It wasn't enough to really break the blade, but it was
enough where he couldn't get anything to move. It was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Doig is still plotting his revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who it was, those pranksters,'' he said. ``But
when they least expect it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't all just been fun and games, though, for the surging
Coyotes during their 35-day unbeaten streak, which had vaulted them
to the top of the NHL standings entering Wednesday's games. When
the puck drops, it's all business. When Coach Jim Schoenfeld blows
his whistle for the start of practice, the clowning and cavorting
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the stuff that goes on in the room is great
that way,'' Schoenfeld said. ``I think sometimes it's more critical
when you're going through a ``tough'' time to regain your sense of
humor. But I always enjoyed a good practical joke when I was a
player. I've been on both ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fun of the game. That's the camaraderie that you
remember when it's all said and done. What was the best thing about
playing? The best thing about playing was the guys I played with.
The relationships you had, the friendships that develop. Then you
go on and get married, you have your families and they have their
families, and friendships permeate to the children. I mean, that's
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a limit . . . But you need enthusiasm in this game. I
don't think anybody's blown anybody's car up or anything like that,
so it hasn't gotten too far out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran forward Rick Tocchet said the pranks and practical jokes
have done a lot to strengthen the team's chemistry, which wasn't
the best the past two years. Players are starting to express their
personalities, he said, and that not only lightens up the dressing
room, it shows on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys like to joke before games, some guys like to play
pranks,'' he said. ``And we haven't stopped doing it. There's been
a lot of pranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Name one, he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I can't,'' Tocchet said, ``because then Oleg's
going to think it was me. I didn't do it, Oleg, I swear.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, the team's 34-year-old war horse, has even been a
victim on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a few, just a couple things I'm not too pleased
about,'' he said. ``Me and `Gus,' Greg Adams, are the oldest guys
on the team, and we're getting too many pranks pulled on us, so
we're going to have to put a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   What sort of things have they done?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, I don't really want to divulge that right now,'' Tocchet
said. ``I don't want to say. Some guys don't know I know it's them.
I gotta get payback, you know? I got something coming for them.
It's a good one.'' &QL;

CLAIBORNE IS TWICE AS GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker Chris Claiborne was named to the
first two All-American teams released Wednesday. Claiborne was a
first-team selection on the Walter Camp All-American team and also
made the Football Writers Association of America's first team.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne is on track to become USC's first consensus
All-American linebacker since Jack Del Rio in 1984. He is the
Trojans' first consensus All-American since Keyshawn Johnson in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne is also a Butkus Award finalist, along with Florida's
Jevon Kearse and Texas A&AMP;M's Dat Nguyen. Claiborne has 95 tackles,
five sacks, five interceptions and 13 pass deflections this season.
Kearse has 54 tackles, 7{ sacks, 10 deflections and one
interception while Nguyen has 118 tackles, three sacks, one
interception and two deflections.
</P>
<P>
   The Butkus Award winner will be announced Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson makes slow progress: Linebacker David Gibson tried to
practice Wednesday but was unable to go as he continued to be
bothered by his bruised thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not as good as I had hoped,'' Gibson said. ``I think
it's going to be a game-time decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Mark Cusano would start at linebacker in place of
Gibson, but he expected Gibson would be able to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly that he'll be ready,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano and freshman Darryl Knight split time at the position
during the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Ennis Davis also missed practice and Hackett
said senior Marc Matock would probably start, although he is still
not capable of going an entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to put too much pressure on him,'' Hackett said.
Hackett still expects Davis to play.
</P>
<P>
   Although wide receiver R. Jay Soward has recovered from his
sprained ankle, he will not practice the rest of the week to keep
his legs fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably close (to 100 percent),'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Losing focus: Is Hackett concerned that the Trojans will lose
focus with the Thanksgiving holiday?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a whole bunch of things we have to be
concerned about,'' Hackett said. ``You've got to look at it as a
routine, and the breaking of a routine. On the other hand, we have
a chance to rest a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have to regroup and concentrate. That was a concern
on the UCLA game. That we didn't concentrate the way we were
supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   No practice: USC will take most of next week off, but probably
resume practice either Saturday or Sunday, Hackett said. The
Trojans are allowed to practice because they are a bowl-eligible
team.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said USC would not be able to use all its bowl
practices, no matter which bowl the Trojans play in, because of
finals.

TOMEY TAKES UA BACK TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He sat on some beat-up steps near the locker room after a
draining Arizona victory at Washington. He wore a T-shirt, jeans,
no socks and scuffed shoes. He looked like an overworked janitor on
a much-needed break.
</P>
<P>
   ``College football is about a lot guys named Joe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Joe in Dick Tomey who was talking after a game that
defined both him and his Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, straightforward and about as pretentious as a frayed
collar. That's Joe, Tomey's definition of an All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, perhaps, has been more successful on college football's
major level with the unknown, workaday kind of athlete than Tomey.
Notre Dame and Ohio State get the ``Parade'' All-Americans. Tomey
gets the kids who deliver the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   His reliance on the forgotten athlete has been the intriguing
story to this Arizona season, which will go down as the school's
best ever if the Wildcats beat Arizona State on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: Marcus Bell.
</P>
<P>
   On the All-Joe team, Bell is Mos Valuable Player. He wasn't
recruited by anybody as a high school player in remote St. Johns.
Late in the process, Northern Arizona was about to offer him a
remaining scholarship before the Wildcats decided to take a chance.
Today, Bell is the Pac-10's leading tackler.
</P>
<P>
   Bell represents an element of luck in a very lucky year. His
emergence is matched by freshman defensive lineman Keoni Fraser and
a host of other young players who were just other Joes six months
ago. But the luck has come in large part because of Tomey's renewed
faith in kids who either look average or just go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, however, Tomey said he had lost touch with that
fundamental philosophy. A year near the top of college football was
the reason.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Tomey's Wildcats were ``Sports Illustrate''d's No. 1
team in its preseason edition. They didn't finish there but did
score an impressive Fiesta Bowl victory over Miami in their only
New Year's Day appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The dizzy heights provided a perspective that proved to be a
delusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forgot who we were,'' Tomey said. ``After that Fiesta Bowl,
I made a mistake. We went after a lot of high-profile players. But
we're not a UCLA or a Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get into a fight for high-profile athletes with a
Notre Dame. We'll lose almost every time. We learned a lot over
that lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons came hard and fast in 1995 and 1996, when the
Wildcats were a combined 11-11. Season-ticket sales went in a steep
decline, and speculation about Tomey's future went into overdrive.
That's when Tomey started thinking like himself. Like Joe.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy still generates some grumbling. In many ways,
Arizona football is the flip side to the basketball program.
Arizona basketball sells itself these days with what seems to be an
inexhaustible source of young stars.
</P>
<P>
   A result is some inevitable comparisons between the two
programs. There was an undercurrent of grumbling by some prominent
alums after the 41-7 thumping of Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, running back Trung Canidate was
unstoppable. He rushed for 140 yards. Tomey used him sparingly
after that. Some complained that Tomey should have left him on the
field on a night when he could have racked up 300-plus yards. The
idea, they said, was to turn Canidate into a star who could sell
empty seats at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But a Joe doesn't often become a star. What he can become is
part of a larger process that is often called team building by
Tomey, who has been offered a five-year contract that is expected
to be approved in January. Much of it takes place away from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we approach kids differently than a lot of teams and
programs do,'' he said. ``We try to build camaraderie through a
variety of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Arizona's season-opening victory at Hawaii, the team
visited Pearl Harbor and the U.S.S. Arizona, which was sunk on Dec.
7, 1941. Afterward, the players discussed the historical and
sociological impact.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, Tomey had his wife, author Nanci Kincaid,
meet with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no coaches,'' said Tomey, whose wife is on a
national tour to promote her latest novel, ``Balls,'' a look at
Southern football through the wives and daughters of men who play
it and coach it. ``It was my wife and the players. She talked to
them about an athlete's relationships with women. The players'
reactions were incredible. We're going to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-field sessions are important, the players say, because
it gives them a chance to learn something about teammates that has
nothing to do with football. The friendships that develop often
have an impact on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have players looking out for each other,'' quarterback
Keith Smith said. ``This team is together for a lot of reasons, and
whole lot of them are for reasons you don't see on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Tomey emphasizes a lot of different things. But he's
upfront about it. When I was thinking about transferring, I went to
him and he put it to me straight. He told me I'd get every chance
possible to play quarterback. He also told me I'd probably share
time with OJ (Ortege Jenkins).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exactly that way. If he tells you something, you can
believe it. He won't ever do or say anything phony.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe wouldn't know how. &QL;

SNYDER FINDS LOSING A REAL `KILLER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's on the verge of only his second losing season since
arriving at Arizona State in 1992. He has heard his players booed.
Fans have questioned his game preparation.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Snyder's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe we're on the verge of going on a real great
run,'' the ASU coach said. ``Maybe it'll start this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   If Snyder feels hopeless about ASU's 5-5 season, he's not
letting on. Although he's frustrated by the team's struggles, he's
confident in the program's direction. A victory over Arizona Friday
would confirm his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not my first rodeo,'' he said. ``I've been through
some wars. This is certainly one of them. But what I do recognize
in my business is that if you keep battling, you'll go right out of
something and go on a run. That's where I think we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``But believe me, I hate losing. It's a killer.''
</P>
<P>
   His job is secure. His contract runs through 2002, and the
Arizona Board of Regents is expected to vote on another two-year
extension soon.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder acknowledges he and his staff have made mistakes. But he
fiercely defends his assistants and said the team's struggles have
not divided the group.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to analyze the season after it's complete, but here are
some potential topics of discussion:
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have done a sound job of luring quality talent,
but there's something to be said for recruiting the right
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Several times this season Snyder said he was unhappy with
practice. That suggests at least some of the problem was related to
work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   And the coach's recent statement that this season's recruiting
class could include eight to 10 junior college transfers (vs. the
usual four or five) means this team has more holes than usual to
fill. There's nothing wrong with recruiting JCs _ Derrick Rodgers,
Jeremy Staat come to mind _ but selectivity is key. A bad batch can
cast a negative light on a program.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils could come into next season with Ryan Kealy and
no other quarterback with game experience.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Chad Elliott has been in honest in saying he
will re-evaluate his future after the season. He acknowledges that
Kealy is a talented quarterback but also that he's hungry to play.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sun Devils can't sell Elliott on staying, will they
consider a junior-college quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries made this a less-productive unit, but did it go beyond
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there have been mistakes this season,'' Snyder said.
``When you have this many moving parts . . . What you hope is that
the ledger shows you've made more positive moves and they outweigh
the negative moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done some really good things. They just haven't
produced wins. Over the next six, eight months, whatever, there is
some real analyzing to do. The best thing to come out of this
season is how much we have learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder knows he raised some eyebrows earlier this season when he
called this year the best coaching job by he and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that came out the way I wanted it to, because it
certainly sounds incongruous between the record and what I said,''
he said. ``I guess what I meant is that the best coaching and
teaching does go on when you're struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been positives.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils clearly are a better team than they were earlier
in the season, suggesting the staff targeted problems early and
adjusted. They are playing smarter, and they seem to be playing
hungrier. Newcomers who struggled early _ defensive linemen Erik
Flowers and Junior Ioane, freshman safety Willie Daniel _ could be
impact players next season.
</P>
<P>
   And they showed the fruits of their recent recruiting labor:
linebacker Eric Fields and kicker Stephen Baker, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The staff has remained united. There has been no
finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have gone through this, every part of our team in some
ways has been really under stress,'' Snyder said. ``Whether it's
the secondary with (assistant coaches Ron) English and (Phil) Snow.
Whether it's been the offensive line and some of our production
there. John Pettas and the quarterback, or Dick Arbuckle with
(kickers) Stephen Baker and Mike Gauthier. We've all had our
challenges through the course of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really proud and pleased how mentally tough this
group of men is and how professional they've been when things have
been tough. I don't know if people understand, and I don't mean to
be `poor, poor pitiful me,' but how intense and how sensitive this
job is. There's a real pressure there. And you can't escape it.
It's not like, `I'm going to take the weekend off and get away from
my job,' or even go home at night. We hardly go home at night.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's in store for Snyder? His contract suggests he's here
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   With four years of NFL coaching experience, he's just one NFL
season away from being 100 percent vested in the league's
retirement program. While such security is a lure, he said it's not
enough alone to make him seek an NFL job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a benefit, but it wouldn't be the reason to make
that much of a major decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he'll continue the pick-and-shovel work with his chin
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached 18 years as a head coach,'' he said. ``Some of
those have been awfully good, but there are some in there that
aren't. You just keep going.'' &QL;

PETITION DRIVE ENDS IN STUDY FOR SECESSION FROM L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With one last, furious push for signatures,
activists finished a petition drive Wednesday that eventually could
lead to the San Fernando Valley's secession from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Its completion marks a milestone in a historic effort that began
six months ago and is expected to lead to an unprecedented study of
whether the creation of a Valley city is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been truly a major achievement for the Valley,'' said
Jeff Brain, president of Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment, the nonprofit group that launched the petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   Many obstacles remain, including who will pay to validate the
200,000 signatures Valley VOTE hoped to have by the midnight
Wednesday deadline. Also undecided is who will pay for the study,
estimated to cost at least $1million.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE needs 135,000 valid signatures on its petitions to
trigger a public secession study organized by the Local Agency
Formation Commission. Although the group won't announce its final
tally until Dec. 6, it had collected 198,000 names as of Sunday and
wanted more to ensure a comfortable margin of success.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed study finds that splitting the Valley from the
rest of Los Angeles would not financially damage either community,
LAFCO members will vote on whether to send the secession issue to
county supervisors, who would in turn place it before voters in a
citywide election.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters in the Valley and all of Los Angeles must
approve the measure for the Valley to become its own city.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders were cautiously optimistic Wednesday, hoping
they had reached their target. While praising their volunteers and
paid circulators for collecting so many names, they remained
anxious to see how many would prove valid when examined by county
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 65,000 more than required, but do we have enough?''
asked Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close. ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Valley VOTE scrambled for the last signatures, the
proposed secession study began taking shape. LAFCO members
Wednesday approved a broad outline of how the study would be
conducted, envisioning a process in which Valley VOTE and Los
Angeles officials would work on the study together with the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Close called the idea the best way to prevent litigation over
the potentially contentious study and ensure its success. A
spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan said his office would have to
study the idea before commenting on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had a chance to review the proposal,'' Deane
Leavenworth said.
</P>
<P>
   In its editorial pages, the Daily News has strongly endorsed
Valley VOTE's drive for a public study of secession that would
determine whether a breakup would be revenue-neutral to the
remaining part of the city and whether the new city would be
economically viable. The newspaper also has contributed $60,000 to
the petition-gathering effort.
</P>
<P>
   Key issues concerning the petition drive's fate remain
unresolved. The commission still has not decided how to pay for
checking a random 3percent sample of the signatures to ensure their
validity. While Valley VOTE argues it should not have to pay, the
commission has a history of charging similar fees on similar
petition drives.
</P>
<P>
   Several commission members said Wednesday that they empathized
with Valley VOTE's position, but needed someone to pay the fees,
which reimburse the commission for money it must pay county
elections officials who check the signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have a right to petition without it costing you any
money,'' said LAFCO Chairman Thomas E. Jackson. But ``It stills
boils down to the fact this commission has no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas floated by commission members include possibly waiving the
fee or seeking money from Los Angeles city and county officials.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will discuss the issue at its Dec. 9 meeting, the
same meeting at which Valley VOTE plans to turn in its signatures.
Brain said he did not know whether the group would then pay the
validation fees, estimated at between $8,000 and $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be here, possibly with a blank check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains to be seen whether the petition drive will be
verified after county officials examine a random sample. Should
Valley VOTE fail that initial test, checking every signature could
cost about $272,000. Under state law, Valley VOTE also would be
able to collect signatures for another 15 days if the drive fails.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's flurry of activity capped a campaign that could
eventually lead to the first secession of one California city from
another since Coronado broke from San Diego in 1890.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE's campaign was expensive _ costing the group more
than $235,000 _ and difficult. Initially, VOTE relied more on
volunteers than paid circulators to collect petitions. The idea was
to help project a grass-roots image, but leaders later acknowledged
that it slowed their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers were ejected from a popular public air show at the
Van Nuys Airport, possibly costing them 20,000 to 40,000
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Valley VOTE leaders originally thought they had
just 90 days to circulate petitions, based on their interpretation
of state law. One day before the Aug. 27 deadline, however, Gov.
Pete Wilson signed a law stating they had 180 days instead.
</P>
<P>
   Had they not received that reprieve, the group might not have
reached its goal. ``It was unlikely,'' Close said.
</P>
<P>
   The group miscalculated the deadline again, initially thinking
it had until midnight Friday to finish collecting signatures. The
error, Brain said, lay in counting an additional three months from
their last deadline instead of 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   With circulators at local supermarkets Wednesday night, hoping
to hit holiday shoppers, Brain said he was very proud of his
people. They already had collected signatures from more Valley
residents than voted for the recent charter reform initiative, he
said.

DAFOE, BRUINS BLANK FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ The Bruins had a meltdown against the Florida
Panthers a week ago _ blowing a 4-0 lead and having to settle for a
5-5 tie _ and when the teams met in a rematch Wednesday night,
Boston coach Pat Burns said, he wouldn't dwell on what happened
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said his club was putting that contest out of their minds
and moving on. However, it was obvious from the way the Bruins
played the third period that they had no intention of allowing the
Panthers back into this game.
</P>
<P>
   Boston scored the only goal it would need with 1:28 left in the
second period _ left wing Sergei Samsonov converting on the power
play _ and rode it to a 1-0 victory at the National Car Rental
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins extended their unbeaten streak to four games (3-0-1)
and are 5-1-3 in their last nine. Byron Dafoe recorded his fourth
shutout this season and 11th of his career as he stopped 23 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate to get that goal,'' said Burns. ``They still
played a solid game. We played a solid game, too. Nobody blew
anyone's doors off in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any show to put on here. We came in and we were
going to stick to the game plan. Again, we showed some patience and
that's how we're going to get wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple weeks ago, I asked for everybody to give us some time
for players who have missed training camp and guys who have been
hurt. I said, `Give us some time and it'll come.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first period was pretty tepid for both teams, with Florida
outshooting Boston, 7-5. In the second, Florida had the better
scoring chances but it was the Bruins who came up with the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have the NHL's top power play _ having converted 25
of 112 chances (22.3 percent) _ and cashed in their first and only
man advantage of the game, this one late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   With Robert Svehla off for tripping Jason Allison, Ray Bourque
dished a pass to Allison in the right circle. Allison relayed it
down to Samsonov, who was positioned along the goal line to goalie
Kirk McLean's left. Samsonov, switching to his backhand, flipped a
pass in front of the goal for Darren Van Impe charging in at the
left post, but the puck hit the stick of defenseman Terry Carkner
and went into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's assist pulled him within three of tying Gordie Howe at
1,049 for third place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers had a boatload of chances in the middle period,
some of the best by impressive rookie forward Mark Parrish, who had
a goal against Boston a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish had a shot on his backhand from deep in the left circle
at 5:41 right after a power play had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lindsay had an even better one at 6:17 from in tight but
Dafoe denied him, too. Svehla had a point-blank chance during a
power play with about five minutes left but came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, the Bruins clamped down on anything the
Panthers tried to do, preventing them from generating the kind of
chances they had in the second period and limiting them to six
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has talked about how offensive these games have been
between us,'' said Dafoe. ``When you look on paper, you expect a
defensive battle and finally we got one. As a goaltender, it was
much appreciated.''

RED SOX LOSERS, YANKEES KEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a crushing reversal of fortune that has depressingly
familiar precedents, the Red Sox learned Wednesday night that
instead of signing free agent center fielder Bernie Williams, they
were swept away by a last-minute bid from the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With a seven-year deal for a guaranteed $87.5 million, the
defending champion Yankees retained the American League batting
champion and Gold Glove outfielder while maintaining their record
of one-upping their archrivals in acquiring elite talent. There's
also an option for an eighth year, reportedly with a $4 million
buyout that makes the guaranteed value of the deal $91.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Williams's agreement with the Yankees came
within an hour of notification that Mo Vaughn had made his
departure from the Red Sox official, agreeing to a six-year, $80
million deal with the Anaheim Angels. The timing of Vaughn's
announcement only reinforced the image of the huge void in the
Boston lineup that general manager Dan Duquette had hoped Williams
would fill.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also hold a $14 million club option on a seventh year
for Vaughn, with a $2 million buyout. At an average of $13.3
million a year, Vaughn becomes baseball's highest-paid player.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had digested the fact that he was leaving Boston,
Vaughn said, ``I've had a whole year to do that. I'm pretty much a
realist. I didn't get blindsided by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the failure to land Williams _ Duquette had been
poised Wednesday night to receive a phone call from Williams's
agent, Scott Boras, accepting Boston's seven-year offer _ was the
general manager's assertion that the Red Sox were no longer
interested in free agent slugger Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had courted Belle immediately after breaking off talks
with Vaughn, but Belle slipped from being a prime target to a
contingency plan to off the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's going to work for us,'' Duquette said of
signing Belle, who under a provision in his White Sox contract has
until next Wednesday to sign with another club or return to Chicago
with a deal for $33 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette would not elaborate on why the Red Sox bowed out of the
Belle bidding. There were hints that the Sox had become concerned
about character issues involving the controversial slugger, who has
a history of antisocial behavior, but there were new economic
considerations, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Sun reported Wednesday night that the Orioles have
made a five-year, $65 million offer to Belle, and have offered a
five-year, $45 million deal to first baseman Rafael Palmeiro,
another player to whom the Sox talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still available,'' Duquette said of Palmeiro. ``We've
always liked him as a player. But it looks like it's up to five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Belle's brother, Terry, his agent, Arn Tellem,
and Red Sox CEO John Harrington were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go?'' a subdued Duquette said by phone, in the
wake of what may be a worse lineup upheaval than the one caused by
Roger Clemens's departure two winters ago. ``We'll have to take a
look. We'll probably take a look at pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that the Red Sox will be a late
entrant in the bidding for either Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson, the
top two pitching prizes on the market. The Sox had interest in
Johnson, but as Duquette said, ``Both pitchers have said they'd
like to play for a team in a different geographic location.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also have contacted Robin Ventura, a third baseman who
can play first, but they haven't spoken to his agent in more than a
week; Ventura is also being pursued by the Mets. The Sox reportedly
have shown interest in Gregg Jefferies, but neither Ventura nor
Jefferies can approach the power numbers (40 home runs, 115 RBI)
that Vaughn posted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only free agent the Sox have signed is second
baseman Jose Offerman, whose four-year, $26 million deal has
sparked considerable criticism in industry circles.
</P>
<P>
   There are several trade options the Sox could explore. They've
talked to the Expos about outfielder Rondell White, but according
to a source, they don't have the talent to make that deal work.
Gary Sheffield, the Dodgers' slugger whose career began in
Milwaukee when Duquette was with the Brewers, is probably
available, but he has had injury problems and his production has
fallen short of what a team would expect from a $10 million a year
player. The Sox also like Dodger right fielder Raul Mondesi, whom
they inquired about last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had consistently refused to offer Williams more than
a five-year deal, and owner George Steinbrenner publicly mocked
Boras's assertion that he had at least one seven-year offer in
hand. It wasn't until the Red Sox met for two days with Williams in
Atlanta, and put their seven-year deal on the table, that the
Yankees summoned Williams and Boras for a meeting Tuesday night in
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, according to sources, the Yankees were prepared at
midday Wednesday to sign Belle, to whom they had made a four-year,
$50 million offer.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Yankees did not hear from Belle, that gave Williams
one last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Boras closed the deal late Wednesday afternoon by phone from
Coors Field in Denver, where he'd gone to meet with the Rockies
about Brown, another client.
</P>
<P>
   The final package Williams accepted in many respects was similar
to the Red Sox offer and believed to be for a similar amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the Red Sox drove the price up,'' Yankees
GM Brian Cashman said in a conference call Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also spoke of the Red Sox' offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very aggressive,'' he said. ``They felt I was the
type of player they wanted to have on their team. They didn't beat
around the bush. They let me know with a serious offer right from
the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was asked if he felt used by either the agent or the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made good offers on a couple of fronts,'' he said. ``That's
just the way the market works.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Williams had come away enthusiastic about his meetings
with the Sox, Duquette replied, with a hint of sarcasm, ``We
impressed him? That's nice to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's deal guarantees him $91.5 million, or a half-million
more than the seven-year, $91 million deal Mike Piazza signed with
the Mets, the industry's previous benchmark.

FLIP WILSON, 64, OVER-THE-TOP COMIC AND TV HOST, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MEL WATKINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flip Wilson, the popular comedian who became the first black
entertainer to be the host of a successful weekly variety show on
network television, died on Wednesday night at his home in Malibu,
Calif. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   He died of liver cancer, the comedian's assistant, Angie Hill,
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was best known for his portrayals of such outrageous,
over-the-top characters as the Reverend Leroy of the Church of
What's Happening Now and Geraldine, the sassy but proud black woman
whose flamboyance, enthusiasm, and screeching, high-pitched voice
was recognized by millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Her trademark quips _ ``When you're hot, you're hot; when you're
not, you're not,'' ``The devil made me do it'' and ``What you see
is what you get'' _became national catch phrases, part of
everyone's vocabulary when Wilson's variety show in the 1970s
become one of America's best-watched programs.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his career, Wilson said of the irrepressible Geraldine,
``She carried me longer than my mother did.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine and the Reverend Leroy, along with Wilson's likable
personality, seemingly effortless delivery, and joyful depiction of
the language and mannerisms of black street life helped catapult
``The Flip Wilson Show'' to number one in the ratings among variety
shows shortly after it began on NBC in 1970. The next year, Wilson
won an Emmy for Outstanding Writing Achievement for a Variety Show
and, by 1972, his show was second in the overall ratings only to
Archie Bunker and ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   More storyteller than one-line standup comic, Wilson's winding
tales and uninhibited use of the timbre and resonance of black
dialect were often compared to the Yiddish inflections and stories
of the comedian Myron Cohen. Richard Pryor once told him, ``You're
the only performer that I've seen who goes on the stage and the
audience hopes that you like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many groundbreaking comedians of his period, most notably
Lenny Bruce, Dick Gregory and Mort Sahl, Wilson stayed far afield
of politics and social satire. ``Things can be funny only when we
are in fun,'' he insisted. ``When we're `dead earnest,' humor is
the only thing that is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   His whimsical fables usually depended on the incongruity of
having black characters view historic events from their distinct
perspective. In his version of the discovery of America, for
example, Christopher Columbus tells Queen Isabella, ``If I don't
discover America, there's not gonna be a Benjamin Franklin or a
`Star-Spangled Banner,' or a land of the free, or a home of the
brave _ and no Ray Charles.'' When the queen hears this, she
screames, ``Chris gone find Ray Charles! He goin' to America on
that boat. What you say!''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also delighted in telling shaggy dog stories that wound
through circuitous asides and ended with unexpected puns and
innocuous word play. In a routine, set near the Coliseum in ancient
Rome where the Christians fought the lions, he announced : ``Those
lions were undefeated _ the Christians had a great coach . . . but
the team was shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   And his story of a vaudeville comedy team called Well Enough and
Bad Enough concludes in a courtroom scene after one comic has been
assaulted by a hotel clerk. Given a particularly harsh sentence,
the hotel clerk asks the judge, ``How come you being so hard on
me?'' The judge replies, ``I'm trying to teach you to leave Well
Enough alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Clerow Wilson was born in Jersey City, N.J., on Dec. 8, 1933,
one of a family of 18 children. He was placed in foster care at the
age of 7, shortly after his mother abandoned the family. A series
of unhappy periods in foster homes followed; after running away
more than a dozen times, he was sent to reform school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My happiest memory of childhood was my first birthday in
reform school,'' he once told a reporter. ``This teacher took an
interest in me. In fact, he gave me the first birthday presents I
ever got _ a box of Cracker Jacks and a can of ABC shoe polish.''
At age 13, Wilson rejoined his father, who was a sporadically
employed carpenter. ``We were so poor, even the poorest looked down
on us,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he quit school and, lying about his age, joined the Air
Force. His knack for creating outlandish stories and acting them
out in various dialects led some members of his outfit to conclude
that he was ``flipping out.'' Soon, everyone was calling him Flip.
His commanding officer, a white, Southern major, persuaded him to
resume studying and to take typing courses, and he began writing
out some of his comedy material. By the time he was discharged in
1954, he had decided to attempt a professional career as a
comedian.
</P>
<P>
   He began at a hotel in San Francisco where he had taken a job as
a bellhop. He asked the manager to let him try out a comedy skit
between dance acts at the hotel's nightclub. After the first night,
he appeared regularly.
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight years, Wilson worked his way across the
country, appearing in black clubs and theaters where he honed his
skills and silenced insistent hecklers with lines such as, ``You
know, when we take over, we goin' to have to kill some of us too.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1960s, he had arrived in New York, where he
frequently appeared as a comic and master of ceremonies at the
Apollo Theater in Harlem. His big break came in 1965, when Johnny
Carson, the talk show host, asked Redd Foxx who was the funniest
comic around. ``Flip Wilson,'' Foxx replied, without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carson immediately booked Wilson on ``The Tonight Show,'' where
he scored a success and was invited back frequently. These
appearances led to bookings on ``Rowan and Martin's
Laugh-In''(everyone got to imitate the Wilson reading of ``Heah
come de judge!''), ``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' and the ``Mike
Douglas'' and ``Merv Griffin'' shows as well as nightclub
engagements at New York's Bitter End, Village Gate, Rainbow Grill,
and Latin Quarter, and San Francisco's hungry i. Wilson was given a
television special in 1968 and his own variety show in 1970. By
1972, his income had soared to more than a million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he rose to prominence at a time when the nation was
racked with racial tension, urban riots, and a call for black
power, he continued focusing on the lighter side of comedy. ``What
Flip Wilson has accomplished is almost incredible in a time of
Black Panthers and savage rhetoric,'' the critic John Leonard wrote
in Life magazine. ``He has taken the threat out of the fact of
blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   While other critics praised him for humor that ``was without a
shred of racial rancor,'' others criticized him for ``defusing his
blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny is not a color,'' Wilson responded. ``Being black is
only good from the time you get from the curtain to the
microphone.'' He insisted that ``my main point is to be funny. If I
can slip a message in there, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson appeared on four comedy albums, including ``Flip Wilson,
You Devil You,'' which won a Grammy award for Best Comedy Recording
in 1968. His film credits included ``Uptown Saturday Night'' (1974)
with Sidney Poitier, Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. In that film,
Vincent Canby, the critic of The New York Times, said his
performance as preacher delivering a rousing sermon ``almost stops
the film.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1974-75 season, Wilson abruptly left his weekly
variety show, while it was still among the top 10 shows on
television. During the next few years, he starred in several NBC
specials and appeared in films but severely curtailed his public
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accomplished what I set out to do,'' he said in an interview
in 1979 at his home in Malibu. ``I wanted the whole cookie and I
got it. Now I want to spend more time with my children _ make sure
they don't go through what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was married and divorced twice; he had four children in
his second marriage. He is survived by sons Kevin and David, and
daughters Stacey, Tamara and Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   He made headlines in 1981 when he was dropped from a Seven-Up
advertising campaign after he was arrested and charged with
possession of a small amount of cocaine. He returned to television
in 1984 as the host of a revival of the old Art Linkletter show,
``People Are Funny'' and, in 1985, he costarred with Gladys Knight
in a situation comedy for CBS called ``Charlie and Company.''
Neither show matched the success of his earlier program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the congeniality and openness he exuded on stage, Wilson
was protective of his privacy. ``What I have to say is on the
screen,'' he once said to a reporter. ``My life is my own. My show
is my statement. Mention my family and I'll walk away. Touch on my
personal life and I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1980s, he seldom performed except for occasional guest
spots on television situation comedies He lived quietly, out of the
public eye, at his Malibu home.
</P>
<P>
   Flip Wilson's enduring contribution may have been the
re-introduction of a distinctively black voice to mainstream
comedy, but his appeal was hardly racial. ``Mr. Wilson is not just
a black comedian, any more than Jack Benny is just a Jewish
comedian,'' a Time magazine critic wrote. ``His humor is unversal.
He has the talent to make blacks laugh without anger and whites
laugh without guilt.''

STRIKING TEACHERS REACH TENTATIVE DEAL IN JERSEY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Striking public-school teachers tentatively
agreed on Wednesday afternoon to end their increasingly bitter
five-day strike, which has brought chaos and disruption to the
32,000-student district.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, the 2,500 teachers in the
district would get a pay raise of 12.5 percent over three years,
said Thomas Favia, president of the Jersey City Education
Association, and the 1,000 teachers' aides and secretaries would
get about a 15 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary for Jersey City teachers is $58,254, compared
with a state average of about $52,000. The average is high partly
because many Jersey City teachers have been with the district more
than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, Favia said, the agreement would give
teachers more input in teacher evaluations, an issue that had
driven many teachers to the picket lines because they said they
were being judged without a right to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all it was a tremendous victory,'' Favia said. ``It was
a victory for teachers all over because it showed teachers were
concerned more about professionalism than about their paychecks,
contrary to what the district said.''
</P>
<P>
   The union rank and file are to vote on the proposed settlement
on Sunday, and the contract will also have to be approved by the
state commissioner of education, Leo Klagholz, because the district
has been under state control since 1989 because of poor
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from both sides said they were relieved that the
fight was finally over. Judge Martin Greenberg of Hudson County
Superior Court ordered a fine of $100,000 a day against the the
Jersey City Education Association after members of the union
refused his order to return to their classrooms. He said that any
teacher who did not return to work on Monday would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra, the business administrator for the district and
one of its negotiators, said, ``There are no winners in this, but
there are losers, and that's the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   District officials said they expected all schools to be open on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the strike, when almost all of the teachers
took to the picket lines, the district had only about 200
substitute teachers to take their places. With so few adults in
charge, students at many of the schools began hurling bottles and
bricks, turning over desks and computers, pulling fire alarms and
even assaulting each other.
</P>
<P>
   Classes at the city's five high schools were canceled after the
first day of the strike, and the elementary schools _ which have
prekindergarten through eighth grades _ met for only half days.
Attendance was around 30 percent.

PETITION DRIVE ENDS IN STUDY FOR SECESSION FROM L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS, resending with correctly spelled slug) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With one last, furious push for signatures,
activists finished a petition drive Wednesday that eventually could
lead to the San Fernando Valley's secession from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Its completion marks a milestone in a historic effort that began
six months ago and is expected to lead to an unprecedented study of
whether the creation of a Valley city is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been truly a major achievement for the Valley,'' said
Jeff Brain, president of Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment, the nonprofit group that launched the petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   Many obstacles remain, including who will pay to validate the
200,000 signatures Valley VOTE hoped to have by the midnight
Wednesday deadline. Also undecided is who will pay for the study,
estimated to cost at least $1million.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE needs 135,000 valid signatures on its petitions to
trigger a public secession study organized by the Local Agency
Formation Commission. Although the group won't announce its final
tally until Dec. 6, it had collected 198,000 names as of Sunday and
wanted more to ensure a comfortable margin of success.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed study finds that splitting the Valley from the
rest of Los Angeles would not financially damage either community,
LAFCO members will vote on whether to send the secession issue to
county supervisors, who would in turn place it before voters in a
citywide election.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters in the Valley and all of Los Angeles must
approve the measure for the Valley to become its own city.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders were cautiously optimistic Wednesday, hoping
they had reached their target. While praising their volunteers and
paid circulators for collecting so many names, they remained
anxious to see how many would prove valid when examined by county
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 65,000 more than required, but do we have enough?''
asked Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close. ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Valley VOTE scrambled for the last signatures, the
proposed secession study began taking shape. LAFCO members
Wednesday approved a broad outline of how the study would be
conducted, envisioning a process in which Valley VOTE and Los
Angeles officials would work on the study together with the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Close called the idea the best way to prevent litigation over
the potentially contentious study and ensure its success. A
spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan said his office would have to
study the idea before commenting on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had a chance to review the proposal,'' Deane
Leavenworth said.
</P>
<P>
   In its editorial pages, the Daily News has strongly endorsed
Valley VOTE's drive for a public study of secession that would
determine whether a breakup would be revenue-neutral to the
remaining part of the city and whether the new city would be
economically viable. The newspaper also has contributed $60,000 to
the petition-gathering effort.
</P>
<P>
   Key issues concerning the petition drive's fate remain
unresolved. The commission still has not decided how to pay for
checking a random 3percent sample of the signatures to ensure their
validity. While Valley VOTE argues it should not have to pay, the
commission has a history of charging similar fees on similar
petition drives.
</P>
<P>
   Several commission members said Wednesday that they empathized
with Valley VOTE's position, but needed someone to pay the fees,
which reimburse the commission for money it must pay county
elections officials who check the signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have a right to petition without it costing you any
money,'' said LAFCO Chairman Thomas E. Jackson. But ``It stills
boils down to the fact this commission has no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas floated by commission members include possibly waiving the
fee or seeking money from Los Angeles city and county officials.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will discuss the issue at its Dec. 9 meeting, the
same meeting at which Valley VOTE plans to turn in its signatures.
Brain said he did not know whether the group would then pay the
validation fees, estimated at between $8,000 and $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be here, possibly with a blank check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains to be seen whether the petition drive will be
verified after county officials examine a random sample. Should
Valley VOTE fail that initial test, checking every signature could
cost about $272,000. Under state law, Valley VOTE also would be
able to collect signatures for another 15 days if the drive fails.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's flurry of activity capped a campaign that could
eventually lead to the first secession of one California city from
another since Coronado broke from San Diego in 1890.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE's campaign was expensive _ costing the group more
than $235,000 _ and difficult. Initially, VOTE relied more on
volunteers than paid circulators to collect petitions. The idea was
to help project a grass-roots image, but leaders later acknowledged
that it slowed their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers were ejected from a popular public air show at the
Van Nuys Airport, possibly costing them 20,000 to 40,000
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Valley VOTE leaders originally thought they had
just 90 days to circulate petitions, based on their interpretation
of state law. One day before the Aug. 27 deadline, however, Gov.
Pete Wilson signed a law stating they had 180 days instead.
</P>
<P>
   Had they not received that reprieve, the group might not have
reached its goal. ``It was unlikely,'' Close said.
</P>
<P>
   The group miscalculated the deadline again, initially thinking
it had until midnight Friday to finish collecting signatures. The
error, Brain said, lay in counting an additional three months from
their last deadline instead of 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   With circulators at local supermarkets Wednesday night, hoping
to hit holiday shoppers, Brain said he was very proud of his
people. They already had collected signatures from more Valley
residents than voted for the recent charter reform initiative, he
said.

ANGELS GIVE VAUGHN $80 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Anaheim just became Mo-town.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels on Wednesday finalized a six-year, $80 million deal
for free-agent first baseman Mo Vaughn, making him the highest-paid
player in baseball based on average annual salary ($13.3 million).
The Angels hold a club option for a seventh season in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement ended three weeks of negotiations between the
Angels and Vaughn's representatives. There were no other serious
offers made to Vaughn other than the five-year, $60 million offer
from his previous team, the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made their intentions clear from the beginning,
calling Vaughn's agent, Tom Reich, at 9 a.m. on Nov. 5, the first
day teams could begin negotiating with free agents. It is by far
the most lucrative contract in Angels history, surpassing the
four-year, $22.5 million deal awarded to Tim Salmon before the 1997
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was obviously a huge day for our organization,'' Angels
general manager Bill Bavasi said. ``It's a very, very exciting day.
One we'll always remember.''
</P>
<P>
   It's memorable because the Angels just added one of baseball's
most productive hitters to their lineup and one of the biggest
prizes in this year's free-agent crop. Memorable because they also
added a strong clubhouse presence many felt was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was likewise impressed with the Angels from the beginning
of the negotiations. In fact, one of Vaughn's representatives, Adam
Katz, said that Vaughn ordered his agents not to listen to any
other offers once the Angels made theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could read the letter (Bavasi) had written to me as
well as their offer, you could tell what kind of people he's
working for,'' Vaughn said during a conference call. ``They were
going out and looking for people with attitude. You need an
attitude, you need some linebackers playing baseball. He's
instilled that attitude. Disney decided to spend some money and get
some attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn didn't specify what was in the letter, only to say that
Bavasi made him feel wanted, unlike the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't know what people feel about you as a player,
especially an opposing player,'' Vaughn said. ``But obviously they
studied my actions and my attitude as a player. I appreciate that.
After being (in Boston) for eight years, you get the feeling they
(Red Sox) didn't see the same things (the Angels) had seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, it was not a competition (among teams),''
Katz said of the negotiations. ``From the beginning the Angels were
identified by Mo as his first choice and the Angels identified Mo
as their first choice. We just worked very, very hard and figured
it out. Mo dictated the pace. He didn't want to engage multiple
teams and multiple offers. The Angels were his first choice and we
attacked that.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, it might seem the Angels have made a change in
philosophy by spending big money. Not so, Bavasi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a change in action, I don't think there's a change in
philosophy,'' he said. ``We've been very careful. We haven't seen a
player like him. He was the guy for us. It was very important for
us. If there was a guy like Mo Vaughn available last year or the
year before, we'd have tried to sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, 30, hit .337 with 40 homers and 115 RBI last season for
the Red Sox and has 230 homers and a .304 average in his eight-year
career. But as big as Vaughn's numbers can be, he presence in the
dugout and clubhouse were equally important to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (Angels first base coach) George Hendrick
after the season and he was saying we need a guy that's willing to
say, `Get on my back, I'll take you. Let's go,''' Bavasi said. ``We
made it a point we didn't just want a first baseman that could hit.
We wanted his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys just strike you as `This is the guy who's going to
do it for you.' I've always admired the guy, the way he's one about
his business every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The signing of Mo Vaughn is an extraordinary event for our
ballclub,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Mo is one of those
rare individuals whose presence will have a profound effect on the
players, the organization and this community. Our ownership has
established its desire to take this team to the next level. And Mo
is the type of individual who relishes that challenge.''

   Vaughn put a lot into his years in Boston, becoming active in
charities and community programs. He also said he plans to keep a
house there and live there during the offseason. But making the
adjustment to living on the West Coast, he said, is something he
has been preparing for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a whole year to really think about it,'' he said. ``I
kind of knew this was coming for a long time. It's not like I was
hit and blindsided.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Vaughn is an Angel, Darin Erstad will move from first
base to the outfield, giving the Angels four outfielders. Bavasi,
however, said it wouldn't be fair to assume the Angels will trade
one of them. Jim Edmonds' name has come up the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us flexibility because we can rotate the
outfielders through the DH every night,'' Bavasi said. ``And we
also have flexibility to deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are one of the finalists for pitcher Randy Johnson,
and Bavasi said other teams would be wise to know the Angels will
not drop out of the bidding because they have signed Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn himself said he will do whatever he can to bring Johnson
to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call him,'' Vaughn said. ``We're pretty good friends.
I'll do whatever I can to get him signed.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Loretta Moisan and Lori Killam won't spend a lot
of time thinking about turkey dinner and pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mother and daughter are making sure the laces on
their running shoes are fresh and unfrayed, the zippers on their
fanny packs are unobstructed, and the wheels on the baby stroller
are greased and rolling.
</P>
<P>
   They're prepping for Friday, the official start of the holiday
shopping season, when they will join thousands upon thousands of
early-bird shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   It's an annual ritual for the women that begins the week before
Thanksgiving, when they map out with almost military precision the
exact route they will navigate come Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Their clothes _ what they call their shopping uniforms _ have to
allow for freedom of movement. The stroller has to have just the
right accouterments to better accommodate their load of gifts. And
their itinerary has been so carefully worked out that they can tell
now exactly where they will be at any given time of the day.
</P>
<P>
   They're not alone. True, millions of people have turned the day
after Thanksgiving into one of the most popular shopping days of
the year, but a unique subgroup of those shoppers _ Killam and
Moisan included _ wake up at the crack of dawn to take advantage of
special giveaways and reduced prices offered only to early risers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the nation's retailers share the excitement of these
shoppers. Some stores are opening their doors as early as 6 a.m.
Most national retailers are offering discounts and special ``door
buster'' incentives for the first few hundred arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   A few retailers are opening even earlier ... today. Both Kmart
Corp. and the City of Commerce-based 99 Cents Only Stores will open
their stores across the region for a full day of shopping today for
those who can't wait for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But for this year, at least, Killam and Moisan are concentrating
on Friday, not today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have a good time shopping and we like deals,'' said
Killam, 33, an executive assistant. ``It's just kind of fun being
out with all the crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband laughs at us because we do this every year,'' adds
Moisan, 55, who works at Kaiser Permanente in Woodland Hills,
booking appointments for doctors. ``We've done this since the kid
could walk.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, she exaggerates. Moisan actually introduced her daughter to
hard-core day-after-Thanksgiving shopping when Killam was hitting
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd introduce her to the real way to shop,'' Moisan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they do it.
</P>
<P>
   They spend about a week scouring the newspaper ads for coupons
and holiday sales, making notes of the places that promise the best
deals.
</P>
<P>
   They bring a baby stroller that includes a mesh bag in the back
and a shelf underneath _ a crucial tool that ensures ample room to
stuff a maximum number of bags and packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comes from years of observation and seeing how other
women shop,'' Moisan said. ``It works. It's better than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter meet at 7 a.m. at a neighborhood Starbucks
for a quick fix of caffeine and one last check of their list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have coffee _ we don't want to eat _ we don't want to
get tired,'' Moisan said. ``We just want to have our caffeine.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they're off and running, usually Topanga Plaza first, then
The Promenade followed by the Target store on Ventura Boulevard and
De Soto Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have an itinerary, we just go with the flow,''
Killam said.
</P>
<P>
   They take a break about 11 a.m. for a quick lunch, then it's
back to the store aisles, which they continue to haunt until about
4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they're through, they've completed up to 60percent
of their holiday shopping.

MOSCONE'S STYLE REFLECTED SAN FRANCISCO'S CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS 
</HEADLINE>
 RESENT FOR JUMP   By SUSAN SWARD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    George Moscone is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma,
Calif., beneath a marker that bears his name, dates of birth and
death and a simple inscription: ``We love you, Dad.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no monument distinguishing the grave from the scores
around it, no sign it is the resting place of a mayor who presided
over San Francisco in a time of great tumult. That upheaval
culminated in the City Hall assassinations of Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk at the hands of former Supervisor Dan White
on Nov. 27, 1978 _ 20 years ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the day a 70-car, police-escorted funeral cortege took
Moscone to his grave, the city he loved has changed dramatically.
How much of that change flows from the bullets White fired is a
debate that rages even now.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the 49-year-old mayor was cut down after he had already
left a mark on the city that could never be erased _ opening
government jobs to diverse groups, linking highrise construction to
developer concessions and promoting big sewer and convention center
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first truly progressive mayor of San Francisco,''
said San Francisco State University political scientist Rich
DeLeon, author of a study of San Francisco politics titled ``Left
Coast City.'' ``To get elected, he didn't go downtown _ he
demonstrated there was this new grassroots coalition of previously
excluded groups.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, Moscone fizzled as mayor _ failing to exhibit the
showman skills of his predecessor, Joe Alioto, and demonstrating
little of the administrative abilities and zeal of his successor,
Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really loved George Moscone, and I thought he would make
significant changes for all of us and especially for those on the
margins of society,'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide
Memorial United Methodist Church. ``But somehow as you looked at
his genuine concern for people, at times he fell short of making it
fully come together for himself and the city.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The San Francisco that existed when Moscone was mayor is far
removed from the city of today.
</P>
<P>
   While the city's population of 735,000 is only about 60,000 more
than it was 20 years ago, the number of whites has dropped sharply.
At the end of the 1970s, whites made up 53 percent of city
residents, compared with 40 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of highrise, concrete and glass, the city is very
different: About one-third of the city's skyscrapers were approved
for construction during Feinstein's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   And in the political milieu, the combat is far less explosive
than it was when Moscone served as the city's 37th mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, acts of political violence were not uncommon.
One group alone, the New World Liberation Front, had been linked to
more than 70 bombings, mostly in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Many whites dwelling in conservative neighborhoods, such as
White's Excelsior District, felt increasingly hemmed in. Gays were
flocking to the city, and immigration was bringing thousands of
Latinos and Asians into areas formerly populated by Irish,
Italians, Germans and Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscone came into a culture particularly hostile to the
massive demographic flows changing the city,'' DeLeon said. ``You
have to measure his accomplishments against the opposition arrayed
against him _ the resistance from the longtime old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco in that time, paranoia and recrimination were
prevalent, said historian Kevin Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happening at that time was bruising,'' said Starr.
``Up to the point of the Moscone-Milk assassination, this city had
a fierce ideological edge to it, and opponents fiercely demonized
each other. West of Twin Peaks demonized the gays. The gays
demonized West of Twin Peaks. The old sons and daughters were
demonizing the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had one group that had dominated the city since the 19th
century that was being displaced, and the group that was being
displaced still had great force.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  In the December 1975 mayor's race, Moscone defeated Supervisor
John Barbagelata, an acerbic West of Twin Peaks real estate agent,
by a mere 4,270 votes. That thin victory deeply affected Moscone, a
San Francisco-born former St. Ignatius High School basketball star,
according to his friend John Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't win by a mandate when he should have won
decisively,'' said Burton, now the state Senate's leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were old San Franciscans being vituperative toward him
because of his position on issues like gays and race _ guys he went
to high school with,'' Burton said. ``These people saw the world
changing and didn't understand it. What you don't understand, you
don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking office in January, Moscone immediately faced a
multimillion-dollar deficit and an unfriendly Board of Supervisors.
City craft workers struck for 38 days _ prompting critics to accuse
the new mayor of not doing enough to resolve the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Moscone had been accustomed to the clublike atmosphere of the
Legislature, where for a decade he skillfully maneuvered as a state
senator to win passage of many landmark measures. In San Francisco,
he found the combat fierce and few deals being worked out over
steak and martini dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made many, many mistakes by not acting boldly,'' Moscone
said after a year in office, ``because that is what I felt the
people wanted after Alioto _ a cautious, low-profile mayor. Now I
know they want the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his tenure, Moscone pushed through a ballot measure to
build the Yerba Buena Center, renamed for him after his death. He
played a huge part in keeping the Giants from moving to Toronto.
And he secured a rebuilt sewer system with a $240 million bond
measure after the state had slapped a building freeze on the city.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all Moscone legacies _ as is the fact that City Hall
is no longer so exclusively the province of white men. He was the
first to appoint minorities, women and gays to city posts in large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the legacy of inclusiveness, which I believe was the
hallmark of George's approach to politics, remains and will never
change,'' said Rudy Nothenberg, who served as a deputy mayor under
both Moscone and Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a political reality only a fool would ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   But the battles, and some of his own missteps, had weakened
Moscone's already thin support. Even many of his allies did not
consider his re-election a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   His probable opponent in the 1979 mayor's race, Quentin Kopp,
said: ``I just felt I could have beaten him, and I would have.
George had a number of problems from a managerial standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The assassinations' most obvious political fallout is
well-known: Dianne Feinstein, a centrist supervisor who had planned
to get out of politics, had her flagging career reborn when
Moscone's death swept her into the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the theory that Moscone's slaying brought a sea
change in San Francisco have always argued that White achieved his
goal _ to squash liberal rule in the city. Feinstein herself said,
``I do think I brought the city to the center. I put an emphasis on
running the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In her nine years as mayor, Feinstein presided over an
unprecedented building boom downtown, something some of Moscone's
admirers think he would have tempered. Under Feinstein, the amount
of approved office construction amounted to more than 22 million
square feet _ equal to almost 13 Bank of America buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many who worked with Feinstein argue that the city does not look
much different from what it it would have looked like had Moscone
lived _ because no mayor would have been able to say no to the
development money flooding into San Francisco and other cities back
then.
</P>
<P>
   Under Feinstein, they say, San Francisco became the first city
in the nation to impose several fees on developers, including ones
that raised millions of dollars for transit, open space, public
art, housing and child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would any mayor _ left, right or center _ have been able to
reshape that boom?'' asked Dean Macris, Feinstein's planning
director. ``I doubt it. In that time, more jobs were being created
outside metropolitan centers, and to compete for those jobs, cities
had to create commercial office space.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadley Roff, Feinstein's deputy mayor, said the city's financial
plight was a crucial factor in that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot ignore the revenue gap that began with Proposition
13 and the huge cutback in federal dollars beginning with Reagan's
election in 1980,'' he said. ``So there was a need to try to create
jobs and build city revenue to fill the gap _ building was looked
at as a way to increase jobs and revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Two leaders of the city's growth-control movement, Calvin Welch
and Sue Hestor, argue that more highrises were built bigger and
bulkier under Feinstein than would have been in a Moscone regime.
They say the city failed to collect huge mitigation sums from the
developers during the height of the building boom because Feinstein
was so pro-development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question Feinstein shifted the development of this
city from one that under Moscone started to seek some mitigation
agreements with developers as a cost of doing business in San
Francisco to one under her where the Department of Planning's job
was to approve projects with as little difficulty as possible for
the developer,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Hestor said that even if Moscone had allowed all the highrises
Feinstein permitted, ``there would have been different assumptions
on what kind of conditions should have been imposed on the
projects. Part of George would have backslid into dealing with the
money people, but you could have tugged him back some because of
where his soul was.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Moscone's life showed he cared a great deal about
low-income people,'' Hestor said. ``He would have understood it was
right to require new developments to provide for child care and
affordable, not market-rate, housing. We wouldn't have had to fight
for five years'' to win those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  DeLeon said that if he were to inscribe on some tablet what he
believes the mayor left behind, he would write: `` `George Moscone
included the excluded.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So many avoid conflict and nothing happens, but he was brave
enough to get into it. He decided to swim upstream. He chose to
make history.
</P>
<P>
   ``His role in local history at that moment was to play the role
of political leader. At great odds, he made a valiant stab at it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Nothenberg _ who spent many years working for both
Moscone and Feinstein _ is weary of attempts to place Moscone in
some large historical scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that aggravates me is that everyone sees George as a
metaphor,'' Nothenberg said. ``He was a vibrant, wonderful,
humorous, warm being who loved life and loved this city. First and
foremost, this was a personal tragedy _ he was cut down leaving a
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there is a human tragedy at the heart of this is
somehow obscured by everyone trying to make this a metaphor for
what may or may not have happened to the city.''

MOSCONE'S STYLE REFLECTED SAN FRANCISCO'S CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    George Moscone is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma,
Calif., beneath a marker that bears his name, dates of birth and
death and a simple inscription: ``We love you, Dad.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no monument distinguishing the grave from the scores
around it, no sign it is the resting place of a mayor who presided
over San Francisco in a time of great tumult. That upheaval
culminated in the City Hall assassinations of Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk at the hands of former Supervisor Dan White
on Nov. 27, 1978 _ 20 years ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the day a 70-car, police-escorted funeral cortege took
Moscone to his grave, the city he loved has changed dramatically.
How much of that change flows from the bullets White fired is a
debate that rages even now.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the 49-year-old mayor was cut down after he had already
left a mark on the city that could never be erased _ opening
government jobs to diverse groups, linking highrise construction to
developer concessions and promoting big sewer and convention center
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first truly progressive mayor of San Francisco,''
said San Francisco State University political scientist Rich
DeLeon, author of a study of San Francisco politics titled ``Left
Coast City.'' ``To get elected, he didn't go downtown _ he
demonstrated there was this new grassroots coalition of previously
excluded groups.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, Moscone fizzled as mayor _ failing to exhibit the
showman skills of his predecessor, Joe Alioto, and demonstrating
little of the administrative abilities and zeal of his successor,
Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really loved George Moscone, and I thought he would make
significant changes for all of us and especially for those on the
margins of society,'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide
Memorial United Methodist Church. ``But somehow as you looked at
his genuine concern for people, at times he fell short of making it
fully come together for himself and the city.''

said after a year in office, ``because that is what I felt the
people wanted after Alioto _ a cautious, low-profile mayor. Now I
know they want the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his tenure, Moscone pushed through a ballot measure to
build the Yerba Buena Center, renamed for him after his death. He
played a huge part in keeping the Giants from moving to Toronto.
And he secured a rebuilt sewer system with a $240 million bond
measure after the state had slapped a building freeze on the city.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all Moscone legacies _ as is the fact that City Hall
is no longer so exclusively the province of white men. He was the
first to appoint minorities, women and gays to city posts in large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the legacy of inclusiveness, which I believe was the
hallmark of George's approach to politics, remains and will never
change,'' said Rudy Nothenberg, who served as a deputy mayor under
both Moscone and Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a political reality only a fool would ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   But the battles, and some of his own missteps, had weakened
Moscone's already thin support. Even many of his allies did not
consider his re-election a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   His probable opponent in the 1979 mayor's race, Quentin Kopp,
said: ``I just felt I could have beaten him, and I would have.
George had a number of problems from a managerial standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The assassinations' most obvious political fallout is
well-known: Dianne Feinstein, a centrist supervisor who had planned
to get out of politics, had her flagging career reborn when
Moscone's death swept her into the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the theory that Moscone's slaying brought a sea
change in San Francisco have always argued that White achieved his
goal _ to squash liberal rule in the city. Feinstein herself said,
``I do think I brought the city to the center. I put an emphasis on
running the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In her nine years as mayor, Feinstein presided over an
unprecedented building boom downtown, something some of Moscone's
admirers think he would have tempered. Under Feinstein, the amount
of approved office construction amounted to more than 22 million
square feet _ equal to almost 13 Bank of America buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many who worked with Feinstein argue that the city does not look
much different from what it it would have looked like had Moscone
lived _ because no mayor would have been able to say no to the
development money flooding into San Francisco and other cities back
then.
</P>
<P>
   Under Feinstein, they say, San Francisco became the first city
in the nation to impose several fees on developers, including ones
that raised millions of dollars for transit, open space, public
art, housing and child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would any mayor _ left, right or center _ have been able to
reshape that boom?'' asked Dean Macris, Feinstein's planning
director. ``I doubt it. In that time, more jobs were being created
outside metropolitan centers, and to compete for those jobs, cities
had to create commercial office space.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadley Roff, Feinstein's deputy mayor, said the city's financial
plight was a crucial factor in that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot ignore the revenue gap that began with Proposition
13 and the huge cutback in federal dollars beginning with Reagan's
election in 1980,'' he said. ``So there was a need to try to create
jobs and build city revenue to fill the gap _ building was looked
at as a way to increase jobs and revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Two leaders of the city's growth-control movement, Calvin Welch
and Sue Hestor, argue that more highrises were built bigger and
bulkier under Feinstein than would have been in a Moscone regime.
They say the city failed to collect huge mitigation sums from the
developers during the height of the building boom because Feinstein
was so pro-development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question Feinstein shifted the development of this
city from one that under Moscone started to seek some mitigation
agreements with developers as a cost of doing business in San
Francisco to one under her where the Department of Planning's job
was to approve projects with as little difficulty as possible for
the developer,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Hestor said that even if Moscone had allowed all the highrises
Feinstein permitted, ``there would have been different assumptions
on what kind of conditions should have been imposed on the
projects. Part of George would have backslid into dealing with the
money people, but you could have tugged him back some because of
where his soul was.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Moscone's life showed he cared a great deal about
low-income people,'' Hestor said. ``He would have understood it was
right to require new developments to provide for child care and
affordable, not market-rate, housing. We wouldn't have had to fight
for five years'' to win those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  DeLeon said that if he were to inscribe on some tablet what he
believes the mayor left behind, he would write: `` `George Moscone
included the excluded.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So many avoid conflict and nothing happens, but he was brave
enough to get into it. He decided to swim upstream. He chose to
make history.
</P>
<P>
   ``His role in local history at that moment was to play the role
of political leader. At great odds, he made a valiant stab at it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Nothenberg _ who spent many years working for both
Moscone and Feinstein _ is weary of attempts to place Moscone in
some large historical scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that aggravates me is that everyone sees George as a
metaphor,'' Nothenberg said. ``He was a vibrant, wonderful,
humorous, warm being who loved life and loved this city. First and
foremost, this was a personal tragedy _ he was cut down leaving a
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there is a human tragedy at the heart of this is
somehow obscured by everyone trying to make this a metaphor for
what may or may not have happened to the city.''

   3. WOODY ALLEN SKEWERS POP CULTURE WITH 'CELEBRITY' by Joshua
Mooney from BPI Entertainment News Wire. ``Celebrity'', Woody
Allen's 27th film, is a stinging satire about popular culture and
America's obsession with fame. It's a bold film that doesn't pull
any punches, but Allen acknowledges that even ``Celebrity'' is
overshadowed by today's headlines.

   4. LONE WOLF By Alex Witchell - The New York Times Magazine
George Wolfe has had a highly successful tenure as producer of New
York's Public Theater, turning its finances around, and has won
acclaim as the director of plays such as ``Angels in America'',
``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' and ``Jelly's Last Jam''.
Now, however, since a brush with death, he has what the writer
terms a ``questionable obsession'' with bringing to Broadway ``On
the Town'', a show that flopped in a previous 1971 revival and
received tepid reviews in a Central Park production he produced
last summer. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Robert Sirico - New York Times Op-Ed Robert Sirico, a Catholic
priest, decries the ``60 Minutes'' segment that showed Kervorkian's

   6. WHAT'S DOING IN MUNICH By John Tagliabue - The New York Times
Travel Come to Germany in December, and you'd think this was the
place that invented Christmas. And in some ways, you'd be right.
German cities vie for the loveliest Christmas Market, and certainly
Munich is a leading contender.

   7. EU is Stalling Meanly on Eastern Candidates by Flora Lewis It
is fully accepted that the six countries which have now begun to
negociate accession to the EU will certainly be invited to join,
eventually. Further, the others eager to follow will be accepted
sooner or later. ``There is no question whether, only when and
how,'' said a senior Spanish official, echoing the Brussels
establishment.

   SODOMY-PRECEDENT _ ATLANTA _ When Paolo Pavesich picked up a
Sunday edition of the Atlanta Constitution in November 1903, he
couldn't believe his eyes. There he sat, photographed in natty
attire, in a display advertisement, next to another photograph of a
man looking gaunt and unhappy. A caption said Pavesich was reaping
the benefits of buying New England Mutual Life Insurance policies.
The person in the other photo was described as ``the man who
didn't.'' Because Pavesich, an Atlanta artist, had never purchased
insurance from New England Life and never given the company
permission to use his photo, he filed suit for invasion of privacy.
His case would provide an opportunity for the Georgia Supreme Court
to become the first court of its kind to recognize an enforceable
right to privacy _ 60 years before the U.S. Supreme Court arrived
at the same conclusion. On Monday, when a 6-1 majority of the
Georgia Supreme Court overturned the state's anti-sodomy law,
privacy was its primary focus, not heterosexual or homosexual
behavior. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Adoption across borders gives couple a reason for thanks
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It is a Thanksgiving celebration that Nancy and
Gregg Clark say probably will never be matched in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The day is being filled with family, friends, fellowship, food.
</P>
<P>
   But the best part is it will be shared with the laughter and the
love of their 10 month-old daughter, Shannon Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Mother, father and daughter were scooting around, playing on the
floor in the living room of their bi-level home in Springboro one
night this past week, when the father looked up and said, ``I
simply don't know how we survived without Shannon for the last 10
years. This is nothing less than a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The miracle baby who has blessed their lives was adopted from an
orphanage in a city called Perm in Russia in late August. It
happened after years of frustration for the new parents, who are
both 37 and have wanted to start a family for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   When they found out they were unable to conceive, the Clarks,
who have been married 10 years, turned to doctors and fertility
experts. ``We finally were told that if we wanted to do this
fertility project, it would probably cost as much as $15,000 and
there was only a 32 percent chance it would work,'' the father
said. ``We decided to check out adoption possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   After looking into all the alternatives, the Clarks chose an
international adoption agency in October 1997 and began on a path
filled with red tape and bureaucratic hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just stacks of forms to be filled out,'' the mother
said. ``I have never seen so much paper work. There were home
checks, and background investigations, and we had to take classes
for infant CPR, and there were FBI checks. We cooperated, and
worked at it, and finally approval came last February.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the video clips provided by the Russian orphanage began to
arrive. The first baby on the video just didn't seem to be the one,
they said. They also passed on the second video. The baby had some
medical problems and the chemistry was just not there.
</P>
<P>
   Then the third one came. It was 90 seconds long. The images of
the little baby girl stole their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Clark wrote into a journal that night: ``Dear Baby. We saw
your video. You look so alert and anxious to see what is going on
about you. You hold your head up very strong and you arched your
back. Your hair is reddish brown. When they stood you up, you
almost smiled when you started to bounce. We were smiling all the
way through the video. You look so beautiful. I know in my heart
that we want you. But my head tells me we have to be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   They had doctors check the video, and based on a good report
from them and the information provided by the orphanage and the
adoption agency, the Clarks signed the agreement of intent in July.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, the two were summoned to Russia. Gregg is manager
of Romano's Macaroni Grill, 1020 Miamisburg-Centerville Road in
Washington Twp. and was given a leave of absence and the blessings
of his employers. Nancy took time off from her position as a
placement supervisor for Olsten Staffing Services, 175 E.
Alexandersville-Bellbrook Road.
</P>
<P>
   They pulled things together, left for Moscow and then flew to
Perm, where they met the driver, the interpreter and the adoption
agent assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first saw our baby at the orphanage, it was like she
came right to us,'' the father said. ``If she could talk she would
have said, `Where have you been? I've been waiting for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The process moved into the court system, where there were a lot
of questions. ``It was intimidating and somewhat frightening,'' the
mother said. ``But the people helping us were very kind. And we
pressed ahead because after we met our little girl. We knew that
this was meant to be. ``
</P>
<P>
   In the Russian hotel that night, Nancy Clark wrote in the diary:
``My darling little girl, we have a lot of people back home praying
for us right now. Hopefully our prayers will be answered. And we
will be bringing you home.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as they sat outside the courtroom, waiting for the
judge to rule, the anxious would-be parents picked a name for the
daughter they wanted to bring home. They chose Shannon Marie. It
just seemed right, they said.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited, Clark wrote in the journal she plans to share
with her daughter one day: ``During this entire process, I think I
have gone through every emotion known to man. Even though we have
faced the most difficult times, I never thought of giving up. I
love you, sweet Shannon. We are almost there. Love, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the words later added at the bottom of the page announced
in big letters, ``The judge ruled yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only time I really cried during this whole
process,'' the mother said. ``When we got the good word, and then
when we picked up Shannon and brought her to our hotel room, I
cried like I have never cried before.''
</P>
<P>
   The adoptive process was long and involved, and ultimately cost
about $25,000. ``When you see what we have, you see it was worth
it,'' the mother said. ``Our sweet sweet Shannon. She lights up the
world with her smile.

 &HT;    Diet can have some effect on gout
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is gout affected by someone's diet?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gout is a disorder in which joints, especially knees and
feet, become very painful and swollen. Uric acid in the blood rises
when the body produces too much or the kidneys do not eliminate
enough, and deposits build up in and around the joints. Medicine is
used to reduce uric acid levels, but diet can have some effects.
</P>
<P>
   Uric acid levels may be reduced by avoiding foods high in
purines, including organ meats (such as liver and kidney), meat
gravies and broths, sardines, mackerel and scallops. Alcohol can
raise uric acid levels, so should be avoided or minimized by those
prone to gout.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking enough liquid is important to help the kidneys excrete
uric acid. There is some evidence that limiting meat portions and
other steps to avoid too much protein can help control gout, as can
weight control.
</P>
<P>
   If someone with a tendency to develop gout wants to lose weight,
it's important to lose gradually. Very low calorie diets or the
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that are popular now could
actually raise uric acid levels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hear such great things about broccoli sprouts. Are they
actually better than broccoli?
</P>
<P>
   A: Broccoli sprouts _ tiny shoots from germinating broccoli
seeds that are just a few days old and can be used in salads or
sandwiches just as you might use bean or alfalfa sprouts _ are more
than 10 times as concentrated in a cancer-fighting phytochemical
called sulphoraphane than is mature broccoli. But broccoli is
higher in fiber, beta carotene and vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the antibiotic soaps and cleaning products for hands and
cooking equipment a good idea for extra protection against food
poisoning?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not necessarily. In fact, the current widespread use of
antibiotics may cause real problems. As bacteria are exposed to
antibiotics, new strains develop that are resistant to them. This
is already been seen in certain illnesses where antibiotics that
could once have treated an infection are now ineffective because
the bacteria responsible has become resistant. Researchers are
saying that the same thing can happen with indiscriminate use of
antibiotic cleansers in the home. These products may help people
whose immune systems are weakened by illness or certain medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts say that the rest of us can help prevent
development of resistant strains and just as effectively clean our
hands and kitchens by these steps: Wash hands, cutting boards and
knives in hot soapy water after contact with raw meat. Don't thaw
food at room temperature. Rinse fruits and vegetables well. And
before eating or preparing food always wash your hands. Regular
soap will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   These Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins,
M.S., R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research.

 &HT;    It's a familiar song and dance
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ The girls, as they call themselves, are
talking about each other the way girls do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so cute,'' Bette says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adorable,'' Lee agrees. ``What a figure! Why didn't I keep
mine?''
</P>
<P>
   Teri, the object of these observations, seems to be involved in
another conversation. Suddenly she turns to Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still beautiful,'' she says, and then goes back to what
she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   All this gushing might be suspect if it were merely overheard.
These are, after all, accomplished performers. But the light of
sincerity and gratitude is unmistakable in the eyes of Teri's
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done so much for me,'' Bette says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She rejuvenated me,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Carlin earned this gratitude by casting Bette Dubbs and Lee
Schulman in charity shows a few years back, the first real chance
each had to shake off a half-century's stage rust.
</P>
<P>
   Bette and Lee returned the favor by giving Teri their all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stars,'' she says. ``They're the reason we were a
sellout at the Mae Volen Senior Center. They're the ones people
come to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Teri is certain no one would come just to see her. ``I don't
dance very well, and I can't sing,'' she insists. ``But I know what
an audience likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her talent lies in writing, directing and discovering _ or
rediscovering _ the talent around her at the Edgewater Pointe
Estates retirement community in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Teri stays out of the spotlight. She does the
introductions, sets the scene for each song or skit, and she's
costumed and ready to jump in as understudy for practically
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to twist my arm very hard,'' she concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the gentlest pleading launches Teri into a
demonstration of her Charleston routine, which she precedes by
ripping off her breakaway skirt. At 85, she's not a bit shy about
showing off her showgirl legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the elderly people here get upset that I wear
shorts,'' she says. ``Of course, a lot of them are younger than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Most are at least old enough to remember the era that Teri
evokes with her song-and-dance benefit shows, when entertainers
were real and close instead of glowing figures in a vacuum tube.
It's something Teri was born into.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter of a showgirl and a wrestler, Teri says she took her
first steps on stage and hasn't stopped since. She was organizing
USO shows during World War II when she moved from New York to
Miami. After the war, she went to work as social director at a
series of hotels from Miami Beach to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed through the glamor days of the grand hotels, when
some of the biggest names in show business played the lounges at
night and mingled poolside by day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned what makes a good show, what gets audiences
involved,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She learned from watching and working with acts like Alan King,
Judy Garland, Danny Thomas, Robert Goulet, Peggy Lee and Tony
Bennett. She helped stage Can-Can revues at the Carillon and
fashion shows at the Diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Teri's specialty was drawing the guests into the act. She had a
knack for persuading otherwise dignified folks to parade in hula
skirts or pajamas, and her scrapbook shows just how she did it: by
parading right along with them.
</P>
<P>
   Teri came to know both celebrities and regular guests by their
first names. Her ``Tidbits'' column in the Diplomat's weekly
newsletter offered a who's-who guide to lobby watching.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Herman Wilke, Elkins Park, Pa., report this is
their fifth visit. He's known as the `Volkswagen King' of Philly .
. .
</P>
<P>
   By the late '60s her column was getting shorter, as fewer of the
old guests came back each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beach was changing,'' she says. ``You could tell it was a
different crowd because people started stealing towels. That never
happened in the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   As her old friends and audience retired, Teri followed them. She
took a job as social director at the then-new Palm Aire complex in
Pompano Beach, staging her old-time costume shows and theme parties
until she finally retired in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Then Teri found a new outlet for her entertainment energy in
benefit shows, which she stages three or four times a year, and a
new source of talent in her fellow retirees. Twice widowed, she
settled into Edgewater Pointe about 10 years ago and has collected
an impressive sheaf of thank-you letters from charitable
organizations for her productions.
</P>
<P>
   Her recent ``Hokey Pokey, a spoof of the Fabulous Fifties,'' was
typical: dancing, singing, reading, piano playing. Teri dreams up a
theme, then adapts it to the skills and interests of her revolving
troupe of former professionals and amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Bette, hadn't even thought of performing in years
until Teri came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very shy when I was young _ still am, really,'' Bette
says. ``My mother encouraged me to take parts in plays and
operettas to get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bette and her sister Bobbi eventually worked up an act,
performing at Eastern Star benefits near their home in Washington,
D.C., and in USO shows at veterans' hospitals. Bobbi played the
piano, and they both sang a mix of popular and novelty tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did silly stuff,'' she recalls. ``Real corny, like Homer
and Jethro.''
</P>
<P>
   Silly, corny stuff was exactly the right medicine for their
audience. Bette remembers one ward in a naval hospital filled with
men in head bandages. Most couldn't see the two girls in old jeans
and baggy shirts, but they loved what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too young to realize the impact,'' she says. ``We
thought it was fun, going to a big hospital. Then we started
getting thank-you letters from the men telling us how much it meant
to them to be able to forget their problems for a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   Bette kept those letters in the scrapbook she left behind when
she married and moved away after the war. She didn't seriously
consider a performer's life. She had a good career at NASA,
retiring after many years as assistant to the astronauts' chief
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bette, Lee had nothing but a show business career in mind
from an early age. Dance lessons turned to serious study, and at 13
she was performing in sophisticated Manhattan presentations of
Scheherazade and Prince Igor with the Michel Fokine Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   But the popular rhythm of the day urged her more toward Carmen
Miranda than Anna Pavolova. At 15, she became dance partner of
Antonio Cansino, who was already well-known for a dance act with
his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He had only one reservation about the young but talented Eleanor
Weichsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed my name to Leonor Sola,'' Lee explains, with
dramatic sweep of her arms.
</P>
<P>
   The next few years were a whirl, as Lee took to the road with a
stack of wolf-whistle publicity photos and a suitcase full of
exotic dresses. ``At the time, those costumes cost about $500
each,'' she says. ``My kids wound up wearing them for Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   At 19, she landed a major dance role in George Abbott's Broadway
production Too Many Girls, starring Desi Arnaz and Van Johnson. Her
name and pictures began to show up regularly in the entertainment
columns:
</P>
<P>
   She's in ``Too Many Girls,'' at the Imperial. But how can there
be too many girls if they're all as pretty as she?
</P>
<P>
   Arnaz, touted as ``the new singing-juvenile find of the
season,'' asked her out to celebrate his 24th birthday. He talked
all evening about Lucille Ball, who was all set to be his co-star
in the upcoming film version of the play. Lee and other cast
members were to head for Hollywood soon for their screen tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I was out bicycle riding with a couple of the other
dancers and a man on a horse ran into me,'' Lee says. ``My head was
fractured.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee couldn't even dance again for a year, but she was determined
make up for the missed film opportunity. When she recovered, she
signed with the William Morris talent agency, which booked a series
of club appearances. Her tour ended when she collapsed with
pleurisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I decided God was trying to tell me
something,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So had a most persistent suitor. This time, Lee not only
listened to his proposal, she accepted. Leonor Sola of stage and
almost screen became Lee Schulman of the alumni records department
at Princeton University. She stopped thinking about performing but
never lost the instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughters tell me they could hear my heels clacking on the
kitchen floor while I was doing dishes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Bette and Lee don't recall just when Teri picked up on their
long-latent talent, but they're grateful. Not just for her interest
and encouragement, but for her feel-young attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``With arthritis and surgery, I felt embarrassed about going on
stage with a cane,'' Bette said. ``But why? You have to just keep
on going.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever-adaptable Teri directs Bette, 74, toward seated roles.
A lip-synch specialist, Bette treated the Hokey Pokey show's
audience to an appropriately hammy rendition of Adelaide's Lament
from Guys and Dolls. She silently sobs and sighs to a recording
cued by her musical director and husband of 50 years, Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   The show's theme was a tribute to Lee. At 77, she's under
doctor's orders not to try the spins and dips of her youth. More
important, she's under Teri's orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a half-turn in rehearsal, and she's right there to stop
me from going farther,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no sudden twirls in the Hokey Pokey. It's a dance
Lee can lead and feel good about. It's also a dance everyone knows
and can join in, Teri says.
</P>
<P>
   The kind an audience likes.

 &HT;    Scout handbook reflects changing times
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A boy's life just isn't the same anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That's readily evident in the latest edition of ``The Boy Scout
Handbook,'' arriving this week in bookstores. It advises the next
generation of Scouts on everything from tying a square knot to
navigating the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The tenets haven't changed. ``Be Prepared'' is still the
official Boy Scout motto. And the Scout laws _ be trustworthy,
obedient, cheerful _ are as intact as the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The tenets haven't changed, but the times have.
</P>
<P>
   The first edition of the handbook was published in 1911. It
contained this advice regarding the opposite sex:
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenderfoot and the Scout must be polite and kind to women,
not merely to well-dressed women, but to poorly dressed women; not
merely to young women, but to old women; to women everywhere
wherever they may be found _ wherever they may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Flip forward 87 years to Page 376 of the new 11th edition, under
the heading ``Your Responsibility to Young Women,'' and you'll find
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy relationship is supportive and equal. You can have a
terrific time together enjoying life and growing socially and
emotionally. However, the difficulties created by an unplanned
pregnancy can be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   The handbook also instructs members of the MTV generation to
watch television ``wisely,'' avoid alcohol, drugs and tobacco, and
protect themselves from sexual abuse. It encourages tenderfoot
Scouts to look beyond ``differences of race, culture and language
that might keep people at a distance'' and accept people for ``who
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The revision was two years in the making, and a number of
elements have been removed or shortened from the previous edition,
issued in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this to be not just a guide for scouting, but a
guide to life,'' said Bob Longoria, a former Eagle Scout and an
engineer with Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.,
who worked on the rewrite committee.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version also places more emphasis on physical
fitness. ``Fat kids are a big issue in America,'' said Boy Scout
spokesman Jay Lawrence. Another emphasized topic is ``no trace''
camping _ leaving no trace of your camping trip behind to mar the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting has been around for 90 years. In the United States,
there are an estimated 3.5 million Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Milleson, a 19-year-old Eagle Scout in Farmington,
N.M.,who helped brainstorm the new text, says the scouting movement
and the handbook are more pertinent than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scouts provide a moral compass that a lot of kids are
lacking, the difference between right and wrong,'' he said.
``That's something that has shifted outside the home and been
removed from the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Another timely element in the new book: how to handle meat and
dairy products safely. ``E. coli isn't something Boy Scouts had to
deal with 90 years ago,'' said spokesman Lawrence.

 &HT;    Is death video good journalism?
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Nov. 29
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When ``60 Minutes'' showed Dr. Jack Kevorkian
ending the life of a 52-year-old man Sunday, some felt the
well-respected newsmagazine killed off some of its own prestige at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's indefensible to take a moment of death and create
a sensationalist atmosphere around it,'' said Stephen D. Reese,
chairman of the journalism department at the University of Texas.
``I do think that's unethical. Obviously both (Kevorkian and `60
Minutes') had something to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, a retired Michigan pathologist and euthanasia
advocate, wants to push the issue of assisted suicide to a legal
showdown. ``60 Minutes'' wants to tell a compelling story about a
hot-button issue. Such a symbiotic relationship between newsmakers
and the news media is not uncommon. But CBS News has come under
heavy fire for showing the graphic video, taken by Kevorkian and
brought to the newsmagazine. CBS also has been criticized for the
timing of the broadcast _ the final night of the all-important
November sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, Kevorkian is seen administering a sleep-inducing
injection into the arm of Thomas Youk, a Michigan man suffering
from Lou Gehrig's disease. Next he injected a drug to stop Youk's
breathing and then another to stop his heart. The process took 83
seconds. Kevorkian's face is not seen, but Youk's face is shown as
he dies. The assisted suicide, one of 120 Kevorkian says he has
participated in, was taped Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   CBS affiliates owned by the Dallas-based A.H. Belo Corp. refused
to air the Kevorkian portion, which was reported by Mike Wallace.
Instead, the stations inserted 15 minutes of local news. Belo
stations in Texas include KHOU in Houston and KENS in San Antonio.
KENS received about 200 calls after the decision to drop the
segment was announced, with more than half against Belo's decision
and less than half supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our corporation has a policy of not showing the taking of a
life or the moment of death of an individual in its news
broadcasts,'' said Marty Haag, vice president of news for Belo, in
a statement released Sunday. Belo also objected to the time period
_ 6 p.m. Sunday when families with young children are traditionally
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's CBS affiliate KEYE aired the segment and had little
viewer response. General manager Dennis Upah said the station
received three negative calls and one positive one. He said he has
no regrets about airing the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a newsworthy issue, and `60 Minutes' certainly
has a track record of responsible journalism,'' Upah said. ``I
don't think it was done for exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Upah acknowledged that his station's 6 p.m. local news would
not show an assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be a party to the commission of a crime, so it
would have been a problem for us internally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News released a statement of support this week, stating that
the program ``performed a valuable public service.'' A spokesman
said the network received a few calls of protest but ``was not
inundated.''
</P>
<P>
   The death video might not have stirred as much controversy had
it aired on a Fox reality show or one of the more sensational
collaborations of Court TV and NBC News on ``Dateline NBC.'' But it
aired on a program widely regarded as the most conservative,
news-oriented magazine on the networks. ``60 Minutes,'' for
example, was alone among the newsmagazines in ignoring the whole
circus-like O.J. Simpson murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be changing. Ed Bradley's interview with Kathleen
Willey, who accused President Clinton of groping her in the White
House, was criticized by many for being one-sided and salacious.
Wallace's interview with Kevorkian, with the disturbing home video,
gave Kevorkian a far-reaching platform from which to preach.
</P>
<P>
   While the report was not completely one-sided, it was a forum
for a cause, with titillating video that probably attracted lots of
people who weren't particularly interested in the larger issue. CBS
reports that the program drew its highest ratings so far this
season. Not surprising considering all the hype and hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   But was it worth it? Has ``60 Minutes'' jeopardized its
reputation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the moment of death, one of the most profound moments
in life, and capitalizing on it is really going over the line for
me,'' said UT's Reese. ``The ethical principles of assisted suicide
can be talked about without showing (the death). People do it all
the time in stories about executions without showing them. Of
course, if CBS's logic is upheld, that may be just around the
corner.'' Diane Holloway is the TV critic for the Austin
American-Statesman.

 &HT;    Kindness? What a radical, human, concept
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My husband discovered a jewel at Eckerd the other day.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the kind of jewel you could put on a ring or a
necklace, she was a cashier who counted back his change.
</P>
<P>
   What a rare find these days when most clerks fish out change as
directed by a computer screen and then dump it into your waiting
palm.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, you may get a mumbled thank you. More often, I
don't even get that. Instead, the clerk who's never even made eye
contact is looking at the purchases of the guy behind me, ready to
run him through.
</P>
<P>
   I'm dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, I listened to a glowing recounting of how
the drug store clerk had counted back the several dollars and
change exactly and how she had responded to a compliment about her
skill and consideration. She politely informed my husband that it
was just another way of making sure the change was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   What a radical concept.
</P>
<P>
   We were sitting in the drivethrough at Golden Chick as he was
telling the clerk story and he was so busy talking he was being
rather dismissive of the very courteous and well-spoken young woman
at the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, be nice to her,'' I chided. ``She's being nice to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, I chatted with Susan Dubose, assistant manager at
Target. A retail veteran, she too appreciates being treated well
when she's the customer. ``When you get someone really nice, you
really want to be nice to them.''
</P>
<P>
   That translates into her training of checkers for the store.
Their motto is ``fast, fun, friendly.'' Employees are trained to
treat customers as they would guests in their homes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when they do it well, it pays. Susan informed me that the
store takes those guest comment cards at the checkout stand quite
seriously and employees are rewarded based on what customers write
on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   I called Target because I remembered spending part of last
Saturday chatting with one of their employees as she checked our
purchases. We talked about the recent weather, of all things, and
not knowing what to put on in the morning because you never know
how the day really will turn out. We exchanged anecdotes. It was
pleasant and informative. My transaction was handled accurately and
efficiently and I left with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   And I guess when people leave with a smile, they come back.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to blame youth for the brusque treatment we're
given in many check-out lines. Certainly many of the people who
have such jobs are relatively young. Some of them have not had time
to build the self-confidence it takes to look folks in the eye and
say hello or to make small talk.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not sure it is not we the customers who are to blame. We
don't like to wait in line whether on our feet or in our cars. We
always need to be somewhere else _ and we needed to be there five
minutes ago.

   We demand fast, fast, fast, and that's what we get.

   Passing the time is quite a good use of time.

   AUS-A&AMP;M-NGUYEN Texas A&AMP;M's incredible NGUYEN, win situation By
Randy Riggs
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION _ Considering what he has done for and means to
Texas A&AMP;M, Dat Nguyen uses a surprising word to describe his
introduction to life as an Aggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devastating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Dat Nguyen was another lonely freshman on the A&AMP;M
football team, albeit one with a background not exactly consistent
with that of the average college football player _ born in an
Arkansas refugee camp to parents who had escaped from their
war-torn home in Vietnam on a crowded refugee boat.
</P>
<P>
   Great human-interest stuff. But it wasn't Nguyen's past that
concerned him that August in 1994 as much as it was his future,
specifically whether he had one at A&AMP;M after he learned he would be
redshirted for his freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   Inactivity, after all, was an alien football concept to Nguyen,
who chose A&AMP;M over Michigan after a high-school career at
Rockport-Fulton on the Gulf Coast where he played both fullback and
linebacker with exceptional intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cracked about every helmet we ever put on him,'' recalled
Bob Pyssen, his high school coach. ``He hardly ever came out, and
the harder it got, the better he liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   It became evident quickly to Nguyen (fittingly pronounced
``win'') that he wasn't included in Coach R.C. Slocum's immediate
plans his freshman year. And he hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought at least they could give me a shot, but they
didn't,'' he said of his redshirt year. ``But I talked to my
family, friends and my old coaches and they got me to see the big
picture. Reality hit me then. There's not a kid in the world who's
going to go to school and be happy with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day our freshman year he seemed like he was unhappy and
felt like he wasn't going to get his chance to play here,'' said
starting safety Rich Coady, a former walk-on who has roomed with
Nguyen since both arrived five years ago. ``Every day, we'd come in
and he'd be like, `I'm transferring to Michigan.' I'd say, `Hey, at
least they're paying for your school. And at least your name's on
the depth chart, maybe fourth or fifth, but at least it's on
there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the 46 football games he's played at A&AMP;M since then, Nguyen's
name has moved up the depth chart and into the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the heap When he takes the field at Royal-Memorial
Stadium on Friday against Texas in the final regular-season game of
his college career, the formerly unhappy freshman who remembers
being, ``just one of a hundred players _ I just had a number on me
and that was pretty much it,'' now has another number by his name.
</P>
<P>
   It's No. 488, and counting. That is the number of tackles he's
been involved in at A&AMP;M, beginning with a stop on Louisiana State
tailback Kevin Faulk in the 1995 season opener, making him the most
prolific tackler in the history of a proud program reknowned for
producing some of the top defensive players in Southwest
Conference/Big 12 history.
</P>
<P>
   The player who retreated home to Rockport several days into his
freshman two-a-days at A&AMP;M and had to be convinced to return to
College Station now ranks at the top of lists more significant than
tackles _ if also more subjective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the other day that I can honestly say, in my
opinion, that there's not been a player we've ever had here who has
done more for us, on or off the field,'' Slocum said. ``No one has
ever represented us better than he has. I believe that. He's been a
model guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is good now for Nguyen. He's a football hero, certainly,
but also an icon for the Asian community in College Station and
beyond. He readily acknowledges his name focused the spotlight on
him initially _ ``I stick out because my name's different,'' he
said _ but to his credit, he hasn't attempted to escape it.
</P>
<P>
   Like his equally famous dreadlocked counterpart in Austin, Ricky
Williams, Nguyen is especially good with children. He has spent
considerable time at elementary schools in Bryan and College
Station. And like Williams, whom Nguyen considers a friend after
the two spent time together last summer at a Playboy magazine
All-America team gathering in Phoenix, Nguyen takes his role-model
chores seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge responsibility for student-athletes. Not just for
me or (Williams),'' he said. ``Everybody should do it but a lot
don't. If I was a little kid and Ricky Williams came to my school,
I'd be the happiest person in the world. Most athletes don't
understand that, but when I think about my past and how we were
supported by refugee camps before we moved to Rockport (when he was
six months old), anything I can do to give back and say thanks,
I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyssen, his former coach, said Nguyen is still idolized at
Rockport, where he said the high school enrollment is about 12
percent Asian, mostly children whose parents, like Nguyen's, are
involved in the shrimping business.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these kids look up to him,'' said Pyssen, now a school
administrator in Rockport. ``We've got a lot of them who want to be
just like him.''
</P>
<P>
   What will future bring? His Texas ties are a big reason why
Nguyen isn't doing his tackling and role modeling these days in
Michigan. He can laugh, now, when he reminisces about his
unsettling early days as an Aggie. And laughter, quick staccato
bursts that are loud and frequent, comes easily to Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that was new for me, but it was old for him (Slocum).
He gets that stuff every year with freshmen,'' he said. ``You've
got to go through some obstacles in life, and that was a huge
obstacle that I had to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Despite holding A&AMP;M's tackles record and being a finalist for
the Butkus and Lombardi awards, Nguyen again has concerns about his
future. At least his football-playing future. He earned his
bachelor's degree in agricultural development this summer and is
taking graduate courses this fall. But there are those who think
that moving up to graduate-level football _ the NFL _ will be
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, size often matters. And Nguyen isn't blessed with an
overabundance of it. He stands only 5 feet, 11 inches and has
bulked up this year to 230 pounds. That's the most he's weighed
since reporting to A&AMP;M weighing a puffy 238 pounds as a freshman,
thinking he had to be big to survive. Last year he played at about
215.
</P>
<P>
   But Nguyen's uncanny football instincts and ability to make
plays, even if they aren't of the highlight-film,
take-your-head-off variety, plus the success of undersized NFL
linebackers like Miami's Zach Thomas (formerly of Texas Tech),
Dallas' Dexter Coakley and Tennessee's Joe Bowden (Oklahoma ex)
will give him a chance. Many believe, however, that his A&AMP;M
teammate Warrick Holdman will have a better opportunity in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd bring him to camp in a heartbeat, but you can't get stuck
with too many of those kinds of kids,'' one veteran NFL scout said
of Nguyen. ``If he was 6-1, he'd be a first-rounder. Now there are
a lot of 6-3 guys who can run like the devil but can't make plays.
That kid just flat makes plays. But he's in the same boat as Zach.
You've got to keep him covered up, let him hide and make plays,
like they do at A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen describes his NFL chances as ``real slim,'' but wants at
least a shot. If it doesn't work out, though, there's always
corporate America. An A&AMP;M official said the CEOs of several large
companies, many of whom happen to be Aggies, want to discuss
employment opportunities with Nguyen after his football days are
over, whenever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are some doors open to me and I've got a lot of
opportunities out there,'' Nguyen said. ``But I hope there's a
future in football, at least for a while. I know I'm so undersized
for my position, but I just want a chance. If it doesn't come, it
doesn't come. Football will end sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the playing ends, Slocum thinks his prize linebacker
could coach _ among many other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd make a great coach. He'd make a great anything,'' Slocum
said. ``He has all the qualities that make for a successful person.
Whatever he chooses to do, he will find a way to be successful at
it.''

 &HT;    Buffalo's Flutie will feel right at home in Foxboro
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the NFL's schedule-maker settled on the '98 card
seven months ago, he overlooked a significant element of
Thanksgiving. One of the best parts of the holiday is snacking on
the leftovers. Alas, with the Minnesota-Dallas game having been
played Thursday, there is precious little dessert for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   By default, Sunday's game between the Buffalo Bills and Hartford
Patriots _ the lone matchup featuring teams with winning records _
represents the best of a weekend that could conclude with five of
the 12 playoff berths already determined.
</P>
<P>
   With AFC East co-leaders Miami and the New York Jets likely to
handle New Orleans and Carolina, respectively, the loser at Foxboro
Stadium could be all but eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Bills, quarterback Doug Flutie is
comfortable at Foxboro, having rung up a 10-0 record at a facility
that could be transformed into a flea market once the Pats pull up
stakes in 2001. Never mind that five of the victories came when
Flutie was playing at Boston College. Buffalo's lucky charm
quarterback figures to hear more cheers than most of the New
England players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming home to play like this, with all my friends and family
in the stands, is another part of what has been a dream year,''
said Flutie, whose 11-year-old nephew, Bill, will participate in
the regional finals of the Punt, Pass and Kick competition.
``There's going to be a comfort zone for me there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pats rallied in the final minutes Monday night against the
Dolphins to silence their critics for a few days, but they need a
winning streak to resurrect postseason aspirations for one of the
NFL's most talented rosters.
</P>
<P>
   A key for New England coach Pete Carroll will be the play of an
offensive line demolished by Bills end Bruce Smith in Buffalo's
13-10 victory over the Patriots two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the NFL ``bests'' for this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: Washington is 2-2 in its last four games,
has averaged a gaudy 29.5 points in that stretch and has
quarterback Trent Green playing well. It won't be enough to save
Norv Turner's job, but the Redskins will post numbers against an
Oakland secondary decimated by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: San Diego's defense leads the league
overall and against the run, but the Chargers probably can't shut
down the Broncos. Still, those collisions between Denver tailback
Terrell Davis and two San Diego defenders, linebacker Junior Seau
and strong safety Rodney Harrison, should be real train wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: A dislocated finger won't keep Green Bay
quarterback Brett Favre from strafing the sorry Eagles. Bet on
``the Brettster'' for at least three touchdown passes, one to his
newest weapon, backup tight end Tyrone Davis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: The Colts make their first trip back to
Baltimore since bolting the city under cover of darkness in 1984.
It's a good thing the man who precipitated the move, the late Indy
owner Bob Irsay, won't be there. Things could get ugly, in the
stands and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division matchup: Beyond the Buffalo-New England game, there's
not much divisional meat on the bone. The inconsistent Jacksonville
Jaguars, whose run was interrupted last week in Pittsburgh, could
catch some resistance at Cincinnati for about a half. The Bengals
probably can't hang with the Jags, though, for four quarters.

Singapore has thrown off old regulations and taken a knife to its
high costs, Hong Kong has moved in the opposite direction _
intervening to prop up its stock market, imposing a raft of new

   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.
</P>

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

 ADAPTED FROM ``DECORATING FOR THE HOLIDAYS: CHRISTMAS WITH MARTHA
STEWART LIVING, VOLUME 2''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the

INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>
<P>
   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.
</P>

SCRAPBOOKS: HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT WILL BE FAMILY TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
 (For purchase information and to obtain photos, call New York Times
Syndicate sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or
(212) 499-3333.) &HT;    
 By KATHY SENA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No doubt there's a shoebox or two up in your closet just
overflowing with snapshots dating back to your child's first
birthday, your wedding ... maybe your own childhood. How do I know
all this? Just take a look in my closets!
 &HT;    You can turn those treasured photos into albums that will become
great holiday gifts _ and family heirlooms.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking, the popular craft of creating ``memory books,''
has been sweeping the western and southern parts of the United
States for the past few years. It is quickly becoming the '90s
version of the quilting bee. Its popularity has even spread to
England, Australia and Japan.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is simple. But the list of products _ and the
terminology _ can sound intimidating to the beginner. Acid-free?
Polyurethane? Archival quality?
 &HT;    Not to worry. Just follow these simple instructions and you'll
finish your first scrapbook page in no time. And trust me _ you'll
be hooked.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that photos preserved in this fashion should
still be in good shape at least 200 years from now. I can't say the
same for my high school photo album, a magnetic album that has
turned my photos gummy and brown around the edges _ and I'm not
that old! What better treasure to pass on to your children _ and
your great-great-grandchildren.
 WHAT IS SCRAPBOOKING?  
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is a way to preserve photographs and other
memorabilia in a safe, acid-free environment. Acid can weaken and
discolor paper. As long as you choose acid-free, archival-quality
(meaning material that can be safely used for preservation
purposes) paper, pens, adhesive and sheet-protectors, you really
can't go wrong. The only thing you add is photos, love and a little
imagination.
 &HT;    Here's how to get started:
 &HT;    1. Get organized. Group your photos by year or by subject. Most
experts recommend starting with your most recent photographs and
working back in time. Because magnetic-page photo albums are quite
harmful to photos, consider removing photos from old albums and
storing them by date in a heavy-duty, acid-free photo-storage box
(which can be purchased inexpensively at most camera stores and
photo shops) until you have time to add them to your scrapbook.
 &HT;    2. Buy supplies. There is an overwhelming array of scrapbooking
products available at craft stores, stationery stores and rubber
stamp stores and by mail order. There are even stores devoted just
to scrapbooking. But all you really need to get started is the
following:
 &HT;    + Photos. Order double prints.
 &HT;    + Acid-free mounting paper, polyurethane archival-quality page
protectors and a three-ring binder. Some people prefer to use 8 1/2
x 11-inch sheets stored in sheet protectors in binders. Others use
albums of different sizes that are pre-filled with acid-free paper.
 &HT;    + Regular household scissors.
 &HT;    + Acid-free adhesive _ glue stick, photo corners or
peel-and-stick squares.
 &HT;    + Acid-free pen for ``journaling'' _ adding names, dates and
comments to the page.
 &HT;    Starter kits containing most of the above can be purchased at
many craft stores for about $25. To further enhance your pages, you
may wish to buy such items as paper punches, stickers, circle
cutters, colored paper and pens, templates for cutting shapes,
fancy-edged scissors.
 &HT;    3. Pick a theme. Christmas? Your child's birthday party? The
school picnic? Whatever your theme, play with groupings of photos.
Be choosy. Use only your best photos, whether it's one special
photo alone on a page or a grouping of four or five.
 &HT;    4. Crop and mat. You may want to crop your photos to sharpen
their focus. Trim around the most important part of the photo,
removing excess background or unnecessary elements. If you are
using old family photos or other irreplaceable photos, make color
copies and work from those.
 &HT;    You can use plain or patterned paper to create a mat. Just glue
your photo to the paper and trim around the edges, leaving a border
showing. Double- or triple-matted photos look great, too.
 &HT;    5. Add the finishing touches. After you've chosen a layout, it's
time to glue down your photos and to add stickers, stamps and _
most important _ journaling.
 &HT;    Add dates and names, of course. But don't stop there. Add
details that will make the photos come alive for future
generations. Tell a funny story about how your dog ate the
Thanksgiving turkey. List your child's five favorite songs next to
a photo showing her singing. Describe where and how far your son
hiked on the Boy Scout camping trip. It's those details that make
your scrapbook a real family treasure.
 &HT;    6. Pass it around. One of the most rewarding parts of
scrapbooking is sharing the finished book with your family. Kids
can learn a lot from looking at scrapbooks. Older kids enjoy
looking back on family activities and sharing the book with
friends. Toddlers and preschoolers learn names of family members,
pick up lots of new words and enjoy looking at themselves when they
were ``just babies.''
 &HT;    And all kids feel like VIPs as they turn the pages. After all,
they're the stars of their very own book.

AMERICA'S FIRST CHRISTMAS CARD

 &HT;    
 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Once a year, Christmas cards flood America's mailboxes. Once a
year, countless fingers go numb from signing and addressing stacks
of them.
 &HT;    How did this tradition come to be?
 &HT;    The first Christmas card can be traced to a long-forgotten
businessman named Richard H. Pease. History records little of Pease
except that he was a skilled lithographer and printer who set up
shop in Albany in 1850. In 1851, whether in a fit of Yuletide
whimsy or in a savvy burst of self-promotion, he put bold black ink
to stiff, pristine white paper and crafted an intricate design.
 &HT;    On 4 1/2-by-6-inch cards, the holiday entrepreneur fashioned
images that later generations might have deemed too ``busy'' in
such a limited space, but that Americans of the 1850s found
perfectly fitting, given the mid-19th century affinity for
Victorian vistas and Currier &AMP; Ives prints.
 &HT;    A gracefully curved line of holly adorned the bottom of the
card, and prominently above the inked leaves ran the creator's
advertisement _ ``Pease's Great Variety Store in the Temple of
Fancy.''
 &HT;    ``Temple of Fancy'' perfectly described the images crowding the
card, Pease having turned his imagination and his drawing hand
loose in a burst of Christmas creativity. Featured in his holiday
motifs was, of course, Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Pease's Santa, however, bore only a passing resemblance to the
rotund St. Nick that famed 19th-century caricaturist Thomas Nast
later stamped upon the nation's collective imagination. The
businessman's Santa appeared on the card as a small, rather elflike
Santa Claus with a fur-trimmed cap.
 &HT;    Pease's card also featured scenes of how middle- and upper-class
Americans of the day celebrated Christmas. Arrayed around the
card's four corners were Christmas presents, Christmas dishes and
Christmas drinks, all hinting of mouthwatering holiday repasts and
heartfelt toasts.
 &HT;    In the card's center, a young, handsome couple, faces redolent
of holiday cheer and financial comfort, enjoyed the Yuletide
exuberance of their three children. Behind the beaming family, a
servant was setting an elaborate holiday dinner, a familiar scene
in affluent and middle-class households throughout the United
States. Reflecting an equally familiar but more disturbing reality
of 1850s American life was the black servant bustling about the
table.
 &HT;    Whether they knew it or not, friends and customers peering at
Pease's landmark cards, with their vivid black and white tones and
their boldly inked message, ``A Merry Christmas and A Happy New
Year,'' literally held the future theme of the Christmas card in
their hands.
 &HT;    Pease's card also contained the stuff of printers' nightmares.
To his friends' and customers' probable amusement and to his
certain chagrin, the engraver's cards included a misspelled word:
``Pease's Great Varety Store.''
 &HT;    In 1874, 24 years after Pease's flight of holiday fancy
materialized, Massachusetts lithographer Louis Prang unveiled a
line of beautiful commercial Christmas cards that spawned a
lucrative industry and earned him the sobriquet ``Father of the
American Christmas Card.''
 &HT;    For generations to come, Prang, whose pleasant, white-whiskered
features resembled those of the Santas in his popular cards, was
hailed as the first American to craft Christmas cards. Pease's
milestone card slipped into historical obscurity, eclipsed by the
commercial and artistic feat of Prang, who would long receive
mistaken acclaim as the creator of the very first American
Christmas card.
 &HT;    In 1954, greeting card authority Gyorgy Buday completed his
detailed book ``The History of the Christmas Card,'' which credited
Prang as the creator of the Christmas card. His publisher was at
the page-proof stage, when the author had a surprise for his
editors.
 &HT;    Buday had just received a letter from E.D. Chase, who had
enclosed a copy of ``the first American Christmas card'' -- Richard
Pease's card.
 &HT;    Buday went on to anoint Pease's card as the first: ``No date
appears on the lithograph itself, but as a result of some
considerable research, Mr. Chase satisfactorily established that it
must be either 1850, 1 or 2, since it was only these three years
that Mr. Pease occupied the building which is pictured prominently
on the card.''
 &HT;    Other scholars of Americana followed Buday's attempt to assign
Pease's card its proper place in the greeting card firmament. That
Prang had created the first commercially successful cards remains
clear. But Pease's creation stands as the nation's first bonafide
Christmas card.
 &HT;    We will never know if Pease's marriage of Christmas and commerce
bloomed ahead of its time, or if he, unlike Prang in the 1870s,
simply failed to parlay his idea into a holiday fortune.

   POLLOCK-PAINTINGS (New York) _ Looking at the Jackson Pollock
canvases now on view at the Museum of Modern Art and thinking about
the short, cometlike arc of Pollock's life and career, one seems to
face an inscrutable proposition from the science of physics: naked
energy, mass transformed by momentum and explosion, an explosion in
this case whose laboratory was the body and psyche of a single
person. Though its popular arts had traveled worldwide by the
1940s, until the advent of Abstract Expressionism no form of
American elite art commanded international attention. At the
International Biennale exhibition in Venice in 1950, the Italian
painter Giorgio Morandi surveyed paintings by de Kooning and
Arshile Gorky with keen interest, but when he saw the Pollock
canvases, he exclaimed: ``Ah, ah _ this is new. Vitality, energy _
new!'' By Ann Douglas.

   ADULT-POP (Undated) _ Attention fellow dinosaurs, old fogeys and
senescent Beatlemaniacs. If you can hardly find any music on the
radio to listen to nowadays and the bouncy toy sounds of Brandy and
Monica fighting over a boy don't speak to your soul the way Joni
Mitchell's or Bob Dylan's records once did, there is still pop
music being made that is worth your attention. Some of it is even
made by musicians in their 20's. And some of it (although not much)
is even very popular. One veteran critic's annotated personal
roundup of favorite adult pop albums of 1998. By Stephen Holden.

   BUTTERFLIES (New York) _ There are plenty of Solomonic exchanges

   LONG-RUNNING-PLAYS (New York) _ Absolutely convinced that I was
going to be an audience of one, I arrived at ``The Fantasticks'' in
the Village a little early. My thinking was, if the box office had
tangible evidence of a bona fide ticketholder, the show positively
had to go on. Pardon my lack of faith, but it was almost impossible
to believe that virtually any viable life form on the planet had
not already paid a visit to this cozy arthouse musical, which has
run at the Sullivan Street Playhouse for, gulp, 38 years and, as of
Dec. 18, fully 16,000 performances. Like an overscheduled medical
resident, I recently made the rounds of 7 of the 10 Off Broadway
shows that have been running a year or more to check their pulses,
to generally assess the effects of the passage of time. By Peter
Marks.

   POLLOCK-PAINTINGS (New York) _ Looking at the Jackson Pollock
canvases now on view at the Museum of Modern Art and thinking about
the short, cometlike arc of Pollock's life and career, one seems to
face an inscrutable proposition from the science of physics: naked
energy, mass transformed by momentum and explosion, an explosion in
this case whose laboratory was the body and psyche of a single
person. Though its popular arts had traveled worldwide by the
1940s, until the advent of Abstract Expressionism no form of
American elite art commanded international attention. At the

TEXAS-ARLINGTON GOLF TEAM LIFTS WEIGHTS TO IMPROVE GAME

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas-Arlington senior athlete Charan Thethy
emerges from the school's weight room, his pumped-up muscles still
not struggling to stay inside his polo shirt.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Thethy. He's a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks senior athlete Chris Forbes, awake at 6:30 a.m.,
returns home from a jog to find he's pretty tired and not ready to
join the track team.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Forbes. He's a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington golfers are using the winter off-season to get
stronger and build stamina, just as the men's and women's
basketball teams do before their grueling schedules. These are
improvements that the golf team hopes will translate to lower
scores when the spring season comes around.
</P>
<P>
   Before snickering about golfers in the weight room, Thethy said,
``try carrying a 15-pound bag through the last five holes of a
72-hole, four-day tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really worked out much before, but I can tell it
helps,'' he said. ``I don't get as tired, and it's easier to
concentrate. If you're in better shape, you'll feel better and play
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches at Division I universities are allowed to work out their
athletes eight hours per week during the off-season, and
Texas-Arlington second-year coach Mark Hankins fills the time with
a program from his playing and coaching days Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks start the day with a light jog, followed by
circuit training in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Hankins said he wants his players to develop solid trunks,
strong backs and firmer stomachs while increasing overall
flexibility. The team works out five days per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of little things can add up to something big,'' Hankins
said. ``What I tell our players is, `If you want to be a great
player, you have to go beyond what other people do.' There are so
many benefits. Getting stronger not only builds self-esteem and
stamina, it can help players avoid injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional golfers started the fitness trend in the early
1980s. By 1984, a fitness trailer made each stop on the PGA Tour to
offer the competitors a chance to work out.
</P>
<P>
   It took little time for college golfers to mimic the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older golfers never thought about fitness, and
they are the ones with back problems,'' Hankins said. ``The golf
swing is all about your trunk. That's why we concentrate on the
stomach, butt muscles and hamstring area. It also builds team
chemistry, because the guys are working together and pushing each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Mavericks will continue to hit the weights and run.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect bulging biceps on the 140-pound Thethy, and don't
look for Forbes on the track team. But Texas-Arlington's five-man
golf squad of Thethy, Forbes, Harry Singh, Adam Babb and Corby King
has three months of off-season training before they make a run at
the Southland Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   The three months could make the difference, Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a tournament, you want to feel like you're
prepared,'' he said. ``This makes us feel like we've done
everything we can to get ready.''

WHEN DAVID SEDARIS SPEAKS HIS MIND, IT'S NO HOLDS BARRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURIE NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In the name of all that's holy, please don't call him
``the elf guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't call him ``the apartment cleaner guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't call him ``the most brilliantly witty New Yorker since
Dorothy Parker.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, don't even ask him if he's a writer.
</P>
<P>
   For David Sedaris, author of three bestselling books _
``Naked,'' ``Barrel Fever'' and ``Holiday on Ice'' _ it's kind of
embarrassing. He doesn't really enjoy any of those titles, although
all of them have been used relentlessly to describe him.
</P>
<P>
   Since initially broadcasting his sardonic, chopping-block wit on
National Public Radio in 1992 in an essay about his experience as
Santa's helper at Macy's, the elf reference has stuck to Sedaris
like a ratty piece of toilet paper on a rubber sole. At the end of
that broadcast, Sedaris was identified as ``an apartment cleaner
who lives in New York City,'' an earmark that evolved into somewhat
of a bulbous nose ring. Although it was true at the time, it's
still the predominant ditty that reporters and public-relations
folks bite into first and shake like a pit bull, even six years
later. Understandably, it can become tiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely sick of hearing about the apartment cleaning,''
Sedaris says nicely from a hotel room in Portland, Maine, where he
will be performing in about an hour. ``When ``Barrel Fever'' came
out, I would do interviews and people would make it sound like it
was some kind of a gimmick. They'd say, `Our guest is a house
cleaner, so call up if you have any questions, about . . . cleaning
houses. Tough stains you want to talk about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When ``New York'' magazine made the Dorothy Parker reference _
prefaced by the words ``radio star'' and, of course, ``retired
elf'' _ Sedaris simply ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to read those things they put in the front of my
books,'' Sedaris explains, taking a deep drag from a Kool Mild
cigarette. ``Someone introduced me a couple days ago before a
reading, and they were saying that I was `wise.' And I was like,
`Oh no, I'm not wise! And now I have to go out there and own up to
wisdom? No way. I can't do it.' I never thought to call myself
anything. I can't call myself a writer. I'm just a . . . typist.''
</P>
<P>
   In his typically dry voice _ both on paper and over the airwaves
_ Sedaris humbly whips and tickles his audience's sense of humor in
unison, scratching at social values, passively delivering the
ridiculous as unbiased fact and the comical as little pinpricks of
misery. In an October broadcast on NPR's ``Morning Edition,'' he
pondered aloud that there are no normal restaurants left in New
York City: ``You can't open a menu anymore without finding the word
`baby.' Veal is a baby calf, but you rarely hear it described that
way. Because even to a meat eater, it's unpleasant to think of
eating an infant.'' The chain-smoking Sedaris wondered why he can't
find his addiction addressed in any entree: ``What I really want is
a cigarette, and I'm always searching the menu in hopes that some
courageous chef has finally recognized tobacco as a vegetable. Bake
it, steam it, stuff it into little-neck clams. I just need
something familiar that I can hold on to.''
</P>
<P>
   Though millions of listeners have borne witness to Sedaris' NPR
commentaries, he'll quickly turn off the radio when one starts,
only to revive it after the piece is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't stand the sound of my voice. I can't stand it,''
he says adamantly of his patient and droll, somewhat nasal
inflection. ``But it's a nice voice for a 10-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also shocked at the $25 asking price for that night's
Portland performance, despite his rapidly increasing cult
following. The entirety of the show, which consists of readings
from his pieces from ``The New Yorker'' and various short stories,
doesn't quite add up in his estimation to the ticket price, and,
frankly, he's rather mortified.
</P>
<P>
   ``For $25, you should sing or dance,'' he says modestly, ``or do
something. I just always imagine people walking to the parking lot
after the show and saying, `Man, we could have bought . . . (begin
ital) drugs (end ital) with that money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Sedaris' self-deprecating perspective and the fact
that he smokes far too much to tap dance or belt out the chorus of
``Cabaret,'' sold-out performances across the country are proof
that the typist with the prepubescent girlie voice can pack 'em in.
Critics in darker moments, however, have called him ``mean.'' His
subject matter has been defined as ``ugly to read about'' and
``scathing.''
</P>
<P>
   So what? They're right. Sedaris' humor is at times brutal and
savage _ and true. It strikes nerves. Hits close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stories would not work if I didn't expose myself
as an ass_,'' Sedaris says. ``It's stuff that anyone in their right
mind would want to make fun of and for some stupid reason aren't
allowed to. As far as I'm concerned, anyone should be allowed to
make fun of whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's now at work on his next project _ maybe. ``Either
I've started it or I haven't,'' he says. ``I'm just not sure. It's
supposed to be a novel, but I don't know how to write a novel. You
have to plot. I'm not a plotter. You have to develop characters,
and then remember later that the character has a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedaris and his boyfriend, artist Hugh Hamrick, have temporarily
relocated to Paris, where he fields questions from French neighbors
who want to know what it's like living in ``Nye,'' misreading
``NY,'' and diffusing grand ideas that he often spots such
celebrities as Madonna and Michael Jackson breast-feeding their
children on a bench in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, David Sedaris isn't thinking about that. He's not
thinking about the novel, or that he's hitting the stage in about
10 minutes. He's too busy focusing on the fact that tomorrow
morning he's getting on a small plane that will carry him to his
next show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to ride in a little plane,'' he says, somewhat
nervously. ``Do you know what I mean? The amazing thing is that
there's only going to be two people in the plane, me and the pilot,
and still, (begin ital) still, (end ital) I can't smoke.'' &QL;

BRINGING JOY TO THE WORLD IS WHAT BLUES MAN DOES BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVAL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Among Mose Allison lore, the story has taken on
legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   Seems that in the late '50s, the legendary bluesman was playing
at a Black club on the south side of Chicago. ``Jet Magazine'' took
notice of the buzz surrounding the young musician and put a
reporter on the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to know if I'd been to college,'' Allison recounts
in his sauntering Mississippi drawl. ``I told him I graduated from
LSU (Louisiana State University), and the reporter wanted to know
if I was the first Black man to graduate from the university. I
told him, `Sir, I think there is something you should know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Allison laughs. Even over the phone, the richness of his
Southern-fried chortle creates images of an old storyteller
relaxing under a magnolia tree. This despite the fact he's calling
from his Long Island home a couple of weeks after his 71st
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a checkup, and I don't have any major problems,''
he happily reports. ``Just the little things that happen to all
people. Like, now, I have a different relationship to inanimate
objects: I drop things and bump into things.''
</P>
<P>
   A singer and songwriter and pianist, Allison is one of those
national treasures who probably would go unrecognized at the mall.
He has been recording since the '50s for a variety of major labels.
He's currently signed to Capitol's Blue Note jazz division, which
released this year's delightful ``Gimcracks and Gewgaws.'' The
silver-bearded sage has no pretenses about his albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the new one is going, it's never going to pay for
itself,'' he says. ``None of my records have ever paid for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allison is a special talent meriting special attention.
Rhino Records gave him the box-set treatment a few years ago. Van
Morrison recorded a tribute album of all Allison songs in '96. And
the Who recorded his ``Young Man's Blues'' in 1970, perhaps his
greatest achievement.
</P>
<P>
   On his latest album, Allison revisits the song with his pungent
wit. Now titled ``Old Man's Blues,'' the rewritten verse goes:
``Well an old man ain't nothing in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   He's known for his cool sarcasm. ``Certified Senior Citizen''
(1994) included the following delicious couplet: ``I'm a certified
senior citizen and I don't have to pay full fare/ You might ignore
me, but doctors adore me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, people have accused me of cynicism,'' Allison
says. ``They take my stuff too seriously. Classic jazz people were
part clowns. They did humorous material. There's always been that
element to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of irony and deadpan humor and I'm sure it has to do
with the Southern background. It's like the wise old fool who says
something that doesn't really pertain to anything. It's nonsense
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   With Allison, nonsense and wisdom go hand in hand. In live
performances, he's simply a marvel, with fast, penetrating piano
work, colorful songs and his rich, humorous patter. It's fattening
and delicious, the perfect three-course Southern meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, I played a gig in Atlanta,'' he relates.
``Afterward, people came up to me, saying why they liked one song,
why they liked another. And this one lady walked up to me and said
the reason she liked my set was because of the joy in it.
`Hallelujah!' I thought. `Somebody has finally recognized what this
is all about!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, thousands of people know what the joy of Allison is
all about. If you don't, you need to find out.  &QL;

HE'S ON SANTA'S LIST, AND NOT UNDER `NICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Robert Schimmel's second comedy album, like his first,
carries the big black and white ``explicit content'' label, but if
you've heard his act, that warning is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks openly about sex, but if you're familiar with his
comedy, that shouldn't be a surprise, either. That also means his
act's not that television-friendly, keeping his fan base to those
who either frequent comedy clubs or buy his albums.
</P>
<P>
   So of all the people at the mall during the holiday season to
recognize Schimmel, it was the person he least suspected. Even more
shocking to Schimmel _ which is pretty hard to do in the first
place _ was that the guy knew the comedian's material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa looked up at me and said, `You're the guy with the
Popsicle in your butt, right?' I said, `What?' He said, `You're
Robert Schimmel, right?' '' Schimmel says. ``My wife looked at me
and said, `Santa is quoting your act. The world is near an end.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be a great image enhancer for red-suited,
gift-bearing fat men, but it's a good sign for Scottsdale resident
Schimmel, whose second album, ``If You Buy This CD, I Can Get This
Car,'' came out Oct. 20, about two years after his first.
</P>
<P>
   The first 54 minutes of the 66-minute CD were taped in January
in San Francisco. The rest of it is the comedian performing songs,
including two versions (dirty and less dirty) of the title track.
</P>
<P>
   The last track on the album is ``I'm So Good in Bed,'' a song
Schimmel, 48, recorded as a joke after record executives pestered
him to pen some verse, as comedians Adam Sandler and Jeff Foxworthy
had done. The song then was released to markets, including Grand
Rapids, Mich., where it made some stations' most-requested lists.
The album version of the song was recorded live in Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end (of the Grand Rapids show) I did the song, and the
audience knew the words,'' he says. ``I had 1,800 people singing
that with me and I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the stand-up portion of the CD was recorded in one
night, it flows better than Schimmel's first release, which
essentially was a greatest-hits compilation from his first 14 years
of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a comedy album, and after you've heard it once, you
know all the jokes. And, as evidenced by Jerry Seinfeld's CD
version of his HBO special, they're just not as popular as they
used to be. But Schimmel says he will continue to do them because,
besides the stage, the CD is his only outlet for unencumbered
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television tells you what you can say, what you can't say,''
he says. ``. . . The only place you can really do whatever you want
to do is onstage. It might not work and you can bomb, but you can
try it.'' &QL;

 &UR; EVERYONE IS GETTING TOGETHER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In this season of brotherly love and making money, more and more
companies, AOL and Netscape for example, are tying the knot.
 &UR; Bob Cullinan  &LR; offers some swell corporate suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   - A merger of PolyGram Records, Warner Brothers and Keebler:
Poly-Warner-Cracker.
</P>
<P>
   - A merger between Yahoo and Netscape: Net 'n' Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   - W.R. Grace buying Fuller Brush and Mary Kay Cosmetics, then
merging with Hale Business Systems: Hale Mary Fuller Grace.
</P>
<P>
   - 3M and Goodyear: mmmGood.
</P>
<P>
   - Knott's Berry Farm and National Organization for Women: Knott
NOW.
</P>
<P>
   - Federal Express and UPS: FedUp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OAKLAND'S HOTTEST SHOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 13, 1877,  &UR; William Frank ``Doc'' Carver &LR; , who lived in
Oakland, wrote to The San Francisco Chronicle to present a
challenge: ``I will shoot any man (cq) in the world at 500 glass
balls, 25 yards rise. ... I will bet from $250 to $500 a side that
I can break 100 glass balls quicker than ... any man living and I
will go to any part of the world to do it.'' Carver challenged all
comers to contests in which glass balls would be thrown into the
air and shot at from horseback. ``I can make more fancy shots with
a rifle than any man in the world. ... I will bet $1,000 that I can
go on the plains and kill more buffalo on one run shooting from a
horse's back, than any man in the world, and if buffalo are not to
be found, will run elk.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of marksmen took up his challenges; a cross-country
tour ``drew national recognition,'' says ``Buffalo Bill's Wild
West; An American Legend'' by  &UR; R.L. Wilson  &LR; with  &UR; Greg Martin &LR; 
(Random House; $60). The book's historic photos _ of posters,
advertising materials, guns, artifacts and souvenirs of the West in
museums and private collections _ were shot in San Francisco by
 &UR; Peter Beard &LR;  and &UR; Douglas Sandberg &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Carver broke 5,500 glass balls out of 6,212
launched in seven hours and 38 minutes. He was said to have netted
$80,000 on a European tour. The next year, he moved to San
Francisco.

   &UR; OAKLAND'S HOTTEST SHOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 13, 1877,  &UR; William Frank ``Doc'' Carver &LR; , who lived in
Oakland, wrote to The San Francisco Chronicle to present a
challenge: ``I will shoot any man (cq) in the world at 500 glass
balls, 25 yards rise. ... I will bet from $250 to $500 a side that
I can break 100 glass balls quicker than ... any man living and I
will go to any part of the world to do it.'' Carver challenged all
comers to contests in which glass balls would be thrown into the
air and shot at from horseback. ``I can make more fancy shots with
a rifle than any man in the world. ... I will bet $1,000 that I can
go on the plains and kill more buffalo on one run shooting from a
horse's back, than any man in the world, and if buffalo are not to
be found, will run elk.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of marksmen took up his challenges; a cross-country
tour ``drew national recognition,'' says ``Buffalo Bill's Wild
West; An American Legend'' by  &UR; R.L. Wilson  &LR; with  &UR; Greg Martin &LR; 
(Random House; $60). The book's historic photos _ of posters,
advertising materials, guns, artifacts and souvenirs of the West in
museums and private collections _ were shot in San Francisco by
 &UR; Peter Beard &LR;  and &UR; Douglas Sandberg &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Carver broke 5,500 glass balls out of 6,212
launched in seven hours and 38 minutes. He was said to have netted
$80,000 on a European tour. The next year, he moved to San
Francisco.

TIME TO PUT KEVORKIAN IN HIS PLACE

<P>
   PHOENIX - Again he defines the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Given a national stage, he tells us (for about the 130th time
now) the time, place and manner to prescribe death.
</P>
<P>
   He sets the agenda and the tone. He speaks for us _ because we
let him.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we let him?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kevorkian killed Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old man with Lou
Gehrig's disease. He videotaped it to prove it to the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said this particular death, directly by his hand _ not with
his contraption that allows patients to kill themselves _ was
necessary for the ``showdown'' he wants so badly with prosecutors,
the medical community, the Supreme Court and anyone else who
disagrees with his means to the final end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue's got to be raised to the level where it is finally
decided,'' he told about 15.6 million households tuned in to the
``60 Minutes'' airing of Youk's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be prosecuted for euthanasia,'' he told a Michigan
newspaper. ``I want to prove that this is not a crime, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors think they saw a homicide on videotape and have
charged Kevorkian with three felony counts, including first-degree
premeditated murder. Television viewers, with diverse opinions on
right-to-die issues, probably saw many things _ a charlatan, a
social change agent at his daring best, a poor soul being put out
of his misery, an execution.
</P>
<P>
   What we all saw _ again _ was an ill-suited poster child for
physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. We saw a ghoulish man on
his own bizarre death march, standing at the forefront of one of
the most sensitive, personal and important issues of our time.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he didn't speak for those of us _ the majority of us,
perhaps _ who want greater exploration of alternatives to
state-sanctioned euthanasia. He didn't discuss the glaring need for
doctors to be more aggressive in treating the pain of the
terminally ill, which in many cases would make suicide a less
desirable option and which in some cases requires lethal doses of
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't we be talking long and loud about palliative sedation?
Shouldn't medical doctors, patient advocates and sick people, lead
the discussion on dying with dignity?
</P>
<P>
   The TV event last Sunday was about the messenger, not the
messages we need to sort through as we care for the terminally ill.
It was more about Jack Kevorkian than a right to die with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It was about one man's cold, calculated means, not the gentle,
respectful end we all desire for ourselves and those we love.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate aftermath of the videotaped death has encouraged
no thoughtful, productive conversation about merciful treatment for
dying patients. Instead, the attention is on CBS' showboating
during ``sweeps'' month, about subpoenas, about Kevorkian thumbing
his nose at Michigan laws and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   It's about him. And his showdown.
</P>
<P>
   When will it be about the rest of us and about our desire to be
respectful to the dying?
</P>
<P>
   Only when we wrest the subject from this man's death grip and
make it our own. &QL;

U.S. NEEDS A NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARS IN THE NOV. 27 ARIZONA REPUBLIC)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For Attorney General Janet Reno, her refusal to name
an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's
fund-raising calls from the White House came down to her belief
that ``the evidence fails to provide any reasonable basis for a
conclusion that the vice president may have lied.''
</P>
<P>
   As if she were anticipating the skeptics, she added an
exclamation point: ``I also find a lack of evidence to reasonably
support a conclusion that he may have had a motive'' to lie, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   We wish she'd listened more closely to the counsel of her FBI
director, Louis Freeh, who suggested Reno name a special
prosecutor. His counsel was bolstered by the appearance of a memo
that contained notes from a Gore aide who said that fund-raising
would be ``65 percent soft, 35 percent hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard money for the Clinton-Gore 1996 re-election effort? Perish
the thought. Probe the larger picture of questionable contributions
to the campaign, including money from the Chinese? Out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision this week hands Gore a new lease on political
life. Still, the temptation, as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
suggests, is to think of this as a political decision.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in another case involving a member of Team Clinton.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is the target of an independent
counsel's probe to try to unearth more compelling and substantial
evidence than the contradictory statements of Babbitt, a former
Arizona governor, and an old friend, Paul Eckstein of Phoenix. At
issue here is an alleged quid pro quo _ the Interior Department's
rejection of a casino application in exchange for campaign
contributions of about $230,000 from five Indian tribes to the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Different targets. Different standards. Different decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for a different attorney general. &QL;

UT'S WILLIAMS WOULD TRADE RUSHING RECORD FOR VICTORY

   Ricky's record run Texas tailback Ricky Williams needs 63 yards
today against Texas A&AMP;M to become the NCAA career rushing leader in
Division I-A. A look at his statistics, compared to record-holder
Tony Dorsett: Player, school (seasons)Carries YardsAvgTDs Tony
Dorsett, Pitt. (1973-76) 1,074 6,082 5.7 55 Ricky Williams, Texas
(1995-98) 967 6,020 6.2 71
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Regardless of the position held by emotional history
buffs, Texas football coach Mack Brown said the call would be a
simple one.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's prospective dilemma concerns today's 10 a.m. game
against Texas A&AMP;M and the accompanying record chase by tailback
Ricky Williams, who needs 63 yards to surpass Tony Dorsett as the
NCAA career rushing leader in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters wanted to know what Brown would do if the Longhorns
(7-3 overall, 5-2 Big 12) found themselves 30 yards from the A&AMP;M
end zone, down by four points, with time for only one play.
Williams, in this scenario, needs only 3 yards to eclipse Dorsett's
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple. You throw it in the end zone and try to win the
game,'' Brown said. ``I plan on being here a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The sooner a first-year coach can log his initial victory over
the Aggies (10-1, 7-0), in Brown's estimation, the better his
chance for long-term staying power. Williams, for the record,
concurs with Brown's decision to leave Dorsett's record unbroken if
it means a chance to walk off Royal-Memorial Stadium with a victory
against the Longhorns' archrivals in his final regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely right,'' Williams said. ``But I don't think
we're going to be that close if I've only got 60 yards that late in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, considering that Williams averages 186.5 yards per
game and the Longhorns usually need every inch to generate enough
points to offset a defense that allows 30.2 points per contest.
Williams' successful pursuit of Dorsett's record is considered so
inevitable that even A&AMP;M players are rooting for him to make
history ... as long as the record doesn't come with a Longhorns'
victory that would eliminate the Aggies' outside hopes for a
national championship. The Aggies are fifth in the Bowl
Championship Series rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Mark McGwire home-run chase in baseball,'' said
A&AMP;M strong safety Rich Coady. ``You want to see him get it, but you
don't want it to ruin your goals. I'll be glad when he gets it. I
just hope we have the lead when he does.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said the Aggies' defense, although ranked
13th nationally against the run (104.8 yards per game), has no
delusions about stifling Williams. In three previous meetings,
Williams has ground out 163.7 yards per start against A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played a lot of guys over the years who got 63 yards on
us, and we still won the game,'' Slocum said. ``He'll get his 63.
We're not putting a lot of stock in keeping him from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Aggies do put stock in is carrying an 11-1 record into
next week's Big 12 championship game against No. 2 Kansas State
(11-0). Texas, meanwhile, hopes to pull a season-ending upset that
could propel the Longhorns to a berth in the Jan. 1 Southwestern
Bell Cotton Bowl. Bowl destinations for Big 12 teams will be
finalized Dec. 6, the day after the league championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials, on the other hand, are making arrangements to
reach closure on Williams' record run. Dorsett, the former Cowboys'
standout who set his NCAA rushing record (6,082 yards) at
Pittsburgh from 1973-76, has accepted an invitation to attend
today's game. He will be accompanied on the Longhorns' sideline by
Earl Campbell, the running back Williams hopes to join on the short
list of Texas' Heisman Trophy winners.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams' record-breaking carry, plans have been made for
the ball to be taken out of play and forwarded, along with
Williams' jersey, to the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame
in South Bend, Ind. The game will not be stopped, said Texas
officials, but a postgame video tribute to Williams will be shown
on the stadium's JumboTron scoreboard, and Brown plans to address
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett is prepared for the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew it would happen some time,'' he said. ``If someone's
going to break it, I'd rather see it done by a class act like
Ricky. You can't help but root for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As his final regular-season game approaches, Williams said he's
more convinced than ever that he made the right decision to return
for his senior season rather than enter the 1998 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been even better than I thought it could be. I
really never imagined myself doing this well,'' Williams said.
``It's great that Tony will be here to watch me break the record.
That's special for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But not as special, in Williams' estimation, as one last victory
over the Aggies. If one must be sacrificed in pursuit of the other,
Williams is willing to fall short in his record run.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's really no reason we can't do both,'' Williams
said.

POLLOCK'S VOLCANIC NEW YORK CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN DOUGLAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking at the Jackson Pollock canvases now on view
at the Museum of Modern Art and thinking about the short, cometlike
arc of Pollock's life and career, one seems to face an inscrutable
proposition from the science of physics: naked energy, mass
transformed by momentum and explosion, an explosion in this case
whose laboratory was the body and psyche of a single person.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's a rough correlation between the initial efforts
to split the atom in the early 1940s, Hiroshima, the nuclear tests
of the late 40s and Pollock's step-by-step breakthrough into what
is perhaps the most radically innovative painting style in the
second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Epic-size canvases, poured, dripped, splattered paint, found
materials and a subject matter electrified by the process of its
own transformation _ designs as disturbing as they are intoxicating
_ serve a vision of overwrought glamour and celestial greed.
Pollock was nothing if not a child of his times.
</P>
<P>
   Abstract Expressionism, the movement of which Pollock, Willem de
Kooning, Mark Rothko and Franz Kline are usually considered the
stars, was sometimes known as the New York School. The Dutch-born
de Kooning said that although he was no longer European, he wasn't
exactly American: ``I am a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothko, born in Russia, came to the city from Portland, Ore.,
and New Haven in the 1920s to ``wander around, bum about'' and
``take advantage of the freedom to develop'' that he believed only
New York offered. Kline couldn't imagine ``working anywhere but New
York.'' Arriving in New York in 1930, Pollock, too, found it
``keener, more demanding, more intense and expansive'' than
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the early 1940s why he didn't work from nature, Pollock
replied, ``I am nature.'' The city, too, refuses to imitate,
becoming itself a new form of nature instead, an indoors that is
also outdoors. Pollock moved to East Hampton in 1945, and in later
years he sometimes found his trips to the city depressing, even
``brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the monumentality of Manhattan, its man-made sublime of
allover, compacted spaces dense with interactive matter and
shifting vistas, was stored in his optic treasury, as integral to
his art as the bare reaches of Long Island or his native Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   New York's long tradition of small manufacturing industries had
left a plethora of lofts begging to be converted into studios
scattered throughout the East and West Villages. With Hitler's
ascent in the 1930s and the fall of Paris, the art capital of the
West, to the Nazis in June 1940, dozens of important emigre artists
made their way to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Here the Museum of Modern Art, founded in 1929, was amassing the
greatest collection of modern art in the world; Paris did not open
the Georges Pompidou Center, a museum exclusively devoted to the
modern period, until 1976. By the 1930's, more than three-fourths
of American artists were already in New York; the Federal Arts
Project of the New Deal allowed them for the first time to make a
living by their painting.
</P>
<P>
   Once the United States entered the war, the Modern enlisted in
the propaganda effort, opening an ``Artists for Victory'' show and
a buy-American-art campaign. Between 1940 and 1946, the number of
galleries in New York grew to 150 from 40.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings by Mondrian and Fernand Leger turned up in fashion
spreads in Harper's Bazaar; Salvador Dali decorated a Bonwit Teller
window. ``Money can be heard crinkling throughout the land,'' an
art dealer, Sam Kootz, observed in 1941. ``All you have to do is
get a new approach.'' By the late 1950s, corporations had
discovered avant-garde art as a growth stock.
</P>
<P>
   Though its popular arts had traveled worldwide by the 1940s,
until the advent of Abstract Expressionism no form of American
elite art commanded international attention.

   At the International Biennale exhibition in Venice in 1950, the
Italian painter Giorgio Morandi surveyed paintings by de Kooning
and Arshile Gorky with keen interest, but when he saw the Pollock
canvases, he exclaimed: ``Ah, ah _ this is new. Vitality, energy _
new!''
</P>
<P>
   Only in America could such art appear. Pollock was the first
poster boy of serious American art, the one who ``broke the ice,''
in de Kooning's phrase, the focus of its esthetic, cultural and
commercial desires.
</P>
<P>
   In a pathbreaking Life article of Aug. 8, 1949, titled ``Jackson
Pollock: Is He the Greatest Living Painter in the United States?,''
Pollock, then 37, was photographed standing before one of his
paintings. Dressed in dark jeans, a work jacket and heavy shoes,
his arms insolently crossed, head cocked, a cigarette in his mouth,
he was the very image of the tough, tortured, ultra-masculine
rebel, indifferent to all, presumably, but the picture behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The critic Clement Greenberg, then Pollock's fervent champion,
said that the contemporary artist existed in ``inconceivable''
isolation and alienation; Pollock was ``Gothic, morbid, extreme,''
he was ``brutal'' as no European artist could be, committed to an
endless task of remorseless innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional modes of representation could not adequately convey
the unprecedented terrors of the modern world; the real artist,
partisans explained, perforce dealt in abstraction. ``If you want
to see a face,'' Pollock once snapped, ``look at one.'' The artist
created not particular portraits or recognizable landscapes, but
eternal, universal ``myths,'' drawn from the depths of the
unconscious, ``tragic and timeless,'' in Rothko's phrase.
</P>
<P>
   These painters belonged to the generation that Amiri Baraka
called the ``last romantics of our age''; the melodramatically
pumped-up exaggerations in which their claims were often couched,
no matter how alien, even distasteful, to post-modern ears, are
part of their art and its continuing appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock won recognition first not only because he was
extraordinarily ambitious and gifted, but also because he was the
most marketable of the group. De Kooning, who spoke with a strong
Dutch accent, didn't become a United States citizen until 1962;
Rothko, who was Jewish, had waited until 1938. The dark, dashing
Kline was of Spanish and German descent. Pollock, however, tall and
fair, born in Cody, Wyo., of Scots-Irish stock, was an all-American
cowboy capturing Manhattan with a lariat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Though he had been a shy, troubled and pampered boy who couldn't
ride a horse or rope a cow, as a young man he spent summers
crisscrossing the continent, hopping freight trains and sleeping
under the stars. De Kooning noted more than once the awful
``burden'' of being American. Cars became Pollock's weapon of
choice; a demon driver, in 1956, at 44, he killed himself (and a
passenger) in a drunken crash in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock appeared ready-made for the needs of a newly imperial
nation, flush with its victories in World War II and finding fresh
ordeals and triumphs in the Cold War that rapidly succeeded it. As
various art critics of the day pointed out, in the totalitarian
Soviet Union artists had to be banal and realist in style,
conformist and upbeat in spirit, or vanish into the gulag.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the United States encouraged liberty of expression,
rewarding precisely those like Pollock who wouldn't or couldn't
adjust, who entertained the darkest of demons as their muse. The
damage that the activities of the House Un-American Activities
Committee and Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy did to the image of America
abroad was offset by the damage that artists like Pollock wreaked
on the social conventions, and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rothko, de Kooning and Kline were all alcoholics, but Pollock
was in a class by himself. At a party in Kline's small, crowded,
smoke-filled apartment, Pollock punched out a window with his fist,
inspiring others to follow his example. They were men acting like
children, de Kooning later said, ``such an emotion, such life,''
such ``desperate joy.''
</P>
<P>
   But others remembered Pollock differently: hideously drunk,
jumping out of a car in midtown at rush hour to play Russian
roulette with the traffic; sitting in the Cedar Tavern, pounding
his fist on the table, crying, ``Why do I suffer like this?''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor put him on tranquilizers in 1948, and for two precious
years he didn't drink. But his manic-depressive temperament surely
required a permanent course of antidepressants and mood
stabilizers, drugs not available in the 1940s. The ``last
romantics'' were also the last unmedicated artists; post-modernism
and psychopharmacology are synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   As the age of machines approached its peak, painting was still
handmade, stubbornly resistant, at least until the advent of Andy
Warhol in the 1960s, to mass production. If the postwar painter, at
once avant-garde and obsolete, wanted to sell a new kind of art, he
needed a concept, ideas about modernity and words to put them in.
De Kooning, a student of Wittgenstein, spoke about painting with
elegant sophistication, as did Rothko, a devotee of Kierkegaard and
Nietzsche.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pollock's intuitive gifts were legendary _ ``three words
and he knew the whole story,'' a friend said _ he was subject to
agonies of self-consciousness; he read little and talked less.
</P>
<P>
   Exquisitely understanding and kind to children and animals, he
came at adults with terse, in-your-face questions: ``Who are you?
What are you involved with?'' Profanity was as necessary a
shorthand to him as to a Hemingway hero.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, his wife, the painter Lee Krasner, sometimes
filled in for him, and others supplied the titles for those of his
paintings that were named rather than numbered. To explain ``She
Wolf'' (1943), his most-discussed early work, was to destroy it, he
said: ``A painting has a life of its own. I try to let it live.''
The hyperactivity of his paint is articulation _ the paint is
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock was the first American painter to receive full-blown
media treatment, a shock that this media-saturated age must strain
even to imagine. The year after the Life article, Hans Namuth did a
series of photographs and short films (now on view as part of the
Modern's exhibition) showing Pollock in the act of painting.
</P>
<P>
   The surface to be covered lies flat on the ground. Pollock moves
around its four edges, occasionally going into the arena of the
painting, pouring the paint (an industrial rather than an
art-supply brand) straight from the can, wielding hardened brushes
to get the tighter delineations that will lace the painting into a
centerless yet stunning coherence, adding detritus (shells, coins,
wire) to the mix, pausing occasionally to ``get acquainted,'' in
his phrase, with what he has done, then gardening the painting
again, his forearm and hand, taut with precision, poised above it,
choreographing its patterns in the air. The method, critics noted,
was the content.
</P>
<P>
   Photography and film require no explanation from their subject,
nothing except the willingness to be reproduced. Pollock on camera
suggests the artist as athlete and actor; the painting and the
artist's body mate in a ritual as cerebral as it is sensual.
</P>
<P>
   But Pollock painting is quintessential media material precisely
because it is an extraordinarily private act disturbingly exposed
to public view. Bending to the ground, his back hunched, his face
agonized in its concentration no matter how graceful and controlled
his movements, Pollock conjures up images not only of dancers but
also of Hugo's Quasimodo, tending the bells he believes so much
more beautiful than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Artists can be monsters, and monsters negotiate the line between
public and private differently; they know that we do and don't want
to see them with equal force.
</P>
<P>
   After the last shoot in November 1950, Pollock and Namuth went
back to Pollock's farmhouse, where Pollock poured himself a glass
of whisky, his first in two years, saying, ``Damn it, we need
it!,'' then got violently drunk, upending the carefully laid dinner
table and walking out the door. Maybe the ``natives'' are right, he
told a friend; whoever takes your picture steals your soul. With
fame, ``you're not your own you'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   During the last alcohol-drenched years of his life, Pollock
produced several masterpieces, most notably ``Blue Poles'' (1952)
and ``The Deep'' (1953), but the astonishing flood of energy that
produced ``No. 32, 1950,'' ``One: No. 31, 1950,'' ``Autumn Rhythm''
and ``Lavender Mist'' in the space of a year was spent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Is it entirely coincidence that in 1955 and 1956, as exhibitions
and sales of his work multiplied, when at last he could have sold
whatever he did, he ceased to paint altogether? At the center of
``The Deep'' appears a melodramatic rift, a black abyss framed by
jagged, snow-encrusted ice, precise as an unwanted look into the
bowels of nonbeing.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock's awkward, fumbled early drawings (also on view at the
Modern) testify that he was not a skilled draftsman. He didn't do
preliminary sketches for his later work, going straight to the
canvas and working in great bursts of productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The gigantic ``Mural'' of 1943, a stampede of interlacing forms
and colors, took less than 24 hours to paint. His art was a
one-shot venture, a performance requiring the utmost discipline; if
he ``lost contact with the painting,'' in his words, he had to
start again.
</P>
<P>
   His only ticket was an instant pass to the center; denied it, he
stood balked and lost, stranded on the outskirts of the town he
wished to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Flame,'' an early work from the late 1930s, licking
tongues of red, white, yellow, brown and black build and interweave
in dense, rhythmic motions, devouring landscapes, people, the
archaic shapes Pollock loved and the invisible universe within him.
</P>
<P>
   What burns can't be distinguished from what is burnt. Jean
Cocteau, asked what he would save if his house were on fire,
replied, ``The fire.'' Nobody escapes Pollock's bonfire. Standing
before his paintings, who would want to?

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (italics)Here is a selection of sites in Manhattan that were
connected with the lives of the Abstract Expressionists:(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   1. ART STUDENTS LEAGUE, 215 West 57th Street. Tuition-free art
school, established in 1875 and still open. Mark Rothko, 20,
wandered in to meet a friend in 1923, saw the nude model the class
was drawing and decided that this is ``the life for me.'' Jackson
Pollock, 18, began classes here in 1930 with the American Realist
Thomas Hart Benton, who told him: ``You've the stuff, old kid. All
you have to do is keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   2. 46 EAST EIGHTH STREET. Pollock lived here with various family
members (at $35 a month) and then with Lee Krasner, from 1933 until
1945. In December 1943, working on the mural commissioned by the
bohemian heiress Peggy Guggenheim, Pollock had to tear down a wall
to accommodate its size (8 feet 11 inches by 19 feet 9 inches). It
was ``exciting as all hell,'' he wrote his brother. In 1945, he
moved to 830 Fireplace Road, Springs, East Hampton, attracting
other artists to Long Island, though he continued to spend time in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   3. 5 WEST 19TH STREET. Experimental Workshop of the Mexican
mural painter David Alfaro Siquieros. Pollock participated in April
1936, learning to work with lacquers, Duco paint, airbrushes and
spray guns. Siquieros encouraged his students to pour, drip,
splatter and hurl paint at the canvas; he left to fight in the
Spanish Civil War in late 1936.
</P>
<P>
   4. 314 WEST 75TH STREET. Rothko lived in the basement in the
early 1930s; his apartment once served as a dog kennel. He
sometimes slept in the bathtub, or in subways. Rothko believed that
poverty is part of the alienated artist's consecration for his
task.
</P>
<P>
   5. 143 WEST 22nd STREET. Willem de Kooning's loft in the 1930s
and 40s. When his wife, Elaine, moved in, in 1943, he built a
smaller loft for her in the center, white outside and pink within.
A confessed ``clean bug,'' who liked everything ``light and
bright,'' he washed the apartment top to bottom every Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   6. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK. Rothko and de Kooning first met here
on a bench one evening in the 1930s, while taking a rare break from
their work. De Kooning didn't speak, lest he be thought a
homosexual. ``Nice evening,'' Rothko finally said, and they
discovered they were both painters.
</P>
<P>
   7. ART OF THIS CENTURY GALLERY, 30 West 57th Street. In 1942,
Peggy Guggenheim opened her avant-garde, surrealist, egg-shaped
gallery, designed to achieve a ``continuous flow.'' The floors were
turquoise, the paintings unframed. Pollock's first one-man show was
held here, in November 1943. Guggenheim's lipstick shade was
``Eternal Wound.'' (The gallery closed in 1947.)
</P>
<P>
   8. 52 EAST NINTH STREET. Franz Kline had his studio on the top
floor beginning in 1944. The building once belonged to Lillian
Russell, and a friend noted that ``its winding staircase looked
exactly like her.'' Kline had his great breakthrough into black in
1950. He was evicted in 1953 when the building was torn down.
</P>
<P>
   9. BETTY PARSONS GALLERY, 15 East 57th Street. Parsons, a
socialite and an artist, opened her gallery in 1946. She exhibited
Pollock, Rothko, Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still. ``I knew that
my artists saw into the future,'' she said. In the 1950s, many of
the painters defected to the Sidney Janis Gallery (in the same
building). Janis could offer them more money. (The Betty Parsons
Gallery no longer exists; the Janis Gallery is now at 110 West 57th
Street.)
</P>
<P>
   10. CEDAR TAVERN, Eighth Street and University Place. (The
present Cedar Tavern is a few blocks north of this site, on
University Place.) The artists' stomping and drinking ground in the
late 1940s and 50s, with pea-green walls but no decor or music, and
smelling of roughhouse masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people were the style,'' said Pollock's lover Ruth
Kligman; Pollock, drunken or sober, was king, ``the greatest of the
matadors.'' In the later 50s, Kline drank here with his friend Jack
Kerouac.
</P>
<P>
   11. ARTISTS' CLUB, 39 East Eighth Street. The place where New
York artists and intellectuals mixed in the late 1940s and 50s,
sponsoring panels with John Cage, Edwin Denby, Hannah Arendt and
Frank O'Hara. Members, women included, drank as much as they
talked. ``What happened is that we turned into alcoholics,'' Elaine
de Kooning later realized. Pollock seldom came; Robert Motherwell
called it ``de Kooning Party Headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   12. 242 WEST 14TH STREET. Kline found a studio on the second
floor in 1958. He lamented the changes in the Village: the Italian
section had been replaced by modern apartment buildings, he
complained, and downtown was now indistinguishable from uptown. He
bought a black Thunderbird with the revenue from his paintings,
opened its hood and discovered that the engine looked ``just like a
washing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   13. FOUR SEASONS, in the Seagram Building, 375 Park Avenue, at
52nd( Street. Rothko painted 30 murals for the new restaurant in
1958 but withdrew from the project, returning his commission
determined that its rich patrons ``will never look at a painting of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   14. 118 EAST 98TH STREET. Rothko, now worth millions, moved here
in 1961. Alcoholic and tormented, he killed himself in his 69th
Street studio in February 1970, slashing his veins and leaving no
suicide note. ``Silence is so accurate,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   15. 242 LEXINGTON AVENUE, near 34th Street. Andy Warhol lived
here, with his mother, from 1953 until 1959 and laid siege to the
New York art world. He decided to invent Pop Art because ``I hate
Abstract Expressionism.'' The apartment was decorated in white,
with wicker and twig furniture, multiple televisions and a large
tiger skin rug. Warhol claimed to live on candy and cake.
</P>
<P>
   16. 231 EAST 47TH STREET. Warhol's Factory grabbed the spotlight
in 1964 with a huge ``silver party.'' Reynolds Wrap was everywhere;
the floors and the pay phone were painted silver. Warhol liked
silver because it suggested astronauts and narcissism. In 1974, the
Factory moved to 860 Broadway at Union Square, as Andy Warhol
Enterprises. ``The new art is really a business,'' he commented. In
East Hampton, at a party given by Larry Rivers in late 1968, a
drunken de Kooning refused to shake Warhol's hand. ``You're a
killer of art,'' he said. A few years later, Warhol planned a movie
about Pollock, starring Jack Nicholson, but the project was
unrealized.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a selection of books about Jackson Pollock and other
Abstract Expressionist painters in New York: &QL; 
 &QL;

   ``THE CULTURE OF SPONTANEITY: IMPROVISATION AND THE ARTS IN
POSTWAR AMERICA,'' by Daniel Belgrad. University of Chicago Press,
1998. $29. A broad and intelligent synthesis of the ethos of
spontaneity, which links Pollock with be-bop, the Beats, Zen
Buddhism, Black Mountain poets and Jungian psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``HOW NEW YORK STOLE THE IDEA OF MODERN ART: ABSTRACT
EXPRESSIONISM, FREEDOM AND THE COLD WAR,'' by Serge Guilbaut,
translated by Arthur Goldhammer. University of Chicago Press, 1983.
$13.95. The controversial but indispensable brilliant historical
analysis of how Abstract Expressionism was co-opted for American
propaganda purposes after World War II. The author's passionate
concern for Pollock shines through.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FATE OF GESTURE: JACKSON POLLOCK AND POSTWAR AMERICAN
ART,'' by Carter Ratcliffe. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1996. $35. A
smart, generous-hearted study of Pollock's art as part of the

including Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and Robert Smithson.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TURNING POINT: THE ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISTS AND THE
TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN ART,'' by April Kingsley. Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1992. $30. This focuses on 1950, the annus mirabile of

<P>
   ``JACKSON POLLOCK: AN AMERICAN SAGA,'' by Steven Neifeh and
Gregory White Smith. Woodward/White, 1989. $27.95. Exhaustively
researched, compelling biography, marred only by the author's
contention that Pollock was a closeted homosexual _ an intensely
troubled heterosexual identity does not automatically translate
into homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``JACKSON POLLOCK,'' by Kirk Varnedoe with Pepe Karmel. Museum
of Modern Art, 1998. $35. The catalog for the museum's current
exhibition is a marvel of accurate, balanced scholarship, with

   ((There was never a king like Solomon,
</P>
<P>
   Not since the world began
</P>
<P>
   For Solomon talked to a butterfly
</P>
<P>
   As a man would talk to a man.))
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are plenty of Solomonic exchanges to be seen at
a butterfly exhibition that opens Friday at the American Museum of
Natural History, mostly between delighted children and the
magnificent insects that have found their fingers a useful perch.
</P>
<P>
   The butterflies hatch daily from pupae shipped to the museum
from butterfly farms in Florida and Costa Rica. One morning this
week, two queens and a monarch butterfly were holding court in the
puparium where visitors can watch the miniature miracle of a
butterfly spreading its wings for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the show are the morphos, large butterflies that
seem nothing special when at rest because their outerwear is of an
unassuming brown. But when they unfold their wings, they display an
iridescent blue of startling intensity. The morphos are joined by a
supporting cast of 39 other species, making up a troupe of about
400 butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has created a home for the butterflies by
constructing a vivarium, an enclosed habitat, in its hall of
oceanic birds. Visitors step from the dour panoramas of storm-swept
seas to a bright patch of electronically sun-drenched forest so hot
and humid that most people will want to shed coats and jackets
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Butterflies are the dinosaurs of the insect world _ crowd
pleasers that catch attention, even though in the entomologist's
eye they are no more important than their less showy cousins, the
myriad ant and beetle species that keep tropical forests in good
working order.
</P>
<P>
   Nature may be red in tooth and claw, but in the swirl of pastels
on a butterfly's wing, evolution's design studios seem to be purely
at play, throwing off one stunning pattern after another for the
joy of creation. Alas, this is not the case at all. The bright
colors of a butterfly's wing are a danger sign. Most butterflies
are poisonous, having absorbed as caterpillars the toxins that
their food plants create to fend off browsers. Those gorgeous hues
and conspicuous patterns are a blunt message to birds: ``Eat me and
have the worst stomachache of your life.'' Nature at its most
beautiful is most venomous.
</P>
<P>
   The morphos' iridescent blue seems to have a different
rationale, however, one that is somehow connected with male-to-male
interaction. An old collector's trick, writes Dr. Philip J. DeVries
in his book on the butterflies of Costa Rica, is to wave a blue
silk scarf while walking down a forest trail. The female morphos,
many of which are brown, will ignore the lure but the patrolling
males will come fluttering down to inspect it.
</P>
<P>
   Another Costa Rican species in the exhibition is the zebra
longwing, a member of a striking family of butterflies whose
caterpillars feed on passionflowers. The male zebras are so
passionate and impatient that they will mate with a female before
she has even left her chrysalis. After mating, the female protects
herself from further attention by wafting from organs known as
stink clubs, an antiaphrodisiac scent that repels new suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the museum has been unable to show the
butterflies going through their life cycles. One reason is that the
exhibition lasts only until the end of February. Another is that
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which regulates butterfly
houses, forbids the use of the insects' natural food plants. The
department fears that foreign butterflies, if allowed to breed in
the United States, might introduce diseases that could spread among
native species.
</P>
<P>
   The butterflies in the vivarium seem healthy enough. But some,
deprived of their familiar food by U.S.D.A. fiat, appear a little
forlorn and disoriented. A few ignore the potted plants and palms
and roost disdainfully on the ceiling. It is not a natural
experience for them. Still, they are blissfully free of predators,
they have as much rotten fruit and nectar as any butterfly could
need, and they are performing an important educational mission by
showing urban visitors the biological riches from the suddenly
imperiled forests that have been the butterflies' homes for the
last 100 million years.

   Visitors are shown a lively display of butterfly lore while
approaching the entrance of the vivarium. Particularly striking is
an array of the butterfly species in the Dzanga-Sanga (pronounced
zonga-songa) rain forest of the Central African Republic. The
region is not some hot spot of butterfly speciation, as the visitor
might suppose, but just a locale chosen because it is featured in
another exhibition, on biodiversity, at the museum. Dr. Eric
Quinter, an entomology curator, selected the butterflies from the
museum's large collection.
</P>
<P>
   The vivarium was designed by David Harvey, the museum's director
of exhibitions. An earlier attempt to open the exhibition had to be
postponed when the butterflies died, perhaps because of adverse
reactions to the plants they were offered. ``The art of doing this
is to give them plants they like but don't love,'' Harvey said,
referring to the agriculture department's ban on plants the
butterflies could breed on. ``We had to keep changing the mix of
plants until we got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The vivarium is small and intimate, and is notable for its lack
of ropes or other physical barriers to separate people from the
exhibits. ``We have to trust people, we are not taking the
heavy-handed approach,'' Harvey said. At least during previews, no
one trampled the flower beds or tried to catch the butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim Miller, a curator of entomology, helped prepare the
exhibition. His specialty is moths, although he studies a
particular family of tropical, day-flying moths that he says are as
brightly colored as ``little jewels.'' There are many more moth
species than butterflies, but moths get less respect because they
are mostly drab and nocturnal. Butterflies are thought to have
evolved from moths more than 100 million years ago, though experts
dispute which family of moths is their closest living relative.
``Butterflies are just a moth group, in a sense,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Most things in a museum, however artfully displayed, are dead.
Nothing can compete with a living butterfly for conveying
evolution's design skills. And it doesn't take the wisdom of
Solomon to understand the message that these delicate creatures
bring from their fragile homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Butterfly Conservatory: Tropical Butterflies Alive in
Winter'' opens Friday and runs through Feb. 28 at the American
Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street. Museum

`THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND': FUN, GAMES AND DEATH, IN UGANDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicholas Garrigan, the willfully oblivious hero of Giles Foden's
first novel, is a nightmare version of Forrest Gump transplanted to
Uganda: he is a witness to many of the bloody atrocities committed
during the 1970s rule of Ugandan President Idi Amin, the confidant
of both Amin and the British consul, a witness to the Entebbe
hijacking and hostage rescue and an unwitting accomplice in the
bombing of a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last King of Scotland'' (which was published to
considerable acclaim in Britain earlier this year) is an
uncomfortable amalgam of black comedy and historical tragedy _ the
sort of thing you'd get if you took Evelyn Waugh's ``Black
Mischief'' and William Boyd's ``Good Man in Africa'' and set them
against the backdrop of a real-life mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a highly readable but troubling novel that
inadvertently trivializes the plight of the estimated 500,000
people who died in Uganda during Amin's eight-year reign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Garrigan, we learn, is a Scottish physician,
posted by the British Ministry of Health in a remote Ugandan
village to work in a clinic. Through a chance encounter, he becomes
Amin's personal physician, a job that will make him privy to many
of the heinous acts committed during the dictator's reign.
</P>
<P>
   As the novel's narrator, Garrigan initially comes across as a
bumbling but likable twit: a self-absorbed fellow looking for women
and a good time. Still, Garrigan readily admits that he has a
``closed-in, oblivious temperament,'' and he soon falls under the
spell of Idi Amin, whom he likens to ``a being out of Greek myth.''
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Amin has been described by journalists as a
larger-than-life figure, capable of exuding childlike geniality one
minute, irrational rage the next, and the portrait of the ruler
that Foden, a staff writer for The Guardian, draws in this novel
clearly owes a debt to such descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Foden's Amin is a monster of egotism, declaring himself ``the
savior of Africa'' and the ``most powerful figure in the world.''
He boasts of cannibalism. He absurdly maintains, ``Anything that is
done in my name, it is the right thing. Any bad thing done, it is
by those who are disobeying me.'' And when asked about atrocities
committed by his soldiers, he replies, ``There have been a few
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because we see Amin in this novel through the star-struck eyes
of Nick Garrigan, however, the comic, rather than monstrous,
aspects of his personality tend to be italicized. This Amin drives
a red Maserati and swans about Uganda, dressed in ridiculous
costumes: full Highland dress, complete with kilt, spats and
brogans; or an electric-blue safari suit with a matching sombrero.
He even rigs up an elaborate machine that allows him to make a
grand entrance by rising from the midst of a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Foden's Amin captivates Garrigan, who soon admits to feeling ``a
sneaking sense of affection towards him.'' Garrigan accepts a used
van from his new boss, using it to drive around Kampala to visit
bars and clubs. And when his affair with the British ambassador's
wife fails to ignite, he finds comfort in Amin's philosophical
words about romance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite knowing that the dictator thinks ``Hitler was right
about the Jews,'' despite seeing the hacked-up body of Amin's
unfaithful wife, Garrigan persists in being his friend. There was,
he concedes to himself, ``something in me that actually  &UR; liked &LR;  the
man, monster though he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrigan decides to leave Uganda only after Amin turns on him
and has his British passport revoked. He realizes that he has been
corrupted by Amin, that he has, in a sense, become Amin, ``a
suppurating beast, someone with a smell of evil about his person.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrigan's story is presumably meant to make the point that one
cannot be an innocent bystander when appalling crimes are being
committed, that bystanders who ratify such acts by refusing to
dissent are morally contaminated themselves. By the end of the
book, Garrigan is saying ``I merely did my job,'' echoing those
Germans who aided Hitler by shutting their eyes to his crimes. His
private feelings of guilt have also given way to the conviction
that he has put Amin's world ``with all its blood and crazed
illusions'' behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the reader remains mystified by Garrigan's bizarre
affection for Amin in the face of so many horrors: his suggestion
that his own Scottish heritage made him susceptible to Amin's
claims to be the ``last King of the Scots'' remains absurd, as is
his suggestion that Amin's charisma is nearly impossible to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the comic tone of much of this novel overshadows the
reality of the horrors actually committed in the Uganda of Idi
Amin. Although Foden does a vivid job of describing the decapitated
bodies, the mutilated corpses, the unspeakable crimes committed by
Amin's henchmen, such scenes essentially become a suspenseful
backdrop for Garrigan's bumbling adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through ``The Last King of Scotland,'' one of Foden's
characters says of Idi Amin's antics: ``It would be quite funny if
it weren't for the thousands of people who are dying. All these
silly larks of his, it's like pornography. If you laugh at it,
you're stepping over the corpses.'' The same might well be said of
this clever, fluently written _ but ultimately perverse _ novel.

POP MUSIC TO DECLINE BY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention fellow dinosaurs, old fogies and senescent
Beatlemaniacs. If you can hardly find any music on the radio to
listen to nowadays and the bouncy toy sounds of Brandy and Monica
fighting over a boy don't speak to your soul the way Joni
Mitchell's or Bob Dylan's records once did, there is still pop
music being made that is worth your attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is even made by musicians in their 20s. And some of
it (although not much) is even very popular.
</P>
<P>
   That music is not the weepy bombast of Celine Dion or the
generic country-pop of Shania Twain, two talented mass-appeal
singers whose songs and productions reflect a glitzy late-90s,
corporate impersonality. Nor is it the Three Tenors peddling ersatz
high culture to stadium-size audiences.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly not Barry Manilow delivering a shallow,
emotionally vapid tribute to Frank Sinatra on his newest album,
``Manilow Sings Sinatra'' (Arista) or Neil Diamond pompously
trampling over classic movie songs on his new two-disk recording,
``The Movie Album: As Time Goes By'' (Columbia).
</P>
<P>
   Unpretentious, nondisposable pop has always been hard to find,
but it's a little harder to come by nowadays than it used to be.
Eons ago, it seems, pop music was the medium adopted by baby
boomers for sharing their feelings about sex, politics,
relationships and society.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music mattered. With the rise of MTV, television swallowed
up pop and regurgitated it as passive couch entertainment. Now
computers are supplanting television as the hot center of youth
culture. The world is a chat room in which you can download
fragments of the new Jewel and Alanis Morisette albums and sample
them like dabs of cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, it seemed possible that the American
songwriters who came of age in the 1960s and 70s would develop into
grand old sages of rock-and-roll and that their audiences would
grow old with them, continuing a shared conversation about growing
up, learning hard lessons and facing mortality.
</P>
<P>
   That expectation proved wrong. Once it had grown up, the
rock-and-roll generation didn't need its pop stars to be role
models anymore. It was too busy making money and creating babies to
keep up with heroes who themselves seemed less heroic as they aged
and sobered up.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the performers who were supposed to remain
beacons of wisdom and enlightenment in an extended rock-and-roll
community (with a few scattered exceptions) lost courage. Fame
tends to be addictive and toxic. Once it's attained, holding onto
it becomes an end in itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a youth-obsessed culture, pop stars are the last people in
the world who want to be viewed as middle-aged. Most feel compelled
to eke out the last drop of youth-culture adoration before their
fan bases evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Even pop stars who are now in their 30s are busy cultivating
``younger'' sounds. On much of Whitney Houston's new album, ``My
Love Is Your Love'' (Arista), one of pop's most powerful balladeers
has suddenly turned girlish, reining in her majestic gospel power
to pose as Brandy and Monica's sassy peer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the old dinosaurs roll on. Joni Mitchell's hugely
disappointing new album, ``Taming the Tiger'' (Reprise), may not
have a fraction of the immediacy, depth and melodicism of her best
1970s work, but the music has some texture and the voice sounds
lived in.
</P>
<P>
   Probably this year's best ``new'' album of adult pop music was
recorded 32 years ago: ``Bob Dylan Live 1966'' (Columbia), a
two-disk ``authorized bootleg.''
</P>
<P>
   So here follows one veteran critic's annotated personal roundup
of favorite adult pop albums of 1998. Omitted is Dylan's album
because it consists of old material. Except for the top two _ Audra
McDonald's ``Way Back to Paradise'' and ``The McGarrigle Hour'' _
the rest are listed alphabetically. (CDs are $17 to $18 for a
single disk to $25 for a two-CD set.)
</P>
<P>
   AUDRA McDONALD: ``WAY BACK TO PARADISE'' (Nonesuch). The debut
recording of the 28-year-old vocal phenomenon who has won three
Tony Awards just barely qualifies as a pop album since most of the
material hovers on the thin line between Broadway and opera.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making a conventional debut by singing Broadway
standards, Ms. McDonald boldly introduces recent work by six rising
young composers who represent musical theater's best hope of
transcending the schlock of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Frank Wildhorn and
Disney's second-string songwriting teams. Whether any of these
composers make it on Broadway, however, depends on whether their
work strikes a populist chord.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes one genius, Adam Guettel (the grandson of
Richard Rodgers), whose deeply romantic pop music roams all over
the landscape, from Samuel Barber to gospel, and several others who
over time might prove to be equally important.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ian Gordon's settings of texts by Langston Hughes and
James Agee, like Guettel's three contributions, are accessible,
moving art songs. The chattiest numbers are by Michael John
LaChuisa, who is composing a musical, ``Marie Christine,''
specifically for Ms. McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald's singing is magnificent: highly dramatic,
tasteful, psychologically acute, heart-rending. Although
operatically trained, the mezzo-soprano thinks nothing of slipping
into gospel or into speech-song or into hard belting when the song
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Her casual breaking down of musical categories, both vocally and
in her choice of material, indicates the affinity a new generation
of formally trained singers has for nonclassical music. Everything
about the record is extremely encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE McGARRIGLE HOUR'' (Hannibal/Rykodisc). The wonderful
21-song collection is a kind of summary statement by North
America's leading folk music dynasty, whose senior members are now
in their 50s. They include the French-Canadian sisters Kate and
Anna McGarrigle; Kate's former husband, Loudon Wainwright III,
their two children, Rufus and Martha Wainwright, and assorted other
relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The album is a kind of marathon home musicale in which they sing
each other's songs as well as personal favorites by others, from
Irving Berlin's ``What'll I Do?'' to Cole Porter's
``Allez-Vous-En.'' Even the vintage Broadway tunes shed their urban
glamour to become bare-bones reflections on life, love and loss,
sung plainly without a trace of self-pity by the McGarrigles'
lovely homespun voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McGarrigle Hour'' conveys a powerful sense of the extended
family as a vital, complicated organism nurturing itself through
music, the young and the middle-aged singing side by side, all
allowing their blemishes and quirks to show. The folksy purity of
the music along with a sense of these intertwining creative lives
offers a realism rarely found in pop. Note: Loudon and Rufus
Wainwright each have fine solo albums in this roundup. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are the other recommended albums:
</P>
<P>
   ANDY BEY: ``SHADES OF BEY'' (Evidence). The little-known jazz
baritone has a voice so cool and mellow you want to take a dip in
it. Dorival Caymmi's ``Like a Lover'' (with lyrics by Alan and
Marilyn Bergman), crooned to a softly strummed guitar, sets the
dreamy mood.
</P>
<P>
   ERIC CLAPTON: ``PILGRIM'' (Reprise). The best songs on this
bleakly eloquent album of orchestrated blues meditations express a
choked-up grief and despair that slices to the bone. The year's
most underrated album. Killer cuts: ``Pilgrim'' and ``Inside of
Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ADAM COHEN'' (Columbia). The debut album of Leonard Cohen's
son Adam reveals him to be a chip off the old block in his grimly
perceptive evisceration of troubled sexual relationships and
rivalries. A promising beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ELVIS COSTELLO WITH BURT BACHARACH: ``PAINTED FROM MEMORY''
(Mercury). The collaboration on a suite of lovelorn ballads with
music (lavishly arranged) by Bacharach and lyrics by Costello, who
sings them in an anguished geeky voice, powerfully weds an airy 60s
pop romanticism with a lingering post-punk orneriness. Killer cut:
``God Give Me Strength.''
</P>
<P>
   SHERYL CROW: ``THE GLOBE SESSIONS'' (A&AMP;M). These tough, knotty
well-made observational songs sung with sinewy bravado (tinged with
tenderness) find a bracing balance between vocal spontaneity and
solid song craft.
</P>
<P>
   ARETHA FRANKLIN: ``A ROSE IS STILL A ROSE'' (Arista). In songs
written and produced by such hip-hop luminaries as Lauryn Hill and
Sean (Puffy) Combs, soul, hip-hop and funk collide happily. If the
material is uneven, the queen of soul is in great voice, not having
sounded this good since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   HERBIE HANCOCK: ``GERSHWIN'S WORLD'' (Verve). Hancock's
triumphantly sweeping overview of George Gershwin and his
influences features an all-star cast that ranges from Stevie Wonder
(``St. Louis Blues'') to a craggy-voiced Joni Mitchell (``The Man I
Love''). Hancock plays a movement from Ravel's Piano Concerto in G.
Comprehensive and deep.
</P>
<P>
   LYLE LOVETT: ``STEP INSIDE THIS HOUSE'' (Curb/MCA). The two-disk
anthology of Lovett's favorite Texas songwriters (including Townes
Van Zandt, Vince Bell, Guy Clark and Willis Allan Ramsey, among
many others) is a labor of love that is beautifully sung, if a
trifle bland.
</P>
<P>
   MADONNA: ``RAY OF LIGHT'' (Maverick/Warner Brothers) This
transcendent semi-electronic disco album matches the best Donna
Summer in atmospheric intensity. Madonna's explorations of
spirituality feel sincere if a little awkward. But the spectacle of
the 40-year-old pop star still refusing to play it safe is
heartening.
</P>
<P>
   BETTE MIDLER: ``BATHHOUSE BETTY'' (Warner Brothers) Ms. Midler's
best and most varied album since her 1972 debut, ``The Divine Miss
M,'' captures its prototype's exuberance but in a more restrained,
grown-up 90s way.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIE NELSON: ``TEATRO'' (Island). The producer Daniel Lanois,
the master of evocative rustic sound effects, helps enhance
Nelson's well-earned aura of Texas sage on a collection of old and
recent Nelson true-grit ballads. Emmylou Harris provides haunting
rough-edged backup vocals.
</P>
<P>
   BONNIE RAITT: ``FUNDAMENTAL'' (Capitol). Ms. Raitt, teamed with
the producer Mitchell Froom, draws back into a spare bluesy groove.
The singing is tough and convincing. Killer cut: John Hiatt's
devastating ``Lovers Will.''
</P>
<P>
   SEAL: ``HUMAN BEING'' (Warner Brothers). Multi-layered,
impassioned, almost symphonic in places, Seal's third album broods
about the end of a relationship and its cosmic implications. Trevor
Horn's astonishingly rich production makes up for the vagueness of
some of the lyrics. Killer cut: ``No Easy Way.''
</P>
<P>
   DUNCAN SHEIK: ``HUMMING'' (Atlantic). Sheik's
Buddhist-influenced reflections are gently sung and exquisitely
arranged in an orchestral style that recalls Nick Drake's early
records inflected with George Harrison-style psychedelia. Luscious.
</P>
<P>
   ELLIOTT SMITH: ``XO'' (Dreamworks). While the bright, lush
production of the first major-label album for a rising
singer-songwriter recalls the heyday of the Beatles and the Beach
Boys, Smith's introspective songs and low-key delivery pull
intriguingly against the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   LOUDON WAINWRIGHT 3D: ``LITTLE SHIP'' (Charisma). Just because
the songs' middle-aged growing pains are expressed comically
doesn't mean they don't hurt. Wainwright imparts bitter truths and
makes you laugh at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``RUFUS WAINWRIGHT'' (Dreamworks). Once you get used to his
marble-mouthed diction, you find delight in the lavishly arranged
folk-pop songs by Loudon Wainwright's gay son. These elliptical,
anguished, funny, ornate reflections on family ties and the painful
comedy of (usually) unrequited love are well worth studying.
</P>
<P>
   LUCINDA WILLIAMS: ``CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD'' (Mercury).
Southern country-rock realism constructed so artfully it sounds
artless. These timeless vignettes evoke people and places with the
same pungency as great short stories. Ms. Williams embodies a
literary and musical esthetic that might be called essentialist in
its leanness and precision of inflection.

OF SOTHEBY'S AND SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New Mexico)  (js) 
 BY WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people wonder whether there are too many new
saints under consideration these days. There are also hundreds of
saints most of us don't know about, like St. Rosalie of Palermo,
the protector against plague, smallpox, typhoid and earthquakes;
the Holy Child of Atocha, the patron of travelers who risk capture
by non-Christian enemies, and St. Isidore the Plowman, the patron
of rain and good crops. Stanley Marcus' collection of carved images
of these saints and others, made in the 1800s by Hispanic
colonists, native New Mexicans and American Indians in the
Southwest, are coming up for auction at Sotheby's next week, and
they give new meaning to the term ``folk art.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale, on Dec. 2, consists of 159 items from the Marcus
collection of Southwestern art, and is part of Sotheby's sale of
``Important American Indian Art.'' Marcus and his wife, Linda,
bought the works _ American Indian, New Mexican Devotional and
Latin American _ for their home in Santa Fe, N.M. They are now
selling the house and the collection because Marcus, 93, is finding
it difficult to live at the high altitude.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Marcus said he started buying bultos,
three-dimensional carvings of saints, on his first trip to New
Mexico in 1937, a decade after Mable Dodge Lujan, a socially
prominent Easterner, established an art colony in Taos, N.M. But
there was little interest in such art in this country then.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, bultos were $40 to $60 apiece,'' he said. And
while he traveled the world buying the most sophisticated,
high-style couture for Neiman-Marcus, his father's department
store, he was also developing a taste for native folk art.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of how bultos came to be carved in New Mexico: founded
in 1598, New Mexico was a frontier ruled by Spain until 1821.
``After the Christian conquistadors conquered New Mexico, they
brought in a carver with models,'' Marcus said. ``The Indians saw
them and then carved their own religious sculptures.''
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures were not just for decoration. ``They were
devotional objects,'' Marcus said. ``They were daily companions to
the farmers and ranchers. They helped them through their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to understand the importance of the works is to
read Harriet Doerr's beautifully written novella ``Stones for
Ibarra,'' which recounts a young American woman's life in rural
Mexico and her confrontation with the faith of the local people.
</P>
<P>
   An essay in the catalog for the Al Luckett Jr. sale at Sotheby's
in January by Larry Frank, the author of ``New Kingdom of the
Saints: Religious Art of New Mexico, 1780-1907,'' also explores the
role of bultos. Frank wrote that the saints were ``not worshiped by
Catholics like Jesus and Mary but rather they are revered and
esteemed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like miscreant children they can be naughty and whimsical
because they do not always behave properly,'' he continued. ``They
simply do not grant everyone's petition.'' But Frank said, ``As
members of an extended family, they are accepted as companions,
supporters and benefactors along with their foibles and
consequently they are loved.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like the antics of Zeus and the Olympian gods.
</P>
<P>
   For Marcus, the bultos carry a special appeal. ``There's a
sincerity to them that is moving,'' he said. ``They are more naive
than the bultos of any other culture in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus has studied his collection with the help of dealers. Some
of the bultos in it are quite primitive and others more refined.
``Most of the early carvers have now been identified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more primitive bultos for sale is carved polychromed
wood thought to be a representation of St. Raymond of the Unborn,
the patron of pregnant women and women in childbirth. This saint,
in long robe and red cloak, has clenched fists that may have once
held implements. The sale catalog says that women giving birth
would pray a novena to St. Raymond for nine days before the
delivery. With his deep-set eyes and well-trimmed beard, he is a
kindly saint. Experts speculate that the artist was Pedro Antonio
Fresquis or Jose Aragon, circa 1820. The estimate is $2,500 to
$3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Another Aragon, Rafael Aragon, is thought to be the carver of
St. Michael the Archangel, circa 1820. The angel has speckled,
flaring yellow wings, a sword in his hand and a serpent at his
feet. His task was to fight the devil. He was also the patron of
soldiers and the guardian of small children. The estimate is $5,000
to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   A third bulto for sale is of St. Isidore the Plowman, driving a
pair of oxen with the help of a small angel. He is attributed to
Jose Benito Ortega, a prolific carver who worked between 1875 and
1907.
</P>
<P>
   St. Isidore is the patron of farmers and crops, and was
petitioned for rain. ``Farmers depended on his good will,'' Marcus
said. ``He could assure them continuity and reproduction for their
livestock and themselves. Survival was their biggest worry.'' The
estimate is $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most refined bulto in the sale is Our Lady of St.
John of the Lakes. She is mounted on a wood platform and flanked by
two wood candles. Her face is modeled to emphasize her dark eyes.
Her robe and crown are painted red, her cloak blue. Her hands are
cupped in prayer. The work is attributed to Antonio Molleno or the
Laguna School, circa 1800-45. The estimate is $18,000 to $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe also has
examples of Laguna School bultos. Its catalog ``Traditional Arts of
Spanish New Mexico'' is another good introduction to these
carvings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcuses were married in 1979. At the time, Mrs. Marcus, an
anthropologist who had worked in Belize, Panama and Nicaragua,
collected Mexican and Guatamalen textiles. After they bought a
second home in Santa Fe, Marcus was soon hooked on textiles, too,
and they began to buy blankets and rugs. He realized, he said, that
``textiles embody all the dimensions of art: color, innovation,
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus' favorite textile in the sale is a manta, a classic
Navajo woman's shawl from the 1870s made of hand-spun wool, that
once hung in his master bedroom. Its stripes of rare indigo blue
alternate with bands of red and pale blue. The estimate is $35,000
to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcuses bring different backgrounds to their collecting.
Jay Cantor, a Sotheby's freelance consultant, wrote in the catalog:
``For Stanley, in the end, it is the conjunction of both the
humanity of the object and the perfection of the form that combines
to create an excited and ongoing energy, and for Linda, it is also
the especially fine state of preservation.'' In addition to the
bultos and textiles, the sale includes prehistoric Southwestern
pottery, contemporary Acoma black-on-white jars, antique carved
storage chests and vintage Indian clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought what we liked, not what we should have bought,''
Marcus said. ``If we had concentrated on one thing, we would have a
great collection, but we wouldn't have had as much fun.''

METALLICA: HOMAGE AND ONE-UPMANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metallica never hid its influences. Band members
invariably praised the new wave of British heavy metal, a late
1970s movement of bands inspired by punk's do-it-yourself
practices, along with American punk rock and British metal bands
like Budgie. It played their songs onstage, and as early as 1984
started to record them for B-sides and EPs. Metallica released one
group of metal and punk cover versions for its ``Garage Days
Re-Revisited'' EP (Elektra) and has just released ``Garage, Inc.''
(Elektra), a more varied two-CD set.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Metallica played a full set of other bands'
songs at Roseland.
</P>
<P>
   It was 90 minutes of unstoppable drive, simultaneously ferocious
and meticulous. (For conceptual symmetry, the opening act, Battery,
played Metallica songs.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Metallica was offering homage to its favorites. But
it couldn't help adding one-upmanship. As it blasted through the
old songs, Metallica showed where it learned the power of grinding
or pummeling guitar riffs, the joys of heft and speed and the
willingness to sing about mayhem and death. Yet for all Metallica
picked up from Diamond Head (``Am I Evil?''), the Misfits (``Die
Die My Darling''), Motorhead (``Overkill'') and Mercyful Fate
(``Satan's Fall''), it was just as smart about what it eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   For its own songs, Metallica got rid of quasi-operatic high
tenor vocals, trading them for James Hetfield's growl. And Hetfield
didn't embarrass himself by singing about '70s metal commonplaces
like Satan, mythology, rock stardom, self-pity or (until recently)
love. Metallica lyrics stuck to power, oppression and death, while
the music defiantly flexed its muscle.
</P>
<P>
   As Metallica drew on the unison riffing of Black Sabbath, the
slow-fast contrasts of bands like Diamond Head and the adrenaline
surge of punk, it subjected them to the musical equivalent of an
acid bath, stripping away everything that didn't add propulsion or
tumult.
</P>
<P>
   Hetfield on guitar and Jason Newsted on bass share tensile,
unanimous riffs that are anchored to Lars Ulrich's drumming, which
moves like an armored Ferrari, while way up above them, Kirk
Hammett plays lead guitar lines that wriggle and zoom. Metallica's
effect on '80s metal songs was similar to what happened to '80s
movie heroes: They put on muscle, grew tight-lipped and started
blowing things up.
</P>
<P>
   At Roseland, Metallica delivered the lyrics straight-faced as it
retrofitted the music. While the recorded versions sometimes turn
sterile with their flawless technique, onstage Metallica was
visceral as well as virtuosic; Ulrich's drumming slammed home the
beat with gut-punching impact.
</P>
<P>
   The band lent ominous grandeur to Bob Seger's maudlin ``Turn the
Page,'' the only ballad in the set.
</P>
<P>
   It pumped up the virtuosity of punk songs like Sweet Savage's
``Killing Time,'' and its medley of Mercyful Fate songs showed why
Hetfield praised them as ``the riffmasters.'' Hammett made every
solo flail and claw, streaking through triplets and cartwheeling
across arpeggios.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's own recent songs have slowed down, forfeiting the
thrills of its old speed-metal.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the band charge through the old songs gave hope that
Metallica might rouse itself again. The band's current behemoth
tread is impressive, but a behemoth that can sprint, as Metallica
used to do, is a marvel.

`ALDRICH AMES: TRAITOR WITHIN': MAN IN EMPTY SUIT TAKES REVENGE  
 MAUREEN O'HARA IN `CAB TO CANADA' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Aldrich Ames has been called the worst mole in the history of
the CIA. As played by Timothy Hutton, he is also something of a
weasel. But mostly he is a cipher, a colorless bureaucrat, an empty
suit who sells out his country and insures the deaths of at least
10 spies (probably far more), all because he is vaguely peeved at
his bosses and wants to pay off some pesky debts.
</P>
<P>
   Hutton has the title role in ``Aldrich Ames: Traitor Within,'' a
film that Showtime is offering Sunday night. It is based, of
course, on a true story. As sketched here, Ames was a
second-generation, second-rate CIA employee who was having trouble
keeping his Colombian-born wife, Rosario, in the manner to which
she had become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   You may wonder how Mrs. Ames (played by Elizabeth Pena) became
accustomed to that manner in the first place, since the folks back
home are evidently broke, and she keeps nagging her husband to send
large sums of money to her mother and brother in Bogota. You may
also wonder why a fiery Latin woman ever married this struggling
milquetoast in the first place, and why, since he was not
particularly good in the job the government was paying him to do,
he thought he could do better as a high-stakes turncoat. You won't
find out here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film, written by Michael Burton and directed by John
Mackenzie, does a workmanlike job of storytelling. You may not care
about these people, but you know what happened to them once Ames
convinced himself that his agency colleagues didn't deserve his
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't recognize a real spy if they tripped over one,''
he says in a voice-over at the moment of decision. ``Ah, the hell
with it. I'll go for it.'' And he does, giving the Russians, among
other things, the names of their own officials who were passing
secrets to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He makes a lot of money at this until the CIA assigns the task
of rooting out its deadly mole to an analyst named Jean
Vertefeuille (Joan Plowright), who declares, ``No room for traitors
in my CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hutton and Ms. Pena, who seem unable to find real people
in the lines they've been given, Ms. Plowright furrows her brow
above eyes gleaming with determination and breathes some life into
the proceedings. Once she's on the case, you know that she'll set
things right.
</P>
<P>
   The real Aldrich Ames, who now lives at the federal penitentiary
in Allenwood, Pa., is listed in the film's credits as a technical
adviser. The production notes say that the executive producer,
Robert Benedetti, first met Ames at the University of Chicago in
1960 and visits his old friend at the prison. Is this the reason
Ames never really comes into focus and is treated rather gently?
</P>
<P>
   How exactly did the convicted traitor participate in the making
of the film? Explaining the process might be the job for yet
another made-for-television film, based on one more true story.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:

<P>
   Want to bask in the glow of a real movie star, the kind they
don't make anymore? Here's your chance. Maureen O'Hara is a joy as
she overacts her way through this wisp of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   As a woman of a certain age and uncertain prospects named
Katharine Eure, Ms. O'Hara walks away from a friend's funeral in
Pasadena, Calif., and decides to live a little while she still has
a chance. So she tells the cabdriver that she isn't ready to go
home. First they go to the beach. Then they go to San Francisco.
Then Vancouver. If that's not living on the wild side, what is?
</P>
<P>
   During this several-day quest, a mutual admiration develops
between the patrician Katharine and her accidental companion, the
driver, Mike Donahue (Jason Beghe of ``To Have and to Hold''). He's
a gruff blue-collar guy with a heart of _ you know. Back home,
Mike's devoted girlfriend, Sandy (Catherine Bell of ``JAG''), fills
in for him as a selfless pal to Bobby (Haley Joel Osment), the
lonely little boy next door.
</P>
<P>
   None of this makes a lick of sense. You can abandon the story at
any point and make up your own sticky-sweet ending. But then you'll
miss Ms. O'Hara, hair still Technicolor red, being every inch the
grand lady and looking as if she's having a ball. More than 50
years after ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' she has a few little
miracles left.

ROSS BLECKNER: HERE, THERE, EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Exhibit notes are at end of review.) 
 (mk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a lot of Ross Bleckner to see in New York
City right now, with two gallery exhibitions and a spate of
Absolute Vodka ads in glossy magazines. Taken together they suggest
an artist in search of diplomatic immunity, that is, easy travel to
different artistic planets, from mystical light-filled abstraction
to political art to popular illustration. They also provide a
particularly clear view of Bleckner's strengths and weaknesses and
his tendency to undermine and cheapen his own accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery shows are at Lehmann Maupin in SoHo and at the
artist's longtime home base, Mary Boone, on 57th Street. The
Lehmann Maupin show, which includes a soupcon of political
photo-based work (a new tangent for the artist), features some of
the best paintings he has made in years, maybe ever. Seductive,
refined, dominated by his characteristic grisaille palette and
infused with a melancholy inner light, these works treat motifs and
effects that the artist has pursued for years but with a new
economy and force.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Bleckner has jettisoned the greasily varnished
fields dotted with birds, flowers or flares of light that dominated
so many of the canvases in his 1995 mid-career survey at the
Guggenheim Museum. While those works were often described as
memorials to the devastation wrought by the AIDS epidemic, such
meanings seem largely tacked on by admirers. What really came
across was an air of slick Victorian kitschiness.
</P>
<P>
   In these new works, gray-toned expanses of tiny overlapping
shapes suggest tiny cells, the transparent cytoplasm of larger
cells, microscopic views or cross sections of skin or fish scales.
They evoke illness and the body more concretely but also more
abstractly than anything Bleckner has done before. They also
resurrect his penchant for Op Art-like effects but seem less a
quotation of the earlier style than an attempt to extend it.
</P>
<P>
   The fields are generated by a real dazzler of a technique:
Hundreds of quick, closely spaced bursts from an airbrush transform
still-wet surfaces dotted with circles and spheres into fluctuating
networks of cells and shadowy forms. (Think of Yayoi Kusama nets
painted in the style of Roger Brown's tightly rendered shaded
clouds.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the new technique is so dazzling that the first
reaction to these paintings may simply be, ``How were these things
made?,'' followed quickly by a close-up examination of the surface,
which doesn't explain much. You can almost forget to back up and
look at them whole, which is something of a weakness. Such
mysterious high finish goes bravely against the grain of most
current abstraction's emphasis on self-evident process; it's even
mildly Victorian (we also look closely at paintings by Edward
Burne-Jones or Richard Dadd to try to see how they're made) but
with a contemporary sci-fi edge.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that one of two paintings titled
``Tolerance,'' in which the little cell-shapes are organized into a
big mandalalike dome or wheel, is the best work here. Its
concentric circles and radiating spokes add a larger purpose to the
tiny pulsating units. In addition, it is more loosely worked: The
airbrushed cell-shapes read more clearly as the little pool-like
clearings of paint that they really are. And they're not
continuous; patches of Bleckner's casually brushed underlayer
remain visible.
</P>
<P>
   Having returned to more abstract imagery, Bleckner presents his
political conscience as a kind of side dish. Along one wall at
Lehmann Maupin are a series of photographs of page A3 of The New
York Times, all with a major international story appearing beside
an ad for Tiffany's. This kind of appropriation was done much
better nearly 20 years ago by some of Bleckner's contemporaries,
among them Richard Prince and Sarah Charlesworth. In addition, this
juxtaposition of images of harsh reality (war-torn Bosnia, for
example) with smug promotions of high-priced elegance seems
disingenuous, considering that Bleckner's paintings belong to the
second category themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Things deteriorate further at Boone, where Bleckner essentially
puts his new technique into overproduction, something he has done
before. The addition of stronger colors makes the paintings seem
more obvious and cloying. DNA-like chains of cells come in pleasant
shades of blue, yellow and pink; red is added to other works so
that blood cells and scientific illustrations are evoked. And the
airbrush technique seems to tighten, which means that many of the
cells seem to be made of jelly-beans or beads; suddenly the
paintings seem more photo-realist than abstract.
</P>
<P>
   The vodka ads, which also feature the cell-shape surface, are
something like the last straw. In this context, a motif intended to
set off a certain visual and poetic resonance is leveled, stripped
of seriousness and reduced to entertainment. There are very few
artists whose work can travel from art gallery to magazine
advertisements and retain anything close to its original character;
Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Barbara Kruger are possible
exceptions. It would be easy to say that Bleckner misunderstands
his own art if he thinks it can, too, but maybe the
misunderstanding is ours.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Bleckner's new work remains at Lehmann Maupin, 39 Greene
St., near Grand Street, SoHo, and the Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth
Ave., near 57th Street, through Jan. 19.

DVD FOR FILMS BIG AND SMALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the rash of ``DVD is here'' notices in store windows, it's
obvious that the digital CD with a movie on it is gaining ground.
How much ground is debated by hardware dealers and video
distributors, but there's no arguing that after a year of generally
desultory performance, the new format has enough players and titles
to claim a future and perhaps a substantial one.
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures generally put the number of players in use at
500,000, with hundreds of thousands more stocked in stores. About
2,000 movies are on disk. The numbers are infinitesimal compared
with VHS, but there is evidence that DVD has spread beyond a tight
little band of early adopters and is infiltrating a broader group
of video enthusiasts, many of whom have moved over from laser disk.
</P>
<P>
   They are buying large numbers of movies to go with their new
machines, dealers report. In some stores, the disks have begun to
challenge cassettes for shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   Studios say they are releasing most of their big films on DVD
more or less at the same time they appear on cassette. But not
wanting to cut into tape sales, they make notable exceptions.
Video, for example, has yet to see a DVD of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   More interesting perhaps is the degree of participation by some
smaller distributors who find that their customers are buying DVD
players and who go to some lengths to provide disks along with
their cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for instance, Fox Lorber, a medium-size distributor
of art-house and foreign features and documentaries on
videocassette, released 10 titles on DVD, a large number for a
relatively small company. Feature films include ``Tampopo,'' Juzo
Itami's comedy-satire on food; ``Pierrot le Fou,'' Jean-Luc
Godard's romantic adventure with Jean-Paul Belmondo, and ``The
Official Story,'' Luis Puenzo's film about Argentine repression and
an Oscar winner as best foreign film. ``Leonard Bernstein: Reaching
for the Note,'' a PBS American Masters production, and ``Can't You
Hear the Wind Howl,'' a documentary about the blues musician Robert
Johnson, are also available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gravitate toward specific groups, and we know that these
groups have enough DVD hardware to make it very interesting,'' said
Michael Olivieri, president of Fox Lorber's video division. Much of
the company's inventory, from Akira Kurosawa's ``Ran'' and Eric
Rohmer's ``Chloe in the Afternoon'' to the documentaries ``Carmen
Miranda: Bananas Is My Business'' and ``Timothy Leary's Last
Trip,'' have been released on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the disk has meant working with different
production houses. ``We've had to learn to speak a new language,''
Olivieri said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fox Lorber titles _ like ``Cartoon Crazy's Go to War,''
with Bugs Bunny selling bonds and Daffy Duck fighting Hitler and
collecting scrap metal, and ``Max Fleischer's Superman,'' a
collection of animated shorts _ begin on DVD. Only later do they
move to videocassette. &QL;

   The Mask of Zorro
</P>
<P>
   That Z on the wall is old news to Don Rafael Montero (Stuart
Wilson). Years before, he brutalized the peasants as the Spanish
Governor of California and tangled with the first Zorro, the
high-born Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins).
</P>
<P>
   These days Montero brutalizes the peasants at his gold mine and
puts up with a new Zorro (Antonio Banderas), a rascally and
impertinent former bandit schooled in swordplay and barely passable
gallant behavior (no nobleman, this one) by the old Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   For smolder, there is the ravishing Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones), a welcome addition to a dauntless adventure, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``so earnestly retrograde that
it seems new.'' &QL;

   The Negotiator
</P>
<P>
   When the police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Samuel L.
Jackson) is accused of stealing from a disability fund, he goes
crazy like a fox and takes his own hostages in an effort to clear
himself. That leads to a standoff with Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey),
the only negotiator who can deal with the negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Directed with brisk momentum by F. Gary Gray, the film suffers
from making its stars such bland nice guys. Flat dilogue doesn't
help either, nor does a script ``that doesn't leave much to the
imagination.'' (Maslin). &QL;

   Sliding Doors &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an idly romantic question, but how would Helen's life be
different if she had caught a London subway train instead of just
missing it? In the first of alternating futures, intercut
throughout, one Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes the train and meets
an annoyingly glib fellow (John Hannah), who offers the possibility
of a great job and fresh love.
</P>
<P>
   The other Helen misses her ride and goes back home to her dreary
job and a live-in lover (John Lynch) who is cheating on her. Ms.
Paltrow winsomely holds up her end, but the other characters ``are
so predictably cut and dried that the movie accumulates little
comic or dramatic momentum'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   History doesn't admit as much but Lewis and Clark actually were
nosed out in a mad dash to the Pacific surf line by a pickup team

Hunt is the loud, crude one who likes jokes about animal dung;
Edwards is a pleasant, cultured fellow who falls out of wagons a

   GUANTANAMERA. The final collaboration of Tomas Guiterrez Alea,
the Cuban director who died in 1996, and Juan Carlos Tabio, with
whom he directed ``Strawberry and Chocolate,'' is structured like

named.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban singer Yoyita returns to her homeland after 50 years
and joyfully and promptly dies in the arms of Candido (Raul
Eguren), a former lover who still remains smitten with her after
all that time. But transporting her coffin to Havana becomes a less
euphoric journey, complete with fuel restrictions and a
free-spirited lothario in hot pursuit of the wife of the undertaker
in charge of the cortege. 1995. New Yorker. $94.98. 101 minutes.

hose cut during a deep dive on the night of a full moon. A failure

   HUNGRY MODERN IN SAN FRANCISCO  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few U.S. institutions have made as serious a commitment to
building an impressive permanent collection in a relatively short
time as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its $63 million building was completed three years
ago, word that it was becoming a major buyer had spread through the
art world. Dealers and collectors with works to sell began
approaching the San Francisco Museum. Auction house experts have
also been keeping museum officials informed about what's coming up
for sale and have been known to fly a painting to San Francisco for
curators and trustees to see.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the museum in the enviable position of being offered
the cream of what's on the market, but its trustees are also
providing the financial muscle to buy only the best.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's sale of 20th-century art at Christie's, the San
Francisco Modern bought an important Magritte, ``Personal Values''
(1952), for which it paid $7.1 million, a record price for the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Phyllis Wattis, one of its most generous trustees,
gave the museum Warhol's ``Red Liz'' (1962), one of the artist's
famous images of Elizabeth Taylor set against a brilliant red
background. Ms. Wattis paid $1.7 million for it at the Christie's
auction.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also bought from dealers and has been given
several crucial gifts. Among the highlights are the only known
preparatory drawing for ``The Large Glass'' (1915-23) by Marcel
Duchamp, which was another gift from Ms. Wattis, and the purchase
of ``Persistent Antagonism'' (1946-48), a painted wood sculpture by
Louise Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee Corp., which has been giving works to museums around
the world, recently gave the museum an early Cubist Picasso
gouache, ``Female Torso'' (1908).
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fisher, a trustee, and his wife, Doris, have made a
fractional gift of Gerhard Richter's ``Seascape (852-1)'' from
1988.
</P>
<P>
   These acquisitions are in addition to major works by artists
including Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Motherwell and Piet Mondrian
that have been either bought by the museum or given to it in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city means what it says,'' said David Ross, who began as
the museum's director in June after being director of the Whitney
Museum of American Art in Manhattan for seven years. ``People here
want to make this great collection greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest acquisitions fill important gaps in its
collection, and in some cases strengthen holdings of particular
artists the museum wants to collect in depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal Values,'' for example, is the museum's first painting
by Magritte; it joins his drawing ``Untitled (Apple),'' circa 1965.
Warhol's ``Red Liz'' is a perfect complement to one of the museum's
other Warhols, ``National Velvet'' (1963), which features multiple
images of a young Ms. Taylor. It joins the museum's holdings of
nearly 30 Warhol paintings, as well as Warhol photographs, prints
and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of an artist like Duchamp, the latest gift brings
the museum's holdings by the artist to three. The others are a
urinal, ``Fountain,'' a 1964 edition of the 1917 work that the
museum acquired in June, and ``The Bottle and Suitcase,'' from
1938-1942. The Bourgeois sculpture is the second to enter the
museum's collection; ``The Next'' (1994) was acquired in June.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be the end of acquisition announcements by the
museum, Ross said. And even in its new building, the museum is
making plans to grow. ``We're in the enviable position of needing
more space,'' Ross said. ``We're in the early stages of thinking
and talking about expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   $8 MILLION FOR YALE
</P>
<P>
   Simeon Braguin, an artist and illustrator who died a year ago,
has left the Yale University Art Gallery more than $8 million. The
money will go into the Janet and Simeon Braguin Fund, named for the
artist and his late wife, Janet Chatfield Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of Yale's benefactors, Braguin had no previous
connection to the university. But he lived in Essex, Conn., for 30
years and became friendly with former directors of the art gallery
and several curators there.
</P>
<P>
   The Braguin will stipulates that the income from the fund is to
be used ``in a fashion which assists living American artists by the
acquisition and display of their works by the art gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible windfall for Yale,'' said Jock Reynolds,
the gallery's director. ``It allows us to buy and show more living
artists. It will be a whole new era for us.''
</P>
<P>
   DRAWINGS AT THE GETTY
</P>
<P>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum has named Lee Hendrix its new drawings
curator. Hendrix is a well-known scholar of Northern European
prints and drawings, especially the work of the Flemish
late-Renaissance painter Joris Hoefnagel. She has been the
associate curator of drawings at the Getty since 1989 and replaces
Nicholas J.L. Turner, who left in September.
</P>
<P>
   For several years the drawings department at the Getty has been
fairly quiet, letting institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in Manhattan acquire important drawings when they come up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   But art experts predict that Ms. Hendrix will be more than
simply a caretaker and will make the museum a competitor in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   WITHOUT ART AND WITH
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dec. 1 is the 10th anniversary of Day With(Out) Art,
the annual observance about the impact of AIDS. It is sponsored by
Visual AIDS, a Manhattan-based nonprofit group of arts
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hunt, director of Visual AIDS, said parentheses had been
added this year because so many of the observances do include art
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there will be shows focusing on the disease in museums
and galleries throughout the New York metropolitan region. There
will also be a Night Without Light, from 7:45 to 8 p.m. on Dec. 1,
when New York City's bridges and buildings will go dark. (The White
House is also turning off its lights for those 15 minutes, in
observance of the day.)
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a host of online events, highlighted by a new
web site, www.thebody.com/visualaids.

HISTORY HAUNTS JAPAN-CHINA SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By Nicholas D. Kristof   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan apologized Thursday
to President Jiang Zemin of China for Japan's conduct in World War
II, but the two countries immediately became entangled in an uproar
about the wartime memories that still haunt relations between the
two great powers of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is the first Chinese head of state to visit Japan, and the
five-day trip was intended as a milestone in the process of healing
suspicions between the countries. Instead, the session on Thursday
seemed to inflame the antagonisms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on the Asian economic crisis or the risks of
war on the Korean Peninsula, the summit meeting has been caught up
in disputes about events of half a century ago. Once again the main
force shaping East Asia's future has turned out to be its past.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both sides played down the disagreement,
emphasizing that Jiang and Obuchi agreed on a wide range of
important issues ranging from environmental cooperation to youth
exchanges. But a joint declaration by the leaders was delayed for
more than five hours, and in an unusual move it was simply issued
without being signed.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang wanted two concessions from Obuchi: a clear-cut written
apology to the Chinese people for World War II behavior by Japan,
similar to the apology Japan gave South Korea last month, and a
pledge about relations with Taiwan similar to the statement
President Clinton made to China during his visit earlier this year.
Japan rebuffed Jiang on both counts, instead offering an oral
apology for the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Japan-China relationship to develop further in the
future, it is necessary to face up to the past squarely,'' Obuchi
told Jiang. ``There was an unfortunate relationship between Japan
and China for a certain period in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese government expresses once again its remorse and
apology to China on this occasion,'' Obuchi added.
</P>
<P>
   Akitaka Saiki, Obuchi's spokesman, said that Jiang had nodded
and then said that it was a good statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the Chinese president was happy with what Obuchi told
him,'' Saiki said. ``That's our view.''
</P>
<P>
   China did not publicly express its discontent Thursday night,
but it did manage to extract an expression of Japanese remorse in
the joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan feels acute responsibility for the grave misfortune and
harm to the Chinese people during a certain period of aggression
toward China, and we express deep remorse about this,'' the
declaration said. But it did not use the word apology, which many
Japanese feel is more serious than the word for remorse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Negotiations over how Japan would refer to the past have been
going on with China since the summer, and Beijing has been pushing
for the kind of apology that Obuchi gave President Kim Dae Jung of
South Korea during Kim's visit last month. At that time Obuchi
signed a declaration along with Kim expressing Japan's ``remorseful
repentance and heartfelt apology'' for having inflicted
``unbearable damage and pain on the Korean people.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan refused and dug in its heels. Saiki explained Thursday
night that Japan believes the historical circumstances were
different and that an apology like the one made to the Korean
people was inappropriate for China. He noted that Japan had
formally annexed the Korean Peninsula, while in the case of China
it had fought a war there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never colonized China, although we did fight on the
continent of China, and that is something we have to apologize
for,'' Saiki said, adding, ``But we do not have to issue an apology
in writing for China.'' Saiki said that the essence of the apology
was the same to both countries, and that it was simply a matter of
the form's being different.
</P>
<P>
   Japan also refused to follow Clinton's lead and issue a ``three
no's'' statement about Taiwan: no support for Taiwan independence,
no support for a policy of ``one China, one Taiwan,'' and no
support for entry by Taiwan into international groups for which
statehood is required. Obuchi did say that he did not support
Taiwan independence and that he did regard it as Chinese territory.

ON STAGE AND OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the slow burn at Livent continued to command the
attention of Broadway's gurus and gossips, several shows have been
taking stock of their own enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   At the Joseph Papp Public Theater, officials said this week that
their long-running hit, ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,''
would close on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   To bid farewell to the show, Savion Glover, who won a Tony in
1996 for his choreography on the show, will return on Dec. 8 and
stay through the end of the run.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to close the show was painful but practical for the
Public, which was bruised earlier this week by mediocre reviews for
its big-money revival of ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go out with a bang and this is the best way of
doing it,'' said Carol Fineman, the theater's spokeswoman. ``The
show's been an amazing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, after opening downtown in November 1995, the show
moved to the Ambassador Theater on Broadway and received glowing
reviews and won four Tonys. But in recent months ticket sales have
sagged.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Glover is a moment of bittersweet artistic
detente. When he left the show two weeks ahead of schedule in July
1997, the official reason was scheduling conflicts. But it was an
open secret that Glover had feuded with the producers.
</P>
<P>
   The show's closing has also prompted a rescheduling of the
revival of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' which began a run
in Skokie, Ill., last week and received good notices from Chicago
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The show was set to play at the Longacre Theater, on West 48th
Street, but will move into the Ambassador. That theater, on West
49th Street, is considered more desirable because it is more
intimate, with one balcony to the Longacre's two. And the
Longacre's technical rigging is older, making it harder to install
equipment and run shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy because we literally just opened, got the reviews
and now this opens up,'' said Michael Leavitt, the executive
producer. He added that the opening, scheduled for early February,
may be briefly delayed to finish fine-tuning the show.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Ambassador, Leavitt said: ``It's a hot theater with a
hot show just leaving. I'm like bring in the Charlie, bring in the
Brown.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision this week by the producers of Matthew Bourne's
``Swan Lake'' to close as scheduled on Jan. 23 has piqued the
interest of several shows that would like to fill the swan's
slippers at the Neil Simon Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Among shows seeking a theater for the spring are ``Putting It
Together,'' a revue of Stephen Sondheim's work, starring Carol
Burnett, which closes a successful run in Los Angeles on Sunday;
David Hare's ``Amy's View,'' which plans an April opening, and
``The Weir,'' the Conor McPherson play that is expected to follow
``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' into the Walter Kerr Theater, but
may go elsewhere if ``Beauty Queen'' runs past April.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting possibilities that developed this
week is an extension for ``Peter Pan,'' with Cathy Rigby. The show
is at the Marquis Theater for six weeks and had been scheduled for
a tour of Livent theaters in Vancouver and Toronto in late January.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Livent's troubles, those plans are off, but magic at
the box office _ some $4 million in sales so far _ may make a shift
to another theater attractive. The transition could be especially
smooth because a producer of ``Peter Pan'' is the Nederlander
Organization, which also owns the Neil Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Scandalios, the Nederlander's executive vice president,
said a decision on the occupant for the theater could be made by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for ``Swan Lake'' called their decision to close an
exercise in caution.
</P>
<P>
   The producers, buoyed by strong reviews and good sales, had
flirted with the idea of an extension with a replacement cast; the
original is headed back to Britain to work on Bourne's
``Cinderella.'' But Alan Wasser, the show's general manager, said
that after considering the more than $500,000 cost of recasting and
rehearsing, the producers decided to quit while they were ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prudent decision is the best way to describe it,'' Wasser
said, adding that a national tour will soon begin. ``And we end it
as the longest-running ballet ever on Broadway.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Comedie Francaise, France's state theater, has long looked
askance at playwrights non Francaise. True, since its founding in
1680, the theater has been home to productions of Shakespeare and a
few other notable interlopers, but a living foreign playwright has
never had a production on the theater's main stage.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night that tradition was broken with a performance
of ``Arcadia'' by Tom Stoppard, who is British and very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confess, it's a genuine thrill because I'm very
sensitive to tradition,'' said Stoppard from Paris. ``So I'm very,
very aware of having a play in Moliere's theater.''
</P>
<P>
   While foreign writers were not specifically banned from the
Comedie, the company's labyrinthine bylaws made such productions
nearly impossible. But in 1995, the troupe passed a resolution
easing these restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The show's official opening on Monday is being treated as a
cultural milestone, with the culture ministers of Britain and
France scheduled to attend. ``I have to stay alive till Monday for
this to really count,'' Stoppard said. ``I'm crossing the street
with extreme caution.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Snakebit,'' the three-person play by David Marshall Grant
about downwardly mobile yuppies, has extended its run at the Grove
Street Playhouse until Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   _ The American Theater Wing, a philanthropical organization that
founded the Tonys, will offer bridge grants to nonprofit theater
companies whose city financing was delayed during the recent budget
dispute. For information call: (212) 765-0606.

   NEW YORK _ Absolutely convinced that I was going to be an
audience of one, I arrived at ``The Fantasticks'' in the Village a
little early. My thinking was, if the box office had tangible
evidence of a bona fide ticket holder, the show positively had to
go on.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon my lack of faith, but it was almost impossible to believe
that virtually any viable life form on the planet had not already
paid a visit to this cozy art-house musical, which has run at the
Sullivan Street Playhouse for, gulp, 38 years and, as of Dec. 18,
fully 16,000 performances. As it had opened six months before John
F. Kennedy was elected President, one had to wonder: What claim
could it conceivably make to having an untapped market?
Realistically, how many Himalayan sherpas, Trappist monks or
Antarctic climatologists will be trolling for twofers at the TKTS
booth in the coming years?
</P>
<P>
   I came in out of the rain on a recent Friday evening and took my
seat in the cramped middle of the back row; although reviewers
ordinarily inform a producer about when they will attend, I decided
to come unannounced. And when I looked around the theater, I saw
the oddest thing. People. Lots and lots of people. New Yorkers,
out-of-towners, teen-age girls, middle-aged couples, you name it,
filing in and filling three-quarters of the tiny auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Who were they? I knew why I was there; why were they? The lights
went down before I could absorb the shock. But as soon as that
plucky piano overture commenced _ ``BUM-bum. Bum BUM BUM BUM. Ba-da
BUM BUM'' _ I had the answer: a big bunch of softies is what they
were, and they had come to the right place. Despite advancing age,
``The Fantasticks,'' it turns out, can not only still put up a
charming front but it appears able to renew itself. With its
capable cast, no-frills set, romantic score and unabashed
celebration of innocence, the musical retains the power to
overwhelm cynicism with lyricism, to make itself, in fact, seem
eternally young.
</P>
<P>
   In the stable of off-Broadway warhorses, ``The Fantasticks'' may
be the eldest, but it's far from the only senior citizen. ``Perfect
Crime'' at the Duffy Theater in Times Square has been running since
1987; Tony 'n' Tina have been getting married in raucous
interactive ceremonies at various Manhattan locations for a decade,
and ``Blue Man Group'' has been spewing disgusting fluids at
audiences in the Astor Place Theater on Lafayette Street for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   These and other multiyear phenoms, like ``Stomp,'' ``Forbidden
Broadway'' and ``I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change,'' have
become such permanent fixtures that off-Broadway _ where plays have
a reputation of coming and going like commuters through the
turnstiles _ now is home to nearly as many long-running hits as
Broadway. And like the big Broadway musicals that run and run,
these off-Broadway perennials depend more and more on an alien
audience pool _ the tourist trade _ that traditionally avoided the
city's smaller theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Like an overscheduled medical resident, I recently made the
rounds of 7 of the 10 off-Broadway shows that have been running a
year or more (actually one, ``Shakespeare's R &AMP; J,'' is only just
approaching its first birthday) to check their pulses, to generally
assess the effects of the passage of time. I opted not to revisit
three: ``Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding'' and ``Late Nite Catechism,''
because, as interactive shows, they are by nature different every
night, and ``Perfect Crime,'' because this convoluted thriller was
such a stupefying mess when I sat through it a year ago, the
thought of returning felt like asking for a second dose of measles.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, for the shows I visited, production standards remained
surprisingly high, even for ``The Fantasticks,'' which would have
every reason to devolve into a wheezing basket case. Some, like
``Stomp,'' the dance-and-rhythm extravaganza that sets the beat to
garbage-can lids, kitchen sinks and brooms, are remarkably fresh,
while others, like ``Blue Man Group,'' the witty, cerebral
prankfest, have gone just a tad stale: after seven years in the
East Village, some new tricks would be welcome up its slightly
tattered sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every production, however, there was the pleasure
of discovering, or rediscovering, an exceptional performer, as with
Bryan Batt in ``Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act!'' or Adam
Grupper in ``I Love You, You're Perfect,'' or Allison Munn and Eric
Meyersfield, as the Girl and Boy in ``The Fantasticks,'' or the
three new cast members, Matt Dill, Jeremy Peter Johnson and Caesar
Samayoa, in ``R &AMP; J.'' Here then, in approximate descending order
of enjoyment, is a quick excursion back into the heavily charted
territory of the long runs:
</P>
<P>
   `Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act!'
</P>
<P>
   Will the American Theater Wing ever swallow its pride and give
Gerard Alessandrini the Tony he deserves? No one, in truth, is more
slavishly devoted to the Broadway legend than the creator of this
bottomlessly entertaining parody revue, which just unveiled its new
edition at the Stardust Theater. Alessandrini's targets should all
plead with him to keep them in the show, as a ``Forbidden
Broadway'' knock is confirmation that one still moves with enough
force to make the needle move on the theater district's
seismometer.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Batt, one of the show's quartet of singing parodists,
comes into his own in this revised production, which by virtue of
some scrumptious new material does the ``Forbidden Broadway''
franchise proud. Whether it's his devastating impression of Mandy
Patinkin, singing an overwrought ``I Have A Little Dreidel'' _ a
takeoff on Patinkin's evening of Yiddish folk music, ``Mamaloshen''
_ or his uproarious sendup of the baboon character in ``The Lion
King,,'' Batt always gets to the fiendish point without a trace of
remorse. He makes you happy that Broadway is such an easy mark.
</P>
<P>
   Although the other players are not up to his level _ the show
misses the talents of versatile stalwarts like Christine Pedi and
Michael McGrath, both of whom are in ``Little Me'' _ they're strong
enough to pull off Alessandrini's sharpest stuff. This is true, for
example, of Kristine Zbornik's parody of Julie Taymor, the director
of ``The Lion King,'' demonstrating her design skills on a Lamb
Chop-like sock puppet, or Edward Staudenmayer's funny impression of
Alan Cumming, the ``Cabaret'' master of ceremonies, donning
lederhosen and infiltrating the von Trapp family in a giddy ``Sound
of Music'' interlude.
</P>
<P>
   New pieces on ``Footloose'' _ ``Loose/Footloose/Why is our
po-ster puce?'' _ and ``Ragtime'' _ ``The people call it
`Gagtime''' _ are bullseyes, as are skits about the fake reporter
in those ``Broadway Buzz'' commercials and a song about ``The
Beauty Queen of Leenane'' called ``How Are Things in Irish Drama?''
sung to the tune of ``How are Things in Glocca Mora?''
</P>
<P>
   Some jokes inevitably are going to sputter in this format, which
is borne out by the all-too-easy, limp-wristed assault on ``Swan
Lake'' and an off-point skewering of Ann Miller. More often,
however, the retaining of some fabulous older skits, like a divine
extended parody of ``Titanic'' that makes fun of its elaborate
sinking set and clunky crowd-scene management, reveal how durable
and renewable this resource is.
</P>
<P>
   If anything holds Alessandrini back, it's the unfortunate dearth
of big Broadway stars to set up for hilarious falls. That Julie
Andrews, Ethel Merman and Ms. Miller remain the most prominent
faces on the revue's dart board says a lot about the tarnished
condition of Broadway glitter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `Shakespeare's R&AMP;J'
</P>
<P>
   The show is a relative infant among the long runs, and how long
it will survive is unclear; it is scheduled to close in early
January. But this simple, clever production, born in a Lower East
Side storefront and transferred to a slightly larger theater on
West 42nd Street, has matured greatly since reopening at the John
Houseman Studio Theater last January, and it deserves the
opportunity to evolve some more.
</P>
<P>
   The premise was never easy to dramatize: four students at a
stern boy's school, perhaps a Roman Catholic prep school, gather
secretly one evening to act out all the parts in ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' Joe Calarco's inspired direction of four enthusiastic
young actors underlined not only the homoerotic aspects but the
universally romantic elements of the play. Despite a few stagey
conceits, including grafting on passages from ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' the adaptation worked amazingly well.
</P>
<P>
   It now works even better. This has a lot to do, it seems, with
the discipline that sometimes comes over time with the handling of
a complex text. Of the original cast, only Greg Shamie, who plays
Romeo, remains, and while the three who departed were excellent _
and Daniel J. Shore, the original Juliet, was particularly good _
their replacements are no less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Peter Johnson, who plays the Nurse, among other
characters, and Matt Dill, as Mercutio, bring a level of comfort
with the verse and intuition about Shakespeare that make both
actors fascinating to observe in the spare surroundings of the
studio theater. Caesar Samayoa's Juliet is a fully realized
creation as well, especially in the play's final scenes, as he
passes from infatuated teen-ager to panicked lover, and Shamie's
Romeo has grown in emotional and technical command.
</P>
<P>
   The action sequences are more deliberate now; in my third
viewing of the play, it also seemed more wrenching. ``R&AMP;J'' may be
the unlikeliest of the long-runners, which only makes it a more
intriguing example of the vitality of downtown theater.
</P>
<P>
   `Stomp'
</P>
<P>
   Little having to do with ``Stomp'' is mild or muted, not even
the admonition to the audience before it begins. ``If you're taking
photographs,'' warns the voice over the public address system,
``your film will be taken away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Are they kidding? Yes, of course, flashbulbs are dangerous
distractions in the Stompers' split-second choreography, but is the
management really up to confiscating personal items, like guards
posted outside Czech air bases during the Cold War?
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to hubris. The show next week celebrates its 2,000th
performance at the Orpheum Theater, a milestone that would excuse a
certain arrogance, if not a level of creative and physical
exhaustion. But such excuses aren't necessary. ``Stomp'' is as
crisp and exuberant as if it had opened yesterday. The performers
remain a wholly original, precision marching band of working
stiffs, who take everyday tools and articles and make them shake
and rattle to ancient and contemporary rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The eight men and women know a lot about making noise and making
you laugh, but what was most exhilarating this time around were the
subtler forms of percussion coaxed from cigarette lighters, soft
drink containers and shopping bags. In any event, there's no
possibility of turning down the volume on the explosive joy in the
Orpheum.
</P>
<P>
   `The Fantasticks'
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the current El Gallo, John Savarese, rushes through those
gloriously purple monologues, the sort you might have scribbled
down in your own high school notebooks and immediately ripped up
because even then they made your lips pucker.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe rapid deployment is the only way to handle El Gallo's
poetic efforts. Still, part of the fun of ``The Fantasticks'' is
joining in the pretense that all of life is a gauzy romance. It's
El Gallo who spins the fantasy, for the archetypal Boy and Girl as
well as for the audience, with his reminder of the kind of
September ``when love was an ember about to billow.''
</P>
<P>
   The timeless musical lives on in part because the atmospheric
music and lyrics by Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones contain all the
warming flavors of memory. (That sound purple enough?)
``Metaphor,'' ``Soon It's Gonna Rain,'' ``Try to Remember,'' ``They
Were You'': is there a more serenely nostalgic score in all of
musical comedy?
</P>
<P>
   It's no chore at all to listen to these songs again, especially
since many of them are sung so well by the current cast members. To
be sure, the show is not as fresh as it once was _ ``The
Fantasticks'' is perhaps the only show in town with a permanent
museum devoted to itself _ but it's surprising how well it holds
up. Thanks to Eric Meyersfield and Allison Munn, portraying the Boy
and Girl, the story of young love never becomes the spoonful of
treacle that perpetually threatens. As their fathers, Gordon G.
Jones and William Tost are delightful cranks. In their hands,
``Never Say No'' and ``Plant a Radish'' supply the evening's wryest
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that after the excesses of the rapidly fading era of
the megamusical, tastes may swing back to the kind of old-fashioned
theatrical values embodied by ``The Fantasticks.'' And if they do,
is there any doubt that this show will be around to take full
advantage?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `Blue Man Group'
</P>
<P>
   Although this production makes ample use of a variety of gooky
substances, ``Blue Man Group'' may be due for an oil change.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences still emerge merrily from their 90-minute encounter
with three poker-faced young men dyed shiny blue, but after seven
years and 3,285 performances you can detect, at times, a drop-off
in spectator reaction. The show, parts satire, hazing ritual and
Grateful Dead concert, seems unchanged from the production I saw
three years ago, and some of the jokes have hair on them. This is
especially true of the conceptual-art humor. For example, a bit in
which each blue man expresses, through personal electronic
messages, critical evaluations of a dessicated fish framed and
mounted on a wall _ ``I want to forget the fish,'' ``I want to
curate the fish,'' ``I want to fillet the fish'' _ drifts off like
a dead fish.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, ``Blue Man Group,'' which calls this production
``Tubes,'' for the sets of plastic piping on which the blue men tap
out ethereal music, has a fail-safe recipe: Children will love the
terrible ways Twinkies, marshmallows and Cap'n Crunch cereal are
abused. But couldn't a few new spices be added? The group prides
itself on its mockery of intellectual pretension and laziness. When
the blue men themselves begin to appear a little stodgy, can a
full-blown parody of ``Blue Man Group'' be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change''
</P>
<P>
   ``When a show runs this long,'' said a friend, as we took our
seats for this two-year-old production at the Westside Theater,
``there has to be a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   There is. The audience seemed charmed by Joe Dipietro's and
Jimmy Roberts' amiable boy-meets-girl revue, a middle-of-the-road
kind of sendup of dating and marriage. Never much of a challenge,
the show mostly confirms what the ticket buyers already know, and
that level of familiarity makes it easy to sit through.
</P>
<P>
   Its humor has been compared to ``Seinfeld,'' but the more apt
model is ``Love, American Style,'' the prim, dated television
comedy show of the early 1970s . Dipietro and Roberts have a jolly
style of their own, but they rarely take risks. The characters,
played by two men and two women, are desperate types in search of
love and security. The song titles alone tell you just how
unadventurous the authors mean to be: ``A Stud and a Babe,'' ``Why?
'Cause I'm a Guy,'' ``Marriage Tango,'' ``Shouldn't I Be Less in
Love With You?'' The sensibility is not exactly cutting edge. In
``Single Man Drought,'' the line ``I should be a lesbian!'' gets
the show's biggest laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The four singing actors _ Adam Grupper, Kevin Pariseau, Erin
Leigh Peck and Cheryl Stern _ attack the material like marines
storming the beaches. Among these thoroughgoing pros, the talented
Grupper is a particular pleasure. Playing macho-nerdy everyguys,
you can sense his polish, as well as the fact that he is being
asked to apply only about 40 percent of his capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know''
</P>
<P>
   Another evening, another revue. This cabaret-formatted yearling,
newly moved to the Ibis Theater, about the headaches and horrors of
travel (and inspired by a travel guide of the same name by Wendy
Perrin) has some sweet spots. The sweetest: a funny number
performed by Jay Leonhart about smuggling exotic animals through
customs.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, though, it proves to be a fairly thin premise for a
full-fledged off-Broadway show. As with ``I Love You, You're
Perfect,'' you have to endure some fairly sparkless stuff _ a Noel
Coward takeoff being the flattest _ to get to the occasional fizz.
</P>
<P>
   Never painful, but never soaring, the experience is a lot like
modern air travel. You spend a lot of time waiting on the runway.

NURSES-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - The promise of sunny skies, a casual
lifestyle and friendly people lured Barbara Griffin from Pittsburgh
to Arizona this year, nudging the state closer to overcoming a
shortage of up to 10,000 nurses. But not nearly close enough. So
hospitals in Phoenix and Tucson are offering free trips to Hawaii,
signing bonuses of up to $6,000 and other incentives to attract
nurses willing to work long hours under stressful conditions. Some
who already have jobs in Phoenix say they're so worn out that they
welcome all the help they can get. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MISRATINGS-MOVIE (Undated) - When is an R not an R? When they call
it a PG-13. About 15 years ago, movie ratings had some starch. You
could send your kids to a PG movie and feel confident that they
wouldn't be surprised with sex, nudity, profanity or intense
violence. Now the ratings flop all over the place, with today's
PG-13 being closer to yesterday's R than you may want your kids to
find out. Even the kids-safe G isn't completely safe any more.
Story includes chart that shows Gs that should have been PGs, PGs
that should have been PG-13s, etc. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in
the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SEDARIS-COMEDY (Undated) - I n the name of all that's holy, please
don't call him ``the elf guy.'' Don't call him ``the apartment
cleaner guy.'' In fact, don't even ask him if he's a writer. For
David Sedaris, author of three bestselling books _ ``Naked,''
``Barrel Fever'' and ``Holiday on Ice'' _ it's kind of
embarrassing. He doesn't really enjoy any of those titles, although
all of them have been used relentlessly to describe him. By LAURI
NOTARO. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCHIMMEL-COMEDY (Undated) - Robert Schimmel's second comedy album,
like his first, carries the big black and white ``explicit
content'' label, but if you've heard his act, that warning is
understandable. He speaks openly about sex, but if you're familiar
with his comedy, that shouldn't be a surprise, either. That also
means his act's not that television-friendly, keeping his fan base
to those who either frequent comedy clubs or buy his albums. By
MONTY PHAN. Story moved in the ``E`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALLISON-MUSIC (Undated) - A singer and songwriter and pianist, Mose
Allison, 71, is one of those national treasures who probably would
go unrecognized at the mall. He has been recording since the '50s
for a variety of major labels. He's currently signed to Capitol's
Blue Note jazz division, which released this year's delightful
``Gimcracks and Gewgaws.'' By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-KEVORKIAN (Phoenix) - Again he defines the terms. Given a
national stage, he tells us (for about the 130th time now) the
time, place and manner to prescribe death. He sets the agenda and
the tone. He speaks for us _ because we let him. Why do we let him?
Story moved in the ``K'' category.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-RENO (Phoenix) - In the aftermath of Janet Reno's decision not
to appoint an independent counsel to probe Vice President Albert
Gore, it's time for a new attorney general. Story moved in the
``K'' category. &QL;

ROTH IRA, MUCH IGNORED, IS WORTH GETTING TO KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, advertisements from investment houses and
articles in the financial press have touted the benefits of the new
Roth IRA. Yet few people seem to be paying attention. Surveys find
that no more than one in 20 eligible Americans has put retirement
money into a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this will capture your imagination: If you make a single
$2,000 investment in a Roth IRA and it earns the historical average
return for stocks of large companies, your heirs could withdraw
money from the account for the next 80 years, pocketing nearly $1.3
million without paying a penny in income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Interested now?
</P>
<P>
   Then read carefully, because while the figures can get
complicated, the Roth is one of the biggest single investment tax
breaks Congress has ever given to middle-class Americans _
especially those who are diligent savers. And if you want to move
money from another retirement plan to a Roth on the most favorable
terms, you have just over a month in which to act.
</P>
<P>
   A warning: Not everyone can profit from a Roth IRA. Eligibility
for a full, $2,000-per-person annual contribution is limited to
spouses who together make less than $150,000 and single people
earning no more than $95,000; smaller contributions are allowed for
couples who make up to $160,000 and singles earning up to $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   But these boundaries encompass 95 percent of taxpayers. And the
income eligibility limits for starting a Roth are more liberal than
those for making tax-deductible contributions to traditional IRAs,
which, for people with pension plans, rapidly phase out once
spouses together earn $50,000 and individuals earn $30,000. A
worker without a pension can contribute $2,000 to a traditional IRA
regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   (And anyone can make a nondeductible contribution to a
traditional IRA, though experts recommend this route only for those
who cannot qualify for any other savings plan.)
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference between the two types of accounts
involves the timing of tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth is built with money you have left after you pay the
government, but it allows you to withdraw money tax-free at
retirement. By paying up front, you are essentially betting that
tax rates will not fall in the future, or that you won't be in a
lower tax bracket when it comes time to withdraw money from your
account.
</P>
<P>
   So Roths make sense for people who expect their incomes to rise
in the future, especially diligent savers who expect to have more
income in retirement than they are earning today.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional IRAs, by contrast, you use pre-tax dollars to
contribute to the account, but your withdrawals are taxed. In
essence, you're assuming that you will be earning less in
retirement than during your prime saving years, so your withdrawals
will be taxed at a lower rate than if you had paid your taxes up
front, as with a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, you'll be paying taxes on the money you withdraw
at high ordinary income rates, even though much of the growth in
your IRA will be capital gains. With a Roth, by contrast, you pay
at ordinary rates on your initial contributions, but pay no taxes
at all on the money that grows in your account.
</P>
<P>
   So why are relatively few Americans taking advantage of the
Roth, which became part of the tax code last January? A big reason,
financial planners say, is that people have become so accustomed to
deferring taxes whenever possible _ a generally sound strategy _
that the idea of paying a tax sooner rather than later is hard for
many people to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though intellectually you can analyze that if you pay
this tax up front you will be better off in the long run, it is so
against what we are programmed to do that many find it difficult
psychologically,'' said Steve Mitchell, a senior vice president at
Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   John Barth, a principal in the retirement services group at
Vanguard, another mutual fund giant, said his firm's analysis of
customer calls found ``a lot of uncertainty'' about the Roth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say if you pay the taxes first, then what is the
benefit?'' Barth observed.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance to accelerate tax payments also seems to be
discouraging many people from converting their traditional IRAs
into Roth accounts, even though the math, for many, makes a
compelling case for the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Couples filing jointly with less than $100,000 in adjusted gross
income (the last figure on the front of the Form 1040 tax return)
can roll any amount of money from a 401(k), traditional IRA or
similar retirement savings vehicle into a Roth. The income limit is
the same for singles. But as with any contribution to a Roth, taxes
must be paid up front in exchange for the right to withdraw the
money tax-free at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement discourages many prospective users of the Roth,
according to Barth; they simply don't have the money to pay the
income taxes. And this is where time is of the essence: Rollovers
completed by the end of December get a special tax break _ Congress
says you can take four years to pay the income taxes. If rollovers
are made next year or later, the money is due all at once.
</P>
<P>
   For all the benefits of the Roth, financial advisers say there
are other retirement savings plans that trump it. Experts say you
should save all you are allowed in a 401(k) or 403(b) (the latter
for teachers and other public and nonprofit employees) or similar
plan before you put money into a Roth _ so long as your employer is
matching your contributions with more than 10 cents for every
dollar you save.
</P>
<P>
   Bob FitzSimmons, a certified financial planner in Lincoln, Neb.,
offers this advice: First, put as much money into your 401(k) as
your company will match; then put $2,000 into a Roth. Then, if you
can afford to save more for retirement, add unmatched money to your
401(k) up to the $10,000 annual maximum.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   His logic is that the match is the most valuable benefit,
followed by the tax-free income from the Roth and, finally,
additional tax-deferred savings in the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, if your employer does not offer a match, you
would need to contribute $2,778 to a 401(k) to get the same
retirement income as $2,000 in a Roth, assuming that you are in the
28 percent tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a match, the 401(k) has one practical advantage.
Because your contributions will be automatically deducted from your
paycheck, you are more likely to follow through on your retirement
savings program than with a Roth, said Mitchell of Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roth IRAs have a number of twists that make them an
appealing retirement planning tool _ and not just for baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a teen-ager working after school, or a young adult
just starting out _ and if you are more Puritan than prodigal in
your thinking about money _ the Roth is an ideal savings vehicle.
After all, your tax rate looks almost certain to rise in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this example:
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old, in the 15 percent tax bracket, saves $2,000 from
her job selling toys at the mall. Her money earns 10.9 percent
annually, the historical long-term return for stocks of large
companies. Through hard work over the years, she becomes marketing
director for a chain of toy stores and finds herself in the top
39.6 percent bracket when she retires at age 66 and withdraws the
balance in her retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   If she had put that original $2,000 into a Roth (which means she
paid $300 in taxes back when she was 16), she would have
accumulated $352,864. But if she had saved in a traditional IRA and
then paid taxes on her withdrawal, she would be left with just
$213,130. Even if she had been disciplined enough at 16 to invest
the extra $300 in a taxable account, she would have added less than
$10,000 to her wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In short, for every after-tax dollar in a traditional IRA, she
would have $1.57 in her tax-free Roth account.
</P>
<P>
   Roths can also figure in the plans of the elderly. If you
qualify for a Roth conversion (that is, your income is $100,000 or
less) but have enough wealth to be subject to estate taxes (that
is, assets of more than $625,000), your heirs will get more money
if you roll over your traditional IRA or other tax-deferred plan
into a Roth.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the taxes you pay up front on the conversion
``reduce the size of your estate and avoid the tax-on-a-tax at
death, when you pay both estate and income taxes,'' said Sanford
Schlesinger, an estate tax partner with Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays &AMP;
Handler, a New York law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes aside, by making a single contribution to a Roth
and naming a young child as the beneficiary, an elderly person can
generate a cool million for a grandchild or great-grandchild,
assuming Congress makes no changes in the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how: Assume that an heir is born today and made the
beneficiary of a new $2,000 Roth account. If the benefactor leaves
the account untouched and dies in 5 years, the child, under IRS
actuarial tables, will have about 75 years to withdraw the money,
taking 1/75th the first year, 1/74th the next and so on until the
account is emptied.
</P>
<P>
   If the account earns historical average returns, the child will
collect nearly $1.3 million _ and the fund will grow faster than
the withdrawals until the last few years of the heir's projected
life expectancy, according to Seymour Goldberg, a tax lawyer and
certified public accountant in Garden City, N.Y., who runs seminars
on Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With proper planning, you can accomplish a tremendous stretch
that lets money grow untaxed for decades,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth IRA is named for Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who is
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. In an interview last
week, Roth said he would ask Congress next year to raise the annual
ceiling on contributions to both traditional IRAs and Roths to
$4,000 or $5,000. The limit has been $2,000 since 1981, when IRAs
were created. Roth also wants everyone with $1 million or less in
annual income to be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first blush, the Roth IRA is a little difficult to
understand,'' he acknowledged. ``But if you can afford to pay the
taxes at the beginning, you are much better off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compounding of interest is wonderful,'' he said, ``and
when your money is never taxed, it is amazing.''

GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS: BUILDING A TOY TOWN WITHOUT GOVERNMENT HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
 (bl)  
 By JOEL KOTKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For decades the industrial area just east of this
city's downtown was an economic wreck _ 15 blocks of derelict,
half-century-old buildings abutting the flophouses, cheap hotels
and unappetizing sights of skid row. But in recent years the area
has come to boisterous life with voices in various South China
dialects, Vietnamese, Korean, Farsi, Spanish and myriad other
languages, all talking about toys.
</P>
<P>
   The energy of immigrant entrepreneurship and a vision of a
specialized commercial district have effected this remarkable
transformation, turning Central City East, the kind of archaic
industrial area that lies rotting in cities all across the country,
into Toytown, a bustling marketplace with more than 4,000 jobs and
$1 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In December, we have about the worst traffic problem in
downtown,'' Charlie Woo says, proudly. Woo immigrated to Los
Angeles from Hong Kong as a teen-ager in 1968 and now, at 47, is
widely considered Toytown's founding father.
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday season, consumers flock to the area, seeking
cut-rate toys, dolls and action figures, including knockoffs of
well-known brands. The rest of the year, the district sustains
itself as a global wholesale center, with nearly half its shipments
going to Latin America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Toytown was not dreamed up in City Hall. Few in the Los Angeles
establishment noticed in 1979, when Woo and his family started
their first toy wholesaling business there. ``When Toytown started,
the CRA didn't even know about it,'' recalled Don Spivack, who is
now deputy administrator of the city's Community Redevelopment
Agency. ``It happened on its own. It was a dead warehouse
district.''
</P>
<P>
   How dead? Dave Zoraster, an appraiser at CB Richard Ellis, a
commercial brokerage firm, estimated that, in the mid-1970s, land
in the area was worth about $2.75 a square foot and half the
commercial space was vacant. Today the land commands $100 a square
foot or more, and vacancy rates are in the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment agency saw the area as a place for low-income
transients, safely away from the new high-rises of the financial
district a few blocks west. But Woo, then working on a Ph.D. in
physics at UCLA, saw it as a great central location for wholesaling
and distributing the billions of dollars in imported toys flowing
from Asia into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. He bought a
building for $140,000 and got started.
</P>
<P>
   Personal connections in Asia helped him establish close
relationships with scores of toy manufacturers there. He built up
volume by halving the 40 to 50 percent markup typically sought by
traditional small toy wholesalers. Today, Woo and his family own 10
Toytown buildings and a distribution company, Megatoys, with $30
million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Woo built the toy district around him with a strategy that few
other business people would ever consider: He invited his
competitors in. He reasoned that the critical mass of a Hong
Kong-style commercial cluster would lower shipping costs, attract
more buyers and ultimately benefit everyone in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' Woo says, surveying Toytown
recently on crutches, the legacy of a childhood bout with polio.
``But we saw how the garment district was working. We saw it in the
flower and food markets. Convenience brings in more customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the toy district, a hodgepodge of one- and two-story
buildings often painted in pastel shades, is home to roughly 500
toy and electronics-related businesses. Many of them started in
much the same way as M&AMP;J Toys did: Minh Quach and his family came
from Vietnam in 1980 and started selling toys at the swap meets
that flourish throughout ethnic Southern California, then graduated
to a small storefront and today operate a 6,000-square-foot store
and a nearby 30,000-square-foot warehouse packed with boxes of
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Toytown's success has bred growth in toy-related businesses
across Southern California. The region, also home to Mattel, the
world's largest toy maker, has spawned hundreds of smaller toy
designers, distributors and manufacturers. The Otis College of Art
and Design in West Los Angeles has started a toy design department.
Over all, 60 percent of the $12 billion in toys distributed
nationally come through Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   With Toytown's rents and land prices much higher now, Woo
believes the area's future lies in retail development. To make
Toytown more attractive to families, he recently helped establish a
business improvement district to clean streets and improve
security. The area has also seen a boom in new construction and
restoration of older buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, the area's continuing success
testifies to the ability of immigrant entrepreneurs to turn around
even the most destitute urban neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Woo sees the latest improvements as helping keep Toytown a vital
place for wholesalers and designers keen on staying close to
industry trends. ``The future of Toytown will be as a gathering
point for anyone interested in toys,'' Woo said. ``The industry
will grow all over, but this place will remain ground zero.''

WARREN SMITH, 93; EDITED WALPOLE'S LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren Hunting Smith, who devoted more than 50 years of his life
to editing the letters of Horace Walpole, died Nov. 22 at his home
in Geneva, N.Y. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   From 1931 to 1982, Smith worked in Yale University's Sterling
Library on a project that had been started in 1924. The result is a
48-volume edition of Walpole papers, an indispensable source on the
life of the 18th-century English author and man of letters.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that others might think his work tedious, Smith
found a special pleasure in projecting himself back to Walpole's
day. Walpole, who lived from 1717 to 1797, was the son of the
British prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, and was himself a
member of Parliament as well as a writer. His literary reputation
rests largely on his letters, in which he wrote about everything
from Benjamin Franklin's experiments with electricity to the
discovery of the planet Uranus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something like existing in a monastery,'' said Smith in
1983, after the project was completed. ``There were these Gothic
arches, and we were sitting there like medieval monks, reading
manuscripts.'' He said it was pleasant being in ``the backwater of
the university,'' as he peacefully went about his daily work
researching and editing and writing footnotes in what was popularly
referred to as the Walpole Factory.
</P>
<P>
   It was before the days of the computer, and Smith did all his
work by hand. Frank Brady, chairman of the project that edited the
papers of James Boswell at Yale, marveled at the painstaking
labors. He compared it to being ``in the solarium when Gutenberg
came along,'' and concluded that ``no one will ever do that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The project began in 1924 when Wilmarth Lewis, a 1918 graduate
of Yale and a book collector, bought several Walpole letters. Those
letters inspired him to collect Walpole's books, letters and
memorabilia and to make him his life's work. Lewis financed the
project at Yale and was in charge of it until his death in 1979.
Smith began working with Lewis as a graduate student. After Lewis
died, Smith, one of 14 editors and 48 students involved in the
process, took over the older scholar's mission as managing editor,
with a zeal equal to that of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yale Edition of Horace Walpole's Letters'' was never
intended to have a large readership, with a first edition limited
to 1,250 copies. But some of the early volumes went into a second
printing. The index takes up five volumes, and the work on it was
principally attributed to Smith. Lewis' home in Farmington, Conn.,
which he donated to Yale, houses the university's Walpole Library,
by far the largest repository of Walpole material.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was born in Geneva, N.Y. He graduated from Yale in 1927
and received a Ph.D. from Yale in 1931. During World War II, he
served in U.S. Army intelligence. In addition to his work on
Walpole, he published six books, including histories of Geneva and
Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and two novels set in his
hometown. No immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   Walpole was his consuming passion, but even as he immersed
himself in the author's world of letters, the man himself remained
at a remove. ``Walpole never completely unbuttoned, so to speak,''
Smith said. ``He wrote a great deal about his prejudices and
opinions on all subjects but very little about himself.''

PAXTON HOPING FOR A HOME RUN  
 REMAKING `PSYCHO'  
 CONSPIRATORIAL CODGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ By his own admission, Bill Paxton is a solid base
hitter who has not yet hit any home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a little frustrating when you're reading a script
after 10 guys ahead of you have had a chance to pick it over,'' the
cheerfully blunt actor said. ``You can almost see the bread crumbs.
I haven't had a role that's propelled me into major stardom. Sure,
I've had roles that put me on the playing field. A lot of base
hits. No home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   That may change soon.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton stars in two entirely different holiday films that, at
best, will propel him into stardom or, at worst, underscore his
skill as one of the more diverse actors in films. One of them, ``A
Simple Plan,'' directed by Sam Raimi, is a dark drama about the
greed and paranoia of ordinary men who suddenly discover $4 million
in cash in a downed airplane outside a rural town. Opening on Dec.
11, the film was adapted by Scott Smith from his best-selling
novel, and also stars Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   The other film is Disney's update of the 1949 ``Mighty Joe
Young,'' directed by Ron Underwood and opening on Dec. 25. In this
movie, Paxton plays a zoologist in Central Africa who discovers a
dangerous 15-foot gorilla who is tamed when he comes near the
beautiful woman (Charlize Theron) who has raised him. The two seek
to bring the gorilla to a game reserve to protect the animal from
poachers.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton, who has appeared in ``Twister,'' ``Apollo 13'' and ``One
False Move,'' was especially flattered to reprise the role in
``Mighty Joe Young'' that was created by Ben Johnson, whom he knew.
But it's ``A Simple Plan'' that seems to consume Paxton. In the
film, he plays Hank Mitchell, a solid member of the community who
is married with a baby on the way. The discovery of the cash and
the prospect of wealth plunges him, ever so slowly, into a violent
abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad sent me the book and said, `You were born to play this
part,''' Paxton said. ``I could not put the book down. I called him
and said: `Dad, you're breaking my heart. I'll never get to do it.
I knew all the big names would line up for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. For five years, Paxton read about top movie stars
and directors dropping in and out of the project. Finally the film
was set up at Paramount, which had initially turned it down, with
the help of Raimi and Paxton's friend, Thornton, who plays the
actor's emotionally troubled brother.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the role, Paxton has received high marks from his
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you see on the screen with Bill is a simple, elegant
performance,'' Raimi said, ``but he has this great ability to go
underneath the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxton hopes that ``A Simple Plan'' will advance his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snuck in when nobody was looking,'' he said with a laugh.
``I hope it moves me to the next stop on the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for Norman
</P>
<P>
   How risky is it to remake a classic like ``Psycho''?
</P>
<P>
   Very.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned because I will get a lot of heat, and I won't
enjoy it,'' said Brian Grazer, producer of the remake of the 1960
Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece. ``But frankly, I think a lot of the
heat can get mitigated by the fact that it's Gus Van Sant who's
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant, director of the new ``Psycho,'' has wanted to remake
the film for years and used the original shooting script as the
framework for the remake.
</P>
<P>
   The new version was designed partly as an homage to Hitchcock,
partly as a bold experiment and partly to introduce the movie to
younger audiences who may have heard of _ but not seen _ the film
with its maniacal killer, Norman Bates (the Anthony Perkins role),
and its famous shower scene involving Janet Leigh. The original
film is one of the scariest and most sexual ever made by a studio.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant said there was probably an entire generation who had
never seen the original ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to defend myself against questions like, `How
dare you remake `Psycho'?'' said Van Sant, who has also directed
``Good Will Hunting,'' ``My Own Private Idaho'' and ``To Die For.''
``When the critics see it I hope they'll change their minds. But I
know some people will be hoping I get bad reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant continued: ``It's stupid to remake bad movies _ one
should remake the good ones. Any number of remakes are made, but
they never preserve the original, they all play with the logic and
language of the actual filmmaker. They're not interested in
remaking the original but robbing it. This is a remounting of the
original piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Great plays are constantly restaged and reinterpreted, he added.
So why not remake great films? Even Hitchcock, Van Sant said,
remade one of his classics, ``The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' which
was made in Britain in 1934, and remade in 1956 in Hollywood with
James Stewart and Doris Day.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Psycho'' stars Vince Vaughn (``Swingers'') as Norman
and Anne Heche in the Janet Leigh role. ``There are some
differences between this film and the original, mostly in an effort
to make the performances work,'' Van Sant said. ``The performances
are somewhat different because you have different people playing
the roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he had no qualms about stepping into the role of
Norman, even though Perkins had felt that the part had dominated
and may have ultimately hurt his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for me was to work with Gus,'' Vaughn
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``And my feeling was that songs get remade all the
time. Plays get reinterpreted time and time again. So when friends
and the press said to me, `How can you do this?' my take is, acting
comes from a childhood place, not a religious place.'' So, he
added, why not take the risk?
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn called Perkins ``absolutely brilliant'' in ``Psycho.''
But he said he had his own interpretation of Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see a value in mimicking what they did the first
time,'' he said. ``But I didn't try to do things totally
differently. I just tried to use a truthful interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he found Norman sympathetic. ``Norman is actually
more like most people than people realize,'' he said. ``Except he
goes into a very extreme place.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish Eyes Sparkle
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years ago, Kirk Jones was directing commercials in
London and Europe when he came across a small article in the
newspaper that riveted him. It was about a postmistress in a
village in south Wales who was suspected of winning a bundle of
money in the lottery but was so tight-fisted that she tried to keep
it a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began thinking about the effect of the lottery on a small
town,'' the 34-year-old filmmaker said. ``The lottery brings
escapism and magic and hope. So I began writing a story. And I
wanted to make sure, at every opportunity, that I would try to
entertain the audience watching the film.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a disarming fable, ``Waking Ned Devine,'' which
has charmed critics and left its distributor, Fox Searchlight
Pictures, comparing it with that company's big hit last year, ``The
Full Monty.'' The film opened last weekend in New York, Los Angeles
and Toronto, and expands nationwide on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The film, now set in an Irish village, deals with two wily
codgers, lifelong friends, who excitedly discover that someone in
their town has won the national lottery _ and that that someone has
just died. The two men, played by the well-known Irish actors Ian
Bannen and David Kelly, start scheming with the whole town to pull
the wool over the eyes of the lottery officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Law, president of Fox Searchlight, saw the film at the
Cannes Film Festival in May and immediately bought it. ``It was
extremely funny, and you fell in love with those characters,'' Law
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones worked on his screenplay for years, in between jobs
directing commercials for some of London's top advertising
agencies. He kept revising the screenplay, visiting Ireland
numerous times to visit small town pubs and talk to customers about
his ideas for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weekend here, a week there,'' he said. ``I got sort
of depressed. It was taking a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to raise money for the film in the United States fell
apart when Jones refused to change his concept for the film. One
company wanted to cast Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon in the top
roles (``That would have been a disaster,'' Jones said); another
asked him to make the lead characters Americans and to change their
ages to their '40s instead of decades older. The producers finally
raised about $3 million from British and European financiers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was glad he didn't succumb to money offers that
would have forced him to make the film with American actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been able to have that cast if we had taken
the money early on,'' Jones said. ``I'm a first-time writer and
first-time director. I have an unknown cast with two actors nearly
70 years old. It doesn't look good on paper from a business point
of view. I can understand that. But it gives me enormous pleasure
now when audiences approach me after a screening and thank me for
casting people like Ian and David.''

   An ocean buoy anchored near Cape San Martin off the California
coast reported an ocean swell of 22 feet Thursday, prompting the
National Weather Service to issue heavy surf advisories for
Southern California beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Rough surf will pound beaches again Friday as swells from the
wind-agitated ocean arrive. Moreover, clouds will increase across
Southern California as a Pacific disturbance approaches, with
showers spreading gradually from north to south across the region
during the day and Friday night. Rainfalls will be generally light
because the onshore flow of Pacific moisture will stay relatively
weak at low levels. In the southern and central Sierra mountains,
however, moderate to heavy snows are possible by tomorrow morning
as moist, higher-altitude winds are forced to rise over sloping
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Following suit, snow will fall at high elevations from Nevada to
Idaho and western Wyoming as moist Pacific winds aloft are lifted
by mountains.
</P>
<P>
   East of the Rockies, a major late-November warm-up will gain a
foothold on the Middle West from the western Gulf states to the
Northern Plains. The warm-up will be tempered along the upper Texas
and Louisiana coasts, however, where pockets of fog and low clouds
persist for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, snow showers and flurries will dust the high terrain
of northwest New England as a weakening low pressure system heads
toward the Canadian Maritimes. In its wake, winds from the
northwest will average 12 to 25 mph along the southeast New England
and northern Middle Atlantic Seaboards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Arrogant Storms &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious winds gusted to 111 mph at Cannon Beach, Oregon, on
Wednesday, while a 24-hour record 5.56 inches of rain deluged
Astoria. Potent storm systems like the one that battered the
Pacific Northwest on Wednesday almost arrogantly defy accurate
measurement as they become increasingly powerful. Raindrops
buffeted by fierce winds in strong storms are blown horizontally,
making their capture by rain gauges more difficult. Moreover, as
winds increase, it becomes increasingly difficult for instruments
to register a representative speed, given the turbulent nature of
the stormy atmosphere.

EISENSTAEDT PHOTO REVIEW: WHIMSY OF SNAPSHOT, WITH CALCULATING
EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Using nothing fancier than available light, a 35-mm
Leica camera and a superb eye for entrancing storytelling moments,
Alfred Eisenstaedt produced some of the most memorable images of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The picture he took on Aug. 15, 1945, of a sailor in Times
Square giving a nurse an extravagantly theatrical kiss, has become
a stand-in for the intoxicating relief that greeted the news of
Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1950 tribute to childhood's boundless exuberance, a line
of children joyfully imitate the giant strides of their Pied Piper
_ a drum major rehearsing at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor. In 1963 in Paris, Eisenstaedt made a captivating record of
children exploding in horror, amazement and disbelief at the
slaying of their puppet dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alfred Eisenstaedt: A Retrospective on the Anniversary of His
100th Birthday,'' at Soho Triad Fine Arts on Grand Street, includes
two of these images (but not that of the drum major) and a fair
number of the photographs that this irrepressible longtime Life
magazine photographer, who died in 1995 at 96, is most known for.
The show also includes many pictures not previously shown.
Together, they are a reminder that Eisenstaedt was a marvelously
versatile photojournalist.
</P>
<P>
   He took informal, often incisive portraits of the famous, the
infamous and the unknown. He photographed landscapes and
cityscapes. He covered news events, such as Hitler's first meeting
with Mussolini in 1934 and Vice President Richard M. Nixon's visit
to Central America in 1955. He went on countless assignments within
the United States and abroad. He brought his camera to the watering
holes of the affluent and to ordinary workaday places like a custom
shoemaker's shop.
</P>
<P>
   And even before there was Life magazine, which made its debut in
1936, Eisenstaedt, who was known as Eisie in the photography world,
was taking the kind of pictures that came to be identified with the
picture-filled weekly. Living in Berlin in the late 1920s and early
'30s, he was a pioneering photojournalist who produced candid
pictures that were pleasantly informal, sometimes whimsical and
almost always compositionally sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1898 in what was West Prussia and drafted into the
German army when World War I broke out, Eisenstaedt fought at
Flanders and was shot in both legs. But war and mayhem didn't
interest him; the delightfully serendipitous did.
</P>
<P>
   In the Italian town of Turin in 1934, Eisenstaedt crossed paths
with young nuns heading to Sunday mass. The faces in the picture he
took are mesmerizing, each of the young women responding in her own
way to the camera: questioning, amused, impassive, curious.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel picture, taken in Florence in 1935, shows monks
walking along the rain-slicked bank of the River Arno. The wonder
in this elegant image is not in the reaction of the monks to being
photographed (they take it coolly in stride), but in the
juxtaposition of the monks in their somber dark hats and habits
against a backdrop of low, pale buildings across the river, with
both monks and buildings receding gently into a blurry gray
distance marked by single-file cyclists and an old stone bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A more familiar but no less engaging image is ``Premiere at La
Scala, Milan'' (circa 1933). Despite a picture jammed with details
_ row upon row of ornate, people-filled balconies and glittering
lights _ the viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the
photograph's lower right hand corner, to the unsmiling, almost
mournful face of a young woman who is turned toward the camera, her
companion out of view.
</P>
<P>
   In this retrospective, as in earlier exhibitions of
Eisenstaedt's work, what is most evident is that he had a special
affinity for extraordinary faces.
</P>
<P>
   There is the incomparable Marlene Dietrich in Berlin in 1928,
her face surprisingly fresh and innocent despite her cynical pose
in top hat and tails, a cigarette held mannishly between thumb and
finger. There is the great, scowling face of Thomas Hart Benton,
paired in 1970 with his equally grim self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1933 League of Nations session in Geneva, Eisenstaedt
caught Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, his hands
held like claws on the arms of his chair, glaring malevolently at
him.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1961 portrait, the French composer Darius Milhaud looks
comfortable in his overweightness. The lenses of his eyeglasses
rest on the table in front of him, the temples of the glasses
spread wide, as though to gently taunt their owner's expansive
girth. Behind the composer, musical notes written in chalk dance
like thin sprites across the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstaedt occasionally did his own version of casting against
type. In 1947, he did a Paul Strand-like portrait of J. Robert
Oppenheimer, the nuclear physicist who headed the wartime
laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., that developed the first atomic
bombs. Eisenstaedt zeroed in on his subject in an unvarnished,
frontal close-up.
</P>
<P>
   But in a neat twist, Oppenheimer isn't what one imagines a
scientist to look like. A cigarette dangling from his lips, a
porkpie hat squarely on his head, Oppenheimer has the insouciant
air of a roue. (In a separate picture taken with the rumpled
Einstein, Oppenheimer reverts to stereotypical form, that of an
earnest scientist.)
</P>
<P>
   This retrospective does not exclude the kind of treacly, Norman
Rockwell pictures that often filled Life. In keeping with the
times, Eisenstaedt took his share of such pasteurized pictures. A
boy attends to a stand selling Coca-Cola to passing motorists
(Atlanta, 1936). On a sunny day outside a house, the ground
sprinkled with autumn leaves, three boys with a dog at their side
avidly take in a newspaper's comics (Ohio, 1943).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As though to show that even the great Eisenstaedt took
pedestrian pictures, the exhibition also includes some humdrum
street scenes and landscapes. A 1936 image of the RCA Building,
with the camera tilted, looks too much like an imitation of
Margaret Bourke-White's circa 1930 picture of the Chrysler
Building.
</P>
<P>
   In a few instances in the glorious-machines category,
Eisenstaedt outdid Bourke-White, who was noted for her industrial
photography before she joined Life. (The two were among four staff
photographers hired when Life began publication, Eisenstaedt having
moved to New York in late 1935.)
</P>
<P>
   On a Graf Zeppelin flight from Germany to Rio de Janeiro in
1933, he made a stunningly spare, almost surreal picture of crew
members repairing a rip in the covering of the airship's hull.
</P>
<P>
   Although this picture is not in the retrospective, Eisenstaedt's
dazzling interior shot of the old Pennsylvania Station is. In this
1943 image, the Manhattan train station's famous clock looms over
the crowds below, and beyond the clock are the soaring, mistily
gray outlines of arches that seem to be made from a giant Erector
set.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career Eisenstaedt refined an eye for what he
called ``a Rembrandt sort of light'' _ natural light filtering in
from windows and skylights. During his yearlong convalescence from
his World War I wounds, he had haunted art museums, studying how
old master painters handled composition and lighting. He learned
his lessons well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most astonishing pictures in this retrospective is a
reworking of the old master genre. In ``First Lesson at the Truempy
Ballet School, Berlin'' (1930), a teacher gently guides a young
ballet student. They are reflected in a large mirror, which also
bears the reflection of other young students ranged on one side,
their faces solemn and heartbreakingly hopeful. &QL;
</P>

   ``Alfred Eisenstaedt: A Retrospective on the Anniversary of His
100th Birthday'' remains at Soho Triad Fine Arts, 107 Grand St.,
Soho, through Jan. 10. Abbeville Press has reprinted ``Eisenstaedt
on Eisenstaedt,'' first published by BBC Publications. A revised
edition of ``Eisenstaedt: Remembrances'' will be published by
Bulfinch Press in June. On the Internet, Life magazine's home page

NEW THOUGHTS ON MEASURING A STORM'S DANGERS ARE PROMPTED BY
HURRICANE MITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 BY PAMELA MERCER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As the Central American nations devastated by Hurricane
Mitch struggle to pick up the pieces, meteorologists here are
beginning to consider devising a new scale for measuring hurricanes
in an effort to give the public a broader view of their potential
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center, which tracks most storm systems
in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, has begun informal
discussions on how to devise a scale to measure some geographic and
sociological factors that often play crucial roles in determining
how damaging a hurricane will be.
</P>
<P>
   The current yardstick used to classify hurricanes, the
Saffir/Simpson Scale, measures a storm mostly by the strength of
the winds at its center. An additional scale could include ``a
matrix of factors that contribute to a hurricane disaster and a
computer model of that,'' said Jerry Jarrell, the director of the
National Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas on creating a new scale, which would coexist alongside the
Saffir/Simpson, are still at an embryonic stage, and no financing
for such a project has yet been procured, Jarrell said. Yet the
disaster wrought by Mitch has led many experts who study hurricanes
to reassess how they are classified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch is what brought this to the forefront a little bit,''
said Stephen Leatherman, the director of the International
Hurricane Center at Florida International University. ``The
community is stoked up on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes are currently defined as tropical cyclones with winds
of at least 74 miles an hour. The strongest type of hurricane under
the Saffir/Simpson scale is a category five, with winds of at least
155 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch, which is estimated to have killed at least 11,000 people
in Honduras and Nicaragua in the worst storm disaster in more than
200 years, had winds that barely reached hurricane force by the
time it touched down over Central America last month. Most of its
destruction was caused by the system's snail-like pace and its
persistent rains, which drenched the region for days, causing
landslides in the mountainous terrain that buried thousands under
sheets of mud.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hurricane Andrew, ranked as a category four to
category five storm, killed 41 people in Florida and Louisiana.
Andrew moved quickly, had less rain, and struck a mostly flat
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a hurricane's winds, its ability to create a storm
surge, or a dramatic rise in sea level, has traditionally been
another main factor in determining its strength. Yet a recent study
by a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center suggests that
most deaths from hurricanes in recent years have actually come from
flooding of rivers, rather than from storm surges, Jarrell said.
Coastal communities have developed effective evacuation plans,
which reduce the danger and deaths from storm surges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Saffir/Simpson scale may be more accurate in
describing hurricanes that travel over water and in coastal areas
than in measuring a storm's behavior on land, where the topography
often causes changes in its strength and speed, Leatherman said.
Hilly terrain can slow a hurricane, causing it to drench an area
with rain, creating mudslides, as in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   One idea for a new scale, Jarrell said, would be to devise a
list of factors such as rain and topography, among others, and
create a model weighting each factor on a scale. Another
possibility would be to have a list of factors that different
regions could consider to estimate how a hurricane would effect a
particular area.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jarrell noted, if a storm were over water, it would
go on a lower scale than one that moved over a populated area. If
people were well prepared, that would downgrade a storm. Hilly
terrain would enhance it, while striking an area with strict
building codes and zoning laws would lower the rating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose we list 50 factors, such as terrain, preparedness,
population, flash floods, etcetera,'' Jarrell said. ``You can go
down and see how it applies. I think there are ways to do this and
I think it's important.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, devising a scale that could apply to regions as diverse
as Central America's mountain ranges, Florida's flat topography and
the many island nations that dot the Caribbean could take years to
devise and may prove difficult to implement, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an excellent idea to have another measure of
possible damage that a storm can do,'' said Bruce Albrecht, a
professor of meteorology at the University of Miami. ``But from my
perspective it's hard to put hurricanes in a real category. There
is a wide range of variability among the systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a complex measuring stick that takes into account
many factors would also have to be one that people could easily
understand in order to know how to prepare for a storm, Albrecht
noted.
</P>
<P>
   And because the hurricane season, June 1 to Nov. 30, does not
produce that many storms, it may be difficult to make
generalizations about the characteristics of hurricanes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few dispute that the Saffir/Simpson scale probably did not
adequately portray Mitch's menace to the residents of Honduras and
Nicaragua who were aware of it days before the storm came ashore.
As it hurtled towards land, Mitch's winds increased to a maximum
strength of 180 miles an hour and then slowed considerably before
striking land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have relaxed people,'' Jarrell said. ``We expected
there to be a disaster, I don't think anyone expected 10,000 or
12,000 dead. I don't think we were giving the real flavor of the
impending disaster.''

`GRIMM TALES': FAIRY TALES THAT CAST SHADOWS ON SWEETNESS AND
LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You remember poor Ashputtel. Her wicked stepmother
and ugly stepsisters wouldn't let her go to the prince's big dance;
she was told to stay home and clean the fireplace instead. But
after a magical transformation, she went to the dance in a
glamorous new dress, won the prince's heart and lost her slipper.
</P>
<P>
   Ashputtel's familiar adventures make up one of the six folk
stories in ``Grimm Tales,'' the Young Vic's entertaining holiday
show at the New Victory Theater.
</P>
<P>
   All the stories are told the way Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm
collected and published them in the early 19th century, so the
young woman we know as Cinderella is Ashputtel and Little Red
Riding Hood is Little Red-Cap. Rumpelstiltskin, however, is still
Rumpelstiltskin.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Vic is a 28-year-old London theater company, and this,
its first visit to the United States, is largely a success.
Children in the audience at Sunday's afternoon performance seemed
especially to love being grossed out by the make-believe gore _
eyes plucked from sockets, ugly stepsisters cutting off toes and
heels to fit into the dainty slipper _ even though the realism
level was such that a ribbon of blood was an actual ribbon, long
and red.
</P>
<P>
   But the sketches, which are performed with no set and minimal
props, sometimes fall a little flat. The final one, ``Brother
Scamp,'' also exhibits a curious confused morality.
</P>
<P>
   Scamp is such a good guy that he gives three beggars (all of
them St. Peter in disguise) most of his bread and all but his last
shilling, but he lies about having eaten a lamb's heart (don't ask)
and is so upset when St. Peter won't accept a huge reward for
having healed the king's daughter that he gets nasty. (``Oh, you
cabbage head!'' he says to the saint.) Scamp takes the reward
himself, squanders it and gets into trouble while pretending to
have healing powers, but still tricks his way into heaven. Go
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Vic's specialty is presenting children's stories with
their adult origins intact; the Grimms, after all, called their
first collection ``Kinder- und Hausmarchen,'' tales for children
and the whole household. The company has definitely captured the
dark side. Andy Williams (not the singer), for instance, exudes a
strong sexual menace as the Wolf in ``Little Red-Cap.'' And it's
interesting to see what an important part wine played in the
original tales.
</P>
<P>
   The mother in ``The Golden Goose'' sends her first son out with
a homemade cake and ``an excellent bottle of wine.'' Little Red-Cap
carries cakes and wine to her grandmother and, after the trauma of
being eaten by the wolf and then cut out of his stomach, takes a
little nip herself. Deprivation is symbolized by a character's
being forced to drink ale or beer instead.
</P>
<P>
   None of the young theatergoers appeared traumatized by the dark
side of Grimm, although the loud music with drumming that
accompanied the wolf's ingestion of the grandmother seemed to make
a few of the very youngest cry. For children, this is a fairly long
production, more than two hours including intermission, but the
show's division into short segments seems to take care of the
attention-span problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Vic does everyone a service by presenting these
stories in their original form, but sheer silliness seemed equally
important to the audience. Two of the performance's biggest laughs
came when the golden goose started making a funny honking sound and
when a burly man made his entrance in an evening gown. The
Hedgehog's Wife ``washing and drying the children'' and hanging
them on the line was a nice moment, too.

A TRIBE CALLED QUEST: RAPPERS' FINAL PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of current rap groups, only A Tribe Called Quest
would end its last-ever performance with a song like ``Find a
Way,'' which innocently wonders about the point at which friendship
spills over into sex. Finishing a 75-minute set on Tuesday night at
Hammerstein Ballroom, the band's D.J., Jarobi White, shut down his
turntables, and the three rappers _ Q-Tip, Phife Dawg and Ali
Shaheed Muhammad _ huddled together repeating the song's chorus.
``Now you caught my heart for the evening,'' it went. ``Kissed my
cheek, move in, you confuse things/Should I just sit out? Help me
find my way.'' As parting shots go, it was a remarkably delicate
one.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop's increasingly exaggerated hardness, its ethic of
plundering and moving on, has turned into a major liability. Its
end result has been nearly total stasis in terms of its stars'
personas; though you can tell voices apart by their approach to
rhythm, it's getting harder to tell sensibilities apart. The lesson
has been that the projection of a tough, cold character eventually
does nothing for art; it flattens out all performers' styles.
</P>
<P>
   A Tribe Called Quest, whose Tuesday show was, as Q-Tip said, the
final New York performance of its 10-year career (its new album,
``The Love Movement,'' on Jive/MCA, is also its last), goes far
enough back in time to use what's now an element lost from hip-hop
_ the softer, more changeable emotions of male soul singers.
Q-Tip's voice, unusually high and boyish, is its promontory.
</P>
<P>
   The group used electric pianos and acoustic basses, intimating
jazz and making music that a fan could grow up with a bit rather
than discarding after adolescence; it was sexual, wry and funny,
coming with a range of expression that could include anger, satire,
constructive preaching and sentimentality; it was conscious of
black entertainment's past.
</P>
<P>
   The group's final show felt appropriately low key and
businesslike; it wasn't the stop-and-start chaos of most rap
concerts. The members, well rehearsed, worked in complete unity,
which few rap groups want to do anymore. They finished one
another's sentences; they worked out tag-team routines with their
words and bodies that became elaborate in ``Bonita Applebaum,'' ``I
Left My Wallet in El Segundo'' and ``Buggin' Out,'' as if the
performers were connected by pulleys.
</P>
<P>
   They took fans' requests, with the stipulation that they
wouldn't do songs that were hits or had been made into videos.
(That lasted for four or five songs, all of which they stopped
after a few verses.) And Q-Tip, noting the range of races in the
crowd and marveling at hip-hop's capacity to reach across young
audiences, took a moment to address the crowd: ``We sincerely want
to thank you for investing your time, because time is really
precious, and in hip-hop 10 years is unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   With the group, a sensibility worth aspiring to has vanished, a
kind of urbane restraint. It's not a good thing for hip-hop that
the band is gone.

FILMS CONTINUE TO PUSH ENVELOPE IN RATINGS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - ``Midnight Cowboy'' features a few bare butts and some
shots of a woman's left breast _ almost identical to the nudity in
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Last Tango in Paris,'' people grimace and groan in
off-camera sex _ which is exactly what we hear but don't quite see
in ``The Man in theIron Mask.''
</P>
<P>
   What's different about these films? ``Midnight Cowboy'' (1969)
and ``Last Tango'' (1973) were both rated X when they were
released, although they've now been revised to an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   The other two films _ marketed to include a preteen audience _
were rated PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   Have the standards of the American public changed that much in
25 years? Or is Hollywood up to something?
</P>
<P>
   The movie rating system, which is supposed to draw a definitive
line between adult and kid movies, has the moral certitude of
government officials committing youthful indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, the ratings had some starch. You could send
your kids to a PG movie and feel confident that they wouldn't be
surprised with sex, nudity, profanity or intense violence.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ratings flop all over the place, with today's PG-13
being closer to yesterday's R than you may want your kids to know.
Even the kid-safe G isn't completely safe anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Why do movie studios want to stretch the boundaries of the
ratings? Three reasons: marketing, marketing, marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Studio marketing departments aren't supposed to be in control of
movie ratings. Movies receive their ratings from the Motion Picture
Association of America, which claims to render independent
judgments on the questionable content of movies screened by its
ratings board.
</P>
<P>
   But guess who funds the MPAA? The movie studios.
</P>
<P>
   The MPAA was established by Hollywood's major studios to
pre-empt any government attempts at film censorship. The MPAA was a
love child of two films: ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,''which
talked frankly about sex, and ``Blowup,'' which showed it.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, neither of these films is particularly
startling. But in the mid-'60s, they were revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   The MPAA continues to be funded by the major studios. Expecting
the ratings board to go against the wishes of the studios that
finance it is like asking Congress to eliminate lobbying abuses.
They're not in the business of biting the hands that feed them.
</P>
<P>
   That's how we get big summer films such as ``Deep Impact,''
``Armageddon,'' ``Godzilla'' and ``The Mask of Zorro,'' which
contain profanity, nudity and violence but receive the mild PG-13
rating.
</P>
<P>
   The target audience for these movies is heavily teenage. An R
rating would keep some of them out, which would ruin profit
projections. Studios don't like to pour $150 million to $200
million into making movies and then watch an R rating limit their
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   An adventure movie such as ``Jurassic Park'' can have dinosaurs
chomping on lawyers and it will never get an R for violence. But
shoot those lawyers in a $20 million gangster movie, and you've got
an R.
</P>
<P>
   And the MPAA judgments keep getting a little more permissive
each year. Used to be that showing nudity or under-covers sex or
using America's favorite forbidden word got your film an R.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can use that f-word and still get a PG-13 rating, as
long as you don't use it to mean what it means. Casual cursing is
apparently OK for kids, according to the MPAA, but accurate cursing
is not.
</P>
<P>
   You can now show nudity, especially if it's from the rear, as
long as it's shown in a non-sexual context. That's how we get a
half-dozen naked men roped to a cactus in the PG-13 ``Mask of
Zorro'' or lingering shots of the topless Kate Winslet in the PG-13
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   You can even show people having sex as long as they're not naked
and as long as you could plausibly deny that's what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   If they're doing it under the covers, maybe they're just making
out in a PG-13 way or wrestling bedbugs in a PG style.
</P>
<P>
   That's how we get Will Farrell and Molly Shannon doing the
horizontal macarena under the covers in ``A Night at the Roxbury''
while enjoying the box-office benefits of a PG-13 rating. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Content secondary &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marketing always comes before content. ``Spice World,'' the
Spice Girls movie, had to be rated PG because it was pitched to
preteen girls. The rating board must have been looking the other
way when the male dancers turned around to reveal that their pants
had no bottoms but that they did.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what is the preteen, PG-rated message of five scantily
clad young women who sing songs about sex while adopting the
pouting poses of ``Playboy'' centerfolds and ``Cosmo'' cover girls?
</P>
<P>
   Sex may be what the Spice Girls really, really want, but a large
portion of the preteen allowance, enhanced by the PG rating, is
what the studio really, really wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost in Space,'' an adaptation of the old TV show, includes
freaky violence and sexual innuendos that are so obvious and clumsy
they would embarrass a TV sitcom writer. Well, maybe. But the movie
slipped through with a PG-13 rating. Why? The studio needed a young
audience for a film that was as corny as the TV show it was derived
from.
</P>
<P>
   Then why put in all the sex chatter? To make 13-year-old boys
giggle and to reassure nostalgic adults that they were seeing
something resembling an adult film.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the rating games are played to get PG-13s for R
films, another small blurring of the line occurs between PG and G
ratings with, of all things, animated films.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be Disney folks could be counted on to think about the
kids. Even when they killed Bambi's mother, they didn't show a
drooling hunter leering over her corpse, the kind of scene they
created for ``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules also are being stretched between R and NC-17, which
replaced the X a few years back. An NC-17 rating purportedly
prohibits anyone younger than 17 from being allowed into the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Very few films have received an NC-17 because it's too difficult
to market them, as the test cases of ``Henry &AMP; June'' and
``Showgirls'' demonstrated to the studios.
</P>
<P>
   So when ``Boogie Nights,'' a film about the porno-film industry,
came along, it had to receive an R to be profitable, even though
the movie contained a full frontal shot of a man's penis and more
rampant sex than ``Showgirls'' or ``Orgazmo,'' the last two films
to receive the NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   You can see clearly how the marketing works when the tables were
turned on Hollywood years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only three major pictures have ever been released with an MPAA X
rating: ``Midnight Cowboy,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' and ``Last
Tango in Paris,'' movies that would be considered mild R's today.
</P>
<P>
   But the MPAA never copyrighted the X rating, as it did with G,
PG and PG-13. So anyone was free to call his film an X-rated movie,
and the X rating soon became a marketing device for porno
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Art-film distributors got around the X by releasing their films
unrated. This is perfectly legitimate because the entire
movie-rating system is voluntary. In recent weeks, ``Second
Chances,'' a sweet tale about the rehabilitation of an injured girl
and a horse; ``Happiness,'' a bitter comedy about a dysfunctional
family that explores murder and pedophilia; and ``Gadjo Dilo,'' a
joyful and erotic Romanian romance, all have been released without
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible for a film to be submitted to the MPAA,
receive an NC-17 rating and then be released unrated or cut down to
an R. But before that happens, the film's marketers have milked the
publicity over the ratings furor to tempt audiences.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a ratings battle; it's marketing strategy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Why an R for `Ryan'?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk before the release of ``Saving Private
Ryan'' that the MPAA would rate the movie NC-17 for the graphic
violence of its battle scenes. No movie has ever received an NC-17
for violence, which can be far more graphically depicted than sex.
</P>
<P>
   The question going around: Would director Steven Spielberg
accept an NC-17 or go back and snip out a few seconds here and
there to tone down the violence and get the R? He never had to face
that issue because the MPAA gave the movie an R without the editing
it often requires of films that show people having sex not under
the covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' got the R despite its dismemberments, disembowelments,
shattered bodies and pools of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Was the less-restrictive rating a recognition of Spielberg's
superior filmmaking talents and the historical value of a movie
that honestly explores the butchery of mechanized warfare?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. If the board gave an NC-17 to ``Ryan'' for
violence, it would be obligated to give NC-17s to slasher and
horror flicks, such as ``Scream,'' that show even more intensely
graphic violence and have no socially redeeming value.
</P>
<P>
   Slasher flicks, which are always about sexy teenagers
encountering murderous madmen, are big moneymakers with teenage
audiences. And the intense violence is now being sold to even
younger kids by advertising these films as comic sendups of other
slasher flicks. Go to a horror movie these days and you'll see
parents who bring little kids, who would be shut out if these films
were rated NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has been part of theater since the Greeks, part of
movies since the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   What's changing in the movies is the increased intensity of the
violence. Youngsters, particularly boys, who watch a lot of violent
films and TV shows become dulled by violence and hardened to
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Violence is bad enough in movie theaters but even worse in video
stores. Why? Because studios take ultraviolent scenes that were cut
from theatrical release and reinsert them into films before they're
sent out for video rental.
</P>
<P>
   And as TV cop shows ratchet up the level of violence, movies
stay ahead by making their killings even more gory and penetrating
to the viewers' psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Will the race toward intense violence ever end? As long as TV
pushes the envelope from one end, movies will pull at the limits
from the other. The problem with ratings isn't that Hollywood makes
movies that contain sex, nudity, profanity and violence. Movies,
like books, cover the entire range of stories.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is truth in advertising. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The mis-rated films of 1998:
</P>
<P>
   G films that should have been rated PG:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' and ``Quest for Camelot'' (the intensity of the
villain's desire to slaughter everyone).
</P>
<P>
   PG films that should have been rated PG-13:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Education of Little Tree'' (innocent nudity, light
profanity), ``Washington Square'' (background sex), ``Spice World''
(male rear nudity, deep female cleavage), ``Wide Awake''
(profanity), ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' (violence).
</P>
<P>

the Iron Mask'' (graphic violence, nudity, sex), ``Mr. Nice Guy''

`THE NUTCRACKER,' AS A RITE OF PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were cries of horror and general consternation
when the New York City Ballet announced that George Balanchine
would create a ``Nutcracker'' for the company. How could that
revered avant-gardist pander so to public taste? Could the
chronically penny-counting company even afford to present a
``Nutcracker''?
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet production opened on Feb. 2, 1954, at City
Center, the company's home before Lincoln Center. A Christmastime
premiere would, perhaps, have gone a little too far in
accommodating public taste. Though now a landmark in the company's
50-year history, ``The Nutcracker'' had a mixed reception, as did
the 1892 original. John Martin, the dance critic for The New York
Times, advised audiences to arrive at the theater at ``about 10
o'clock when the adults take over.'' This was ``not much of a
ballet,'' he added, ``a loving and imaginative resurrection of a
decidedly mediocre work.''
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine's staging did have its early admirers, chief among
them the dance writer Edwin Denby.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Nutcracker' is a fantasy ballet for children, like a toy
that a grown-up makes with thoughtful care,'' Denby wrote in 1954.
``Grown-ups watching can slip back into a world they have left. The
buried longings of it are there glittering still, but so
charmingly, so lightly offered one doesn't have to notice.''
</P>
<P>
   A success at the box office, ``The Nutcracker'' was performed
for a full five weeks the next year; the ballet, in various
productions, has proved to be a cash cow for American ballet
companies ever since. And the City Ballet version, which opens
Friday night at the New York State Theater for a nearly five-week
run, has become a rite of passage for New York children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nutcracker'' is a rite of another kind for balletomanes,
who attend performances regularly to check on each new piece of
casting. Then there are those who, like Denby, are open to the
simple magic of the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   For Balanchine, the ballet centered on the Christmas tree that
grows to the top of the stage as the child Marie dreams _ or does
she dream? _ of bizarre events in the dark parlor after the last
party guests leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``George, can't you do it without the tree?'' Morton Baum, then
managing director of City Center, had asked plaintively. Baum had
budgeted $40,000 for the new production; the tree cost $25,000. But
Balanchine dug in his heels. The ballet, he insisted, was the tree.
</P>
<P>
   At City Center, Nancy Reynolds recalled in her book ``Repertory
in Review: 40 Years of the New York City Ballet,'' the scenery
looked homemade, especially the first Christmas tree, ``uncurling
and wheezing and puffing upward, growing gigantic to some of
Tchaikovsky's most glorious music.''
</P>
<P>
   In early performances, Lincoln Kirstein, a founder of City
Ballet, remembered, tiny bulbs wired to the tree continually
short-circuited, causing alarming special effects. Though
everything got bigger and slicker when City Ballet moved to the
larger stage of the New York State Theater in 1964, the tree, now
zooming awesomely upward, still gets its own round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   As a ballet student at the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg,
Russia, early this century, Balanchine performed several roles in
``The Nutcracker.'' For the City Ballet production, he kept much of
the original staging by Lev Ivanov. He also moved closer to the
story by E.T.A. Hoffmann, on which the ballet was based, of a
Christmas party in a 19th-century middle-class German home and of
two children's voyage to a candy kingdom. Jerome Robbins
choreographed the rowdy first-act battle of invading mice. But
there are many touches of pure Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine's love of gadgetry led him to put a galloping bed in
the midst of the first act and to create an ice-skating glide for
the Sugar Plum Fairy on a strip moving across the stage. His love
of dance ensured choreography that made the most of the dancers'
gifts in roles from the Sugar Plum Fairy and the Dewdrop, danced at
the first performance by Maria Tallchief and Tanaquil LeClercq, to
assorted child candy canes and angels and Marie and the Nutcracker
Prince, danced originally by Alberta Grant and Paul Nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine's production reminded Denby of something very like
the snow that falls at ``Nutcracker'' time onstage and outside the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each dance is instantly specific, it keeps its solidity as it
rushes through the air, and is instantly gone,'' Denby wrote. ``It
has the grandeur of being complete, of asking nothing, of creating
around its brief form a sense of airy stillness, of spacious
calm.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Ballet will perform ``The Nutcracker'' Friday
night at 8, Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m. at
the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. Limited tickets for
all shows this weekend are available for $15 and $25. Reservations:
(212) 307-4100.
</P>
<P>
   The lead roles of the Sugar Plum Fairy, Cavalier and Dewdrop
will be performed, respectively, by Kyra Nichols, Damian Woetzel
and Wendy Whelan (tonight); Miranda Weese, Jock Soto and Yvonne
Borree (tomorrow matinee and Sunday night); Ms. Nichols, Philip
Neal and Alexandra Ansanelli (tomorrow night) and Ms. Whelan, Nilas
Martins and Ms. Ansanelli (Sunday matinee).
</P>
<P>
   Performances continue through Jan. 3, with none on Christmas and
New Year's Day. Tickets: $10 to $80. Information and performance
schedule: (212) 870-5570.

VANS, JUST 15, IN MIDDLE AGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CHERYL JENSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years have passed since Lee A. Iacocca drove the first
modern minivan off a Chrysler Corp. assembly line in Windsor,
Ontario. That short trip, on Nov. 2, 1983, began a noteworthy
journey in which the minivan dethroned the station wagon as the
preferred utility vehicle of American families.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently, the minivan has become the object of snickers
and it has seemed at risk of being muscled aside by sport utilities
with comparable space plus a rugged image.
</P>
<P>
   Although the minivan segment is not growing, it is far from
dead. Auto makers are frantically working to lure new buyers with
vans that are safer, more exciting, more luxurious and more
practical.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Americans have purchased 1.2 million of the vans
each year for the last four years. Industry-wide, they account for
approximately 8 percent, or one in 10, of all new vehicles sold in
the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For this segment to remain viable, some significant demographic
challenges have to be dealt with, according to a 1998 report on the
compact van market by J.D. Power &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers are grappling with how to continue to appeal to baby
boomers (those aged, roughly, 35 to 50) as they move out of their
prime child-rearing years and how to attract the group that Power
calls Generation X'ers (25- to 35-year-olds) as they move into
their family-raising years.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers account for more than half of all minivan sales,
and they are loyal. When it is time to replace the old minivan, 40
percent purchase another, compared with only 36 percent of those
aged 25 to 35, according to another J.D. Power report.
</P>
<P>
   Although minivans appeal to people with children, this report
found that those in the 25-to-35-year-old group appeared to be
marrying later, or perhaps not at all. When they do have children,
the report said, they are more inclined to buy sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   These buyers appear to be rejecting the minivans of their
parents, much as their parents rejected the station wagons that
they had grown up with.
</P>
<P>
   One surprising finding about minivans _ and what may be part of
their salvation _ is that children are not required. J.D. Power
says that a third of all compact vans sold in 1997 went to families
without children, said Paul Ballew, chief economist and senior
director of automotive analysis at J.D. Power.
</P>
<P>
   Such a high number bolsters the idea that minivans are not dead.
Also, 85 percent of the buyers without children were over 50,
suggesting that minivans may have a future as utility vehicles for
older buyers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that what these older buyers will want, and can
afford, is pampering. Just as most consumers older consumers move
upscale in their vehicle choices, ``the same thing will be true for
the people who want to be in minivans,'' said Susan G. Jacobs, an
auto industry analyst in Rutherford, N.J. ``So at least within the
empty nester group, the people who stay in minivans are more likely
to prefer luxury versions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A prime example is Chrysler's Town &AMP; Country Limited, a step up
from the already luxurious Town &AMP; Country LXi, with special trim, a
distinctive interior and even an umbrella holder. It is aimed at
retaining van customers and attracting luxury car owners. And
Chrysler may be onto something: Town &AMP; Country sales rose to 73,188
in 1997 from 33,695 in '95.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile is offering its Silhouette Premiere, and the Ford
Motor Co. is positioning its redesigned 1999 Windstar SEL (which
last year was called the Limited) against the Town &AMP; Country
Limited. It has a leather interior and just about every feature is
standard, including dual power sliding doors, side-impact air bags
and a sensor that warns the driver if there is something in the
path of the vehicle as it backs up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that even in the pamper-me arena, the minivan
faces competition from its nemesis, the luxury sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very dynamic, fast-paced environment,'' Ballew said.
``And, because of that, we're all sitting back here scratching our
heads a bit and trying to get our arms around it. The key is that
it doesn't add up to the demise of the segment, but it does add up
to a very competitive future.'' &QL;

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting televisions and videocassette players in vans is nothing
new. Builders of custom vans have been doing it for years. But
buying a custom van has often meant accepting all that goes with
it: crushed velour curtains, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the size and shape of traditional cathode-ray TV's
usually require a ``pop-top'' _ a reinforced fiberglass roof into
which the monitor is mounted _ that can raise a vehicle's height to
more than 7 feet, barring it from many parking decks. Thus owners
of TV-equipped custom vans may find themselves exiled from that
most sacred of American soil: the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile's new Premiere edition of the Silhouette minivan
solves that problem by using a compact liquid-crystal-display
monitor as the centerpiece of its integrated entertainment system.
Similar to the personal LCDs in the upper-class sections of
jetliners, the Silhouette's monitor folds into the ceiling when not
in use.
</P>
<P>
   The system (which has inputs for video games and camcorders) may
delight sojourning parents who would otherwise have to endure long
bouts of familial closeness with their children. But don't expect
the Palm d'Or from neighborhood film critics.
</P>
<P>
   If in a cinephilic moment you have ever bemoaned the fate of
films adapted to the small screen, the Silhouette's tiny display
will leave you sobbing like the last scene in ``Old Yeller'' _ and
squinting, besides.
</P>
<P>
   At the video store, you can pretty much rule out the works of
David Lean, Sidney Pollock or Vittorio Storraro, or any movie with
the word ``sweeping'' in the box blurbs. Also, since LCDs tend to
wash out in direct sunlight, the Premiere's display is unkind to
dark movies involving menacing asteroids, sinking luxury liners
and/or Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   So, ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' no. ``The Water Boy,'' sure.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that since the system does not receive broadcast
signals (or even cable), you will be captive to the same movies
over and over for as long as your trip shall last. Stay away from
story lines that might give the youngsters ideas, like ``Children
of the Corn'' or ``Battleship Potemkin.''
</P>
<P>
   On balance, though, the Silhouette Premiere might well be the
ultimate family vacation vehicle. The audio system accommodates
four sets of headphones, so that the rear passengers _ be they
youngsters or elders _ can each listen to the movie, radio or
Nintendo while the folks up front listen to a CD or carry on a
conversation (a far-fetched notion, I grant you).
</P>
<P>
   When the front compartment's stereo system is switched off, the
video soundtrack can be played through the speakers with
self-deafening effect. Note to Celine Dion: Less is more.
</P>
<P>
   The CD unit, videotape player and videocassette storage rack are
stacked neatly under the center console of the dashboard; the
screen flips down between the headrests for the front seats.
Despite the tidy packaging it is a bit of a contortion for the
passengers to move to and from the back of the van.
</P>
<P>
   The system includes a handy remote control _ which, like the
headphones, was stolen from our $31,345 test vehicle, proof that
some people will steal about anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Premiere comes larded with every convenience in General
Motors' minivan repertoire. Twin sliding doors yawn wide for
back-seat access; the passenger-side door is powered so that a
slight tug on the handle will send it on its way (there is a child
safety lock as well as a pinch-protection program to protect little
fingers). Vacation-wise features include a sturdy roof rack, an
oversized rear cargo door and a heavenly host of cup holders, map
pockets, cargo netting, convenience lights and electrical outlets.
There is even a built-in air pump in the back for inflating kiddie
pools or novelty gifts.
</P>
<P>
   While the Silhouette can be had with eight-passenger seating
(including two integrated child safety seats), the Premiere version
kicks appointments up a notch with a second row of reclining
leather captain's chairs and a third row of 50/50 split-bench
seating.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat, the Premiere feels a lot like other GM
products, which trade a degree of refinement and personality for
the cost advantages of standardization.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers enamored of the high seating positions of sport utilities
will like the Premiere's power-adjustable seats. I am over 6 feet
tall. Standing outside the vehicle, I can adjust the seat height
from knee level to nearly hip-high, where it is actually higher
than those of many sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanically, the Premiere _ while lacking the silken solidity
of, say, the Toyota Sienna _ does everything asked of it with quiet
competence. The 3.4-liter V6 engine produces a bit more power (185
horsepower) than it used to, and it's smoother than I remember.
</P>
<P>
   The Premiere rides on a touring-tuned suspension with automatic
load leveling, stiffer shocks, anti-roll bars and 15-inch radial
tires. This setup helps: The ride is firm but comfortable and
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Roomy, versatile and well-equipped for the price, the Silhouette
Premiere will be a godsend to buyers whose children suffer
boredom-induced behavior meltdowns on long trips. I also suspect
that a few kid-frazzled parents will sneak out to the driveway at
night with a blanket, a bottle of wine and an old movie. Ah, alone
at last!  &QL;

WHEN A BOSS TURNS ABUSIVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I recently received a promotion, but my new boss
dislikes me and has been verbally abusive, to the point of using an
obscene term to describe me in front of my colleagues. (I reported
the incident to the department head.) Obviously, this behavior
can't go on. What are my rights? Can I sue?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. In America, everyone has the right to sue. You could claim
defamation of character or infliction of emotional harm. With luck,
Judge Judy would hear your case on TV. But that wouldn't
necessarily solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Your recent promotion indicates that your grievance isn't with
the company, but with the cretin to whom you've been assigned. You
need to target your counterattack more precisely than with a
lawsuit. In short, it's time to get personal.
</P>
<P>
   First, do a little detective work, advises Joel Neuman, director
of the Center for Applied Management at the State University of New
York at New Paltz. ``Is this common?'' he asked. ``Has your manager
done this to others?'' If so, you have additional ammunition for
your case. If not, you may find that your boss has short-term
personal problems that are making him hot-tempered.
</P>
<P>
   After sizing up the situation, confront your tormentor privately
(and quickly, since you've spoken to the department head). When you
aren't in the heat of the moment, the two of you just might be able
to resolve _ or at least clarify _ the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The step you've already taken _ going over your boss' head _
should have been a last resort. The outcome is rarely happy; the
sad reality is that management (like the rest of us) often suffers
from an us-versus-them mentality, and just finding a senior person
to back you up can be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if the department head hired and trained your
nemesis, he's probably your boss' ally, said Gary Namie, a
psychologist in Benicia, Calif., who started the Campaign Against
Workplace Bullying. In that case, you'll need to go even higher up
the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that you find a sympathetic ear, take care when
outlining your complaint. Don't expect management to take you
seriously if you get all weepy. Lay out your case as impersonally
as possible and try to show how the situation is hurting the
department's performance, Namie said. Wonder aloud whether your
boss' actions have become apparent to customers or are undermining
staff morale.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the your-word-against-his trap, try to round up
witnesses. Most employees will be less than eager to get involved,
but you can probably convince a few to confirm public incidents.
Your boss' habit of carrying on like a deranged harpy in front of
others should make this easier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even if you succeed and your boss is reprimanded, you
can expect relations to worsen radically. Consider pushing for
reassignment to a new manager or division. Barring that, it may be
time to start thinking about moving on. If you thought your boss
was unpleasant to begin with, just wait until he learns that you've
squealed.

MONEY LESSONS FOR CHILDREN (AND PARENTS)

<P>
   When John and Lisa Manuele of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., make cash
gifts to their two sons for birthdays, Christmas and special events
like first communion or confirmation, they emphasize how hard they
worked to earn the money and urge the boys to use it wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Manuele suggests spending part of it for something they really
want, saving part of it and giving part of it to charity. ``I feel
it's important to pass the values I have on to them,'' he said.
``My grandfather did that for my father, and he did it for me, so I
want to do it for them, and I hope they will for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manueles also regularly give the boys _ Matthew, 11, and
Andrew, 8 _ larger amounts for college savings, and Mrs. Manuele, a
brokerage firm executive, decides how to invest it. ``For small
amounts of money,'' she said, ``mutual funds are generally best
because of the diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's financial adviser, Martin L. Greenberg, a partner
in the New York accounting firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin, likes
the tax advantages of giving to children. Under the Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act, an account may be owned by a child for tax purposes,
but the parent or other adult custodian controls it, generally
until the child is 18 or 21, depending on the state.
</P>
<P>
   The first $700 of income each year is tax-free; the next $700 is
taxed at the child's rate, generally 15 percent. After that, income
is taxed at the parents' rate until a child is 14, when all income
is taxed at the child's rate.
</P>
<P>
   That means a sizable account balance can be built up before the
income is subject to the parents' tax rate _ and if the holdings
are in growth stocks paying little or no dividends, there may be no
taxable income until the shares are sold to pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other parents, the Manueles are combining different
purposes in making financial gifts to their children _ salting away
savings for their college educations and teaching them the
practical lessons of handling money and the virtues of thriftiness
and generosity. But there is no one-size-fits all strategy for
these goals.
</P>
<P>
   David B. Rhine, partner and national director of family-wealth
planning for BDO Seidman, the accounting firm, said parents fell
roughly into three groups: those with incomes low enough that their
children are likely to qualify for financial aid for college;
middle-class people, whose incomes are above the aid level but who
must save regularly to meet college costs without borrowing, and
the affluent, who are not worried about college costs but make big
gifts to get assets out of their taxable estates.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever a family's finances, Rhine said, a gift to a teen-ager
of a small checking account or low-limit credit card will offer
invaluable experience in financial management. It is in disbursing
the ``heavy-duty money'' that approaches vary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhine advises parents in the first group: ``Build up your own
retirement savings. It's very much pay as you go _ you can't make
up a year that you missed.'' Some people struggle to put money into
a child's account and then find scholarships reduced as a result,
he noted. ``If the parent builds up his own 401(k), the money is on
his court, not at the kid's end,'' he added, ``so it won't be
counted in the formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, if no aid is received, parents can withdraw retirement
money. Beginning this year, the 10 percent tax penalty on early IRA
withdrawals is waived if the money is used for qualified education
expenses, and many 401(k) plans allow loans.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-income group may want to make regular gifts of
securities, using a Uniform Gifts to Minors account. And the
wealthy may want to make sizable gifts _ individuals may give
$10,000 a year to an unlimited number of recipients with no gift or
estate tax consequences. Because college payments do not count
against the $10,000, Rhine noted, this group may prefer paying
those costs directly.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lockwood, president of Lockwood Pension Services Inc. in
New York, said many parents set up trusts for gifts to children so
they can control the money longer _ even to age 35 _ to make sure
it isn't wasted on sports cars or ski trips. But trusts can cost
several thousand dollars to establish, and some carry no tax
benefits unless the dividends and earnings are distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids will do the right thing,'' Lockwood said. ``In 98
percent of the cases, it is not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian H. Breuel of Princeton, N.J., author of ``Staying
Wealthy,'' (Bloomberg Press, 1998) recommended that people who want
to make sizable holiday gifts to their children give stocks or
other securities, not cash, ``because it is less likely to be
spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents go to great lengths to leaven monetary gifts with
symbolic significance. ``One of my clients likes to give his
children $1,000 apiece for each day of Hanukkah, plus $1,000 each
for the ninth candle and for birthdays,'' said Avery E. Neumark, a
principal at Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin. ``So there's the
$10,000.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is a selective listing by critics of The New
York Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this
weekend in New York City. Ratings and running times are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN HISTORY X,' starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong and
Beverly D'Angelo. Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes). Flawed
but gut-slugging, renounced by its director yet still a showcase
for his effective style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead who
develops a heart of gold presses every possible hot button. And its
toughest images stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizement,
presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials,
spins out of control. In a show of De Niro-like fury and
versatility, Norton plays a savage, racist killer who learns the
error of his ways through simple-minded but brutally effective plot
devices and efforts to protect his younger brother (Furlong).
Hotheaded and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `BELOVED,' starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton
and Kimberly Elise. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 172 minutes). A
transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, with
all the complexity (and occasional opacity) that entails. Taking on
the most enticing yet daunting job of literary adaptation since
``The English Patient,'' Demme succeeds in bringing the novel's
pulse to the screen. Though it begins too slowly and literally,
this daring effort escalates into a gripping, imaginative film that
mixes memories of slavery with the occult and that isn't quite like
any other. Its linchpin, Ms. Winfrey, is more often a person acting
than an intuitive actress. But she plays her character, a one-time
slave haunted by her past, with enough presence to hold the film
together. The other major performances are extraordinary,
especially Ms. Newton's in the bizarre title role. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELEBRATION,' directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 100
minutes). Working under a set of self-imposed restrictions that are
meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty, this Danish
director shows off dazzling ingenuity. The story of a family
reunion that becomes a black-tie, psyche-bashing blowout is told
with a hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or
sound, and the effect is invigorating rather than austere.
Imaginative angles, nimble editing and fluid, agile camera work
keep the film spinning as a large Danish cast makes the festivities
seem utterly real. The central drama is Shakespeare for the
tell-all age, as a patriarch is haunted by past sins and vengeful
children. ``It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,'' says one
partygoer, putting it mildly. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `CELEBRITY,' starring Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis and Melanie
Griffith. Directed by Woody Allen (R, 113 minutes). Following in
the footsteps of ``La Dolce Vita,'' Allen presents a New York in
which the only thing worse than being famous for nothing is not
being famous at all. At the center of it all he places Branagh as a
journalist with all the Allen tics but none of the filmmaker's
comic flair. The bitter breakup at the center of the film (with Ms.
Davis as the journalist's beached wife) is regularly upstaged by
guest-star segments, a few of which stand out in witty relief
against an otherwise weary backdrop. Charlize Theron dazzles as a
capricious, headstrong model, and Ms. Griffith plays a pampered
movie diva with aplomb. Best of all is Leonardo DiCaprio's brief,
wicked appearance as a bad-boy wonder. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room
for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all in
the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond and then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough, bravura performance is one of the year's
very best. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `DANCING AT LUGHNASA,' starring Meryl Streep, Brid Brennan,
Michael Gambon, Kathy Burke and Catherine McCormack. Directed by
Pat O'Connor (PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as are the
other principals here, in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from
Brian Friel's delicate play. And if O'Connor has lost some of the
play's intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly, he's also
gained a good deal in the way of lovely Irish scenery and quaint
rural charm. Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five
unmarried sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the
return of their gently eccentric brother from many years'
missionary work in Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this
beguilingly atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter
these characters' lives. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Queen Elizabeth I
as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the monarch
as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled,
selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the
hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, it's historical drama for
those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on
spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene
reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the
queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman, afflicted by a
super-intense case of having it all. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `ENEMY OF THE STATE,' starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon
Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes).
Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos
are a main attraction. He also carries the story ably in his first
real leading role, that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds
himself under surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National
Security Agency and a satellite in space. Fortunately, it all
hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop for plot questions.
Sterling cast members like Hackman as an eccentric technology wiz
and Voight as a chilly advocate of surveillance tactics add an
additional touch of class. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at the end of the year,
McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, playing the
gay ``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the
aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming
back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the
Adonis-like form of the gardener (Fraser, also fine), whom Whale
finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and
heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what
Whale's final days may have been like while shaping a splendid
character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood.
Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's
perpetually scandalized housekeeper. (Janet Maslin)

   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams, Dylan Baker, Philip Seymour
Hoffman and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Todd Solondz (not rated;
135 minutes). In a much bigger film than his ``Welcome to the Doll
House,'' this audacious, deadpan filmmaker explores loneliness in
his murderously funny fashion. Outrageous touches _ none more so
than its title _ come easily to ``Happiness,'' and so do the dark
secrets that would surely have brought it an NC-17 rating. No point
in cataloging this film's perverse details: What emerges most
clearly is a ruthless yet tender portrait of suburban characters
seeking romance, captured with enough acid precision to make this a
``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional
times. Ms. Adams plays the dartboard in a three-sister family with
hilarious tremulousness. Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming
pederast who is also a respected doctor and a loving father is
impossible to forget. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `HOME FRIES,' starring Drew Barrymore. Directed by Dean Parisot
(PG-13, 105 minutes). An absurdist satire of sex, sibling rivalry,
Oedipal ties, homicidal jealousy, fast food and helicopters in the
American heartland, ``Home Fries'' isn't funny enough in its
particulars to make you break up laughing, but at least it tries
for a sophistication beyond the typical gross-out Hollywood comedy.
Most of the humor comes from the collision of caricatures that
suggest refugees from ``Tobacco Road,'' reinvented for a '90s
version of the classic '70s sitcom ``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.''
Ms. Barrymore, who is winsome throughout, plays a very pregnant
server at a burger outlet who falls in love with the stepson of her
recently deceased married lover. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER,' starring Jennifer Love
Hewitt and Brandy. Directed by Danny Cannon (R, 105 minutes). The
body count is higher, the shock effects are cruder, the screams are
louder in the depressingly inept sequel to the blockbuster ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer.'' If the original film suggested a modern
teen-age version of Poe's ``Telltale Heart,'' the sequel is a
farcical shock-free blood bath set mostly in the Bahamas. Here is
where the still guilt-stricken Julie James (Ms. Hewitt) and her
best friend, Karla (the pop singer Brandy), spend a
hurricane-drenched Fourth of July after winning a vacation there,
and where the same killer rises again, deadly fishhook in hand.
(Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funny man dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `LIVING OUT LOUD,' starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen
Latifah. Directed by Richard LaGravenese (R, 102 minutes). Making
his directorial debut, LaGravenese, a sensitive screenwriter,
remains very much a writer, constructing a talky, introspective
character study laced with flights of musical fantasy. Ms. Hunter
stiffly but passionately plays a newly divorced woman trying to
reinvent her life. DeVito is warmly credible as a lonely elevator
man who cares for her. Queen Latifah is the film's most
attention-getting figure in the small but glamorous role of a
torchy nightclub singer. Would-be Chekhovian touches abound in this
story of lonely people, but they don't make it jell. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `MEET JOE BLACK,' starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Claire
Forlani. Directed by Martin Brest (PG-13, 170 minutes). Hopkins
zestily plays a noble tycoon in this otherwise somnolent,
emotion-free, nearly three-hour(!) weepie. And Pitt appears blankly
as Death with blond highlights, serving as a kind of personal
afterlife trainer to the tycoon, whose number is up. Ms. Forlani
plays the big man's beautiful daughter in a story based on ``Death
Takes a Holiday.'' In a suffocatingly lavish film that cries out
for a trip to the cutting room, virtually every character is
allowed to overstay his or her welcome, with Pitt especially
diminished by the watching-paint-dry pace. The story drags on so
slowly that there's room for a subplot about party planning, and
several scenes establish how much Death loves peanut butter. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `PLEASANTVILLE,' starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan
Allen, William H. Macy and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Gary Ross
(PG-13, 116 minutes). This cleverly executed fantasy, with a
back-to-the-future trip into the small-town, squeaky-clean paradise
of a 1950s television show, tends toward the black and white,
visually and otherwise. The missionary zeal with which teen-agers
from the 1990s try to awaken benighted '50s types from their
slumber is an attitude that wears thin. But in the meantime there
are witty tricks integrating color into black-and-white images, and
nice little touches abound. The cast is poignant and amusing, with
Ms. Allen especially touching as a prefeminist housewife who's the
prime recipient of '90s hindsight. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE RUGRATS MOVIE,' starring the voices of Tara Charendoff and
Tim Curry. Directed by Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov (G, 90
minutes). Dil Pickles is not the first baby whose resentful older
sibling wanted to return him to the hospital, but he's probably the
only one who has such an interesting trip back. Dil (full name:
Dylan Preston Pickles) is the newborn hero of the first film
starring the five talking babies of Nickelodeon's hit children's
series ``Rugrats.'' The pleasant surprise is that the film is a
delight, from encounters with wolves, wizards and circus monkeys in
the forest to musical numbers at the ``baby store.'' There's
material for grown-up moviegoers, too, including a scene with some
pathetic reporters who turn up at the Pickles house when the
children disappear, getting everybody's name wrong and asking, ``Is
it true a dingo ate your baby?'' (Anita Gates).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIEGE,' starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and
Bruce Willis. Directed by Edward Zwick (R, 109 minutes). This
thriller about Arab terrorists in New York City starts out in
crisply efficient style, then evolves into a speechifying
consideration of civil liberties and constitutional rights. The FBI
(Washington, bringing teasing charm to an officious role), the CIA
(Ms. Bening as one brusque Mata Hari) and the military (Willis,
sneering evilly) all lock horns in a story that eventually sees New
York under martial law. (Inexplicably, the city's mayor doesn't
weigh in about this.) The screenplay is talky and carefully
evenhanded. It's much less forceful than the film's salacious
images of terrorism and Arab villains. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS,' starring Peter Horton and Liz
Stauber. Directed by Brett Leonard (not rated; 45 minutes).
Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two
``Jurassic Park'' films are likely to be requited by this latest
Imax 3-D film. Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic
are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into
paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships.
Seen in 3-D and set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees
of the Olympic rain forest in the state of Washington, these
creatures seem marvelously lifelike. Better yet, ``T-Rex,'' written
by Andrew Gellis and Jeanne Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its
technological splendors. Its time-tripping story takes the viewer
to a paleontological dig, raises unanswered scientific questions
and introduces some of the major figures in the history of the
subject. To be sure, seeing ``T-Rex'' won't qualify anyone for a
doctorate in paleontology, and an intriguing subplot that hints at
a troubled family background for its teen-age heroine is left
unresolved; but the film is likely to whet active young minds to
learn more about the past. At Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, 1998
Broadway, at 68th Street, New York. (Lawrence Van Gelder)
</P>
<P>
   `A TOUCH OF EVIL,' Anyone familiar with Orson Welles' 1958
film-noir landmark knows that it could just as well have been
called ``A Truckload of Evil,'' and that its crazily sinister plot
turns and breathtaking camera work remain astonishingly fresh. ``A
Touch of Evil'' is, among so many things, the other film to find
Janet Leigh at a lonely motel under strangely menacing management,
and the one in which Welles gave one of his most droll, swaggering
performances as a corrupt police captain in an American town on the
Mexican border. As visually thrilling as it is sin-soaked, this
artfully reconstructed version of ``A Touch of Evil'' remains one
of the brightest lights on the cinematic landscape this season.
(Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `VELVET GOLDMINE,' starring Ewan McGregor, Jonathan Rhys Meyers,
Christian Bale and Toni Collette. Directed by Todd Haynes (R, 117
minutes). This dazzlingly surreal film reimagines the glam-rock
'70s as a brave new world of electrifying theatricality and sexual
possibility. And it offers a celestial ``Here's looking at you,
kid'' to the era's British pop flamboyance in general and to David
Bowie's chameleon heyday in particular. Haynes (``Safe''), a deeply
serious yet wildly experimental stylist, draws on influences from
Ken Russell to ``Citizen Kane'' to Fassbinder and winds up telling
his neo-psychedelic story the way operas do: blazing with exquisite
yet abstract passions, and with quite a lot to look at on the side.
An interest in its subject matter isn't a prerequisite for
penetrating the nostalgic world of ``Velvet Goldmine,'' but it
helps. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WAKING NED DEVINE,' starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly and
Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes).
Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket
in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to
be dead. Bannen and Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots
who concoct a plot to claim the winnings, and who unite the town's
cast of hearty characters in the process. Jones' prize-winning
career directing television commercials means that everyone here is
an amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the
septuagenarian stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for
all they're worth. This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of ``The
Full Monty,'' but it knows how to coax laughs from making a
spectacle of elderly gentlemen in the buff. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE WATERBOY,' starring Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates and Fairuza
Balk. Directed by Frank Coraci (PG-13, 91 minutes). The team behind
``The Wedding Singer'' looks like honorary Farrelly brothers with a
comedy that, like ``There's Something About Mary,'' is both
cheerfully outlandish and genuinely endearing. Sandler plays an
amazing 31-year-old freshman who morphs from water-distribution
engineer to sports hero, and he succeeds in doing to football
whatever he did to golf in ``Happy Gilmore.'' There's a lot more
innocence to his happy-idiot antics here than there is in many a
film made for children. Ms. Bates is a great hoot as the waterboy's
overprotective mama, perfectly in tune with the film's sneaky sense
of fun. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   THE POWER OF GLAMOUR. The title of the series at the American
Museum of the Moving Image says it all. Its 25 films celebrate the
careers of 11 actresses who set the patterns for Hollywood-style
stardom: Constance Bennett, Claudette Colbert, Joan Crawford,
Dolores Del Rio, Marlene Dietrich, Kay Francis, Greta Garbo,
Katharine Hepburn, Carole Lombard, Norma Shearer and Gloria
Swanson. Saturday at 2 p.m., Crawford is the center of attention as
the co-star with Clark Gable in Clarence Brown's ``Possessed''
(1931), playing a small-town factory worker who becomes a
millionaire's kept woman. At 4 p.m., directed by George Cukor, she
is the co-star with Melvyn Douglas in ``A Woman's Face'' (1941) as
a bitter, disfigured woman. On Sunday at 2 p.m., the focus shifts
to screwball comedy, with two Lombard vehicles, Gregory La Cava's
``My Man Godfrey'' (1936), with William Powell, followed at 4 by
William Wellman's ``Nothing Sacred'' (1937), with Fredric March.
Admission to the series, continuing through Jan. 3 at the museum,
34-12 36th St., at 35th Avenue, Astoria, Queens, is $8.50 for
adults, $5.50 for people over 65 and students with identification,
$4.50 for children 5 to 18 and free to children under 4.

CAN'T LIVE WITH IT, OR WITHOUT IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LINDA CAROLL MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once heard one friend offer another this observation about
romance: ``It's not serious until he reveals his paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   I was tempted to blurt out, ``That's ridiculous!'' But memory
stopped me. After all, my husband and I were practically engaged
before we felt comfortable making any confessions about salaries.
And a quick poll of our friends bore a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   While most of us wouldn't hesitate to ask a confidant about his
love life, his paycheck is a different story. Sex may be private,
but it is rarely secret. Money, however, is the best-kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder. Mixed messages about money surround us. At some
point, we have all been taught that money is the root of all evil,
that it does not buy happiness or, as the song goes, love.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, notorious for making its elite obscenely rich, has
always preached the villainy of wealth. See the humble, poor hero
outwit the selfish, rich snob. (Think ``Titanic.'') Watch the
leading lady escape wealth and find the path to happiness. (Think
``Titanic'' again.)
</P>
<P>
   And yet, save for a few eccentric starving artists, we rarely
find people in real life who brag about their humble circumstances.
When discussing our current status, the popular strategy seems to
be to subtly give the impression of having means.
</P>
<P>
   You might, for example, work the phrase, ``I prefer Paris in the
fall'' into a conversation. Well, maybe that's not so subtle, but
you get the idea. The trick is to have money, but not to act as if
you have a lot of it, while making people assume that you have a
lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   And if you (italics)do(end italics) have a lot of it, by all
means veil its source. Was it inherited? Won? Earned? Borrowed? Let
them wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say family customs involving money are loaded with
emotional issues of control, power, security and love. I don't have
many financial memories of my childhood _ I know that I had what I
needed and most of what I wanted. But I do remember my first brush
with real wealth.
</P>
<P>
   It came in college. A dorm-mate offered me a ride home, never
bothering to mention that the driver would be her family's
chauffeur. While she enjoyed easy banter with the uniformed driver,
I was tongue-tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stop at the next Pizza Hut for lunch,'' she directed,
with comfortable authority and without a hint of snobbery. I sat in
stupid silence, amazed at her ease. The only person I had ever
commanded with such confidence was my 9-year-old little brother _
and with fewer results. So this was what it was like to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I was in my late 20s, a friend likened our circle of
newlywed peers to teams at the start of a race. Sensing injustice
at having poor earning power despite a rich education (a PhD in
biochemistry), she was the first of my friends to express the
strain of reconciling her personal worth with her bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we are older and, we like to think, wiser, this kind of
questioning is far more common and the cause for some puzzling
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The few people I know who have acquired wealth seem as
uncomfortable as those without it. My brother says little when
asked about his work _ a successful career that finds him lavishly
entertaining clients in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   I think he is quiet because he does not want to be perceived as
pompous. (He isn't.) And I'm certain that he is quiet because he
fears he is at risk of losing the right to whine about his job. (He
is.)
</P>
<P>
   I once read an article about a support group for the born rich.
Its members struggled to find purpose in their lives because the
usual mission, to support oneself and one's family, was absent. So
I suppose that even the rich can be conflicted about money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My own ambivalence surfaces in my response to the question,
``What do you do for a living?'' I am slow to confess full-time
motherhood to the preschool aide who works three jobs, but I
wouldn't hesitate to tell the doctor next door.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for our confusion is that we hate to acknowledge
how much money changes our lives, how it gives us opportunities. In
the United States, we like to believe in equality. We talk
endlessly of leveling the playing field, of equal rights and
access. We don't want to admit that money makes an irreconcilable
difference in individual lives, in opening doors to education,
training or experience.
</P>
<P>
   Might I have been a deft polo player? Perhaps, but who cares?
Yet if Johnny the Drug Lord could have been a skilled surgeon, it
is tragic if he didn't have the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we are ready for a new brand of psychology. Call it
financial psychology. It might be interesting to hear all those
popular catch phrases like ``enabler,'' ``codependent'' and
``self-actualized'' applied to our fiscal lives. And imagine the
eyebrows I could raise when I told friends that I was off to see my
financial therapist. &QL;

THE ECONOMY GROWS. THE SMOKESTACKS SHRINK.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America is putting on an unusual spectacle: The economy keeps
growing and thriving even while manufacturing suffers and falls
behind.
</P>
<P>
   That rarely happens, and its appearance now reopens the
long-debated question of whether manufacturing still matters. The
issue is particularly pertinent because manufacturers have been
insisting, with much chest-thumping, that they have made American
factories the most efficient in the world today. The Asian crisis,
they argue, is only a temporary setback in a turnaround that is not
yet evident in the data.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of manufacturing's shrinking role in the economy
shows up everywhere. The Olin Corp. has just announced the closing
of a factory that makes copper rods, wires and tubes; imports cost
less.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Consumer Electronics recently shut the last factory in
the United States making television sets, replacing it with a plant
in Juarez, Mexico, where labor is so much cheaper. IBM, Dell
Computer and others assemble computers from parts increasingly made
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Once the kingpin of the economy, manufacturing in 1997 accounted
for only about 17 percent of the wages, salaries, benefits and
profits generated within the United States, the Commerce Department
reported this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis has been particularly hard on
manufacturers, denying them sales abroad while cutting costs for
their overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdote and statistic alike suggest that the slide is not
easily reversed. Even the sophisticated equipment that American
manufacturers buy for their factories _ computer-controlled
machines, for example, that cut and shape metal _ now come mostly
from Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing has been losing momentum for decades, with its
share of the gross domestic product dwindling to just over half of
what it was in 1953, the peak postwar year. That year,
manufacturing yielded 29.6 percent of personal compensation and
corporate profits; by 1989, the eve of the last recession, its
share had fallen to 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that we can go too far down,'' said the
economist Robert Hayes, an expert in manufacturing at Harvard
University. ``But I don't know how far too far is. I would have
thought 10 years ago that where we are now was too far. But we are
still humming along.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland is the only developed nation whose manufacturing has
diminished further than in the United States, and it regards itself
as vulnerable, Hayes said. The Swiss are still active in
pharmaceuticals and machinery manufacturing, but banking and
tourism play ever bigger roles as sources of wages and profits. And
these days, banks can leave a country through mergers even faster
than factories.
</P>
<P>
   Factories leave fast enough. What still surprises so many
executives, Hayes said, is ``how quickly less-developed nations
have been able to master advanced manufacturing techniques and
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory at least, any nation should be able to function quite
nicely with a diminished manufacturing sector. The huge and growing
service sector _ retailers, banks, insurers, law firms, hotel
operators, restaurants, phone companies, brokers, home builders,
airlines and Internet operators _ should be able to generate a
satisfactory amount of income and profits. Certainly they play a
big role today in the stock market's spectacular performance and in
strong job growth.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the major manufacturing nations has tested the
theory. Diminished though it is, manufacturing is still central to
the economy. Americans are far and away the most innovative in
developing new products and new software, which are then
incorporated into manufacturing here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And within the United States, manufacturing generates more
income per hour worked than any other sector. As these jobs
disappear _ 198,000 since last March and 760,000 since 1989 _ the
displaced workers get new jobs outside manufacturing, but usually
at lower pay. That downward shifting in wages is one reason why the
nation has escaped inflationary wage pressures, despite strong
economic growth and an unemployment rate of only 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing has other advantages. There is the multiplier
effect: the great number of satellite companies that come into
existence to service manufacturers. In addition, no other sector in
the American economy does as much research, the source of new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the United States has built up over the decades great
reservoirs of knowledge and skill in the manufacture of complex
products. That experience disappears when makers of railroad cars,
for example, leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the sense of production capability,'' said Seymour Melman,
a Columbia University manufacturing expert, ``we are in danger of
finding ourselves, at the end of the current expansion, weaker than
we were at the beginning.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lynn Zimmer wasn't even in the same room as a
marijuana cigarette until 1980, when she was 33 years old.
</P>
<P>
   By then she already had two children and was working on her
Ph.D. in sociology. Somehow, as the child of working-class parents
in upstate Binghamton, she had sidestepped the turbulence of her
generation, and its sweetly pungent perfume.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I graduated from high school in 1965, I had never even
heard of marijuana,'' she said. ``By 1967 I had a child and was
taking care of my family and going to school at night, and working
in a day-care center mornings. So I had no interest in the '60s. I
guess I saw it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the frenzied experimentation and generational
struggle that took place outside her window back then, the debate
over marijuana has only grown in intensity in the ensuing decades.
And suddenly, Ms. Zimmer finds herself in its dead center.
</P>
<P>
   Now teaching sociology at Queens College, she has become at once
an academic authority on the drug and a passionate advocate of its
decriminalization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zimmer's arguments about marijuana's essential harmlessness,
collected in a recent book co-written with a City University
colleague, Dr. John Morgan, have become a flashpoint in the battle
over legalization, which gained steam earlier this month when five
Western states voted to permit the medical use of marijuana. Groups
that favor liberalizing the nation's drug laws have been promoting
the book, which bears the somewhat presumptuous title of
``Marijuana Myths, Marijuana Facts,'' as a kind of bible on the
subject, saying it effectively shoots down the accepted wisdom that
the drug is a physically harmful gateway to crack and the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Academic experts have been far less kind, calling it a
well-researched compilation of opinion that occasionally leaves out
information that might cast marijuana in a negative light.
Opponents of drug use have condemned it as an invitation to
surrender in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt marijuana leads to trouble and I can show you
10 books that prove that for every one like the one you just showed
me,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir, a former drug enforcement
agent, told MSNBC earlier this year. ``The fact that these two
professors are teachers leads me to wonder if they are fit to be
leading a classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, marijuana arrests in New
York have soared to record levels this year, 30 years after the
drug became the token of the counterculture, and the arrests are
likely to reach 40,000 by the end of the year, eight times the
number six years ago. Most of those arrested are charged with
possession of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Zimmer, all this effort is a waste of taxpayer money, a
misguided extension of the quality-of-life campaign that runs
counter to a growing public perception, cherished by many baby
boomers, that marijuana holds little intrinsic danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now are getting into the adult population many more people
who have had experience with marijuana,'' she said, at the dining
room table of her apartment in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.
``Many have children and are concerned about their children, so
they're a little ambivalent, but I think they are questioning some
of the exaggerated claims about marijuana's dangers and certainly
questioning the utility of putting people in jail for engaging in a
behavior that 70 million people have engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that perception has been fostered by several large
foundations that are promoting the relaxation of drug laws, and Ms.
Zimmer, 51, has been the beneficiary of some of their largesse. Her
book was published by the Lindesmith Center, a group funded by
financier George Soros, who has made a worldwide campaign of
finding a less punitive response to drug use than the current laws.
She served for a time on the board of directors of the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, known as NORML, and
her book is dedicated to Dr. Lester Grinspoon, the Harvard
professor who serves as chairman of the Norml Foundation's board.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zimmer said she first became interested in the subject after
conducting a study in 1986 of Operation Pressure Point, an attempt
by the Police Department to rid Manhattan's Lower East Side of
drugs, an effort that she and others judged ineffective. She later
became more interested in the various claims being made about the
dangers of marijuana, most of which she determined were
exaggerated, and which she attempts to debunk in her book.
</P>
<P>
   But in the polarized world of the drug debate, the book
inevitably came to be considered a partisan argument, particularly
because it rarely acknowledges any downside to marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book puts forward as many myths as it debunks,'' said Mark
Kleiman, a drug policy expert at the University of California at
Los Angeles, who himself favors decriminalizing possession. ``If
you didn't know anything and read the book and you're not too
critical about methodology, you'd be impressed. Otherwise you sort
of say, come on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Zimmer, straightforward and almost prim in her love of
research and statistics, remains confident that any thorough review
of the scientific literature will produce the same conclusions. And
no, she said, although she did smoke the occasional joint, she
never seriously indulged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was way too busy for that,'' she said.

BUDDHIST TREASURES FOR THE SPIRIT AND SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Days of Discipline and Grace: Treasures From the
Imperial Buddhist Convents of Kyoto'' is a tiny exhibition tucked
away deep in the stacks of the C.V. Starr East Asian Library at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the objects are pocket-size. Most date from the 17th
century, though some are quite new. Several were made for pleasure,
not spiritual profit: parlor games outnumber religious icons.
Together they capture the subtly exalted ordinariness of convent
life.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Medieval Japanese Studies at Columbia, the
show's sponsor, has been researching the history of Zen Buddhist
convents in Japan for a decade. This year is the 700th anniversary
of the death of the woman who founded the first such institution,
the abbess Mugai Nyodai (1223-1298). The show is culled almost
entirely from convents associated with her name.
</P>
<P>
   She is a central figure here, making a startling personal
appearance in the form of a life-size sculpture installed near the
library's entrance. The sculpture is a plastic-resin cast of a
13th-century image still in Japan. Nyodai's age-creased skin, with
its quizzical eyes and lopsided mouth, projects plenty of
personality even in this similacrum.
</P>
<P>
   Little about her secular life is known. She was born into a
family of high-powered shoguns renowned as ferocious warriors and
ardent Buddhists. She seems to have married well, and may have had
a daughter. But the family archives went up in smoke centuries ago,
and all such details remain hazy.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of her religious career is another matter. Almost
every aspect of it is scrupulously documented. She received her
instruction from the great Chinese Zen master Wuxue Zuyuan, who
clearly held her in high esteem. He gave her an inscribed
self-portrait, asked her to oversee the building of a chapel to his
memory and bequeathed a portion of his relics to her at his death.
</P>
<P>
   His trust was well placed. She built the chapel as promised. And
having secured the patronage of both the imperial court and the
ruling warrior clans, she established the first Japanese Zen
convent, one that spawned numerous sub-chapters and produced a
proud lineage of aristocratic abbesses.
</P>
<P>
   Scroll portraits of some of them appear in the show, along with
one of Nyodai herself painted in the 17th century, by which time
she was a folk heroine and an object of veneration. She sits with
her feet tucked up under her robes. Her head is shaved,
symbolically removing traces of sex and class. Her face, utterly
unlike that on the sculpture, is idealized, smoothed out and
ageless, an emblem of social decorum and psychological poise.
</P>
<P>
   Far more characterful are the portraits that flank her. One is
of a child abbess who died at the age of 10 and is shown with alert
dark eyes and rosebud lips dwarfed by her cloth-swaddled chair. The
other is a wonderful likeness of a recent abbess, Shun'on Jiei
(1887-1967), who bears a resemblance to both Virgil Thompson and
Gertrude Stein. The purple kinomo she wears in the painting is on
view in a case in the gallery, along her fan and rosary beads.
</P>
<P>
   Along with these portraits of women there is art made by women.
A scroll painting of Miroku, Buddha of the Future, comes from the
hand of Shozan Gen'yo (1634-1727), a nun who was the daughter of an
emperor and a phenomenally prolific artist. She is said to have
produced thousands of paintings and sculptures, an example of which
is also included.
</P>
<P>
   Another dynamic polymath, the abbess Hongakuin no Miya
(1672-1745), is responsible for a bold calligraphic piece: the
character ``ki,'' meaning ``return,'' brushed with a vigorous
downward stroke that the show's catalog suggests resembles the
tapering braid of a woman's hair.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th century, the convents founded by Nyodai came under
the direct patronage of the imperial house. The Emperor Gomizuno'o
was an avid Zen devotee; six of his sisters and eight of his
daughters became nuns and eventually abbesses.
</P>
<P>
   With its intellectual pursuits and leisure pastimes, the court
set the tone for convent life.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from ``The Tale of Genji,'' that bible of chivalric love,
appear everywhere. They are especially vivid on a set of miniature
incense boxes thought to have been made by the Empress Tofukumon'in
and on first-time public display in this exhibition. Shaped like
butterflies, fans and flowers, they carry narrative scenes
ingeniously worked out in scraps of appliqued fabric, an effect at
once endearingly homemade and exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   Similar motifs are painted on seashells used as pieces in a
popular parlor game; another game involves a kind of giant Monopoly
board with Buddhist pilgrimage sites.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt such diversions helped to while away wet fall
afternoons accompanied by pipe smoking (a wooden tobacco tray is on
view) and tea poured piping hot from a silver kettle incised top to
bottom with chrysanthemums.
</P>
<P>
   Images of other flowers, along with soaring birds and autumn
maples, can be found on a cluster of gilded cut-paper lotus petals
meant to be tossed in the air during memorial services for nuns and
members of the imperial family. One petal, looking as fresh as the
day it was painted, is dedicated to Nyodai, and is an appropriate
inclusion in a show that is, in essence, a tribute to her.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the exhibition's curators _ Maribeth Graybill of
Swarthmore College; Manabe Shunsho of the Kanagawa Prefectural
Kanazawa Bunko Museum in Japan, and Sadako Ohki of the Institute
for Medieval Japanese Studies at Columbia _ have, with the
slenderest of means, brought her vital spirit to life here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Days of Discipline and Grace: Treasures From the Imperial
Buddhist Convents of Kyoto'' will be at the C.V. Starr East Asian
Library, Columbia University, through Dec. 4. A concurrent
exhibition, ``Images of the Dharma: Buddhist Art From the Columbia
University Collections,'' will be in the rotunda gallery of Low
Library at Columbia through Jan. 31.

`THE CULTURED TOURIST': TRAVEL PHOTOS FROM 2 CENTURIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marco Polo did not get to China on frequent flyer
miles. Travel in his day was arduous, dangerous, stressful,
inconvenient (to say the least) and infinitely time consuming.
Travel in our day is arduous, dangerous, stressful and inconvenient
(to say the least _ try sitting for hours on a runway), but it only
seems infinitely time consuming because the expectation of brevity
is so high and the sense of time available to spend and waste has
shriveled to a nubbin.
</P>
<P>
   The last century witnessed the real development of travel, as
the Industrial Revolution created a leisure class with the time,
money and interest to wander far from home, as well as the vehicles
to make that possible. Since this trend began, travel _ both the
actual variety and the vicarious kind _ has changed with
intemperate haste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cultured Tourist'' at the Leslie Tonkonow Gallery in
Chelsea has put on view some 19th- and 20th-century travel
photographs that make quite clear the differences not only in the
two centuries' photographic and lifestyles but also in their modes
of travel. Leslie Tonkonow and Ingrid Schaffner are the curators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the photographs are lovely, some challenging or
entertaining, some almost as dull as the view outside an airplane
flying through a cloud bank. All are indisputably experiences once
removed, for a photograph can hardly be anything else, but a few of
the more recent ones hint at a change that has recently befallen
both the whole idea of voyage and distance and the notion of travel
once removed.
</P>
<P>
   Actual travel has compressed time and space as if they were
accordions, accomplishing this by means of railroads, steamships,
automobiles, airplanes and, for a very few, rockets. Photography
exploded the potential for vicarious travel, bringing mountains
swiftly and miraculously to thousands who would not or could not go
to them. Such travel by proxy was soon expanded by international
expositions that set up African and Asian villages with imported
natives so that visitors could tour exotic spots while remaining
close to home.
</P>
<P>
   Photographic postcards drove the grander images to ground, and
the personal camera removed the subject of travel matter from the
monument to the traveler, smiling, with the monument there no
longer as itself but as a testimony to vacation. Then came cinema,
television and, at length, simulation, pastiche and re-creation. As
actual travel increases exponentially, a kind of internal travel,
either the armchair kind or the fairground kind, rachets up as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century views tend to be elegant, extremely still and
unpeopled, though the century also had its share of pictures of
tourists viewing Niagara or climbing pyramids with a strong hand up
from the guides. The immense grandeur and dignity of pictures like
Francis Frith's fine ``Temple of Kom-umboo''(1857) at the Tonkonow
Gallery, with its fallen architraves and columns half covered by
the Egyptian sand, are partly a side effect of the limitations of
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But such images also borrowed a tradition of decorum and respect
before monuments. Illustrators and painters had limned the ancient
sites with classical gravity or romantic nostalgia; photographers
could do no less.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Davis' 1989 image of a pyramid, pure and almost abstract,
takes the tradition of the reverential, iconic view of an ancient
subject to its logical conclusion. Ruth Thorne-Thomsen's small,
shimmery image (1979) of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in an Illinois
field where a tiny hot-air balloon floats by removes the tradition
to the realm of dream.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery also has a photograph of slaves in Zanzibar posing
for the camera in 1880, and one by Felix Beato of an executioner
with the heads of two assassins. The Beato was included in an album
in the late 1860s called ``Views of Japan.'' Japan having only
recently become visible to any degree in the West, people were
understandably curious. A very good case can be made for picturing
slavery or decapitation when trying to give a full picture of a
country, but a good case can also be made for the witting or
unwitting use of such images to further the colonialist and racist
ideas and policies of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, people in industrialized nations, and the
British particularly, believed or tried to convince themselves that
they had expunged the remnants of barbarism at home to achieve a
superior civilization; photographic evidence of barbaric practices
elsewhere reinforced this notion. Ogling women of ``inferior''
races thereby became practically guilt free.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of a Tunisian woman around the turn of the century
shows her carefully accoutered and posed: bare breasted _ her dress
appears to have been pulled down about her hips _ and wearing a big
necklace, bracelets and a hat with a flower, with native rugs on
the wall. This picture doubtless says less about Tunisian custom
than about the photographer's inventive approach to voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to voyeurism, Sophie Calle, as the sample at the
Tonkonow Gallery proves, can outdo a mere studio photographer any
day. In the mid-1980s, she got herself a job cleaning hotel rooms,
which she photographed and inventoried, noting such things as which
beds were slept in and which clothes left out. She might have been
illustrating Susan Sontag's pronouncement that ``essentially the
camera makes everyone a tourist in other people's reality, and
eventually in one's own.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Travel photography, like landscape photography, has been rather
victimized in this century by its overwhelming success on calendars
and in brochures. In 1986 Barbara Bloom printed up a series of
pointed remarks on this phenomenon, her ``Calendar on Travel and
Tourism.'' Here unremarkable photographs have unexpected captions:
An Asian man reads a blurred newspaper, and the calendar explains,
``The Minister of Tourism, who hasn't attended a Cabinet session in
months, made a rare public appearance in order to sign copies of
his next book, `Ten Years with the Minority Tribes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism itself has become so obligatory, so essential an element
of middle-class life, so fused with photography, that photographers
from Lee Friedlander to Tseng Kwong Chi, who photographed himself
with nearly every major monument from Niagara to Mickey Mouse, have
observed both the rituals and the people photographing them.
</P>
<P>
   The newest phenomenon, briefly noted in ``The Cultured
Tourist,'' is the invention of a foreign country close to home and
the devotion of tourists to it. Arne Svenson photographed the
Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, a castle lifted straight from an
illustrated fairy tale, with good parking space for tour buses.
</P>
<P>
   Not included in this show are Robbins &AMP; Becher's photographs of
Leavenworth, Wash., a logging town of declining fortunes that in
the 1960s decided to turn itself into an ersatz Bavaria to attract
visitors. Annual festivals feature maidens in dirndls and men in
lederhosen. The town added some Bavarian architectural elements, as
well as Germanic type-faces on commercial signs; within a decade,
the economy had improved.
</P>
<P>
   Tonkonow does have two of Robbins &AMP; Becher's pictures of German
Indians, people who meet annually to camp in tepees and live like
native Americans, supposedly to preserve the heritage, though they
apparently mix one tribe's attributes with another's. One man poses
with buffalo horns and fur pieces hanging about his head, lots of
beads, a mustache and a face that no one would mistake for Sitting
Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs are no longer enough; the real thing is required.
(Of course the real thing may be Mickey Mouse.) Whatever it is, if
it's too far away, just beam me up to the local theme park, Scotty.
You needn't have a language problem if Bavaria is in Washington.
And if you can't find a Sioux warrior in Dresden you can become one
for a while; it's the ultimate voyage of the psyche. Wherever you
go bring your camera so you can be certain that even if the country
you were in wasn't exactly anywhere, you at least were there.
</P>

GENE MOORE, 88, TIFFANY'S WINDOW DISPLAY ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala . )  (rl) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Moore, a window dresser who worked such fanciful wonders
with shoes and had such a whimsical way with diamonds that he had
Fifth Avenue pedestrians doing delighted double takes for more than
half a century, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88
and best known for turning Tiffany's five little windows into
head-turning attractions.
</P>
<P>
   While the 5,000 or so windows Moore decorated for Tiffany &AMP; Co.
during his 39 years as the store's vice president for window
display were testament enough to the scope of his imaginative
powers, to fully appreciate the impact of his artistic genius you
must take a stroll down memory lane, force yourself to stop in
front of a typical Tiffany window of the 1940s and yawn as you
regard a neat, linear arrangement of silver platters, bowls,
candlesticks and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Now fast forward a decade or so, retrace your steps and just try
not to stop when, out of the corner of your eye you spot, say, a
bird, its beak extended, pulling _ hey, that's not a worm, that's a
diamond necklace! _ out of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   For all the acclaim he enjoyed at Tiffany's, by the time he
joined the store in 1955 Moore had spent 20 years making a name for
himself as a Fifth Avenue innovator, first at the I. Miller shoe
store chain, then at Bergdorf Goodman and its Delman shoe division
and later at Bonwit Teller.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the theory of window display was to cram in as
many mannequins displaying as much merchandise as possible, Moore
created interest simply by clearing away the clutter and limiting a
single window to one or two mannequins, but always in such a
startling pose or situation that they were sure to draw attention.
</P>
<P>
   In one Bonwit window on a firefighter-red theme, for example, he
had red-clad fashion mannequins interacting with firemen, one of
whom roasted a hot dog against a mannequin's presumably red-hot red
swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He also enlisted artists like Robert Rauschenberg to provide
backdrop paintings and other artistic touches for his displays,
even giving Jasper Johns his first public exhibition as part of a
Bonwit window display.
</P>
<P>
   The man who captivated New York was born in Birmingham, Ala.,
``the wrong place,'' as he called it in his 1990 illustrated
autobiography, ``My Time at Tiffany's,'' written with Jay Hyams. He
spent his childhood plotting to escape, dreaming first of being a
concert pianist, later imagining himself as a painter and enjoying
some modest success until he decided he would never be great and
burned all his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Moore had made it to New York, a city in which his
impish humor and extravagant flights of fancy fit right in.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no real surprise that the man who repeatedly
used his collection of stuffed hummingbirds in window displays
would make it a practice to talk to himself and even converse, he
boasted, with ``what other people call inanimate objects.'' What
set Moore apart in the pantheon of artistic eccentrics is that the
inanimate objects talked back.
</P>
<P>
   It was, for example, one of the lions in front of the New York
Public Library, the downtown lion, to be exact, that steered him to
his first job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at not being able to find work after arriving in the
city in 1935, Moore was resting against the lion's pedestal, he
recalled, when he asked what he should do. The lion told him to
follow his nose, down East 41st Street, where, sure enough, he
found a job as a bookstore messenger.
</P>
<P>
   He stumbled onto his career a year later when he went to work
for a company that made props for window displays. He impressed a
client, Jim Buckley, a free-lance window dresser who later became
display manager at I. Miller and hired Moore as his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his window work, Moore had a hand in many
artistic projects over the years, designing costumes and sets for
the Paul Taylor dance company, for example, and creating a rage for
tiny white Christmas tree lights with a series of seasonal displays
for the plaza of the Seagram Building.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was his window displays, especially at Tiffany's, that
established his reputation for zany creativity. He used broken
glass as a motif so often that alarmed passers-by were forever
calling the police. Once, during a water shortage, he insisted on
replacing the water in a fountain display with gin.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who leaves no immediate survivors, never worried about
where his next idea would come from. When he was stumped, as he was
when it came time for his last Tiffany's windows, in December 1994,
Moore knew where to turn, in that case to his favorite teddy bear,
Porridge, which explains why Moore filled all five windows with
teddy bears.

   BALTIMORE _ As she checked in, the elderly woman told the man at
the concierge desk that she had a dog at home, Fifi, that needed to
be walked. No problem, she was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted a pet store near where she lived,'' said Leroy
Mobley, the aide who handled the request. ``Someone at the pet
store found a neighbor to walk the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was having an asthmatic attack, and checking herself
into Sinai Hospital's new emergency center here, she discovered
what thousands of other area residents have found since December
1997, a new customer-friendly approach to urban emergency care. It
has proved so successful that hospital officials from more than a
dozen other states and from countries as far away as South Korea
have come to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are endless waits and dingy rooms filled with injured
patients and anguished relatives. As a replacement, the hospital
has built a $16 million wing, twice the size of the previous
emergency-services area, that is designed to speed patients with
anything from a cut lip to a heart attack into one of seven
independent treatment areas, each for a different type of illness
or trauma.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology bells and whistles abound, including an
electronic communications system that tracks the whereabouts of
every staff doctor and nurse.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes ER7, as it is called, unusual _ and now, more
cost-effective _ is the consideration of each patient as a
customer, even the 16 percent each year that hospital officials say
are uninsured. The concierge desk with aides like Mobley, who are
known as patient-care advocates, and a private room for the family
of each patient are among the services provided to reduce the
anxieties of a visit. And amenities, like dog walking, are
available free for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend in emergency care is to be more responsive than in
the past,'' said Jennifer Joynt, an official with the Health Care
Advisory Board, an organization in Washington that conducts
strategic research for member hospitals. ``Some patients were not
always given true priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in emergency health care say Sinai's approach is one of
the most ambitious in the United States as hospitals search for new
ways to deliver services and increase revenues in highly
competitive health-care markets. Sinai's emergency center, for
example, competes for patients with at least five other major
hospitals within a short drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinai has taken it to the nth degree,'' said Dr. John
Moorhead, president of the American College of Emergency
Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But hospitals in other cities have also upgraded their efforts
in recent years to reduce the waiting period and create a
friendlier atmosphere for patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joynt said Harris Methodist Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas,
for example, speeded the check-in process by using bedside
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gilbert, general counsel for Universal Health Services of
King of Prussia, Pa., which owns 40 hospitals around the country,
said many of them guaranteed that a patient would see a nurse
within 15 minutes of arrival and a doctor within an hour, or the
visit was free. Gilbert also said hospital personnel performed
personal services, like picking up children from school or walking
a dog.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sinai officials concede that the hospital was motivated to
conceive a new emergency center, in part, by a need to offset
rising costs of administering emergency services in an aging one.
Warren Green, president and chief executive of Lifebridge Health,
which owns Sinai, said that emergency rooms typically lost money,
and that Sinai regained some money through patients _ about one in
five _ who required more care and were admitted to the hospital for
a longer stay.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinai's 20-year-old emergency center, Green said, was
attracting only about 54,000 patients a year. Rather than expand
the existing center, he said, hospital officials imagined ``a blank
piece of paper'' and started from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a center that officials say will have treated
about 67,000 patients by its first anniversary in December, a 12
percent increase over the old center, which translates to an
additional $12 million, or 5 percent of the hospital's projected
annual revenues. The building has the capacity to accommodate
75,000 a year before expansion would become necessary.
</P>
<P>
   As patients arrive at the new center, they are evaluated and
directed to treatment areas that specialize in their problems. They
include a Fast Track Center that treats patients with minor
problems and releases them quickly, an Emergent Care Center for
people who are critically ill, and a Chest Pain Evaluation Center
for cardiac problems. The center also has a pediatric center.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends of patients are encouraged to use the private
rooms, adjacent to the lobby and each treatment center. Many have
telephones and televisions, and people like Mobley are trained to
meet other needs, like walking dogs and retrieving children.
</P>
<P>
   Sinai officials acknowledge that some problems remain, including
the time some patients have to wait, especially during busy evening
hours. But still, waiting times are generally less than before,
hospital officials say, and their latest survey of former patients
found that the rate of satisfaction was higher than it had been in
five years, a change that is also evident among the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in love with it,'' Dr. Tariq Khan, an emergency physician
who has worked at Sinai for seven years, said of the new center.
``I wouldn't want to go back to the way it was. I wouldn't want to
do that at all.''

COMPUTER CRISIS BECOMING A POCKETBOOK ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mo., N.J., Wash., N.Y., Calif., Ga., Va., Hawaii.,
Okla., Conn., Ala., S.C.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most states are behind schedule in renovating their
computers for the year 2000, and as a result, it is likely that
benefit payments will be delayed, or services interrupted, for some
people who receive welfare, Medicaid, food stamps or other types of
assistance, federal and state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   State employees are working feverishly to fix the problem and to
draft contingency plans in case their computers are not ready by
Jan. 1, 2000. But some states are lagging, and states that have
repaired computers for one program are often behind schedule in
fixing computers used for other social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the problems could begin as early as
January 1999 in some programs like unemployment insurance. People
filing claims for jobless benefits typically have a year to draw
all the checks to which they are entitled. The last day of this
``benefit year'' is recorded when an application is received. So
computers must be able to handle dates with the year 2000, starting
in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, chairman of the Hennepin County Board of
Commissioners in Minneapolis and former president of the National
Association of Counties, said: ``I'd be surprised if there was not
some dislocation and some interruption of services. We are trying
to work with our clients, many of whom are elderly or frail, to
make sure they know how to reach us if they have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Many federal benefit programs are administered at the county
level, and county officials will have to deal with the consequences
if payments are late.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem arises because early computer programmers
often used a two-digit format to express the year. In such computer
programs, 2000 is often indistinguishable from 1900. If the problem
is not corrected, experts say, computers could produce inaccurate
data or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of states by the General Accounting Office found
that many were behind schedule in renovating their computers. Only
one-third of the 421 computer systems used for seven major health,
welfare and nutrition programs were ready for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compliance rate ranged from only 16 percent of the
Medicaid systems to about half of the child care and child welfare
systems,'' the accounting office said.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to make the necessary repairs ``could result in billions
of dollars in benefit payments not being delivered,'' the report
said. In addition, it said, states may have difficulty determining
eligibility of new applicants, and people already on the rolls may
receive late payments or underpayments.
</P>
<P>
   Joel C. Willemssen, who supervises the work of the General
Accounting Office on computer operations of civilian agencies,
called the survey results ``fairly discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had set September 1998 as the target date
for computers to be renovated. That date would have allowed time to
test the performance of computers and to correct software errors.
``Testing is 60 to 70 percent of the job of getting ready for the
year 2000,'' said Wendy Rayner, chief information officer of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kolodney, director of the Department of Information
Services in Washington state and chairman of a panel studying the
year 2000 problem for the chief information-technology officers of
the 50 states, said: ``There is likely to be some dislocation, some
disruption of services. I don't think there will be a wholesale
failure of these computer systems. But it's inevitable, when so
many systems are being renovated, that there will be some delays
and hiccups.''
</P>
<P>
   The interruption of services ``won't be for lack of attention or
concern among state officials,'' Kolodney said. ``It would occur
because we are overwhelmed with the number of fixes that need to be
made.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Many governors, including George Pataki of New York, have
formally recognized the year 2000 problem as a priority.
</P>
<P>
   But John Koskinen, a White House official who supervises
preparations for the year 2000, said, ``We are concerned about some
states where it's not a priority of the governor and it's viewed as
merely an information technology problem, off on the side.''
Koskinen is chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, an interagency group formed in February.
</P>
<P>
   Governors may ultimately be held accountable if benefits are not
paid on time. John Thomas Flynn, the chief information officer of
California, said: ``If social services are disrupted, you'll have
more than computer problems. You could have civil disturbances.
That's why this issue is a high priority for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Lilja, acting deputy administrator of the federal Food
and Nutrition Service, said the government had asked the top
welfare officials in each state to certify, in writing, that they
had fixed their food stamp computers to cope with the year 2000, or
that they had some alternative means of delivering benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare agencies could issue checks by hand for a few weeks, as
they sometimes do after an earthquake or a hurricane. State and
local officials could simply assume that everyone on the rolls of a
particular program in December 1999 was entitled to assistance in
January 2000. Or the federal government could advance the necessary
money to the states for a few months, without receiving the data
normally required to justify such payments. Likewise, a state
having difficulties could seek help from other states with extra
computer capacity, or could hire private companies to write checks
and perform other tasks normally done by government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even a state that fixes its own computers may have problems if
its repairs are not compatible with those made by the federal
government or by counties and cities in the state. In addition,
state officials must deal with thousands of providers and vendors
of services, who may or may not have made the necessary computer
changes.
</P>
<P>
   A state Medicaid program, for example, receives tens of
thousands of electronic claims from doctors, dentists, hospitals,
pharmacies, nursing homes and home health agencies. If such health
care providers do not fix their computers to cope with the year
2000, their Medicaid payments may be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Schnedler, deputy director of computer operations for the
Missouri Medicaid program, said there would be no problem paying
hospitals and chain drug stores that file large numbers of Medicaid
claims. But he said he worried about doctors and dentists who filed
just a few claims a month. State employees may have to do some
``manual manipulation'' of the data before paying such claims, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, the White House official supervising preparations for
the year 2000, said, ``Six or eight states have difficulty even
identifying who operates these electronic data exchanges,'' so they
are in no position to test the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jinnett, a lawyer who specializes in technology issues,
said several states, including Georgia, Virginia and Hawaii, had
passed laws to shield themselves against lawsuits that might be
filed if their computers fail. Under such laws, he said, if a
person does not receive a benefit check and therefore cannot buy
medicine needed to treat a severe illness, the person might be
barred from suing the state for damages.
</P>
<P>
   States are attacking the year 2000 problem in different ways and
vary greatly in their efforts to measure progress.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Worsham, data processing manager for the Medicaid program
in Oklahoma, keeps track of her work with great precision. ``As of
Nov. 5,'' she said, ``we have completed 55.07 percent of the work
to be done by June 30, 1999, and we have used 56.51 percent of the
days available since we started on Jan. 1 of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Health and welfare officials in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut said they had been renovating their computers for
several years and foresaw no major problems. ``We are about 95
percent ready for the year 2000,'' said Joyce Thomas, commissioner
of social services in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarah Mingledorff, deputy commissioner of the Alabama
Medicaid Agency, said: ``Our existing computer system is not being
touched. We won't upgrade it. We'll put in a new one on Oct. 1,
1999.'' Federal officials said that was a high-risk strategy
because information technology projects were rarely completed on
time and often required extensive testing to eliminate defects.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama has posted a progress report on the Internet. It says,
``Jan. 1, 2000, will be here before most of us are ready.''
Moreover, it shows that the state has done just 6 percent of the
necessary work on the computers that track child abuse and neglect
cases, and less than 10 percent of the work needed to fix the
computers that issue food stamps and welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared for Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina says
that ``a significant number of large computer systems will
experience year 2000-related failures'' despite the best efforts of
state employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payments to welfare recipients could be severely delayed
because compensation systems either halt or produce checks so
erroneous that the system must be shut down and checks processed
manually,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   California has upgraded its Medicaid computers, but told the
General Accounting Office that it could not provide statewide data
on the renovation of computers used to establish eligibility for
welfare and food stamps because the computer systems varied from
county to county.

LAST YEAR'S APEC PROTEST REMAINS A STINGING ISSUE FOR CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ At a news conference last year, Canada's Prime
Minister Jean Chretien joked about liking pepper on his food. This
was just after police used pepper spray to break up demonstrators
protesting attendance of Indonesia's President Suharto at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit here.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the protestors are getting the last laugh.
Chretien is embroiled in a deepening scandal over whether Canada's
government violated the rights of its citizens in order not to
offend the feelings of a dictator attending the 1997 summit of
Pacific Rim leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian cabinet minister was forced to resign earlier this
week over remarks overheard on an airplane flight in which he
identified a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer as most likely
to ``take the fall'' for the forceful dispersal of anti-APEC
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   As he he reappeared in Canada's Parliament after attending this
year's APEC summit in Malaysia earlier this month, Chretien was
peppered with opposition demands for a full judicial inquiry over
the prime minister's role in arrangements to shield Suharto from
protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonstrators have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams
in making the entire country focus on kowtowing to a foreign
dictator for the purposes of assuring foreign contracts and a
peaceful conference,'' said Thomas Perry, a Vancouver physician and
former provincial cabinet minister. Perry witnessed part of the
demonstration at the University of British Columbia, which
triggered the spraying incident.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying was vividly captured when, a moment after ordering
anti-APEC and anti-Suharto demonstrators to disperse, RCMP
staff-sergeant Hugh Stewart sprayed not only the crowd but a CBC-TV
camera that was recording the protest.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying scene has become as familiar to Canadian television
viewers as the 1996 crowd shot of President Clinton hugging intern
Monica Lewinsky is to Americans watching their TV news.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators did try to rip down a fence around the
demonstration area. ``The police were not unprovoked,'' Perry
noted. But the RCMP also took away signs and detained people along
the motorcade route between downtown Vancouver hotels and the
university site of the APEC summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were arrested for showing paper signs with such
treasonous messages as `human rights' and `free speech','' said Ken
Georgetti, president of the B.C. Federation of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   The RCMP has convened its own public complaints commission to
investigate the spraying as well as ripping down protest signs. But
increasingly, the focus is more on Prime Minister Chretien than
Sgt. Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence produced at the RCMP inquiry, and released under
Canada's freedom-of-information laws, indicates that the prime
minister's aides told RCMP officers to keep demonstrators far away
from APEC leaders, and to make sure that no placards were seen.
</P>
<P>
   They also show Canadian security officials fearful that
Shuarto's security detail was armed, dangerous and might be
provoked to violence against any protests. A group of Suharto
guards were caught setting up surveillance equipment on the roof of
the Hotel Vancouver. (The Indonesian dictator was forced to resign
several months after attending the APEC summit.)
</P>
<P>
   And documents show that the RCMP warned Chretien's aides that
bringing the APEC leaders to the University of British Columbia was
an invitation to loud, sustained protests. The warning came from
Sgt. Peter Montague, a senior Vancouver-based RCMP officer renowned
for his cool handling of environmental protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many layers of insulation'' surround the prime minister
that Chretien probably never heard or understood the warning, said
Bob Williams, chairman of the Insurance Corp. of British Columbia,
a successful Vancouver businessman and sometime politician.
</P>
<P>
   The APEC controversy has shown Canada's government, and its
prime minister, at their clumsiest.
</P>
<P>
   Goaded by opposition parties in Parliament, Chretien has
continued to make impolitic remarks, at one point suggesting that
the demonstrators should be grateful that they were not beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Soliciter General Andy Scott, the cabinet minister who oversees
the police, seemed to prejudge the RCMP inquiry on a plane flight.
He suggested to a lawyer-friend that ``four or five Mounties
over-reacted'' and that ``Hughie'' _ an apparent reference to
Stewart _ might have to take a ``hit'' or ``fall'' for spraying the
protestors.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was overheard by Dick Proctor, a member of Parliament
from the opposition New Democratic Party. When the news broke,
Scott responded by saying ``I can't recall'' his remarks. But an
affidavit from his seatmate confirmed Proctor's account of the
conversation. Scott was forced to resign this week.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien has resisted calls for a full judicial review. He has
defended the RCMP probe. ``I have said and I repeat, that (the
inquiry) can ask questions on all subjects it wants to and of
anybody, not only the RCMP but in the bureaucracy, including my
office,'' he told Parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has insisted that he did not order any
crackdown on the protestors.
</P>
<P>
   But a day after taking office, the new soliciter-general,
Lawrence MacAulay, created a new controversy by suggesting that the
report of the RCMP inquiry might not be made public if it concludes
that the prime minister's office was to blame for the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   MacAulay backed down later in the day and promised that the
report will not be squelched. Hours after taking office, he had
found himself knee-deep in what has become a quagmire of Canadian
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be a slow learner if he doesn't, by this point,
realize that you better not put your foot in it on this particular
issue,'' said Preston Manning, leader of the opposition Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien has learned that lesson. A recent poll showed that the
prime minister's popularity in British Columbia has declined
sharply. Long nicknamed ``the little guy from Shawinigan'' _ a
title that bespoke a down-to-Earth guy from a tough Quebec mill
town _ Chretien has appeared aloof, arrogant and somewhat
uncomprehending at anger over the suppressed anti-APEC protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of it,'' said Williams.

NO CONSENSUS ON YELTSIN'S DETERIORATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``The subject of the president's health should be
closed. The subject does not even exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing before cameras in the Kremlin last March 10, Boris
Yeltsin looked hearty enough to make that command stick. He dared
reporters to match him in swimming, tennis and track. A thorough
physical five days before, he said, had shown ``no deviations, even
as far as the smallest microelements.'' Then he spat over his
shoulder three times and rapped a nearby table. ``Touch wood, of
course!'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It is dangerous to tempt fate. Three days later, Yeltsin, who is
67, was laid up at home with a chest cold. On March 17 he postponed
a summit meeting of regional heads of state. On March 26 doctors
shifted a meeting with German and French leaders from the Ural
Mountains to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, that episode was but the mildest of recent ailments
that have made Yeltsin's health one of the great political issues _
and mysteries _ of Russian politics. Before his March illness
Yeltsin spent much of December and January in sanitariums and
dachas fighting what aides called a bad cold.
</P>
<P>
   In July a top aide said Yeltsin was too worn out, mentally and
physically, to serve past 2000, when his term ends. In mid-October
he needed support from the president of Uzbekistan to make it
through a welcoming ceremony there, and seemed to wander during a
toast at a state dinner. He has not been at the Kremlin regularly
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Ill with pneumonia, Yeltsin on Monday held an extraordinary
state visit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in his hospital
suite _ an apparent statement that whatever ails Yeltsin, he is
still the elected head of the government. What ails him, if
anything, is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, which long insisted that he is simply susceptible
to colds, has lately begun to acknowledge obliquely that Yeltsin
suffers from ``emotional stress'' and the wear and tear of age.
</P>
<P>
   His latest deputy chief of staff, Oleg Susuyev, has made
increasingly blunt statements about Yeltsin's physical and
political stamina, including a recent suggestion that Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov should simply take over his duties ``if
the situation persists.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kremlin spokesman declined to comment this week on whether
Susuyev was speaking for himself or was reflecting some broader
consensus in the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a person with some of the best information on Yeltsin's
condition, the renowned U.S. heart surgeon Michael DeBakey,
insisted in a telephone interview that the Boris Yeltsin he knows
is a healthy and mentally astute leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly no basic reason to be concerned about any
neurologic problem because in previous studies all neurological
functions were normal,'' he said. ``His liver function was normal,
his kidney function normal, and his heart function is good. I can't
account for his symptoms except to note that they're a symptom of
the flu-like illnesses he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey said he was confident that his assessment of Yeltsin was
accurate up to the onset of the president's most recent illness in
October. ``I had lunch with him in the latter part of June,'' he
said. ``At that time he was in excellent condition, quite vigorous
and in good spirits, and really sort of a delightful host.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his 1996 bypass surgery, Yeltsin had a history of heart
trouble. He suffered several heart attacks or near-attacks in the
early 1990s and underwent quintuple-bypass surgery after his
re-election. Aides said in the mid-1990s that Yeltsin suffered from
high blood pressure, and doctors said this month that his current
case of exhaustion was coupled with fluctuations in his blood
pressure _ a possible sign of new heart troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But DeBakey dismissed that possibility as remote. Yeltsin's
blood pressure has not been especially high in recent years, he
said, and he has not been on medication to regulate it.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia's president is sidelined for weeks or months by
flu-like symptoms _ well, he said, the flu can be an enervating
disease, even for a young, strong person.
</P>
<P>
   That said, outside observers _ none of them medical experts _
say they see something more in Yeltsin of late. They describe a
waxen-faced man who has difficulty walking, whose movements and
speech are slow and labored, and who can have difficulty
concentrating on the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to a Novgorod meat-packing plant this autumn,
witnesses say, Yeltsin was driven to a special entrance so that he
would not have to climb stairs. An employee there noted that
Yeltsin, whose temper is well-known, tried to stamp his foot but
was unable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Uzbekistan officials skipped the normal review of
troops and reception line at a welcoming ceremony for Yeltsin in
Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, so he could go almost directly to a
nearby building. Even then, Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov had
to support Yeltsin after he stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Smets, the Bonn bureau chief of Deutsche Press Agentur,
the German news agency, reported on Yeltsin extensively during a
stint in Moscow and said in an interview that the president has had
difficulty walking for years, and that what other people may be
seeing now are the effects of advancing age. What strikes him and
some other first-hand observers more is the apparent change in
Yeltsin's mental state.
</P>
<P>
   A person who attended a state dinner during Yeltsin's Uzbekistan
visit in October came away feeling ``quite sad'' after the
president suffered a prolonged fit of coughing, then appeared
unable to get through a toast whose written text had already been
passed out to many diners. Yeltsin skipped from the first to the
last paragraphs of the toast and then, seeming to realize something
was amiss, plunged back into the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to tell whether he ad-libbed or whether he
realized that what he was saying wasn't long enough,'' the observer
said. ``He made it to the end, but only after a lot of us held our
breath for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That evoked memories of a similar occurrence during President
Clinton's visit to Moscow in September, when Yeltsin was asked a
question at a news conference, gave a cryptic answer and waited an
excruciatingly long time, as if lost in thought, before saying,
``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smets, who returned to Moscow to cover German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's visit this month, said Yeltsin seemed ``very, very
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His face was very thick,'' he said. ``He wasn't able to speak
whole sentences, like a normal man. He was very long thinking about
what he was saying. It seemed to me that he had very many problems
concentrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Roth, the Moscow bureau chief for Germany's ARD
Television, who has reported on Yeltsin since 1991, was in the same
room. ``He looked frail; very pale,'' he said. ``My impression was
that they'd given him some makeup. He moved very slowly, spoke very
slowly; his hand movements were very slow. I am, of course, not a
doctor, but I had the definite impression that he's a sick man.''
</P>
<P>
   Such descriptions are consistent with other public reports of
Yeltsin's condition. A Japanese diplomat who saw Yeltsin in April
and this month, during a state visit by Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, told Reuters the change was dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like a robot today,'' Reuters quoted the official as
saying, without identifying him. ``He looked completely different,
like someone on drugs.'' Yeltsin skipped a state dinner with
Obuchi, an unusual breach of protocol that Russian officials said
was prearranged, and which Japanese officials said was a complete
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Yeltsin has canceled a trip to India and one to
Vienna, pleading exhaustion. Yeltsin is at an age that is still
vigorous for many Americans but close to elderly in a country where
the average male life span is 57.7 years and where the diet and
medical care have never matched Western standards. Three Soviet
leaders _ Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko _
died respectively at 75, 69 and 73.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts Yeltsin has never been especially careful with
his health. As a student in the 1950s he was hospitalized for
stress from all-night studies and all-day sports, but discharged
himself against doctors' orders. In 1987 he was again hospitalized
for head and heart pain after a dressing-down by Communist Party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of heavy drinking have followed him for years. His
failure over the years as president to make scheduled meetings _
with Ireland's prime minister, the U.S. Treasury secretary and
Japan's foreign minister _ have only fueled the rumors. In Ireland,
Yeltsin never even emerged from his plane after it landed at
Shannon Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has still been seen to drink two or three glasses of
wine at dinners, but aides insist any alcohol abuse is in the past.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals (6-5) at Chiefs (4-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Cardinals are in the playoff hunt. When is the
last time you heard that phrase? The Chiefs may not make the
playoffs. When was the last time you heard that as well? Arizona is
ahead of where most thought they'd be this season because
quarterback Jake Plummer is playing unbelievable football. He has a
96.2 passer rating in his previous four games. He will have a tough
time this week because the Chiefs have the second best pass defense
in the league. But because Kansas City is reeling so badly now, the
Cardinals win a close one on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 27-24
</P>
<P>
   Falcons (9-2) at Rams (3-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Falcons are no longer worrying about winning the
NFC West. They see the San Francisco 49ers in their rear-view
mirror. The Falcons are looking at the bigger picture, and their
eyes are turned towards Minnesota. There is a chance, albeit
slight, that Atlanta could get the home-field advantage throughout
the playoffs if the Vikings slip. That is their greater goal, and
the Falcons won't let a sorry Rams team get in the way, even if
quarterback Chris Chandler is ailing. Atlanta clinches a playoff
birth with a victory or a New Orleans loss and Detroit tie or loss.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 35-7
</P>
<P>
   Panthers (2-9) at Jets (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Jets this year have often followed up a great
victory with a puzzling loss. Last week, they hammered a solid
Tennessee team. This week come the hapless Panthers. Will history
repeat itself? Not this time. Coach Bill Parcells has probably
spent the past few days yelling at the Jets from sunrise to sunset,
trying to imprint on their brains that Carolina is dangerous. The
only true danger on the Panthers is linebacker Kevin Greene, tied
for the league lead in sacks with 14. He'll do some damage.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 28-17
</P>
<P>
   Colts (2-9) at Ravens (4-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The kind of year quarterback Peyton Manning is having
is scary. He's a rookie, and unlike many rookie quarterbacks he has
taken every snap, all 693 of them. His streak of a touchdown pass
in every game this year is the most by a rookie since Joe Namath in
1965. But Manning can't play safety or linebacker or defensive
line. The Colts have one of the worst defenses in football, giving
up 367 yards a game. Baltimore's offense should pick Indianapolis
apart, especially running back Priest Holmes, who ran for 227 yards
last week against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars (8-3) at Bengals (2-9)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Blowout city. The Jaguars are not happy campers after
losing to Pittsburgh last week. While the home team has won the
past five meetings, and six of the last seven games in this series
were decided by 8 points or less, this game won't be close.
Jacksonville cranks up its running attack and quarterback Mark
Brunnel, wh has a 97 rating in past three games against
Cincinnati, will throw for over 300 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 28-0
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers (4-7) at Bears (3-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Tampa Bay is probably the most disappointing team in
the league. Things will only get worse. Chicago has just three
victories but a number of their games have been extremely close;
they should have seven or eight W's. The last time Tampa Bay was at
Chicago, the Bears won by 6 points off two Buccaneers fumbles. This
season, Chicago's 12 fumbled takeways ranks third in the NFC. Don't
be scared by the fact Erik Kramer isn't starting _ he's being
replaced by backup Moses Moreno _ because the Bears are going to
run the ball a zillion times anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, 15-9
</P>
<P>
   Bills (7-4) at Patriots (6-5)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: How this game turns out depends on the index finger of
quarterback Drew Bledsoe. He has two slight fractures and Bledsoe
maintains he can play; he's listed as questionable. But there is
some question about whether it's possible for a quarterback to
effectively throw a football the entire game with such an injury,
though Bledsoe threw beautifully in the final minutes against
Miami. If he plays, the Patriots win, because this team could be on
the verge of a three- or four-game winning streak. They are also

Terry Glenn, back on the field. Doug Flutie is the X-factor, as

 WASHINGTON: be made. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many governors, including George Pataki of New York, have
formally recognized the year 2000 problem as a priority.
</P>
<P>
   But John Koskinen, a White House official who supervises
preparations for the year 2000, said, ``We are concerned about some
states where it's not a priority of the governor and it's viewed as
merely an information technology problem, off on the side.''
Koskinen is chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, an interagency group formed in February.
</P>
<P>
   Governors may ultimately be held accountable if benefits are not
paid on time. John Thomas Flynn, the chief information officer of
California, said: ``If social services are disrupted, you'll have
more than computer problems. You could have civil disturbances.
That's why this issue is a high priority for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Lilja, acting deputy administrator of the federal Food
and Nutrition Service, said the government had asked the top
welfare officials in each state to certify, in writing, that they
had fixed their food stamp computers to cope with the year 2000, or
that they had some alternative means of delivering benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare agencies could issue checks by hand for a few weeks, as
they sometimes do after an earthquake or a hurricane. State and
local officials could simply assume that everyone on the rolls of a
particular program in December 1999 was entitled to assistance in
January 2000. Or the federal government could advance the necessary
money to the states for a few months, without receiving the data
normally required to justify such payments. Likewise, a state
having difficulties could seek help from other states with extra
computer capacity, or could hire private companies to write checks
and perform other tasks normally done by government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even a state that fixes its own computers may have problems if
its repairs are not compatible with those made by the federal
government or by counties and cities in the state. In addition,
state officials must deal with thousands of providers and vendors
of services, who may or may not have made the necessary computer
changes.
</P>
<P>
   A state Medicaid program, for example, receives tens of
thousands of electronic claims from doctors, dentists, hospitals,
pharmacies, nursing homes and home health agencies. If such health
care providers do not fix their computers to cope with the year
2000, their Medicaid payments may be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Schnedler, deputy director of computer operations for the
Missouri Medicaid program, said there would be no problem paying
hospitals and chain drug stores that file large numbers of Medicaid
claims. But he said he worried about doctors and dentists who filed
just a few claims a month. State employees may have to do some
``manual manipulation'' of the data before paying such claims, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, the White House official supervising preparations for
the year 2000, said, ``Six or eight states have difficulty even
identifying who operates these electronic data exchanges,'' so they
are in no position to test the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jinnett, a lawyer who specializes in technology issues,
said several states, including Georgia, Virginia and Hawaii, had
passed laws to shield themselves against lawsuits that might be
filed if their computers fail. Under such laws, he said, if a
person does not receive a benefit check and therefore cannot buy
medicine needed to treat a severe illness, the person might be
barred from suing the state for damages.
</P>
<P>
   States are attacking the year 2000 problem in different ways and
vary greatly in their efforts to measure progress.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Worsham, data processing manager for the Medicaid program
in Oklahoma, keeps track of her work with great precision. ``As of
Nov. 5,'' she said, ``we have completed 55.07 percent of the work
to be done by June 30, 1999, and we have used 56.51 percent of the
days available since we started on Jan. 1 of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Health and welfare officials in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut said they had been renovating their computers for
several years and foresaw no major problems. ``We are about 95
percent ready for the year 2000,'' said Joyce Thomas, commissioner
of social services in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarah Mingledorff, deputy commissioner of the Alabama
Medicaid Agency, said: ``Our existing computer system is not being
touched. We won't upgrade it. We'll put in a new one on Oct. 1,
1999.'' Federal officials said that was a high-risk strategy
because information technology projects were rarely completed on
time and often required extensive testing to eliminate defects.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama has posted a progress report on the Internet. It says,
``Jan. 1, 2000, will be here before most of us are ready.''
Moreover, it shows that the state has done just 6 percent of the
necessary work on the computers that track child abuse and neglect
cases, and less than 10 percent of the work needed to fix the
computers that issue food stamps and welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared for Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina says
that ``a significant number of large computer systems will
experience year 2000-related failures'' despite the best efforts of
state employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payments to welfare recipients could be severely delayed
because compensation systems either halt or produce checks so
erroneous that the system must be shut down and checks processed
manually,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   California has upgraded its Medicaid computers, but told the
General Accounting Office that it could not provide statewide data
on the renovation of computers used to establish eligibility for
welfare and food stamps because the computer systems varied from
county to county.

   Oilers (6-5) at Seahawks (5-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Quarterback Jon Kitna was the most valuable player of
NFL Europe's World Bowl in 1997. Those Barcelona Dragons _ you
can't stop them, you can only hope to contain them. Now, he gets
only his second start in the big league against an average Oilers
defense. He'll put up some points, but the key for Seattle is
stopping running back Eddie George. The Seahawks have 41 sacks, but
pass rushing isn't the key, run stopping is. George already has
1,025 yards rushing and should add on about 100 more.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 19-14
</P>
<P>
   Saints (5-6) at Dolphins (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is where Coach Jimmy Johnson earns the big bucks.
His Miami team is coming off a crushing loss to New England on
Monday Night Football. After the game, Johnson simply stood on the
sideline with his jaw open. He was stunned. Now Johnson must pick
his mouth off the carpet and propel his team to win. They must have
this game and it's a scary one for the Dolphins. Quarterback Kerry
Collins is beginning to look like the franchise quarterback he was
supposed to be in Carolina. And the New Orleans defense, which has
played great all season, is up to the task for stopping one of the
worst receiving corps in football.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 13-12
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (2-9) at Packers (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Blowout city, Part II. Some Minnesota coaches felt
that Packers Coach Mike Holmgren was overconfident before his game
with the Vikings. The Packers lost by two touchdowns. Holmgren had
better not be cocky this week, no matter how bad the Eagles are.
Coach Ray Rhodes, who was on the San Francisco staff when Holmgren
was there, would love to beat his old friend. He'll have the troops
fired up. But the Packers have a top-three wide receiver in Antonio
Freeman, who is averaging 19.9 yards per catch on third down. He
and quarterback Brett Favre hook up at least five times.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 28-10
</P>
<P>
   Redskins (2-9) at Raiders (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Raiders quarterback Donald Hollas may not be a pretty
thrower, or the best player in the league, but he is 4-1 as a
starter, with his only loss coming to undefeated Denver. Not bad.
Washington showed a lot of guts in coming back against Arizona. But
they must be drained. That was a long game and it has been a long
season. They have nothing left to play for except the `p'
word_pride. The Raiders are playing for their own `p' word _
playoff position.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 30-18
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (11-0) at Chargers (5-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Denver can clinch the AFC West with a victory or an
Oakland loss. But they'll win the division, either this week or
next. It's just a matter of time. But that of course is not the
story with this team _ whether they can go undefeated is. They
won't, and this is the road block. The Broncos look unbeatable,
especially early in the game, when they have outscored opponents in
the first quarter by 104 points, the second largest margin in
league history (the Chiefs did by 128 points in 1966). If the
Chargers can weather the storm early, and they will, they'll be in
the ballgame. San Diego is a different team than when these two met
earlier this month and the Broncos cruised, 27-10. The Chargers'
defense has gelled even more and given up just 255.7 yards a game,
tops in the league. San Diego allows only 65 yards on the ground.
Memo to Terrell Davis: Pack some extra padding. You are going to
get hit harder than you have all season.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 24-23
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT GAME
</P>
<P>
   Giants (4-7) at 49ers (8-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The only chance the Giants have of winning this game
is if they open up the offense. That's what a vastly overmanned New
Orleans team did against the 49ers last week and they made a game
of it. The Saints threw deep on their very first pass play of the
game. Will the Giants try that? They should. Have quarterback Kent
Graham, who has one of the strongest arms in the league, throw at
least 40 passes _ and not that dink and dunk stuff, either. The
Giants will probably be in the game because Coach Jim Fassel knows
he can't be conservative on offense if he has any chance of
winning. Defensively is where the Giants are in trouble. With a few
exceptions, they don't have the firepower to stay with the 49ers'
offense, which averages an NFL-high 422.2 yards a game.

SUNKEN LOOT WORTH MILLIONS IS SUDDENLY WITHIN REACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (rl) 
 By BY GORDON ARNAUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Spanish galleon known as the Santissima Trinidad went down in
a fierce 1711 hurricane just a few miles west of Havana harbor.
Loaded with $400 million worth of gold bullion, silver ingots and
coins, the ship has lain undisturbed for centuries, guarded by
Fidel Castro's gunboats since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But the ship is not likely to rest in peace much longer. Last
February, at a ceremony presided over by Carlos Lage, Cuba's vice
president, and the ambassador of Canada, Keith Christie, a Toronto
company was awarded a five-year contract for salvage rights to the
treasures that lie sunken in Cuba's territorial waters. It will be
the first such effort by a Western treasure hunting concern.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the company, Visa Gold Resources, are meeting this
week in Havana with their Cuban joint venture partner, Geomar SA,
to finish plans for an on-the-water survey intended to pinpoint a
handful of the galleons that are most historically significant _
and most likely to hold treasure. The survey is expected to start
in December, with the hunt getting under way in earnest by March,
according to Doug Lewis, Visa Gold's president.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Cuban waters contain the richest concentration
of sunken Spanish treasure anywhere _ perhaps tens of billions of
dollars in New World riches from the era of European conquest.
</P>
<P>
   But while that treasure seems tantalizingly within reach,
recovering the ships and their loot will be a formidable task. For
all the sunken treasure around the globe, only a tiny fraction has
ever been found.
</P>
<P>
   Visa Gold's assigned territory, some 1,500 square miles off
Cuba's northwest coast, Havana harbor and a portion of the southern
shore of the island, is believed to contain as many as 500 sunken
galleons, 400 of them in Havana harbor. Lewis said the company
would seek ``the most likely targets with the largest amount of
reported treasure on the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other salvage companies _ Terra West, another Canadian
company, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and a South African
consortium _ have been given permission to explore Cuban waters for
sunken treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the February agreement, Visa Gold's marine archaeologist,
Phill Wright, and Jack Haskins, a consultant based in Florida, have
been researching archives at Spain's House of Trade in Seville and
at the Royal Naval Library in London and have been poring through
historical records in Cuba and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   They have pieced together a chronicle of Spanish exploitation,
tracing the routes of sailing ships between the New World and the
Old. Of the estimated 13,000 Spanish ships that sailed over a
two-century period, perhaps as many as half sunk before reaching
their destination in Seville. Many of these vessels went down near
Cuba, leaving what, at today's values, is as much as $100 billion
at the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential in Cuba is mind boggling,'' said Patrick J.
Clyne, vice president of Salvors Inc. ``It would make Key West look
like it didn't have any wrecks at all.'' Salvors, under the
direction of the flamboyant treasure hunter Mel Fisher, found the
Nuesta Senora de Atocha, a treasure-laden galleon that sank off the
Florida Keys in 1622. The company recovered about $400 million in
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 16th and 17th centuries Havana was the main port
of commerce for the New World. Its deep harbor was an ideal
collection point for Spanish galleons that cruised up and down the
east coast of South and Central America amassing gold, silver,
platinum, emeralds and jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Visa Gold's deal with Cuba grew out of negotiations lasting two
years, according to Lewis, who was a senior Canadian Cabinet
minister in the previous government of Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney. The deal gives the Cuban government half of the proceeds
of the venture, with the balance split evenly between Visa Gold and
Geomar, a branch of the Cuban Hydrographic Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what we feel is a fair and workable agreement,'' Lewis
said. Although Canada's government did not play an official role in
the negotiations, the friendly relations between the two countries
was an important factor in securing the deal, he added. Canada is
the second-largest export market for Cuba, after Russia, and
bilateral trade between the two countries was $717 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also breaks new ground in defining, beforehand,
the legal ownership of recovered treasure. ``In other ventures of
this kind around the world, when the diver comes up from the ocean
floor, he is met by a government lawyer who claims it all,'' Lewis
said. Preserving the historical integrity of the recovered
artifacts will be a priority of the project and was key to securing
the deal, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the relationship between treasure hunters
and archaeologists has long been stormy and salvors have often
clashed in court with state and federal authorities over claims to
their discoveries.

LAWYER PRESSES FOR HONOR SOCIETY TO ADMIT 2 STUDENTS WHO BECAME
PREGNANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawyer for two Kentucky high school seniors who said they were
denied admission to the National Honor Society because they became
pregnant has asked a federal judge to force the society to admit
the two students while they wait for their case to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't do them much good if they get admitted after they
graduate from high school in May,'' said Sara Mandelbaum, a lawyer
with the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project,
which represents the students, Somer Chipman, 17, and Chasity
Glass, 18, of Grant County High School in Williamstown, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the prestige of being in the honor society,''
Ms. Mandelbaum said, ``but being able to participate in its
day-to-day activities, which include meetings, service projects,
fund-raising and eligibility for National Honor Society
scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for the Grant County School District, Suzanne
Cassidy, countered: ``Participation in the National Honor Society
is a privilege. It is not a right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cassidy also represents the superintendent of schools and
the five-member faculty committee that selected the society members
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Bertelsman of U.S. District Court in Covington,
Ky., said he would rule by Jan. 1 on the request for a temporary
injunction forcing the society to admit the students, pending a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee for the honor society, Ms. Cassidy said,
usually evaluates candidates on the basis of scholarship,
leadership, service and character. In selecting members, local
chapters generally follow guidelines for the National Honor
Society, which has more than 15,000 members in high schools
throughout the United States. Local chapters may also set their own
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In her interviews with school officials, Ms. Cassidy said, she
found ``no evidence that sex discrimination, parental-status
discrimination or any other illegal discrimination played a part in
the decision by the faculty selection committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after the hearing on Tuesday, Ms. Mandelbaum said:
``The issue here is that a school cannot use pregnancy as a basis
for excluding a student from any educational activity. What the
school did in this case was to punish students for engaging in
premarital sex, but all they did was look to see who got pregnant,
and that rule affects only female students.''

FOR QUEBECERS, VIVE LA DIFFERENCE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Anywhere he goes in Quebec, from a secluded
restaurant on the east side of Montreal to the hardware aisles at
the Canadian Tire store in suburban St. Leonard, Claude Meunier
makes heads turn.
</P>
<P>
   But if the wildly popular star of Quebec's most watched
television program, and the man who helped make Quebec the only
place in Canada where Pepsi outsells Coke, happens to step across
the provincial border into Ontario or anywhere else in Canada,
Meunier's puckish face elicits not the slightest whisper or buzz of
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Language, of course, divides the predominantly French-speaking
province of Quebec from most of the rest of Canada _ and the rest
of North America, for that matter. And since Meunier's comedy and
commercials are done in French, his audience is basically limited
to the province.
</P>
<P>
   But language doesn't completely explain how different this
province is from the rest of the United States' largest neighbor,
or why at times like these _ when the province is holding critical
elections that will determine whether there will be another
referendum on separation _ the rest of Canada seems to be so at
wit's end trying to understand what is going on here.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, something as trivial as traffic. Quebec is
the only province in Canada that does not allow drivers to make a
right turn at a red light. It never has, in part because
transportation officials believe it is not safe, despite the
experience of the rest of the country, and most of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecers stand out in many other ways. They smoke more, get
divorced more and, according to one recent poll by the Southam
Newspaper chain, are more stressed out than people in the rest of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More of them tend to be apartment dwellers, more of them rent
their homes rather than own them and more of them rely on electric
heat than anywhere else in the country, in part because Quebec
produces more hydroelectric power than any other Canadian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Quebecers, to be different is good, even if it doesn't
always make much sense,'' said Ted Nation, an advertising executive
who lived and worked in Montreal for many years. ``Being different
helps them express who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, the differences are actually
reflections of a deep and seemingly unbridgeable abyss that
separates the 7 million Quebecers from the 22 million people in the
rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a question of character as a perception of
history,'' said Lise Bissonnette, a French-Canadian author and
former editor of the separatist newspaper Le Devoir. ``It has to do
with the way Quebecers see their country and that's the basic
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that this is a province where every automobile
license plate bears the fighting words ``Je me souviens'' _ `I
remember' _ and where many people have trouble thinking of Quebec
as just another province like tiny Prince Edward Island. Quebec is,
they insist, usually invoking the history of New France in North
America, a founding partner in the very concept of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what makes Quebecers different is that we are trying
to help our language and our culture survive, and this keeps us
very much alive,'' said Meunier during a lunch-time interview just
after he had finished filming the last episode of the season of his
series, ``Le Petite Vie'' (which roughly translates to `The Daily
Life').
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old Montreal comic, whose success allowed him to buy
a vacation house in Maine recently, said the tension of sustaining
a small island of French in a sea of English speakers in North
America gives artists and performers in Quebec a spirit that
energizes their work.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why the arts flourish in Quebec, even though
very little makes its way into the rest of Canada. According to one
recent survey, of 3,500 French books published in Quebec, only 40
were translated into English. And the record for translating
English into French is just as grim.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecers discovered the television program ``Baywatch'' two
years later than everyone else in North America, and they still
don't know who Ally McBeal is because the show isn't dubbed in
French yet. While most of what the rest of Canada watches on
television is produced in the United States, more than 70 percent
of prime time programming in Quebec is produced in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And Meunier's weekly television sitcom is the most popular of
all. The streets are deserted in many French-speaking towns when
the show is broadcast Monday evenings at 7:30. Several episodes
this season reached over 3.3 million viewers, out of 4 million
people who were watching television at the time, giving the show
the equivalent of a weighty 74 share. By contrast, the recent
widely watched interview with Dr. Jack Kevorkian on ``60 Minutes''
got a 24 market share.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Le Petite Vie'' began as a proposed 15-minute filler sketch
before the Saturday night hockey game on the French service of CBC
five years ago. Meunier, who was already a popular comedian _ and
instantly recognizable in the province because of the successful
soft drink commercials _ insisted that a full situation comedy
based on homespun Quebec characters could succeed, just as the soft
drink commercials worked because Quebecers recognized themselves in
the spots.
</P>
<P>
   His oddball comedy is a cross between All in the Family and The
Simpsons, with him as the father of a strange family and his
longtime comedic partner Serge Theriault as the mother. It is
impenetrable to viewers outside of Quebec even if they can
understand the heavily accented French.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about life, about Quebecois life,'' he says, but it also
stresses universal characteristics like jealousy, immodesty, vanity
and arrogance. It also tends to poke fun at the personality faults
that Quebecers know well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent episode, which aired just a week before the
Nov. 30 elections for control of the provincial government, the
characters addressed the serious question of independence in a way
that Canadians elsewhere in the nation would have trouble
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebec would become a country like Sweden,'' boasts one
character, repeating a promise separatist leaders have used to
justify their attempts to create a country with only 7 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I wouldn't vote for independence,'' says the family's
daft daughter, ``because it would be full of Ikea things.'' She was
referring to the Swedish company that sells furniture that has to
be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean,'' she says, pursuing logic that makes
Quebecers howl, but leaves other Canadians shaking their heads, ``I
might not be able to put together my own country.''

PRICE INCREASES BY BOEING, AIRBUS INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (rl) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM and JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antitrust regulators in Washington and at the European Union in
Brussels are conducting separate investigations into recent price
increases announced by the Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, the
world's largest manufacturers of big commercial airliners.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Airbus said Thursday that it had been notified
of the investigation by the Federal Trade Commission in the United
States. He denied that the two companies had cooperated in setting
prices. Sean O'Donnell, a spokesman for Boeing in Seattle, declined
to comment and referred inquiries to the commission. FTC officials
were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, the European competition commissioner, said his
office had also sent ``a series of questions'' to the companies,
Bloomberg News reported. ``We have received substantial responses
and are now evaluating them,'' van Miert said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC investigation, first reported Thursday by The Financial
Times of London, followed increases in list prices by both Airbus
and Boeing. Boeing raised prices on its aircraft by 5 percent on
July 21, its first increase in 23 years. Airbus made a 3 percent
increase in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no collusion whatsoever,'' said an Airbus spokesman
in Toulouse, France, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``That would be totally illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, European antitrust regulators threatened to block the
$14 billion merger of Boeing and the McDonnell Douglas Corp. The
European Commission let the deal go through after Boeing agreed to
back away from exclusive supplier contracts it had signed with
several U.S. airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have been struggling for market share. Boeing,
the long-standing leader, has had about 60 percent and Airbus about
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus recently obtained an order valued at $8.5 billion from
British Airways PLC, which had been virtually an exclusive customer
of Boeing, and a $3.5 billion commitment from a group of Latin
American airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials have said that to obtain such orders, Airbus
had to reduce prices sharply, possibly to levels below its costs.
They said plane makers often made deals at discounted prices,
expecting to recover in lucrative follow-up deliveries of spare
parts, services and additional orders for planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been under pressure to raise prices after a $178
million loss last year, its first in half a century. Ronald B.
Woodward, president of the commercial aircraft division at Boeing,
was forced out and company officials suggested that their priority
would be profitability, even if they lost market share to Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   The price of commercial jets has dropped 20 percent over the
last two years, squeezing the profit margins of plane makers.
Earnings at Airbus fell 61 percent, to $147 million, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Forgeard, who took over as chief executive of Airbus on
April 1, is under pressure to improve profits as Airbus changes to
a unified corporation. It was created as a loose consortium of four
companies _ Aerospatiale of France, Daimler of Germany, British
Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The revamped Airbus plans eventually to sell shares to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts found little merit in accusations of price
fixing. ``On the contrary,'' said Daniel Solon, an analyst in
London with Avmark International, a consulting firm. Price
increases would be ``a return to sanity by both companies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Forgeard's predecessor at Airbus, Jean Pierson, had cut
prices in a drive for market share. Boeing tried to match the
Airbus reductions. ``They are both right in getting less hysterical
about who has what relative share of the market,'' Solon said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission can impose severe fines on companies
that it finds have been fixing prices. Last month, the commission
fined Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., the big Swiss electrical engineering
company, $80 million on price-fixing charges involving heating
pipe, Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   This week, commission inspectors seeking evidence of price
fixing for plasterboard raided the offices of Lafarge SA and BPB
PLC, two big building materials companies, Bloomberg said.

BLAIR ADDRESSES IRISH PARLIAMENT, URGING COOPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By James F. Clarity   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Speaking as the first British prime minister
ever to address the Parliament of the Irish Republic, Tony Blair on
Thursday declared an end to centuries of British-Irish hostility
and said that London and Dublin must now work together to rescue
the stalled Northern Ireland peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, addressing a joint session of the Senate and the lower
house, used the occasion not to advance any prescription for the
peace effort but to nurture good will between two nations who have
been enemies for 800 years.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized his own Irish roots, waxed nostalgic about
childhood memories of Ireland and tried his tongue at Gaelic,
bringing smiles to many of the 226 Irish lawmakers in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   He also appealed to common history rather than to a history of
division, and received one of several ovations when he said: ``So
much shared history, so much shared pain. And now the shared hope
of a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was another in a string of efforts by Ireland and
Britain to move closer and was broadcast live by Irish national
television. ``It is a cementing of the close friendly relationship
between the two governments,'' said Brian Farrell, Irish
television's senior commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent steps include a visit by the Irish president, Mary
MacAleese, to Queen Elizabeth II in London, and a visit by Prince
Philip to Dublin two weeks ago. The queen is widely expected to
become the first British monarch to visit Ireland since it won
independence after a bloody insurrection in the early 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Blair urged a solution to the problems blocking the enactment of
the provisions of the Northern Ireland peace agreement approved in
the spring. He said the peace effort is ``at a difficult
juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   He alluded to the basic obstacle, the dispute over disarmament
of the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army in the
predominantly Protestant British province of Ulster. ``Let us not
underestimate how far we have come; and let us agree that we have
come too far to go back now,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to speak directly to the IRA, which has refused to
disarm, he added that it was ``time for the gun and the threat of
the gun to be taken out of politics once and for all; for
decommissioning to start.'' Decommissioning is Ulsterspeak for
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not asking anyone to surrender,'' he said. ``I am asking
everyone to declare the victory of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA and its political wing, Sinn Fein, insist, accurately,
that the peace agreement specifies only that disarmament will take
place by the spring of 2000. But leaders of Northern Ireland's
Protestant majority insist that some disarmament must start soon,
before Sinn Fein is allowed to participate fully in new
governmental power-sharing structures that will give Catholics more
political power in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sat unsmiling in the
visitors' gallery in the parliament chamber in Leinster House. He
is an elected member of the British Parliament in London, but
refuses to take his seat because that would involve an oath of
loyalty to the monarchy. Officially, Blair heads what is called Her
Majesty's government.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' claim that Sinn Fein is independent of the IRA is a
politically necessary fiction, in the view of the vast majority of
the people of the Irish republic and of Northern Ireland. He says
the IRA's 16-month cease-fire is convincing evidence that they want
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reflect on the sheer waste of children taught to hate,''
Blair said, ``when I believe passionately children should be taught
to think. No one should ignore the injustices of the past, or the
lessons of history. But too often between us, one person's history
has been another person's myth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old ways are changing between London and Dublin,'' he
continued. ``And this can spur the change and healing in Northern
Ireland too. The old notions of Unionists' supremacy and of narrow
nationalism are gradually having their fingers prised from their
grip on the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ireland and Britain became enemies 800 years ago, when an Irish
warlord invited an English warrior, Strongbow, to help him kill
other Irish armies. In the 17th century Oliver Cromwell led a
bloody punitive expedition to Ireland. Eamon de Valera, one of the
founders of independent Ireland, outraged Prime Minister Winston
Churchill by keeping the country neutral during World War II. In
1972, Catholic nationalists burned the British embassy in Dublin.
In 1979, the IRA killed the queen's cousin, Lord Mountbatten.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1980s and early 1990s an Englishman, Jack
Charlton, became the most popular man in Ireland as he made the
national soccer team a world-class contender. And in 1997, Irishmen
and women placed thousands of bouquets outside the British embassy
after the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small minority of the Irish lawmakers can speak Gaelic,
one of the two official national languages, but most knew enough to
applaud Blair's attempt when he said, ``Go raibh mile mait
agaibh,'' roughly, ``thank you from the bottom of my heart.'' They
also enjoyed the prime minister's statement: ``Ireland, as you may
know, is in my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother was born in County Donegal ``above her grandmother's
hardware shop,'' he said. ``She lived there as a child, started
school there and only moved when her father died, her mother
remarried and they crossed the water to Glasgow.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in his childhood his family spent summer holidays
in Ireland. ``We would travel the beautiful countryside of Donegal.
It was there in the seas off the Irish coast that I first learned
to swim, there that my father took me to my first pub, a remote
little house in the country, for a Guinness, a taste I've never
forgotten and which is always a pleasure to repeat,'' Blair said.

SPANISH JUDGE HOPES TO SEE SECRET FILES IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (with PINOCHET, PINOCHET-CHILE)  
 (bl)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Spanish judge who wants former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet to stand trial plans to go to Washington to try to
see secret government files, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the judge's plans to build case will proceed,
regardless of whether the general continues to be held in detention
in London or is freed. Wednesday the House of Lords rejected the
general's claim to immunity. That leaves it up to the British
government to act on the Spanish extradition request to try the
general on charges of terrorism, torture and genocide. The Spanish
judge, Baltasar Garzon, filed the request in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon is said to be particularly interested in U.S. government
files about events of the 1970s, when the CIA and other U.S.
Embassy personnel were close to the Pinochet government and knew of
the activities of its powerful secret police. This police force is
widely considered responsible for the worst excesses of the
Pinochet government, including the kidnapping, torture and secret
execution of leftist opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has thousands of secret files from that period, and
Garzon is expected to ask for hundreds of specific documents from
the State and Justice departments relating to events in Argentina
as well as Chile. He will be making the request under the Mutual
Legal Assistance Treaty, which allows for such exchanges and was
signed by Spain and the United States. He will also ask to hear
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the trip, which would be the second by
a member of the Spanish investigating team.
</P>
<P>
   Another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, who has since stepped
down from the investigation, went to Washington last January after
the United States indicated it was willing to cooperate. But court
officials said that the judge made little headway because he was
only given documents that were already in the public realm. Garzon
hopes for different treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton last month, after Pinochet's
arrest, 36 U.S. congressmen complained that despite the president's
personal promise, the government had been slow to help Spain in the
case. ``It is our understanding that the United States has
materials and other critical information that will help link
Pinochet directly to acts of international terrorism,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the letter said, the Justice Department did not
elicit important testimony from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department material stems from its investigation of
a car bomb that went off on Sheridan Circle in Washington in 1976,
killing former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and an
American, Ronni Moffitt. Agents of the Chilean secret police
prepared and detonated the time bomb and the former secret police
chief, Gen. Manuel Contreras, is in prison for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   This killing is one of the events in which Garzon is interested.
He wants to know if and how Pinochet was linked to the event. At
the time Contreras answered to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon is also interested in finding out more details about
Operation Condor, which was a pact that the intelligence services
of five South American military governments made in 1975 to hunt
down leftists and to stamp out what they considered a communist
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condor practiced international terrorism, they kidnapped
people across borders, exchanged prisoners and tortured and
secretly killed them,'' a Spanish court official involved in the
investigation said this week. ``There is an interest in Condor
because it shows the coordination of the crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   A declassified cable from the U.S. Embassy in Argentina, dated
September 1976 and part of Garzon's files, said Operation Condor
was conceived to carry out joint operations against ``leftists,
communists and Marxists'' in which special teams would ``locate and
surveil the target'' while other teams would ``carry out the actual
sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable said that Chile was the center of the operation and
that other countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and
Uruguay and perhaps Brazil, also took part. It said that members
showing ``the most enthusiasm to date'' have been Chile, Argentina
and Uruguay. Dozens of people were reportedly kidnapped and killed
under the plan, including Spanish citizens, two Uruguayan
congressmen, students and political activists.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon wants to know more about the number of victims of the
operation and to gather more information about the responsibility
of Pinochet and other Chilean and Argentine military figures.
</P>
<P>
   In another, parallel investigation, Garzon is focusing on the
fate of Spanish and other victims during the so-called ``dirty
war'' in Argentina between 1976 and 1983, when its military and
police forces secretly imprisoned and executed more than 10,000
people in their campaign against leftists. He will also request to
see U.S. government documents relating to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers believe that Washington's files are richest
on Chile, though, because of its deep involvement in Chile before
and after the military coup of 1973 in which Pinochet seized power.
The Nixon administration openly favored the coup and helped prepare
the climate for the military intervention against the socialist
government of President Salvador Allende Gossens, by blocking
loans, financing strikes and supporting the opposition press.

   It is Washington's own role at the time that may inhibit its
cooperation with the Spanish investigation today, some American
human rights workers think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. may have more documents linking Pinochet to the
Letelier killing and to other events,'' said Reed Brody, a lawyer
with Human Rights Watch in New York. ``But the U.S. has been less
than interested in cooperating with Spain. If this were a case the
U.S. would like to see prosecuted, the response would be more
energetic and cooperative.''

STUFFED ANIMALS WITH ATTITUDE MAY SPUR TOY SALES 
</HEADLINE>

   Furby? Fuhgeddaboutit.
</P>
<P>
   A stuffed animal with attitude, Furby has already been turned by
marketing buzz and a media blitz into the hot toy of the Christmas
season. It is generating out-the-door lines at any store bold
enough to admit it has a few in stock. And most parents trying to
satisfy the demands of a teary-eyed 9-year-old are going away
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had Furby in our stores for more than 15
minutes,'' said Michael Glazer, chief executive of Kay-Bee Toys,
the mall-based retail chain owned by Consolidated Stores Corp. The
Furby frenzy even has him taking calls from lots of old friends
trying to get their hands on the toy. ``I'm hearing from people
that I haven't heard from in years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furby is one of the few sure-fire hits in what promises to be a
good, but probably not great, toy-shopping period from now through
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The expected blockbusters include Mattel's talking Bounce Around
Tigger, whose chief redeeming social value is that it gyrates
uncontrollably. Toys based on the television shows ``Blue's Clues''
and ``Teletubbies'' as well as those tied to the ``Rugrats'' show
on Nickelodeon, with its movie tie-in this year, are also expected
to be exceptionally popular.
</P>
<P>
   A product from the Lego Group that melds technology and
tradition is in the mix of potential hot sellers. Lego is rushing
to raise output of Lego Mindstorms, the next generation of its
classic toy, which combines robotics with building blocks.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Barbie still rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Furby appears to be in a special class. Tiger Electronics,
the unit of Hasbro that makes Furby, said it was on target to sell
more than a million of the animated stuffed animals this year,
double the number it had expected. The supply, however, is far less
than the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal seems to be that, at $30, Furby is a
relatively affordable product that is both snuggly and smart, said
Roger Shiffman, president of Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Furby has bug eyes, big ears and an annoying need for attention.
It speaks an imaginary language called Furbish but eventually
learns English. That is when it begins to act like an antsy
4-year-old, laughing when tickled, singing jingles and even
sneezing in your face. ``It's a lot of toy for the money,''
Shiffman said.
</P>
<P>
   But can the short supply of Furbys and other popular playthings
really be a result of children all making out the same wish lists?
Or could it be that toy makers are deliberately not making enough,
to stir up an even greater frenzy?
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers say unexpected consumer interest, whipped up
by the media and advertising, is to blame. It is not very different
from what happened in the early 1980s with Cabbage Patch dolls and
with Tickle Me Elmo two years ago after Rosie O'Donnell plugged it
on her television talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those shortages, though, consumers willing to spend a lot
more have an alternative this year: an online auction site, Ebay
(www.ebay.com), has been selling Furbys for as much as triple the
retail price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the interest in a few hot products, toy companies
are expecting only modest gains in sales this season.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us, the United States' largest toy retailer, has the
most on the line. The company is struggling to remake itself after
turning in consistently dismal financial results for much of the
year. The problem? Shoppers have increasingly become frustrated
with the mammoth and often chaotic stores. And many have simply
driven past Toys ``R'' Us stores to do one-stop-shopping at
Wal-Mart or Dayton Hudson's Target.
</P>
<P>
   To fight back, Toys ``R'' Us has cut costs, in part by paring
inventory, which has meant smaller orders to manufacturers. Another
problem across the industry is that many of the most promising
items have been slow to hit the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, about 70 percent of the industry's revenues came
from holiday selling. And while half of the business still comes in
the critical fourth quarter, the industry has been aggressively
trying to get people to buy more playthings during other times of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years the strategy has worked well, as
companies sold Tickle Me Elmo, virtual pets, Beanie Babies and
other top-selling toys all year long. Keeping consumers interested
in toys in the summer and spring enables companies to more
accurately gauge how their year is shaping up before heading into
the holiday. That, in turn, allows them to adjust promotions and
supplies at crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, perhaps because of difficulties among Asian
suppliers suffering from financial stress, production has been
slow, which has once again tightened the selling period. So that
kink, along with some product shortages, may make for spotty
industrywide sales. ``Up to this point we're really kind of
break-even,'' said Terri Bartlett, a spokeswoman for Toy
Manufacturers of America, a trade group. ``With the holiday season,
we are expecting it to kind of pull us through.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry expects to turn in a modest 2 percent sales gain
over last year's revenue of $22.5 billion, according to the toy
group. ``I think the season is going to end up looking good,'' Ms.
Bartlett said. ``I don't know that it's going to surmount what we
had to face from the rest of the year.''

   SODOMY-PRECEDENT _ ATLANTA _ When Paolo Pavesich picked up a
Sunday edition of the Atlanta Constitution in November 1903, he
couldn't believe his eyes. There he sat, photographed in natty
attire, in a display advertisement, next to another photograph of a
man looking gaunt and unhappy. A caption said Pavesich was reaping
the benefits of buying New England Mutual Life Insurance policies.
The person in the other photo was described as ``the man who
didn't.'' Because Pavesich, an Atlanta artist, had never purchased
insurance from New England Life and never given the company
permission to use his photo, he filed suit for invasion of privacy.
His case would provide an opportunity for the Georgia Supreme Court
to become the first court of its kind to recognize an enforceable
right to privacy _ 60 years before the U.S. Supreme Court arrived
at the same conclusion. On Monday, when a 6-1 majority of the
Georgia Supreme Court overturned the state's anti-sodomy law,
privacy was its primary focus, not heterosexual or homosexual
behavior. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 UNDATED: the year.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The range of nifty products certainly helps. And the industry
should benefit not only from the healthy economy but also from the
fact that companies are increasingly coming out with toys that
appeal to a wider age range and both genders. Typically toys grab
the attention of boys or girls, but not both, and appeal to
youngsters in a narrow age range.
</P>
<P>
   That is still mostly the case. The wildly popular dolls based on
the ``Blue's Clues'' and ``Teletubbies'' television programs still
appeal almost exclusively to very young children. And Mattel's
timeless toy, G.I. Joe, is still mainly a boy's toy while its
Barbie doll is still a girl's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   But many more toys are bridging the gaps, which lets toy
companies draw from a larger group. Beanie Babies, still much in
demand, appeal to girls from kindergarten to junior high school.
Even their parents are sometimes shelling out as much as $1,000 to
collect ``retired'' characters. And Lego says fathers are buying
its updated building blocks for themselves as well as their
children of both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   The new version also expands the appeal to older children,
particularly boys, the company said. Lego Mindstorms allow users to
build robots and vehicles that will move and follow commands
programmed into a hand-held electronic brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding this technology to the product maintains its core value
but makes the product more relevant for older kids,'' said John
Dion, a spokesman for Lego. The appeal for adults? ``A lot of guys
grew up loving Legos and now they are really into computers and
this combines both their interests,'' Dion said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some drawbacks to this product, however. Some
potential buyers may get sticker shock at the $200 price tag. It
also requires a computer to program the nerve center that brings
the toys to life.
</P>
<P>
   While product appeal may be changing as toys develop brains,
purchasing patterns are also evolving. More people are shopping at
discount stores these days, and those chains are expected once
again to set off fierce price wars to lure even more parents away
from traditional toy retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target ``are using toys to get people in
their stores and these stores get so much traffic to begin with
that Toys ``R'' Us is finding that hard to combat,'' said Gene
Gilligan, executive editor of Playthings magazine, a toy-industry
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Online toy sellers are trying to broaden their appeal as well,
playing up the ease of point-and-click shopping. Etoys
(www.etoys.com), an online toy seller, has taken a hit at large
retail competitors with a new television advertising campaign that
pokes fun at the frustrations of shopping in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing the commercials do is remind people that
stores are not fun and then it reminds them that there is an
alternative,'' said Toby Lenk, chief executive of Etoys, a unit of
Idealab.
</P>
<P>
   Etoys also says it has an edge over traditional stores because
in addition to the widely known toys, it offers specialty items
that the big retailers do not bother to stock. This year, for
example, Etoys has had a run on a brew-your-own root beer kit from
a tiny company called Copernicus. Special items like this are
``selling neck and neck with the big guys,'' said Jane Saltzman,
vice president of merchandising at Etoys.
</P>
<P>
   Some categories that remain flat are board games and action
figures. And some of last year's hot sellers are also beginning to
lose their luster. Virtual pets are a bit of a yawn this year, and
youngsters finally seem to have grown weary of some of those
wiggle-and-giggle toys.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the respite. It won't last.

 &HT;    Classic has Williams feeling tense
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the starting quarterback his freshman year at
Grambling State, Doug Williams led the Tigers to a 21-0 victory
over state rival Southern University in the first Bayou Classic.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1974, after former Grambling coach Eddie Robinson
had fought successfully to play the game in Tulane's stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the 25th anniversary of the Bayou battle, Williams,
who was 4-0 against Southern as a player, will make his first
appearance against the Jaguars as Grambling's head coach. The SWAC
teams will play in the SuperDome in New Orleans in front of a crowd
expected to exceed 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but for the first time since I've
been coaching, I've felt a little tense,'' said Williams, who was
head coach at Morehouse in heading into the '97 season. ``I think
the hype surrounding this game, the events and the expectations all
hit me at once. I had a terrible headache the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Since replacing his old coach a year ago just a few weeks after
Southern won its fifth in a row over the G-men, Williams already
has improved on the back-to-back 3-8 finishes that tarnished the
end of Robinson's otherwise illustrious career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could pull it off in this game, we'll finish with a
winning record,'' said Williams, whose Grambling squad is 5-5, to
the Jaguars' 7-3 record. ``But if we don't win, it's not a bad
reflection on the season, because we've already accomplished a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a talented team I was expecting a lot of, I'd say
the season has been up and down,'' Williams said. ``But considering
what we were up against when we started, and the changes we had to
make, I'd say that it's been mostly up.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players in particular have stood out for the Tigers, who
lost two games by a combined 14 points. Ironically, one of them was
in a different uniform when Grambling and Southern played in the
Bayou two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Lionel Hayes, who has thrown for 1,992 yards
and 17 touchdowns while being tutored by a guy who was a Super Bowl
MVP, transferred from Southern. Newcomer Robert Taylor of
Birmingham, among the top SWAC tacklers with 72 as a linebacker,
has emerged as a building block in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably played better than anybody else in this
league,'' Williams said about Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what goes down _ or up _ for Grambling today, the
future appears to be bright. Williams, who was an assistant at
Southern in '85, thinks the Tigers have started their return to
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a leg up on recruiting, especially compared
to last year, when we came in like cold turkey,'' he said. ``We've
been in a lot of schools, people know us, and the kids are
responding to us. The future looks pretty good.''

 &HT;    Ga. Tech looking to play its options
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With all the emphasis on Joe Hamilton's arm, it might
be the quarterback's legs and how he runs the Georgia Tech ground
game that makes the difference Saturday against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech is averaging an ACC-second-best 178 yards a game,
much of it from the option. Hamilton has run it successfully
against Virginia, Florida State and Clemson and plans to do the
same against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of our best-executed plays,'' running back Phillip
Rogers said. ``If you try to go on the tailback, Joe is as good as
any running back.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's defense gave up big rushing games to Tennessee (210
yards) and Kentucky (204 yards) but otherwise has done well against
the run, holding four of the other eight opponents under 100 yards.
The Bulldogs are fifth in the SEC, allowing 126.7 yards rushing per
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia coach Jim Donnan anticipates Tech to run more option
than the Dawgs have seen this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They present a real challenge to us,'' Donnan said, ``because
we see some option in our conference but nothing like what they
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech complements its option game with Phillip Rogers and Joe
Burns running between the tackles. But even when such tough run
defenses as Florida State and Clemson have closed down the inside,
Tech has found room outside on the option. How?
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed,'' said tailback Charlie Rogers, a beneficiary of
Hamilton's pitches on the corner. ``It goes along with the
offensive tackles. They're blocking linebackers pretty (well) so
Joe can get out on the corner and pitch it. The wide receivers are
blocking well downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech will use the triple option, with Hamilton sticking the ball
first into fullback Ed Wilder's belly or the double option with
Hamilton on the corner either keeping or pitching to Charlie Rogers
or Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their option game is really pretty versatile, and they do a
good job of attacking the defensive perimeter, based on your
run-support patterns and what you can do to stop their inside
runs,'' Donnan said. ``They work you hard on the perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, who was an option coach as the offensive coordinator at
Oklahoma, says he thinks that the Bulldogs are better prepared to
stop the option this year. Because Georgia is running the option
more on offense, the defense has gotten work on it against the
first-team in practice.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bulldogs have given up some significant yardage at
times, they are stingy around the goal line. Twenty-one times
opponents have ventured inside the Georgia 10, and only four times
have they scored rushing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Weakside linebacker Orantes Grant is Georgia's leading tackler
with 109 and the man who always seems to make the key plays on
goal-line stops. Defensive tackle Richard Seymour is Georgia's
leading tackler among defensive linemen and fourth overall with 63
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got guys up front who are very athletic,'' Tech coach
George O'Leary said. ``They've got great range and great height.
They hold the point very well. I'm very impressed with their
secondary. They're extremely athletic. They play the ball and the
run very well. . . . What I see (is, that) once you are successful
with something, they come back and take it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets, who outrushed Georgia last year 137-115, are
feeling good about their running game after piling up a season-high
319 yards against Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like that happens, it makes you want to do it
again,'' said Tech center Craig Page, honored this week by ACC
defensive coordinators as the best blocker in the conference. ``We
finally got it going; it gives you a lot of confidence going into
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-Georgia Tech game always guarantees physical play,
which should show up as Tech tries to find running room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know our line usually plays a good game for them and you
have to play your best to be able to run the ball on Georgia,''
Phillip Rogers said. ``If we attack, we'll be all right. . . . We
need to attack the first daylight we see.''

 &HT;    NBA rookies working off the wait
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Frustrated by a lockout that put his budding NBA
career on hold, Matt Harpring worked so hard and for so long that
his agent and family chased him out of the gym _ all the way to
Savannah, Ga., where he hung out with friends for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The fear: that when the former Georgia Tech star finally got his
chance with the Orlando Magic, his body might buckle under the
rigors of an NBA season, even a shortened one. ``I can't imagine a
harder worker,'' agent Richard Howell says.
</P>
<P>
   Roshown McLeod, after finally hitting his stride as a Duke
senior, found the delay in his career with the Atlanta Hawks so
discomfiting that he immersed himself in nonstop daily workouts at
his old high school, St. Anthony of Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The danger was that he would leave his edge in that old gym
where he spends his days with two Bob Hurleys, one his old prep
coach, the other the coach's son, another ex-Duke player and
veteran NBA guard. So, McLeod took off his birthday, Nov. 17, and
spent the day with his 3-year-old son, Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the rookie crop of '98, No. 15 pick Harpring says
that, when the lockout started July 1, ``I didn't expect anything
like this. If I were a high school senior or an underclassman
coming out, I'd be kicking myself right now. As it is, this thing
wears on you mentally. It's hard to retain the focus you need to
get better, and you know you have to get better to be successful in
the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Both rookies understand hard work. Harpring was courted as a
quarterback by Wake Forest and Northwestern. Then a growth spurt
made him a sought-after 6-foot-7 basketball swingman his senior
year at Marist. At Tech, he became an All-ACC first-teamer three
straight years and made Academic All-America, maturing into a
21.6-point, 9.4-rebound man his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod chose St. John's so he could remain in the New York area.
But after two disappointing seasons, he broke free and transferred
to Duke, where he emerged into a promising pro prospect. His
team-best 15.3 points per game, plus 5.6 rebounds, were enough to
put him on the All-ACC first team. Most important to the scouts, he
was playing his best games in the tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played over the summer at Duke with all the guys who came
back and the guys still on team, but now the competitiveness is
with yourself,'' says the 6-foot-8 McLeod, picked 20th overall.
``That's the hardest part right now. You don't have anyone to
measure yourself against.''
</P>
<P>
   At Duke, every day in the gym was about measuring up and
improving. ``I was making good strides at becoming a better player,
and now having to put it on hold is really difficult for me,''
McLeod says. ``I've worked so hard defensively, on conditioning, so
I can stay with wing players in the NBA. Now it comes to a holding
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   But McLeod says he thinks that, after making a successful
transition from St. John's to Duke, he can take the step up to the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always been a part of really successful programs, and the
St. John's experience was a setback,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So when he left, he aimed high, and Duke was a quantum leap.
``Guys who leave St. John's would go to a Manhattan school and know
what to expect,'' he says. ``But I have a dream to play in the NBA.
I knew unless big things happened, and I went back to the (winning)
level, it wouldn't happen. I wanted to be the reason for the
success, not just part of it. And I wanted to be able to take care
of my family. That went through my mind every day, and it worked
out for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not being able to compete that wears on these rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life right now centers around going into the gym,'' says
Harpring, who enjoyed pickup games with pros Charles Oakley,
Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett over the summer but now finds the
daily routine a relentless grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that wears on you is the anxiety of a new experience,
the wait before going into a new job, preparing and thinking about
it. You want to make a good impression. And the longer (the
lockout) goes, the more you think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between officials of the league and the players
union were promising late last week but hit a snag Tuesday,
jeopardizing the resumption of talks. Saturday's talks were
canceled, and games have been called off through Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys take this as vacation time,'' Harpring says. ``I
don't do it. I try to improve. That's my mentality. That's the way
it is for every rookie. You've still got to prove you can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish they'd set a date (to begin play). If they just
had a date to aim at and a work schedule, believe me, it would be a
lot more bearable.''

 &HT;    Sodomy decision stems from 1905 privacy ruling
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Paolo Pavesich picked up a Sunday edition of The
Atlanta Constitution in November 1903, he couldn't believe his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There he sat, photographed in natty attire, in a display
advertisement, next to another photograph of a man looking gaunt
and unhappy. A caption said Pavesich was reaping the benefits of
buying New England Mutual Life Insurance policies. The person in
the other photo was described as ``the man who didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Pavesich, an Atlanta artist, had never purchased
insurance from New England Life and never given the company
permission to use his photo, he filed suit for invasion of privacy.
His case would provide an opportunity for the Georgia Supreme Court
to become the first court of its kind to recognize an enforceable
right to privacy _ 60 years before the U.S. Supreme Court arrived
at a similar conclusion in a ruling that lifted a ban on birth
control.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when a 6-1 majority of the Georgia Supreme Court
overturned the state's anti-sodomy law, privacy was its primary
focus, not heterosexual or homosexual behavior. And in doing so, it
relied heavily on the extensive privacy protections laid out in the
1905 Pavesich decision. Pavesich's suit initially was dismissed and
he appealed to the state Supreme Court for the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   In granting that appeal in 1905, Justice Andrew Jackson Cobb
wrote: ``The right of privacy has its foundations in the instincts
of nature. It is recognized intuitively, consciousness being the
witness that can be called to establish its existence. Any person
whose intellect is in a normal condition recognizes at once that as
to each individual member of society there are matters private and
there are matters public so far as the individual is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Steve Sadow, who argued the sodomy challenge
before the Georgia Supreme Court, described the Pavesich decision
as ``a privacy foundation from which all other notions of privacy
have flowed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's opinion, Chief Justice Robert Benham noted that
Georgia courts have repeatedly followed the precedent laid out in
the 1905 right of privacy ruling. ``It is clear from the right of
privacy ... which emanates from Pavesich that the 'right to be let
alone' guaranteed by the Georgia Constitution is far more extensive
than the right of privacy protected by the U.S. Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the ruling has had an impact. On Tuesday, a
Northeastern Judicial Circuit judge threw out sodomy charges
against a former wrestling coach at Riverside Military Academy in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Supreme Court decision Monday reversed the Gwinnett
County conviction of Anthony Powell, who was found guilty of
sodomizing his 17-year-old niece. Her family filed the police
complaint. Sodomy is defined as when a person ``performs or submits
to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and the
mouth or anus of another.''
</P>
<P>
   Benham wrote, ``We cannot think of any other activity that
reasonable persons would rank as more private and more deserving of
protection from governmental interference than consensual, private,
adult sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The stunning and powerful decision drew heated protests from
conservative groups and gleeful exclamations from gay and civil
rights organizations. Conservative state lawmakers said they may
try to get voters to ratify a constitutional amendment that
reinstates the sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur lawyer Jeff Davis, who has studied and written about the
Pavesich ruling, described the 1905 decision as a ``springboard''
behind Monday's decision to abolish the sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can serve as one of the sources, but I don't think
by itself it dictates the result,'' Davis said. ``Pavesich was a
tort case for damages and did not do more than say there is a
general right of privacy. ... Clearly, Justice Cobb had no idea
that this recent ruling about sodomy would be something that would
follow from Pavesich.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer George Weaver, who unsuccessfully ran for a seat
on the Georgia Supreme Court this year, said the court reached too
far this week, noting that even the Pavesich decision set limits on
the right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake to confuse legislative and judicial
power, even though it may be expedient at the moment,'' he said.
``I think a ruling like this could easily be pushed to protect
same-sex marriage and adultery, drug use and possession, even
consensual adult incest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University law school professor,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all of that follows,'' he said. ``In many of
those instances third parties are involved, so it's not totally a
private matter. With adultery, there is the interest of the other
spouse involved. Drug use or possession is the tip of a large
commercial iceberg in which a stream of commerce leads a lot of
dead bodies in its wake.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Wiley, Gwinnett's chief assistant district attorney, said
his office will ask the court to reconsider its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to argue that Powell's niece did not
consent to having Powell perform oral sex on her. During trial,
Powell admitted having oral sex with his niece, but said she did
not say anything to indicate it was against her will. Prosecutors
have said the 17-year-old ``wept and remained silent,'' fearing
that if she yelled out Powell might harm her.
</P>
<P>
   Powell initially was charged with rape and aggravated sodomy,
and the question of force and whether it was against her will _
essential elements behind each conviction _ became issues at trial.
Superior Court Judge Fred Bishop also gave the jury the option of
convicting Powell of simple sodomy, and the jury found him guilty
him of only the crime he admitted to. For this reason, it was
proper for the Georgia Supreme Court to consider that the sodomy
was consensual, said Sadow, one of the city's most respected
criminal defense attorneys. Sadow noted that when Bishop instructed
the jury he said that ``consent on the part of the alleged female
victim is fatal'' to convictions for rape and aggravated sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   Because the jury acquitted Powell of rape and aggravated sodomy,
the state failed to prove the sexual acts were without the niece's
consent, Sadow said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ When Lee Kuan Yew, the father of modern Singapore,
wanted to transform this spit-and-polish outpost into a global
financial center, he urged people here to mimic the freewheeling
ways of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that under Lee's strict rule, Singapore had made a
virtue of being everything Hong Kong was not: clean, orderly,
buttoned-down, an oasis of Asian values worlds away from the
Western permissiveness of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a series of speeches over the last year, Lee, the senior
minister, and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, the deputy prime minister,
have called on regulators to use a lighter hand on Singapore's
markets. In this tightly run Asian citadel, the Lee family's
crusade quickly became official policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to decide to change policies when they are
working,'' said Lee Hsien Loong, 46, a brisk former army general
who also runs the powerful Monetary Authority and is expected to be
the next prime minister. ``But we got feedback from bankers and
others that if you want to take the next stage up, then really you
have to shift gears and allow more free play.''
</P>
<P>
   Few places on earth would set out to become more freewheeling as
methodically as Singapore would. But experts in Asia are not about
to poke fun: They say that this combination of flexibility and
dogged determination has enabled Singapore to steer a remarkably
steady course through the Asian economic typhoon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Singapore's economy finally slid into negative
territory in the third quarter, it had held out longer than that of
most of its neighbors. And several economists and analysts said
that Singapore's strategy of cutting wages, allowing the currency
to adjust downward and liberalizing the financial markets could
mean that Singapore will be in healthier shape after the crisis
than the normally resilient Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   While Hong Kong still has many advantages, Singapore is about to
give it a run for its money. Singapore has introduced a futures
contract based on the Hong Kong stock market that traders say is
the most serious challenge yet to Hong Kong's status as the
financial hub of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore has been more streetwise than Hong Kong,'' said J.
Mark Mobius, the president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund,
which moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore because of
its lower tax rates. ``They've exhibited a better understanding of
the crisis and sounder policy.''
</P>
<P>
   William Overholt, the director of Asia strategy at Nomura
International in Hong Kong, added: ``Singapore has been much more
willing to bite the bullet than Hong Kong. That's a big change.''
</P>
<P>
   While Singapore has thrown off old regulations and taken a knife
to its high costs, Hong Kong has moved in the opposite direction _
intervening to prop up its stock market, imposing a raft of new
restrictions on trading and suspending government sales of land to
stem the decline in real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing Hong Kong become more like the Singapore of the
past, and Singapore become more like the Hong Kong of the past,''
said Mac Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit Trust in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, Hong Kong has geography on its side. While
Hong Kong is the doorstep of China, a vast and still-growing
economy, Singapore is sandwiched between two of Asia's sickest
countries, Indonesia and Malaysia. Relations in the neighborhood
are fragile in the best of times and have frayed badly under the
pressure of the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, officials here said Singapore's precarious geography had
helped solidify popular support for the government's painful
recovery package, which seeks to carve $6.5 billion in costs out of
the economy, mostly through a reduction of 5 percent to 8 percent
in wages and even deeper cuts in pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason Singapore has been so cohesive for so long is
because of the economic and political stress we went through in the
1960s and 1970s,'' said the younger Lee, who introduced the package
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are very small and you have to struggle for your
living, if you don't hang together, you hang separately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, of course, it is often hard to separate active
support from pliant acquiescence. The Lee family still dominates
political discourse in this city-state of 3.4 million people. Its
governing People's Action Party holds 81 of the 83 elected seats in
the Parliament (10 members are appointed) and brooks little dissent
from opposition leaders, labor unions or the media.
</P>
<P>
   About the only public grousing over economic policy has come
from citizens' groups that say that Singapore's civil servants,
among the world's best paid, should bear more of the wage cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see people marching in the streets or even
a lot of letters in the papers,'' said Simon Tay, who is one of the
10 appointed members of Parliament. ``But the government listens to
the public and reacts.''

wondered if they'd be able to handle the changing face of the NFL.
Vermeil is struggling. After leaving the profession 15 or so years
ago because of burnout, he's facing those same demons while
coaching the Rams, Atlanta's Sunday opponent. In short, Vermeil
looks stressed, frustrated and sick. (Pasquarelli, Atlanta

 SINGAPORE: and reacts.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chia Yew Boon has the glass-is-half-full outlook that is typical
of Singaporeans. Chia was laid off recently when his employer, a
foreign bank, retrenched in Asia. But he is considering several job
offers and keeping things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so much better off than the rest of Asia,'' Chia said
over a lunch of Malay-Chinese food in one of Singapore's
traditional Chinese neighborhoods. ``We're not seeing famine or
riots in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering its heavy dependence on trade with Indonesia and
Malaysia, it is a minor miracle that Singapore's economy kept
growing as long as it did. Output fell by 1.5 percent in the third
quarter, the first quarter of reduced output in Singapore since
1986. Most economists think the city-state can still eke out
positive economic numbers for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, at least 20 percent of Singapore's exports go to
its two neighbors, both of which are in an economic free fall.
Because economists predict that the two countries will continue to
contract in 1999, it will be tough for Singapore to return to
sustained growth before the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles of Singapore's neighbors have especially hurt in
tourism and export services. Visitor arrivals are down 14.5 percent
so far in 1998, and many of those who now come are fleeing riots in
Jakarta rather than spending for getaway weekends at Singapore's
swank hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Singapore's lucrative export service business has
collapsed, as financially troubled Indonesian and Malaysian
companies can no longer afford to buy advertising, accounting and
other services in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has hurt Singapore in another highly visible way. When
it imposed capital controls on its markets on Sept. 1, the country
also prohibited shares of Malaysian companies from being traded in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused investors of
using Singapore as a staging ground to speculate against Malaysia's
currency. But the immediate effect of his action was to kill off a
thriving market _ and deprive Singapore of an arrow in its quiver
as a global financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these headaches, people in Singapore worry about the
long-term stability of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. With
214 million people, deepening social strife and islands that lie
just across the harbor from Singapore, an unstable Indonesia could
pose an acute economic and security threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these 200 million people are never again going to be a
market for us, that will be a big problem,'' said Tan Kong Yam,
head of the business policy department at the National University
of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   By drastically reducing costs, Singapore hopes to make its
exports more competitive to those of the rest of the world.
Although Asia accounts for half of its trade, Singapore is a
leading exporter of electronics, petrochemicals and other products
to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hong Kong, Singapore has allowed its currency to drift
downward, though not as much as other regional currencies. In
August, the Monetary Authority adopted a more flexible
exchange-rate policy, and the Singapore dollar has since risen
along with Asia's other resurgent currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the current crisis, Singapore was eager to stake
its claim as Asia's financial mecca. It exploited its convenient
time zone to become the world's fourth-largest foreign-exchange
market, after London, New York and Tokyo. But it trails Hong Kong
in stock trading and asset management.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Singapore sees a chance to close the gap. It has opened its
government bond market, eased restrictions on foreign brokerage
firms and tried to attract asset funds like Templeton by promising
low or zero tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Kuan Yew, who inspired the moves, said in a written response
to questions that he was influenced by Hong Kong's success, by
discussions with leading bankers and by his membership on the
international advisory board of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Company, where he
witnessed the changing world of global finance.
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or Simex, has
begun selling index futures contracts that track Hong Kong's
benchmark index, the Hang Seng. Simex hopes to win business by
offering lower margin requirements for its contracts than the Hong
Kong Futures Exchange, which raised its margin requirements in
September to thwart speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have welcomed Singapore's foray, and many are
considering whether to move their business southward. ``For the big
players, Hong Kong's costs have become punitive,'' said Bill Kaye,
the senior managing director of the Pacific Group, an asset
management fund in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong hurt its image even more when it threatened to deprive
Simex of the real-time data that traders need to calculate the
value of the Hang Seng index. Investors were able to get the data
on a Web site maintained by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials in Hong Kong say they plan to cut prices to fend
off the threat from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to maintain Hong Kong as the Manhattan of
China,'' said Randy Gilmore, the chief executive of the futures
exchange.
</P>

   For all of Singapore's moxie, Hong Kong will most likely cling
to that mantle for some time. The difference, according to experts,
is that Hong Kong's next-door neighbor, mainland China, is stable,
growing, and friendly, while Singapore's neighbors are shaky,
shrinking and potentially hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie fueled Singapore's anxieties
earlier this year when he dismissed the city-state as a ``red dot''
on the map. Singapore has also recently squabbled over its border
crossings with Malaysia, with which it has a tangled history of
close ties and bruised feelings.
</P>
<P>
   In building Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew frequently warned of
disaster around the corner as a way to mobilize his people. His son
said the current tribulations could have a bracing effect on a
population lulled by peace and ever-growing prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been quite helpful for Singaporeans to have heard this
remark about the `little red dot' because that's what we have been
telling them, too,'' the younger Lee said with a wry laugh. ``So
it's a timely reminder.''

DETERMINED TO SHARE THE WEALTH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   This is a story about a very generous man named Jim Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Not Jim Rogers the former hedge-fund manager, who wrote
``Investment Biker.'' We're talking about James Rogers _ but not
the longtime General Electric executive who recently became an
investment banker in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This is James E. Rogers _ but no, not the James E. Rogers who is
chief executive of the Cinergy Corp., the utility holding company
in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Those sound-alikes may be pretty open-handed, but it is James E.
Rogers of Las Vegas, Nev., who has just made philanthropic history.
This Rogers, a lawyer by training, is the owner and chairman of the
Sunbelt Communications Co., which owns KVBC, the NBC affiliate in
Las Vegas, and eight other television stations in five Rocky
Mountain states.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rogers doubled, to $100 million, an earlier
record-breaking pledge to the University of Arizona's college of
law in Tucson; promised $15 million more to match other donors'
gifts to the school, and pledged $15 million to other programs at
the university.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the initial $50 million, his gift was the largest ever
made to an American law school, according to Joel Seligman, the
dean of the school, which this month was named the James E. Rogers
College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has also made a $28.5 million pledge, announced on Nov.
4, to the new law school at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas,
and he has made numerous gifts to other colleges and schools in the
towns where Sunbelt owns stations.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should abandon the concept of `giving,' '' said
Rogers, a cherubic-looking man who wore jeans and a red tattersall
shirt to a recent lunch at a modest bistro in Manhattan. That
concept, he said, implies that one's success is one's own.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, he argued, ``your success is the convergence of a
lot of lucky events _ you were born in America, with a good brain,
with parents who taught you good values _ none of which you had any
control over.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, if those lucky breaks helped you build a fortune,
you should give most of it away. That's what he's planning to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have a right to spend whatever you believe is
necessary to maintain your chosen standard of living,'' Rogers
said. Born into a middle-class family, he maintains a very pleasant
standard of living himself _ with three homes, a horse-breeding
ranch in Idaho and a collection of 85 vintage automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   But after you get all the toys, ``what you have left, you hold
in trust for the public,'' he said quietly. ``I'm holding my money
in trust for education.'' Then, he added with a grin, ``if you
think of it that way, it makes it a lot easier to give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who is 60, is worth somewhere around $500 million. And
he has made it clear that he intends to give away about 75 percent
of that money to promote education _ because ``it is part and
parcel of who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the bulk of his fortune to his three successful adult
children is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving children wealth is like leaving them a case of
psychological cancer,'' Rogers said firmly, explaining that he
believes a child can never gain a sense of his true worth under
such circumstances. Beverly, his third wife, and his three children
all support his plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Louisville, Ky., Rogers moved with his family to Las
Vegas in 1951. In 1960 he earned a bachelor's degree in accounting
from the University of Arizona, and two years later he graduated
from the law school there. He added a master's in law from the
University of Southern California and almost finished a doctorate
in law at the University of Illinois before opening his law
practice in Las Vegas in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he and some business partners filed an application to
take over an existing television license in Las Vegas. In late
1978, after years of litigation involving the former owner, the
application was approved and Rogers, at 40, became a broadcasting
executive _ just as his region's growth broke into a gallop. ``We
caught lightning in a bottle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His pledge to the Arizona law school _ half of which is to be
paid over 20 years and the remainder upon his death _ will
transform his alma mater, said Dean Seligman, whose current annual
budget is just $7 million. Tuition increases, frequent in recent
years, will be a thing of the past. More scholarship money will
become available, and top faculty can be attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Rogers has heard most of the nasty lawyer jokes. ``Some of
them are pretty funny,'' he said. But he still thinks the law is a
noble calling. ``And I bet more lawyers would use their skills to
help the downtrodden if they did not come out of law school
$125,000 in debt,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers denies any religious impulse in his giving, but John
Sexton, the dean of the New York University Law School and an
informal adviser to Rogers, said he thought ``a deep moral
compulsion is at work _ and a belief in the impact the law can have
on society.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was clearly influenced by his friend and late business
partner, Louis Wiener Jr., a legendary Las Vegas lawyer whose
clients included most of the boom town's casino hotels and the
gangster Bugsy Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   Wiener, a tireless fund-raiser for charity, prodded friends to
be more generous by asking those who had attended funerals
``whether they had seen a Brinks truck riding behind the hearse,''
said Rogers, who was his friend's executor.
</P>
<P>
   When Wiener died in February 1996, Rogers followed his wishes to
the letter: Behind the hearse was a Wells Fargo armored truck _ all
the Brinks trucks in town were busy _ bearing a sign that read,
``I've changed my mind; I'm taking it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers got the hint: He is not taking it with him. ``I'd rather
distribute my assets myself than have the federal government
distribute them after I die,'' he said. ``I think I can do a better
job. And I sure as hell can have a lot more fun.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many working Americans will pay 8 percent to 20 percent more for
health insurance premiums next year, the sharpest price increases
since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The rises in premiums follow several years of failed efforts by
health maintenance organizations and other managed-care companies
to stem growing medical costs. Chief among those increases are the
costs of prescription drugs, advanced surgical devices and
techniques and services to patients outside hospitals. Cost-cutting
has also been thwarted by legislation in a number of states that
prevent HMOs from restricting patients' access to specialists and
diagnostic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   As costs climbed, health plans for a time had trouble raising
rates significantly because big employers and purchasing groups
beat down their demands and even, in some cases, forced them to
swallow lower premiums. But now, after a wave of mergers,
acquisitions and departures of HMO companies from some communities,
there is less competition _ and the HMOs have found it easier to
raise prices to try to restore profits.
</P>
<P>
   As businesses and organizations from Sears and American Express
and the federal government to law firms and gas stations face
sharply higher premiums, many of them, reluctant to irritate
workers in a tight labor market, are sharing the increases
proportionately with their employees. But others are asking
employees to pay more for out-of-pocket charges or to pay larger
percentages of the premium costs.
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand employees of J. Baker Inc., a retail shoe chain,
will pay 9 percent more in premiums next year, reflecting a 9.2
percent increase, on average, in the company's overall premiums.
Out-of-pocket charges to employees for prescription drugs,
admissions to hospitals and visits to doctors and emergency rooms
will also rise.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Finigan, benefits manager at J. Baker, which is based in
Canton, Mass., said that without the added out-of-pocket charges
for drugs, physicians and hospital care, overall premiums for the
company would have risen 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel Corp., a telecommunications company based in Little Rock,
Ark., will pay 9.6 percent more, on average, to 80 health
maintenance organizations, but the increases will be much steeper
for many of Alltel's 17,000 employees because the company pays only
a set amount for each employee.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel pays about 80 percent of a $497 monthly premium for a
family in an HMO. The company is raising its contribution for the
first time in four years, by 4 percent, said Joe Meyer, manager of
corporate benefit planning. Even so, some employees will pay 31
percent more, or $19.42 more each month.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at other companies may soon face similar increases,
including higher out-of-pocket charges for drugs, visits to doctors
and hospital stays, benefits executives and consultants said. And a
growing number of employers will be transferring even more of the
costs to employees by 2000, said Tom Beauregarde, a principal at
Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some medium-sized employers in Florida with 500 or 600 workers
``are getting killed,'' said Becky Cherney, president of the
Central Florida Health Care Coalition, a group of large employers
in Orlando. Her members have three-year HMO contracts with 3
percent annual increases, but some middle-sized companies are
facing 20 percent increases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Costs are also sharply higher for small businesses, and some are
considering giving up health benefits, which would add to the 43
million Americans who do not have insurance. Neil Caggiano, owner
of the Glen Head Flower Shop in the Long Island community of Glen
Head, N.Y., with nine employees covered, is waiting for notice of
his 1999 rates, which take effect in February. ``If it goes up
more, we may not be able to offer it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two employees at Howes &AMP; Howes, a four-person law firm in
Raritan, N.J., began contributing $10 a week last month. Tim Howes,
one of the partners, said their payments would help cover an
increase of $60 in the firm's monthly premiums. ``We had to switch
to less comprehensive coverage and still pay an increase,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Riverdale Texaco in Morris County, N.J., will face an 11 percent
increase, to $720 a month, to cover the owner, Sal Risalvato, and
two full-time employees. Risalvato joined an HMO offered by Aetna
U.S. Healthcare when his former insurer left the state. ``If we had
taken a comparable policy, the increase would have been 20
percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the biggest companies, the increases have jolted
corporate benefits executives, who fear a return to the fast-rising
health costs of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Government
economists say they expect that the upswing will continue over the
next few years, adding hundreds of billions of dollars to national
health spending. Medical costs are now projected by consultants to
rise 6 percent, more than three times as fast as the annual rate of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While information on next year's premiums is still being
gathered, the trend is already clear. Medical costs are up 6
percent and HMO premiums are rising 8 percent, according to a
survey of 50 of the nation's largest companies and 1,000
medium-sized employers by BT Alex Brown Inc., a Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   Health benefits executives across the country confirmed the
findings in interviews. Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. reported increases for
next year averaging 8 percent to 9 percent, compared with 3 percent
this year, at 200 HMOs that serve 136,000 Sears employees and early
retirees. The company declined to provide an average amount of
employee contributions, saying there were too many variations.
American Express said it would pay 8 percent more, on average, for
33,000 employees in 150 HMOs next year, after paying virtually no
increases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal employees, whose health plan is the nation's largest,
will pay 7.4 percent more, on average, next year. The government
agreed to average increases in premiums of 10.2 percent, the
biggest since 1989. The employees will pay only part of the
increase because the taxpayers are absorbing part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison employees who are union members will pay 8
percent to 9 percent more next year for HMO coverage, under a
three-year contract. Edwin Ortiz, director of employee relations
for the company, said HMO premiums paid by the company were rising
5 percent to 13 percent, compared with 6 percent to 9 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employees Retirement System bargained
rates down in each of the last four years. Now it has agreed to
increases averaging 7.3 percent for 900,000 members, including a
10.75 percent increase for Kaiser Permanente. Thirty-one thousand
state employees who have family coverage from Kaiser, for example,
will pay $18.57 a month. Previously the full premium was covered by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The premium increases have been welcomed on Wall Street, where
most health maintenance organizations have been out of favor with
investors during several years of small or nonexistent profits.
Indeed, by last year, most health maintenance organizations were
losing money, according to Interstudy, a managed care research
center in Minneapolis, and many HMOs are still in precarious
financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised and shocked that the price increases
are coming through,'' said William McKeever, a health care analyst
at Paine Webber Securities, who added that the year 1999 could be
the ``best since 1993'' for HMO profits.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In New York, where state approval is required for increases in
HMO premiums that exceed 10 percent, Empire Blue Cross and Blue
Shield recently received approval to raise rates for downstate
employers for a popular health plan by 15.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO industry has benefited from rapid consolidation, which
has left the surviving companies in stronger positions. Sixteen of
the nation's 25 biggest HMOs were swallowed by other managed care
companies in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few national carriers left: Aetna, Cigna,
United Healthcare,'' Ms. Finigan of J. Baker said. ``Because the
number is so limited, they are calling the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pinch is apparent in many places. In Chicago, a group of big
employers asked for bids from 11 local HMOs earlier this year. By
the time the negotiations ended, three had disappeared into mergers
and one had left town.
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of all insured workers now in HMOs or other
types of managed care, there are few opportunities left for
employers to lower costs just by transferring people to managed
care from traditional fee-for-service health plans. That process,
many experts say, was the prime factor in temporarily holding down
costs for employers.
</P>
<P>
   McKeever said managed care insurance was moving into
``underwriting cycles'' of three years of losses followed by three
years of profits, following a pattern in traditional insurance. In
the down cycle, insurers reduced rates to attract new business
until they lost money and ``had to either raise rates or exit the
business,'' he said.

BRITAIN SEEKS TO BUY TIME IN PINOCHET CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The effort by the former Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, to escape extradition to Spain and a possible trial for
mass killings moved into the political arena Thursday, with the
British government facing the decision of whether to go forward
with the diplomatically volatile case.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Straw, the home secretary, requested a week's extension,
into mid-December, of a court deadline for deciding whether to
authorize moving ahead on the Spanish petition for extradition or
letting the 83-year-old general return home. The deadline was set
in motion by a court ruling Wednesday that Pinochet did not have
immunity from extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean embassy Thursday night delivered written arguments
for Pinochet's release to the Home Office, and Chile's foreign
minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, was flying here from Santiago for a
Friday meeting with Robin Cook, the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Holding to a government line increasingly strained by events,
Cook said he would emphasize to his Chilean counterpart that the
extradition process was a judicial one and not a political one.
Straw, for his part, said he would be acting in a
``quasi-judicial'' role.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is an awkward one for Prime Minister Tony Blair's
government. Britain is eager not to jeopardize its close
diplomatic, military and business relationships with Chile, but any
move to rid itself of the unwanted case would run counter to the
commitment that Blair has made to an ``ethical'' foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   It would also bring condemnation from the large numbers of
Europeans who revile Pinochet and the many members of Blair's Labor
Party with strong memories of the repressive government that
Pinochet ran. Rights groups that were elated by the ruling
Wednesday would also be upset. Straw, a key member of the Blair
Cabinet, was himself a college radical who marched in anti-Pinochet
rallies in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The Law Lords of the House of Lords, England's highest court,
set the stage for the Blair government's deepening preoccupation
with the case on Wednesday by ruling that Pinochet did not have
sovereign immunity from arrest under British law. The majority in
the 3-to-2 decision argued that crimes like hostage-taking and
torture could not be considered the functional acts of a head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, an unexpected reversal of a unanimous lower court
decision last month in Pinochet's favor, was hailed by human rights
groups and a number of European governments as a major advance in
international law and a warning to tyrants that they could not
escape punishment for abuses in office.
</P>
<P>
   But critics denounced it as a reckless extension of authority
across national boundaries that could empower rogue prosecutors to
try to extradite people like Queen Elizabeth and President Clinton
on their travels abroad.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the general was arrested in London on Oct. 16,
Blair's government has tried to keep itself publicly detached,
saying the matter was one between magistrates in Spain and England.
The original warrant came from Baltasar Garzon, a high-profile
Spanish magistrate who has been investigating atrocities committed
during the ``dirty wars'' in the 1970s and 1980s in Latin America.
Accusing the general of genocide, it tied him to the deaths and
``disappearances'' of 3,178 people. The Spanish government has
given Garzon only belated and begrudging endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The bold move caught the British by surprise and placed them in
an awkward diplomatic position because Chile is a longtime friend
and an active trade partner as well as having been a valued backer
of Britain during the 1982 Falkland Islands war. British
businessmen have been active in Chile, particularly in the mining
sector, and Chileans have purchased arms, frigates and warplanes
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military bonds are strong, and it would be a mistake to
underestimate the importance today of the ties from the Falklands
war,'' said Christopher D. Scott, an expert on the Chilean economy
from the London School of Economics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The government never expected the court to give the impetus it
did to the extradition effort on Wednesday, and was unprepared for
the quandary it finds itself in. Hence, Straw's plea Thursday to
the Bow Street Magistrate's court to put off by a week its
scheduled Dec. 2 hearing in the Pinochet case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Blair's trade and industry minister, Peter Mandelson,
told an interviewer last month that he would find it
``gut-wrenching'' to see Pinochet get away, the comment was viewed
more as an expression of the visceral feelings of Blair's team than
any statement of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has argued that Britain and Spain are interfering in
Chilean democratic development and disrupting Chile's national
resolve to put its convulsive past to rest in its own manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to protect the dictator of yesterday,'' said
Mario Artaza, Chile's ambassador to Britain. ``We are here to
protect and defend our transition to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument has been picked up here by leaders of the
opposition Conservative Party, who have pointed to the return of
divisions and unrest in Chile and fault the Blair government's
indecisiveness for provoking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this has gone on for too long; we think he should be
sent back to Chile,'' said Michael Howard, Straw's Conservative
predecessor in the home secretary's job. ``They have reached a
settlement in Chile after a very, very painful period. Those old
wounds have been opened, and that can't be in anyone's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The extradition process in Britain was once considered one of
the most arduous and time-consuming in the world, and today, even
with reforms enacted in 1989, there are so many opportunities for
judicial review that cases can drag on for years. If the Pinochet
case proceeds at the normal rate, the general would be unable to
leave England for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Straw's first obligation is to declare whether the Spanish case
for extradition meets the principal criteria of the 1989
Extradition Act: whether it would be ``unjust or oppressive'' to
order Pinochet's extradition; whether he is wanted for serious
crimes, ones described as punishable by at least 12 months'
imprisonment; whether the offenses are of a ``political'' nature,
and whether the documentation accompanying the request is thorough
and authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Even before any hearing, the general lawyers can challenge
Straw's decision, starting an appeal process that could take the
matter back up the judicial ladder to the Law Lords.
</P>
<P>
   If Straw gives the initial go-ahead in the Pinochet case and it
survives any judicial scrutiny, the matter will go to the Bow
Street court for a preliminary hearing before the chief
metropolitan magistrate. Pinochet, who has not been seen in public
since his arrest in London, would be required to attend.
</P>
<P>
   A magistrate's decision to endorse the extradition request could
set off another series of appeals. If those hurdles are all
cleared, the case returns to Straw for a ``final surrender''
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Straw would then still have the power to overrule an
extradition, if he cites ``oppressive'' considerations like the age
or health of Pinochet. And if Straw authorized extradition, the
general could then appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office has stressed that this constantly available
step-by-step court overview process means that the Pinochet matter
should continue to be thought of as one in the hands of the
judiciary, not the government.
</P>
<P>
   All those steps are in conformity with the European Convention
of Extradition, under which the Spanish request for the general's
arrest was lodged.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet remained in seclusion on Thursday at the Grovelands
Priory Hospital in North London, where he has been recuperating
since back surgery last month. Doctors last week pronounced him
medically fit, and he is expected to move into a rented house
shortly.

<P>
   In the last year, exposure to Asia has generally meant risking a
bad case of the flu. The region's economic turmoil has weakened
demand, and the health of many companies _ and their stocks _ has
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts see signs of a possible Asian recovery.
Economists at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, for example, forecast
growth in gross domestic product for the region, excluding Japan,
of 3.3 percent for 1999. Falling interest rates, looser monetary
policies, rebounding currencies and greater direct foreign
investment are also positive signs.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report, the Morgan Stanley analysts Markus Rosgen in
Hong Kong and Deborah Weinswig in New York said that it was too
soon to declare the Asian crisis over, but that there were
``glimmers of hope'' in the region.
 &UR;  &LR; They recommended that investors consider multinational
corporations they might have avoided previously because of Asian
exposure. Working with their colleagues, the analysts compiled a
list of North American companies that derive at least a fourth of
their revenues from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   While investors who remain skeptical can still avoid these
companies, buying stocks of multinationals helps reduce the risk of
betting on the Asian turnaround. ``These are globally diversified
companies,'' Ms. Weinswig said, and that diversification should
help protect them even if the Asian economy fails to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies, especially semiconductor-related companies
like Kulicke &AMP; Soffa Industries, Applied Materials and Intel, are
among the biggest sellers to Asia, according to the analysts, but
demand for their goods is not driven solely by Asian companies or
consumers.
 &UR;  &LR;  While these companies initially ship many of their goods to the
region, they are then assembled into electronic products that are
exported to other areas. Energy companies like Unocal, Texaco,
Chevron and Mobil also do a lot of business in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley has also uncovered some companies whose exposure
to Asia may be less obvious: Aflac, an insurer, which gets the bulk
of its sales from Japan, and AMF Bowling, which runs bowling
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may also want to consider overseas companies that
aren't based in Asia but that derive a sizable share of their
revenue there. These include Cable and Wireless Communications of
Britain, the telecommunications company; Gucci Group of the
Netherlands, a luxury goods maker; Bulgari of Italy, a jeweler, and
Sappi of South Africa, a paper maker.

MARKET PLACE: BIG BITES LEAD TO INDIGESTION FOR BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street banks earn big profits greasing the wheels for
companies to buy one another. But when banks merge, sparks often
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Banks rarely blend well. The best investment banks have such
strong cultures they are sometimes compared to cults. Their most
important assets are not loans and custody accounts but traders and
deal-makers _ assets that, as the industry saying goes, walk out
the front door every night.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers Trust complete
what could become the largest international bank merger in history
early next week, then they can ponder all those challenges and one
more: Bankers Trust itself has been a ravenous acquirer of late,
and its most aggressive purchase, $2.8 billion for the boutique
investment bank Alex. Brown &AMP; Co. of Baltimore, has caused some
indigestion. Analysts said the difficulties in merging those two
banks should raise a warning flag for Deutsche Bank, which will try
to bridge a much wider gulf between two companies on two
continents.
</P>
<P>
   Like the German and American banks, Bankers Trust and Alex.
Brown had different cultures, about as different as two East Coast
houses of finance can be. Alex. Brown, the oldest independent
investment bank in the United States before the merger, is a
button-down provincial firm that specializes in financing new
companies _ it underwrote initial offerings of stock in Microsoft
and Starbucks, for example _ as well as managing money for wealthy
clients. Bankers Trust is a swank New York firm best known for
designer derivatives, an impressive client list and risky bets in
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, that made the two seem more complementary than
redundant, and merger-related layoffs were insignificant when the
two were joined more than a year ago. But the process of
integrating them proved trickier than expected, current and former
BT Alex. Brown employees and outside analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex. Brown has tussled with its New York parent for months.
Some issues are minor, like whether Bankers Trust should appear on
Alex. Brown business cards. Others are more weighty, like
determining how bankers should be paid. Alex. Brown managers have
complained about what they see as extravagant perks afforded to
their Bankers Trust colleagues, especially the president, Frank
Newman.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements have taken a toll. Of a dozen top Alex. Brown
executives at the time of the merger, six are gone. A.B. Krongard,
the chief executive and the man who made the firm a top contender
in stock underwriting nationwide, left to take a senior post at the
CIA. The co-head of investment banking resigned. Two other senior
executives defected to Legg Mason, a crosstown rival.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, top Bankers Trust executives have rushed to
Baltimore to soothe flared tempers, especially after the parent
company reported big losses in its international trading operation
and saw its share price plummet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies are entirely different and don't mesh
culturally,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a senior vice president and
equity analyst at Tucker Anthony. ``It's always hard to integrate
firms, especially when a New York bank clashes with a smaller,
non-New York organization used to being on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust officials argue that the merger has worked out
well. Some departures from senior ranks were expected, they said.
And they point out that the new BT Alex. Brown has not had more
troubles than the newly formed Citigroup or the merged BankAmerica,
both of which have sought to meld securities companies with
traditional banking operations and have seen wrenching turnover in
senior staff.
</P>
<P>
   BT Alex. Brown also says it has realized some sought-after
synergies. Bankers Trust's traditional focus on bond markets,
especially junk bonds, has complemented Alex. Brown's stock market
expertise. ``We both had what the other needed,'' said Alexander
Mason, a Bankers Trust managing director and co-head of corporate
finance for BT Alex. Brown. For example, he said, Bankers Trust and
Alex. Brown teamed up to underwrite a complex $1 billion stock
offering for Chancellor Media, the owner of radio stations, earlier
this year _ work that might have been assigned to another
investment bank if the two banks could not offer combined services.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts agree. Brad Ball, a bank industry specialist for
Credit Suisse First Boston, said that at least before turmoil in
world markets pummeled the financial markets serving start-up and
highly leveraged companies, the stomping grounds of Alex. Brown and
Bankers Trust, synergies were evident. He estimates that matching
Bankers Trust's client list with Alex. Brown services, and vice
versa, led to a one-third increase in business for the combined
entity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few deny the merger has been rocky at times. And several
Alex. Brown bankers said they were wary of taking on another merger
partner before resolving issues from the first marriage. ``People
are willing to give it a chance, but I would not say they're
optimistic,'' one current employee said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The frustrations all seem to involve cultural issues. Examples
abound. Even the most senior Alex. Brown executives were accustomed
to flying economy class cross-country with few exceptions. Their
colleagues at Bankers Trust fly first class. Alex. Brown, a pillar
of the Baltimore business community, took special pride in its
annual effort to recruit new bankers, a function now largely
controlled by Bankers Trust in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several current and recently departed Alex. Brown executives
said they took umbrage when Newman, who had a senior position in
the Treasury Department before becoming the president of Bankers
Trust, came for meetings at Alex. Brown offices in a style they
described as imperial. He flew in a rented corporate jet with a
retinue of bodyguards, equipped with microphones on their suit
lapels. One executive said a bodyguard barred others from using the
men's room when Newman was inside.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust staff parties, including one annual meeting at the
New York Public Library where the cast of the Broadway musical
``High Society'' provided the entertainment, were described as
lavish. ``We would rather have had chicken and rice and a short pep
talk and kept the rest as a bonus,'' one Alex. Brown executive
joked.
</P>
<P>
   A Bankers Trust official said some at Alex. Brown had complained
about entertainment and Newman's personal perks. But the official
said that the issue had been exaggerated and that Bankers Trust
spending was neither extravagant nor unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Some at Alex. Brown have clung to traditional ways of doing
things, even when they run up against what has often become
standard Wall Street practice. For example, Alex. Brown has fought
to retain a commission-oriented pay system for some traders and
brokers while Bankers Trust has pushed a now industry-standard
annual bonus plan, people involved with the debate said.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks also butted heads over differing perceptions of
how to treat clients. Because Bankers Trust is a big supplier of
derivatives, which are financial instruments tied to an underlying
security, it frequently enters into contracts in which it takes the
opposite side of a bet from a client, becoming what bankers call a
counterparty. That is a normal service many big banks provide. But
the old Alex. Brown did not deal much in derivatives. Some at the
Baltimore bank found the idea of trading against a client inimical.
``We never put ourselves in a position that we would root for a
client's transaction to be a bad one,'' one former Alex. Brown
banker said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those issues seem likely to be resolved in coming
months. ``I think you need two years to make a merger like that
work, when people stop thinking about it as us and them,'' a
Bankers Trust official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the unrest at Alex. Brown cannot be a good omen for Deutsche
Bank, which has a record of buying securities companies that
perform less well than hoped under its tutelage. The new
German-American bank will have to combine far-flung securities
operations into a single efficient one. That probably means
centralizing investment banking and asset management in New York
and London, not Baltimore. Some layoffs seem inevitable, as does a
further loss of autonomy for the managers at Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   For the Deutsche Bank-Bankers Trust merger to make sense for the
German bank, expenses, mainly people, will have to be cut by $1.5
billion a year, Ball said. That figure is higher than what Deutsche
Bank officials have hinted at so far. Ball said he thought most of
the savings would come from streamlining United States operations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Flanagan of Financial Service Analytics in Philadelphia
sees trouble ahead. ``I don't think Deutsche Bank will be satisfied
with what they have now in BT Alex. Brown,'' he said. ``It doesn't
level the playing field for them against Merrill Lynch or Goldman,
Sachs. You will probably see further consolidation and
reorganization, which will really add to the already tense
situation there.''

IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS, LATIN ENJOYS A RENAISSANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J., Tenn., Pa., Calif., Ga.)  (bl) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Penny Cipolone's eighth-grade Latin students recently turned
their classroom in Woodbury Heights, N.J., into a living hell. They
covered the windows with black curtains, piped in dry-ice smoke and
flashed red lights in their interpretation of Virgil's Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   That is about as close to dead as Latin gets these days.
</P>
<P>
   Once a tedious prep-school requirement endured with yawns, Latin
was deemed by the curriculum reformers the subject least likely to
survive the 1960s. Not only did it survive, it now continues to
grow in high school enrollments, up more than 15 percent from 1990
to 1994, to a national total of 189,000, according to the American
Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.
</P>
<P>
   In middle schools, meanwhile, the number of Latin students has
tripled since the early 1980's. And some enterprising elementary
schools were offering Latin to some 4,300 children as of 1994, up
from 2,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the National Junior Classical League, a
confederation of Latin clubs, has more than doubled since 1977, to
more than 55,000. Students at state and national conventions don
bedsheet togas, compete in ``Jeopardy''-style classics quizzes and
eat grapes at Roman-style banquets.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what has attracted enrollments is a wholesale revamping
of the way Latin courses are taught: students these days are as
likely to learn about the lives of Pompeian teen-agers as to
memorize the ablative case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just, `Can you parse this sentence in the
subjunctive?' '' said Mrs. Cipolone, who had 36 Latin students when
she began teaching 28 years ago and now has 140.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this renaissance _ after a period, beginning 35
years ago, when Latin enrollment plunged _ is an enthusiastic
community of scholars and devoted teachers like Mrs. Cipolone. They
hold classics conventions, hand out pro-Latin fliers, put up
billboards and generally do public relations for Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kitchell, a professor at the University of Massachusetts
who has studied classics for 22 years, calls all this the Great
Counteroffensive by Latin scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are in the same ship, and about 20 years ago we
realized the ship was the Titanic,'' Kitchell said. High school
enrollments had dropped to 150,000 in the mid-1970s from more than
700,000 in the early 1960s. ``People just really woke up,'' the
professor recalled, ``and said it cannot continue to be the way it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The big task was to make classics palatable to teen-agers. A
crucial change was in textbooks. Where once a classical history
text dealt with wars and conquerors, students now are more likely
to use texts that discuss Roman family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to like stories about daily life and what it was
like to be a teen-ager, instead of reading about Julius Caesar
invading a country and slaughtering millions of people,'' said Ed
Long, a high-school Latin teacher in Clarksville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers also began pointing to the ancient world as a paradigm
of diversity. ``Greco-Roman civilization is the archetypal
multiculture,'' said Richard LaFleur, who heads the classics
department at the University of Georgia. ``The Roman Empire
included three continents. And the Romans, by and large, unlike
Americans, were basically color-blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by studies of successful Latin programs in inner
cities like those of Philadelphia and Los Angeles, educators began
to write for the minority students who fill an increasing part of
Latin classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women and girls, Romans from the Near East and from Asia,
black citizens of the Greco-Roman world, they all figure in these
new text materials,'' said LaFleur, whose book ``Latin for the 21st
Century'' (Scott Foresman Addison Wesley, 1998) describes trends in
Latin education.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, new textbooks highlight Spain's role in the Roman
Empire, an appeal to Hispanic students, whose numbers in Latin
classes are growing. ``They are the ones who have the edge,''
LaFleur said. ``They look at Latin and think that they're looking
at their own language.''
</P>
<P>
   American resistance to Latin is nothing new. As early as 1711, a
group of Puritan parents protested its teaching at the Boston Latin
School, calling it impractical. And the Revolutionary patriot
Benjamin Rush maintained that the drudgery of the classics led to
juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   But its defenders have been just as fierce in their loyalty.
``No one ever asks a mother why she ran back into a burning house
to save her child,'' Kitchell said. ``For those of us who are
really involved in promoting in a very aggressive way, it's just
something you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Howard, who runs a teacher placement service for the
American Classical League, a professional association, said the
biggest challenge now was to keep enough Latin teachers to meet the
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea that this is some sort of a Brahmin caste
studying Latin, I think we've blown that out the window,'' Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindi Goodman, who is the only language teacher at Day Middle
School in Newton, Mass., recruits students by visiting sixth-grade
classes with her ``Latin show,'' pitching the benefits of Latin.
When she began teaching in 1971, Ms. Goodman had 30 Latin students;
now she has 160, more than a third of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   She promises her recruits better standardized-test grades and a
leg up on English vocabulary. ``She came in and sold it to us,''
said Elana Rome, now an eighth grader. ``It just seemed like so
much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And, it turns out, it is. Students like Stephanie Carrera, also
an eighth grader, are particularly taken with all the new insults
they have learned using Latin roots. If they want to chide someone
for childish, dull stupidity, they need only say, ``You are a prime
example of puerile hebetudinous desipience.''

TOLEDO'S WORK JUST BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Coaches begin the home-visit portion of the recruiting season
Dec. 1, but Bob Toledo will be five days behind and thousands of
miles away when he enters his first home.
</P>
<P>
   While seven UCLA assistants make post-practice visits throughout
Southern California from Dec. 1-3, Toledo and his coordinators (Al
Borges and Nick Aliotti) will work as usual to prepare the Bruins
for their Dec. 5 showdown at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Toledo will remain behind to visit recruits in
Florida, the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. He'll return for UCLA's
postseason banquet Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami game figures to offset Toledo's delayed start. It'll
be televised nationally on ESPN, with a prime kickoff time (2 p.m.
eastern) and the enormous potential viewership generated by
interest in Championship Saturday. The Big 12 and Southeastern
Conference title games are that day, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have received three oral commitments _ Venice
quarterback J.P. Losman, Anaheim linebacker Asi Faoa and Temecula
safety Ryan Wikert _ and have about 15 slots remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Signing day is Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   __ Close call? All-Pac-10 ballots were due Tuesday, with an
announcement from the league office expected early next week.
Although Cade McNown is a Heisman Trophy finalist and the
undisputed leader of an undefeated team, he might not be the
first-team all-conference quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's Akili Smith has the support of several coaches, based
on their comments during bi-weekly conference calls. His passing
efficiency rating (170) is on pace to break McNown's Pac-10 record
(168) set last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a crying shame,'' Toledo said of McNown not
making the first team. ``How can you not vote for a guy who won all
his games his senior year, won the Pac-10 and made the big plays?
That would be a huge mistake, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Coming on strong: After a slow start, ex-UCLA tailback Skip
Hicks has emerged as one of the few bright spots for the lowly
Washington Redskins, who plucked him from the third round of the
1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks didn't play until the seventh game, when starting tailback
Terry Allen sprained his ankle, but his impact was immediate. He
has scored six touchdowns, including three in a 28-3 victory over
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys' careers get messed up when they get brought in
and thrown to the wolves without really learning too much,'' Hicks
told the Washington Post. ``The situation I came into was great,
because of the fact they brought me in basically for the future.
Being behind Terry, I've learned a lot from him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Take it easy: After an undefeated but exhausting charge
through the Pac-10, the weary Bruins are thankful for a bye this
weekend. While they relax with friends and family, Miami plays at
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, hard run, with lots of pressure on the
players and staff,'' Toledo said. ``It's nice to step back after a
big game (USC) and say, `Let's enjoy what happened. Let's
celebrate. Then let's get back to work and make a run at it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Short stuff: McNown won the Johnny Unitas Award as the
nation's best senior quarterback. . . . Offensive tackle Kris
Farris is one of three finalists for the Outland Trophy, given to
the best interior lineman. . . . Toledo is one of six finalists for
the Bear Bryant Award. . . . UCLA ranks first in the Pac-10 in
third-down conversion (43.3 percent), first in turnover margin
(plus-1.8) and first in fewest sacks allowed (10). . . . Under
Toledo, the Bruins are 13-0 when they score at least 40 points, and
21-2 when they score at least 30.

IN ASSISI, SURVIVOR RECALLS RESCUE FROM HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ Graziella Viterbi is preparing to leave this
city, which was devastated by earthquakes last year, and with her
will go a piece of history that has produced some unexpected
earthquake relief.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Viterbi was among some 200 Jews who fled here during World
War II and were saved because local Catholic Church leaders set up
a secret organization that sheltered refugees in monasteries and
convents or created fake identities for them.
</P>
<P>
   She has told the story of her days in hiding to visiting
Americans attending educational programs here for older tourists.
After the earthquakes last year, one student, Paul Levine, a
retired businessman who lives near San Francisco, started a
fund-raising drive among that city's Jews as a way of repaying what
he saw as a debt to Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed appropriate that Jews remember when people help
them,'' said Levine.
</P>
<P>
   That need for help began in 1943 when German troops invaded
Italy. Ms. Viterbi said her father did not know where to turn, but
one evening he overheard that Assisi might provide a haven because
the Germans had declared the city a hospital town and that other
displaced Italians were going there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father believed in destiny and the signs of destiny and so
we left,'' said Ms. Viterbi, an energetic woman with a face framed
by gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Assisi is struggling to recover from earthquakes that
rocked this region. But when Ms. Viterbi arrived here in the fall
of 1943 _ after a harrowing journey during which she fooled a
German officer into giving her family a car _ it was filled with
wounded German troops.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of a local priest, the Rev. Aldo Brunacci, Ms.
Viterbi's family moved into an apartment. Posing as displaced
Catholics from southern Italy, they were given phony identification
papers and new names.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Viterbi and her sister, Miriam, who was 10, it was a
life of strained normalcy. They studied the geography of the
village from which they had supposedly come and on some Sundays
went to church, though at first they had no idea what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have people teach us how to make the sign of the
cross,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such precautions were necessary because those caught hiding Jews
could be shot. One day local Fascists, who suspected church leaders
of harboring Jews, stormed into Brunacci's home to arrest him. Ms.
Viterbi's father and mother were visiting at the time, but the
priest acted quickly, pushing them behind an open door, where they
were shielded while he was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Brunacci was imprisoned for a time, then released to the custody
of the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Several Catholic leaders involved in the Assisi underground
including Bishop Nicolini, who has died, have been honored by Yad
Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Israel. And this spring Levine,
the retired businessman from California, came here to present the
current bishop of Assisi with $40,000 he had helped raise. It will
be used to rebuild a school for handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the Jews who had hidden here dispersed. But after
her husband's death, Ms. Viterbi returned to Assisi six years ago,
moving back into the same apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Once again her future, like her past, is being shaped by events
affecting this city. Recently, her landlord told her that she would
have to move because the apartment had to be made earthquake-proof.
</P>
<P>
   While she still holds a faint hope that she will find a place to
live here, she is also saying her good-byes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends say that when you leave, all of this will leave
with you,'' she said.

TREASURE HUNTER ADMITS SALE OF FAKE GOLD COINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JIM CARRIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ Treasure hunter Mel Fisher has admitted selling
several counterfeit gold coins at his gift shop here and has agreed
to repay customers their purchase prices of $2,500 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a negotiated plea, Fisher's company also agreed that in the
future it would sell only coins recovered from shipwrecks for which
it has federal salvage rights. The coins in question were said to
have been purchased from a longtime colleague who had contended
that they were genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed Nov. 18, tarnished a career in which
Fisher found hundreds of thousands of gold and silver coins, bars
and jewelry from Spanish shipwrecks off Florida. He and several
investors became millionaires from a haul valued at more than $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, whose office was raided by police in April, is near
death from cancer, said a lawyer, Michael Halpern, who negotiated
the plea for Crystals of Delaware, Fisher's retail sales
subsidiary. Halpern said he believed Fisher's illness contributed
to the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taking immense amounts of medicine,'' Halpern said.
``He is very, very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's son, Kim, who is running the company, signed the plea
bargain for his father.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Crystals pleaded no contest but
acknowledged that the coins were not from a 1733 Spanish fleet that
went aground near the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the more than $67,000 to be paid to identified
claimants, the company agreed to maintain a $50,000 restitution
fund for any additional customers who demand refunds during the
three-year probation period.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Myers, an investigator for the Monroe County state's
attorney's office, said he found indications that as many as 1,000
counterfeit counts bearing a 1733 fleet insignia were forged over
the last 25 years and may have been sold by other dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher bought the coins from Walter Kruse, a longtime
treasure-hunting associate with a criminal record of selling fake
coins, according to Myers. Fisher sold the coins with a signed
certificate stating that he had found them.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern said the agreement to sell only coins from Fisher's six
Florida shipwreck sites protects both customers and Fisher's
reputation. Under federal salvage law, found treasure is presented
to a federal judge who certifies authenticity and title and insures
that archaeological rules were followed.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher spent 18 years looking for the Atocha, which he found in
1985 in the ocean off Key West. His success at finding treasure and
at winning title under traditional admiralty law galvanized
archaeologists, historians and environmentalists, who persuaded
states and Congress to control salvage, beginning in 1987.

RUSSIA RAISES SPECTER OF A LOAN DEFAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Russia has told Western bankers that it will renege on
the terms of repaying $28 billion in Soviet-era debt to creditors,
effectively paving the way for a default on interest payments next
month, bankers said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian position emerged from three days of negotiations
this week between Russian officials and the so-called London Club,
a loose assembly of more than 600 Western creditors. It is the
latest setback for Russia, which has already announced its
intention to renegotiate foreign loans. The country is facing a
collapsing currency, a yawning budget deficit and a deteriorating
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the discussions, according to Russian officials
and Western bankers, was that Russia would not meet previously
agreed terms to pay half of a $724 million interest payment, due
this coming Wednesday, in cash and has offered instead to pay in
bonds worth only about 13 percent of their face value.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of trouble, bankers, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said separate negotiations on $10 billion
in ruble-denominated domestic debt owed to foreigners had divided
Western creditors over whether to accept new Russian terms or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is whether they should give any form of
acknowledgment or not'' when a committee of 18 banks meets here
Friday to discuss the Russian offer, a banker said. ``No one feels
there's been much achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia announced a moratorium on debt Aug. 17 and devalued the
ruble by 34 percent. Since then, it has failed to reach agreement
with the International Monetary Fund on what economic policies it
will undertake in exchange for the IMF's freeing $4.3 billion of a
$22.6 billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   And Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov has signaled
deepening troubles by saying Russia will be able to pay back less
than $10 billion of the $17 billion in foreign debt that falls due
in 1999. Michel Camdessus, the head of the IMF, has agreed to visit
Moscow next week to discuss Russia's economic crisis, Russian
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The negotiations with the London Club had centered on terms
agreed to in 1997 that set out a schedule of repayments of debts
from the former Soviet Union that have principal denominated in
principal bonds _ known as PRINs. Under the 1997 agreement, half of
the interest due Wednesday was to be paid in cash and half in bonds
called interest arrears notes, or IANs. Instead, Russia wants to
pay the whole $724 million by issuing new IANs. Under the terms of
the 1997 deal, Russia has a 15 business-day grace period to meet
its obligations, but bankers remained skeptical that creditors and
investors holding IANs could be reached for their approval of
Moscow's interest repayment proposals.
</P>
<P>
   To fulfill earlier agreements, 75 percent to 95 percent of
creditors must agree to accept payment in new paper, but most of
the holders of IANs are thought to be dispersed. Russian officials
maintain that a separate interest payment of $216 million will be
repaid in cash, but a London Club statement did not confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   And while Kasyanov said Thursday that London Club negotiations
had agreed in principle to accept the whole Dec. 2 interest payment
in IANs, bankers said creditors had not agreed. ``To most lay
people, it's definitely a default,'' said a banker who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``They are not going to pay. We are not
even at the due date, and they have already announced that they are
not going to pay, and they are trying to get the creditors to
accept that.'' However, he said, `'it won't be considered a default
until late December because of the 15-day grace period.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate discussions, Russian officials have offered a
complicated mix of repayments of $10 billion in domestic ruble debt
that was part of the $40 billion Treasury debt frozen last August.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, though, the Russian offer would permit foreign
creditors to repatriate only $550 million, staggered over a year of
monthly central bank auctions. The rest would be swapped for a
variety of ruble securities useful only for transactions inside
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A negotiating committee led by Deutsche Bank AG and Credit
Suisse First Boston is to present the Russian proposal to a larger
banking group Friday, but some of those close to the discussions
said there was little unanimity among the creditors about the value
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that anybody thinks that the Russians could have been
moved more'' in the negotiations, said one banker close to the
discussions. ``It's a question of whether it's worth reacting to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Korishchenko, a senior Russian Central Bank official,
said Thursday that the offer was the best available. ``Investors
could not ask for more than we offered because there was no way we
could improve conditions of the swap,'' he told Bridge News.

NEW RULES ALTER PLANS FOR DIESEL ENGINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif . )  (rl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The walls and roof are almost finished on a huge new
General Motors diesel engine factory in southwestern Ohio. Several
thousand engineers in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois are still
developing new diesel engines for future cars, sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry's broad plans to put diesels into millions of
vehicles early in the next century have suddenly been thrown into
confusion. California environmental regulators voted this month to
eliminate the more lenient pollution standards that have long
prevailed for diesel-powered vehicles. Instead, diesel engines will
have to meet the same pollution standards as gasoline-powered
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline engine standards are being tightened, so regulators say
it will be almost impossible to design diesel engines to meet the
new rules, despite considerable progress in the design of cleaner
diesels. The result is a virtual ban on diesel engines in
California, which accounts for a tenth of the nation's auto sales,
once the new rules are phased in between 2004 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry executives are furious. They had been counting on
diesel engines as part of the answer to environmentalists' concerns
about global warming and poor fuel economy, particularly the low
gas mileage of full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest diesel engines use as much as 33 percent less fuel
per mile as their gasoline counterparts, according to auto industry
engineers. And while even the cleanest diesels still produce
slightly more soot and smog-causing gases than gasoline engines,
diesels emit up to 20 percent less carbon dioxide, a gas linked to
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   GM in particular had been counting on diesels to improve fuel
efficiency and reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases.
``It's a major concern coming out of the California regulations,''
said John Smith, GM chairman and chief executive. ``It goes to the
fundamentals of what is our long-term strategy for dealing with
emissions and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Engine manufacturers are even angrier. ``Which environmentalist
group is going to be in power tomorrow, so I know whether diesels
are going to be the greatest thing or the worst thing?'' asked
Timothy D. Leuliette, vice chairman of Detroit Diesel, a unit of
the Penske Corp.
</P>
<P>
   California regulators say that reducing emissions of greenhouse
gases is not their problem, and should be handled by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency. ``Our clear, unmistakable
authority to enact regulations is to reduce urban smog,'' said
Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board.
``Global warming is an international issue and the U.S. EPA ought
to be the agency taking the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is drafting new pollution standards for vehicles, to be
released early next year, and declined to discuss what they would
include. The agency has a tradition of adopting regulations
slightly less strict than California's. The California Air
Resources Board's own technical staff recommended a more lenient
standard covering diesels, but the board rejected this idea after
hearing strong pleas from environmentalists in the hours before the
board's final vote on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. environmentalists are dubious about diesels. They
point to research indicating that tiny soot particles can cause
cancer, and warn that diesels will always create more soot than
gasoline engines.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also warn that converting to diesels will
limit opportunities to tighten pollution rules even further
someday. And they contend that diesel engines are not the only way
to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases
_ alternatives include building smaller vehicles, developing
advanced technologies like fuel cells or even taking such simple
steps as installing multivalve gasoline engines, said Daniel
Becker, an energy efficiency expert at the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said that in installing diesel engines, automakers were
not really interested in addressing global warming. Instead, he
said, they want to keep building ever-bigger sport utility
vehicles, which earn the highest profit margins, and must install
diesels to continue meeting federal fuel-economy rules. The
light-truck operations of GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG
are all struggling to comply with these rules.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are beginning to install multivalve engines in some
large sport utility vehicles, but are reluctant to do so on a wide
scale because it hurts the vehicles' towing capacity. And the
American public shows little interest in buying small
fuel-efficient cars, said Robert J. Eaton, a co-chairman of
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers, particularly GM, last tried to push diesel engines
during the oil crisis of the early 1980s. But the diesel engines
marketed then were comparatively smoky, noisy and smelly. They have
virtually disappeared from the U.S. light-vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since the early 1980s, enormous progress has been made in
building better diesels. The latest diesels coming out of the
laboratories emit no visible smoke, produce up to 90 percent less
soot and generate up to 75 percent less noise than the vehicles of
the early 1980s, industry engineers say. Even the smell has faded.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have spent heavily on diesel development mainly
because of these engines' popularity in Europe. Fuel prices in
Europe are four times higher than those in the United States, and
Europeans have taken a great interest in global warming. Diesels
are now installed in 22 percent of new family vehicles in Europe,
compared with less than 2 percent here. Engine factories have been
unable to keep up with demand in Europe, and diesels are expected
to reach 30 percent of the European market, once the factories
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry has a history of saying that further pollution
reductions are impossible, only to find ways to comply with new
regulations. Patrick Charbonneau, vice president for engine
engineering at Navistar International Corp., which is designing
diesel prototypes for the next generation of Ford Expedition and
Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicles, said that research on
diesel emissions was not as advanced as research on gasoline engine
emissions. Further spending might lead to breakthroughs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But making diesel engines as clean as gasoline engines is
particularly difficult because current regulations, particularly in
California, allow diesel fuel to be much dirtier than gasoline.
California regulations require oil companies to remove almost all
of the sulfur from gasoline, for example, because sulfur clogs
catalytic converters and allows a vehicle's emissions to soar. But
California's rules allow diesel fuel to have nearly 17 times the
sulfur of gasoline.

ALL TO DRINK FROM SEAVER CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Add another matchup to the North-South rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the efforts of the Northern and Southern California
Golf Associations, amateur golfers from both areas will play in the
inaugural Seaver Cup on Dec. 1 at the Ojai Valley Inn &AMP; Spa.
</P>
<P>
   The matches are named for Charles Seaver, who has gained legend
status among the ranks of California's amateur golfers, and are
sponsored by the California Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very proud and honored to have this recognition. It
wasn't expected, but I'm most certainly going to enjoy it to the
fullest,'' said Seaver, 87, during a telephone interview from his
home in Pebble Beach. ``It's the culmination of things that have
been going on since I was 9 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the age at which he entered his first tournament with a
30 handicap. Six years later he won the Los Angeles Country Club
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, while a student at Stanford and a member of the Los
Angeles club, Seaver won the state amateur title and the NCGA
amateur title. A year later he won the SCGA title. He also came
within a whisker of a club-to-club confrontation with Bobby Jones,
considered to be the greatest amateur golfer ever and the only
player ever to win four major titles in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930 U.S. Amateur, Seaver, whose son Tom is in the
baseball Hall of Fame, lost a semifinal match to Gene Homans. The
next day Jones dusted Homans 8 and 7 to complete his grand slam.
That effort made Seaver, who played in five events with Jones, the
nation's third-ranked amateur player that year.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver also played on the 1932 Walker Cup team at The Country
Club in Brookline, Mass., when the U.S. crushed Great Britain and
Ireland 8 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   He's been active in the Northern California section for years
and helped that group put together the deal to buy the land for the
NCGA members' course at Poppy Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Thomas, editor and publisher of Fore, the SCGA's
magazine, said that naming the new competition after Seaver is a
good way to honor his long service to the game. And he has ties to
both the sections of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all he's just a wonderful person. He embodies
everything that is great about amateur golf and he just gave so
much of his life to this game,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the biennial intrastate matches will be held in
even-numbered years and complement the United States Golf
Association's national team championships that will be held in
odd-numbered years.
</P>
<P>
   Each side will field eight-man teams. The event will be match
play featuring individuals and two-man teams against each other.
The teams will feature the state's top amateur players and each
will have two seniors. The south team's roster includes all of the
section's major championship winners this year. Local players
include Keith Kinsel, 29, of Glendale, and Craig Steinberg, 41, of
Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsel qualified for the U.S. Open sectional tournament this
year and the U.S. Mid-Amateur. He also tied for fifth in the SCGA
Mid-Amateur and the state amateur championship. Steinberg won the
state amateur four times.
</P>
<P>
   The event is free and open to the public. &QL;

CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER FLIES TO GENERAL'S DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See related PINOCHET, PINOCHET-JUDGE) 
(jw) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ As protests to the continuing detention of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet in London mounted here, the foreign minister
flew to London Thursday in an 11th-hour bid to free the former
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not defending a dictator,'' Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza Salinas told reporters before leaving Chile. ``I am
defending the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Insulza said he planned to meet with British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook on Friday morning, adding that he was aiming for
``mutual understanding.'' But he said people ``should not expect
immediate results.''
</P>
<P>
   The official Chilean position, which was stated again in a legal
petition delivered Thursday to British Home Secretary Jack Straw,
is that, as a former head of state, Pinochet is immune to
prosecution and extradition to Spain. On his arrest in London in
October, the note contends, the general was carrying a diplomatic
passport that grants him immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials privately say that Insulza, a Socialist
party leader, will appeal to Labor and Socialist leaders in London
and Madrid, arguing that a prolonged detention of the former
dictator will jeopardize Chile's stability and transition to
democracy. He is also expected to make a personal appeal on behalf
of the general, telling British and Spanish officials that, at age
83, Pinochet is ailing and may not survive a lengthy extradition
and trial.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the country's two conservative parties have called on
President Eduardo Frei to make an all-out diplomatic effort to free
Pinochet by forming a delegation that includes members of the
opposition and jurists with expertise in international law. They
have expressed concerns that the Socialist Party, which governs
with Frei's Christian Democrats, does not really want Pinochet to
return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the military's high command have come out in support
of Frei's initiatives in an apparent effort to cool the passions of
right-wing supporters of Pinochet, who have taken to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A small band of Pinochet supporters Thursday burned a British
flag on a bridge in central Santiago, and there were several
anonymous bomb threats that proved to be hoaxes. The rumblings
followed a night of protests by right-wing and left-wing activists
in Santiago as well as in the provincial city of Concepcion.
</P>
<P>
   Police broke up demonstrations with tear gas and a water cannon,
but not before some Pinochet supporters threw rocks and eggs at the
British and Spanish embassies. Police arrested 120 people, and 10
officers were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the police officers were injured by projectiles thrown at
them by leftist students in front of the University of Concepcion,
a center of revolutionary ferment since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked traffic and reinforced security around the
embassies and ambassadorial residences of Spain and Britain, as
well as those of Sweden, Switzerland and Belgium. Those three
countries joined Spain in petitioning Britain for Pinochet's
extradition on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   The leading presidential candidate in next year's election,
Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist Party, came a step closer to
supporting the government's position favoring Pinochet's return in
an interview published Thursday in Chile from Mexico City.
Previously Lagos had said he would stay out of a judicial matter;
but now he says he favors Pinochet's return so he may be tried in
Chile.

 4 PROFILES OF PEOPLE WITH ROTH IRAs   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon M. Singer is 70 and has no delusions of immortality.
Nonetheless, Singer, a retired businessman who lives in Great Neck,
N.Y., has created a Roth IRA that should be paying out tax-free
income until 2073.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiaries are his granddaughters, Alexis Gertler, who is
6, and her sister Shelley, 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea of the magnitude of the potential benefit of
converting my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA with my grandchildren
as beneficiaries until I attended a seminar at a bookstore,'' said
Singer, a widower.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar was held by Seymour and Jason Goldberg,
father-and-son tax lawyers and accountants in Garden City, N.Y.
``They tuned me on to the differences that started a ball
rolling,'' Singer said, ``and I attempted to educate myself to
learn whatever was required to take advantage of the Roth.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer has put $65,000 into a trust for each girl. Assuming that
he lives another 10 years, and the Roth earns 8 percent annually,
each girl would receive $2,339 in income from her trust the first
year after he dies. And each will collect more than $4.2 million,
tax-free, before their accounts must be emptied under tax rules in
2073. Earning 10 percent, each girl would collect $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying the taxes now is a sacrifice for me, but not a very
great one, because I believe I can do without that money,'' Singer
said. ``The advantages are so enormous that anybody who can do this
and doesn't is making a mistake.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a remark by his father, a retired Chicago police
sergeant, that prompted Leon C. Blair, 23, to put $2,000 into a
Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me he wished he had started saving when he was
young, because he'd be a lot better off now,'' said Blair, who
attends college and works full-time as a human resources consultant
for the Chicago Park District.
</P>
<P>
   His dad's comment prompted Blair to read ``Pay Yourself First,''
a book by Jesse Brown, a member of his church who runs Krystal
Investment Management, a financial advice firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his father, also named Leon, attended a seminar
conducted by Brown, who explained how compound interest, over time,
makes money grow almost magically.
</P>
<P>
   Besides opening a Roth _ investing the money in a mutual fund
recommended by Brown _ Blair began putting $100 a month into a
taxable account in another mutual fund. The saving forced a change
in the young man's life style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to go out and have a good time, but I am in the process
of learning how to manage my money,'' Blair said. ``I am learning
to bite the bullet. I have run up credit card debts in the past.
Now I'm paying off my debt. The money I am investing I would just
blow going to the show or chasing girls _ and I still do, just a
little less now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Blair puts $2,000 into his Roth IRA every year until he is
65, he will have saved $86,000. But if his money earns an 8 percent
average annual return, his account will be worth worth more than
$700,000, all of it tax-free. If he earns 10 percent, he will have
$1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   And if he keeps making $100 monthly investments in his taxable
account, an 8 percent return will give him an additional $259,366,
even after he pays taxes on the capital gains. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Dale E. Schmidt &UR;  &LR; retired six years ago as inventory manager
at a Nebraska factory that makes cough syrup, he rolled his
retirement nest egg into an Individual Retirement Account. Last
February, sold on the benefits of the Roth IRA, he moved a chunk of
his savings into two Roths.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, when the value of the stocks in one of his new
accounts plummeted, Schmidt feared that he had made a terrible
mistake. The conversion of his traditional IRA meant he faced
paying taxes this coming April on money he no longer had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in $89,000 in one Roth, and it dropped to $73,000,''
Schmidt said. ``I thought: `Oh, my goodness, I don't feel very
comfortable. What a disaster.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt turned for help to Bob FitzSimmons, a certified
financial planner in Lincoln, Neb. FitzSimmons had his client undo
the slumping Roth by putting the money back into a traditional IRA
and then rolling it back into another new Roth account.
</P>
<P>
   Under Internal Revenue Service rules, the conversion is valued
for tax purposes at the lower figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That advice saved me taxes on $15,000,'' Schmidt said. ``It's
been a month since I reconverted and, by golly, that Roth's back to
$87,000, so I did well with that.''
</P>
<P>
   People whose Roth accounts have dropped in value can reconvert
once before the end of the year to cut their taxes. And people who
convert to Roths next year will also be allowed one reconversion.
The IRS plans a permanent rule governing reconversions for 2000 and
beyond. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money in Roth IRAs can be withdrawn tax-free after the saver is
59{. That rule can help people who become parents in middle age _
like Kenneth O'Hare and Denise Zaccardi _ save for their children's
college education.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare, 56, will be in his early 60s when Rose Erin, his
11-year-old daughter, starts college. And when their son, Miles, 7,
finishes high school, Ms. Zaccardi, 50, will also be eligible for
tax-free withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about all these new savings vehicles in the 1997 tax
law,'' said O'Hare, chief executive of Millennia Consulting in
Chicago, which evaluates programs for foundations and other
nonprofit organizations. ``I avoided them, because a quick reading
of what was in the newspaper made it all sound pretty complicated.
And who wanted to fool around with the paperwork? Frankly, I was
not impressed with the Roth IRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Hare talked to Ron Freund, his financial adviser at
Social Equity Group in Berkeley, Calif., about ways to finance
college for the children. Freund noted that by using the new
Education IRA, each parent could set aside $500 a child _ a total
of $2,000 annually. But with the Roth IRA, each parent could set
aside $2,000, doubling their tax-advantaged savings.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth has another advantage. College-aid formulas count money
in a student's accounts, including Education IRAs, but not savings
in a parent's Roth IRA, said Cynthia Rife, director of student
awards at Stanford University's financial aid office.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing all the information, the O'Hares each have decided to
establish a Roth account by year-end.

SHOELESS JOE JACKSON'S SUPPORTERS WANT HIM IN HALL OF FAME

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Nearly half a century has passed since
Shoeless Joe Jackson died, yet fans still search out his grave to
leave mementoes _ bats and balls and sometimes even white socks.
They ride by the small brick house that was his in a working-class
neighborhood and visit the ballpark where he first picked up a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, whose .356 lifetime batting average remains the third
highest in major-league history, is not forgotten here, where he
returned after being banished from baseball for his role, along
with seven of his teammates, in throwing the 1919 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Most people here believe Jackson did not go along with his
Chicago White Sox teammates, and they want baseball to right what
they consider an intolerable wrong.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina political leaders, baseball greats, Jackson
family members and others have mounted a campaign to get Jackson
inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. They
have been trying to persuade baseball commissioner Bud Selig to end
Jackson's banishment, thereby making him eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Attending a dinner program here Monday to draw attention to the
effort were South Carolina Gov.-elect Jim Hodges, former Los
Angeles Dodgers coach Tommy Lasorda and former Boston Red Sox star
Ted Williams. In January, Williams filed a 58-page appeal with
Selig, claiming that Jackson's banishment ended when he died in
1951.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sought the support of his dinner companions, and the
lawyer who drafted the appeal, Louis Hegeman of Chicago, said they
could best help by circulating petitions to be sent to Selig and
calling on political leaders for backing in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence proves there could have been too severe a penalty
on somebody never convicted in court,'' said Williams, 80, who now
lives in Hermosa, Fla. He said of Jackson, ``I think he's a pretty
terrific man.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' playing days did not overlap those of Jackson, but
Eddie Collins, the man who signed Williams with the Red Sox, did
play with Jackson. As a young player in 1936, Williams asked about
the legendary and somewhat mysterious Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paused maybe 3-4-5 seconds,'' Williams said, ``looked down,
then looked up at the ceiling and said: `Boy what a player, what a
hitter. The closest hitter I ever saw to Joe Jackson is you.'''
</P>
<P>
   That memory sticks with Williams and pushes him along as he pays
lawyers and makes appearances on behalf of Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Jefferson Wofford Jackson was born in 1888 in Pickens,
S.C. Like many Southern farm families, the Jacksons moved to town
to work in the cotton mills, settling in West Greenville. The
oldest in a family that would eventually include eight children,
Jackson went to work sweeping floors in the Brandon Mill when he
was 7. The family reasoned that the money was more important than
his education.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball became his life at 13 when he stepped onto a dusty
sandlot outside Brandon Mill to join the mill's team.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's slashing swing and sizzling throws soon took him to
Greenville's first minor-league team, the Spinners, where he earned
his nickname. In one game, he played in his socks because new shoes
had caused blisters. A fan of the opposing team shouted, ``You
shoeless sonofagun,'' as Jackson belted a long triple.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, he went to the major leagues, with the Philadelphia
Athletics. He joined the White Sox in 1916. In 13 years as a
major-leaguer, he batted .356, an average surpassed only by Ty Cobb
and Rogers Hornsby. Babe Ruth said he imitated Jackson's swing, and
many, including Cobb, have called him the greatest natural hitter
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In court testimony after the White Sox lost the series to the
Cincinnati Reds in six games, Jackson admitted taking $5,000, but,
he said, he had tried to give the money back. He also went to Sox
owner Charles Comisky to tell him what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jackson's series play was flawless. He led the Sox's
with 12 hits, six runs batted in and the only homer of the series.
He had no errors. He was acquitted but banned from baseball for
life by Commissioner Kennesaw Landis.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson lived for a time in Savannah, Ga., then returned to the
Brandon Mill area to run a liquor store and a pool hall. He never
talked about the series.
</P>
<P>
   His niece, Joy Standridge of Greenville, said the first she and
other family members had ever heard of her uncle's side was just a
few months ago when The State, a newspaper in Columbia, reran an
article first published in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conscience is clear,'' Jackson said in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Greenville County Recreation Commission
spent $250,000 to improve the mill sandlot where Jackson first
played. In July, the city staged a month-long celebration of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   City councils in Chicago and Philadelphia, the South Carolina
General Assembly and sports fans around the nation have tried
before to get Jackson in the Hall of Fame. In 1989, baseball
commissioner Bart Giamatti rejected the effort, saying he did not
``wish to play God with history.''
</P>
<P>
   But people here in this northwestern South Carolina city want
history to note that once there was a ball player who could not
read or write but who nonetheless stands as one of baseball's
greatest.

major-leaguer, he batted .356, an average surpassed only by Ty Cobb
and Rogers Hornsby. Babe Ruth said he imitated Jackson's swing, and
many, including Cobb, have called him the greatest natural hitter
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In court testimony after the White Sox lost the series to the
Cincinnati Reds in six games, Jackson admitted taking $5,000, but,
he said, he had tried to give the money back. He also went to Sox
owner Charles Comisky to tell him what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jackson's series play was flawless. He led the Sox's
with 12 hits, six runs batted in and the only homer of the series.
He had no errors. He was acquitted but banned from baseball for
life by Commissioner Kennesaw Landis.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson lived for a time in Savannah, Ga., then returned to the
Brandon Mill area to run a liquor store and a pool hall. He never
talked about the series.
</P>
<P>
   His niece, Joy Standridge of Greenville, said the first she and
other family members had ever heard of her uncle's side was just a
few months ago when The State, a newspaper in Columbia, reran an
article first published in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conscience is clear,'' Jackson said in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Greenville County Recreation Commission
spent $250,000 to improve the mill sandlot where Jackson first
played. In July, the city staged a month-long celebration of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   City councils in Chicago and Philadelphia, the South Carolina
General Assembly and sports fans around the nation have tried
before to get Jackson in the Hall of Fame. In 1989, baseball
commissioner Bart Giamatti rejected the effort, saying he did not
``wish to play God with history.''
</P>
<P>
   But people here in this northwestern South Carolina city want
history to note that once there was a ball player who could not
read or write but who nonetheless stands as one of baseball's
greatest.

CONGRESSMEN SEEK INQUIRY INTO ABORTION PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Republican members of the House committee that
handles the budget of the District of Columbia have asked a federal
prosecutor to investigate the use of local money to pay for
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress stipulated in 1993 that the district could not use
local money to provide abortions to poor women, but district
officials acknowledge that the practice continued until last month,
when a financial control board official noticed the restriction in
the latest appropriations act.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Wilma Lewis, U.S. attorney for the District of
Columbia, Reps. Todd Tiahrt of Kansas and Robert Aderholt of
Alabama, wrote: ``We are outraged that officials and employees of
the District of Columbia government have feigned ignorance to
justify their blatant violation of federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis would not comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   District officials acknowledge that the abortion ban had been
overlooked, even though it consistently appeared in appropriation
bills and those measures were widely covered in local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All evidence thus far indicates that this was an
administrative snafu, pure and simple,'' said Eleanor Holmes
Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate in the House. ``This
occurred during a time when the district was flat on its back _
it's only now recovering _ from a financial and management
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norton said she was confident that officials in the district
had always meant to scrupulously follow the laws enacted by
Congress, even though some have resented measures that undermined
local policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the district has spent $202,000 to pay
for 756 abortions. Many of the women who had abortions were on
welfare and were advised to apply for money from the Medical
Charities Program, officials said. In 1996, 13,674 abortions were
performed in the District of Columbia, 6,771 of them reported as
being for district residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Charities Program, which does not rely on federal
funds, is financed from property and income taxes. The fund helps
poor residents of Washington pay medical bills if they are not
covered by Medicaid, or if they are ineligible for Medicaid because
they are childless or able-bodied.
</P>
<P>
   Federal policy prohibits Medicaid _ health insurance programs
for the poor and disabled that are financed by federal and state
governments _ from paying for abortions except in cases when the
mother's life is in danger or in cases of incest or rape.
</P>
<P>
   States are free to use local tax money to pay for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Offner, the district commissioner of health care finance,
whose office oversees the Medical Charities Program, complained
that the abortion rule was an example of Congress telling the city
what to do with its own money.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress also barred the use of federal or district
money to pay for needle-exchange programs, which have been active
in the city for several years.

OPEC DELAYS DECISION ON PRODUCTION CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPEC ministers, deeply divided over the best strategy for
propping up sagging crude oil prices, took no action Thursday on
making further production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Rilwanu Lukman, secretary general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was meeting in Vienna, said
the organization already had an agreement in place from June for
restraining production and that any further agreement would be
decided at a meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   Oil markets showed only a modest reaction, since it was widely
expected that OPEC would merely continue with the current
production cuts, which are scheduled to run out in June. In London,
Brent crude oil for January delivery ended the day up 6 cents, at
$10.96 a barrel, after a slight decline earlier. Oil markets in New
York were closed for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was about the minimum that was expected,'' said John
Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation,
a group in New York that does research for the oil industry. ``If
they really stick to their quotas it might at least put a floor on
oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil has fallen by about 40 percent since the
beginning of the year because demand has declined and inventories
have grown as a result of the economic downturn in Asia and the
warm autumn in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, OPEC agreed to cut production by 2.6 million
barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily supply of 74 million
barrels. Leading the cuts were Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, OPEC's
largest producers, and Mexico, which is not an OPEC member but is
also a big oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   There was dissension among the members, with some ministers,
including Youcef Yousfi of Algeria, advocating deeper cuts. ``I
would prefer to have seen further output cuts now,'' Yousfi told
Bloomberg News after the meeting in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh, argued that Saudi
Arabia should make further cuts in its production.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia had replaced most of the oil production lost when
Iraq's exports were cut off after its defeat in the Persian Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudis said OPEC should enforce its existing cutbacks.
This has been a point of contention, because some members have
failed to make all the cuts they pledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they do something in March, prices will stay very low
through 1999,'' Lichtblau said. ``It's good for the consumer. You
will have the lowest gasoline and heating oil prices since 1986.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower prices, however, have hit the oil industry hard, with some
major oil companies making further reductions in already lean work
forces and trimming exploration budgets.

COMMENTARY: SAPS OF NOW AND THEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Return with us now to those dreary days of yesteryear when
television was black-and-white, Dad was a hopeless sap and Mom was
still the virgin mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking, of course, about the 1950s, and this week's
vehicle for taking us back is ``Pleasantville.'' It is a funny and
thoroughly confused movie based on the ever popular notion that the
1950s was the black hole of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   We can only guess why this misconception is so common nowadays.
My theory is that it's because the '50s were the golden age for
parents of today's baby boomers, who now run things and, so, are in
charge of revising history.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents had lived in a heroic age, prevailing against
poverty and tyranny, leaving their children doomed to know only the
unheroic tranquillity of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Born too late to get in on the big show, and being only human,
the children might naturally resent their parents' triumph and take
vengeance by belittling what the old folks made of their moment of
glory. Which, of course, was the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the unheroic era of peace and prosperity has
degenerated into an age of decadence. In middle-age, today's
boomers now confront a world of their own making which cannot much
comfort their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   What do they see? A society ruled by greed and moral license. A
nation whose governing political theory is devil-take-the-hindmost.
</P>
<P>
   You could make a strong case for the thesis that the century's
real black hole is right here, right now, and that it is the
creation of people who were ``kids'' in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   All the above, I hasten to say, is the kind of highly doubtful
speculation we fall into when generalizing about decades,
generational antipathies and the flow of history.
</P>
<P>
   I hope no one will swallow it whole. It is offered here only to
suggest that the present widespread view of the 1950s is also
mostly horsefeathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' presents the familiar malarkey in genial,
clever, all-in-good-fun style until it loses its head and presents
its '50s reactionaries as homespun Nazi book burners and
Kristallnacht window smashers.
</P>
<P>
   The story is a fairy tale about two '90s adolescents who get
trapped in a town created for a 1950s TV sitcom. What a no-fun
town!
</P>
<P>
   It's all black-and-white. Stupid old Dad enters his house every
night and, as mechanically as a cuckoo clock, cries, ``Honey! I'm
home!''
</P>
<P>
   Mom, wearing a little oppressed-housewife apron and hopelessly
ignorant of 1998 dietary dogma, stuffs the whole darned family with
foods dangerously rich in animal fat.
</P>
<P>
   The high school students have never heard of sex. Neither have
Mom and Dad. As a joke about the inanity of '50s sitcoms, all this
is very funny until you realize that there is an absurdly serious
subtext; to wit, that TV sitcoms in the '50s were even more inane
than TV sitcoms today.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual activity is at the heart of the lesson here. Nobody in
the town of Pleasantville has ever engaged in it. Nobody even knows
it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   The two teen-age visitors from the '90s don't put up very long
with this deprived state of affairs. The girl, apparently a
seasoned slut, soon deflowers the star of the basketball team and
pretty soon their example has all the kids in town being naughty up
in Lover's Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Her '90s brother has to inform hopelessly innocent Mom about the
art of masturbation, then assist her in moving up to adultery.
</P>
<P>
   As sexual activity spreads through town, life becomes richer,
better, and the population starts losing its black, white and gray
complexion and breaking out in glorious Technicolor. The town is
now ready for a '90s sitcom to move in.
</P>
<P>
   The real joke here is on the 1990s, which have no sitcom to
compare with ``I Love Lucy'' and no TV humor at all to compare with
the Sid Caesar shows, both of the '50s. Check out ``Saturday Night
Live'' or ``Politically Incorrect'' to see how letting it all hang
out in '90s style has done in TV humor.
</P>
<P>
   No, the '50s decade was not so glorious as old-timers claim, but
it had its many excellences. For us here in the '90s to sneer at
the '50s is as silly as it would be for President Clinton to sneer
at Gen. Eisenhower.

 UNDATED: HMO profits. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York, where state approval is required for increases in
HMO premiums that exceed 10 percent, Empire Blue Cross and Blue
Shield recently received approval to raise rates for downstate
employers for a popular health plan by 15.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO industry has benefited from rapid consolidation, which
has left the surviving companies in stronger positions. Sixteen of
the nation's 25 biggest HMOs were swallowed by other managed care
companies in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few national carriers left: Aetna, Cigna,
United Healthcare,'' Ms. Finigan of J. Baker said. ``Because the
number is so limited, they are calling the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pinch is apparent in many places. In Chicago, a group of big
employers asked for bids from 11 local HMOs earlier this year. By
the time the negotiations ended, three had disappeared into mergers
and one had left town.
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of all insured workers now in HMOs or other
types of managed care, there are few opportunities left for
employers to lower costs just by transferring people to managed
care from traditional fee-for-service health plans. That process,
many experts say, was the prime factor in temporarily holding down
costs for employers.
</P>
<P>
   McKeever said managed care insurance was moving into
``underwriting cycles'' of three years of losses followed by three
years of profits, following a pattern in traditional insurance. In
the down cycle, insurers reduced rates to attract new business
until they lost money and ``had to either raise rates or exit the
business,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: GIFT FOR AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here I come bearing a lovely gift: proof that with the power of
the passion for freedom, Americans can rise high above the
government they elected and compel politicians to follow them.
</P>
<P>
   Those good tidings were rarely more important than now, when
from Washington rises the odor of a garbage-dump of corruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Our president has such contempt for his job and countrymen that
he risked the presidency on back-room sex, sure that if caught he
could lie his way out of it. Congress skitters about, looking for a
solution, desperate not to see it in the Constitution: impeachment,
trial and verdict. Whatever Congress does, or flees, Bill Clinton's
decision to risk the presidency like a dollar chip is his immortal
insult to America.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the capital is afloat in the greed of Americans
who transfer to foreign countries the political skills they
acquired while taking U.S. paychecks, and our country becomes the
personal yo-yo of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the stench of cynicism is so powerful that we fear it
will smother us all. But unwrap the gift. You will see that for
almost three years, tens of millions of Americans, without money to
fight the power of the lobbies, without advertising to break
through the press's bored near-blackout, without any weapons but
their letters, voices and prayers, with no reward except to look at
themselves without shame, these Americans forced the administration
to accept what it had used claw and dollar to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   What was this demon that the administration-trade lobby alliance
tried to destroy? It was a bill that condemned persecution abroad
of Christian and other minorities and called for economic or
political penalties against the persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take years of hard struggle to pass? One reason is
that the administration trembled at the warnings of lobbies that
fury of the persecutors might damage trade. Washington was also
jittery that most of the persecuting countries are Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Persecution cannot be the godly expression of any religion but
is its perversion by man. Persecution in Muslim countries is a
blotch on Islam. It would help if more Muslims in free countries
said so.
</P>
<P>
   American Christians may be the only religious group in the world
that has never been persecuted. It took them, and Jews, too long to
get it through their heads that Christians could be tortured and
murdered still, not just in the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   And it took self-examination for some American Christians to
understand that Asian and African Christians are not exotic
guest-Christians but as deeply rooted in their religion as the
president who carries his Bible to Sunday service but calls China's
persecutor regime his partner.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans turned up their noses at cooperating with
conservative Christians, although the issue was not divisive, or
debatable.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually so many did understand that the issue was
American unity against persecution that the administration heard
the sound of votes, if not prayer. It caved.
</P>
<P>
   The final Senate vote for the bill often pronounced dead was
98-0. Supporters made concessions. But the bill keeps essentials _
a commission on international religious freedom, appointed by the
president and Congress, an annual report naming persecuting
nations, a list of sanctions from which the president must choose
or explain why he prefers none.
</P>
<P>
   The list ranges from near-nothings like private demarches to
real somethings that might persuade persecutors that oppressing
religion does not pay _ like suspension of U.S. developmental or
strategic assistance and loans, and withholding of export licenses.
</P>
<P>
   For America, the special importance is that conservatives and
liberals showed that action for human rights is not the property of
either group and that success depends on the support of both.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to work. In China, recently, 140 more Christians who
refuse to submit to government domination of their churches were
beaten and arrested. In Sudan, the government uses the civil war to
kill, starve and enslave Christians. In Pakistan, the government
enforces on Christians the harshest forms of Islamic law, including
death for blasphemy. Et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   So, as they say at many church meetings in America, pray on
Sunday, and act on Monday.

   News that B.F. Goodrich would buy Coltec Industries was greeted
with cheers Monday by stock-market investors, who bid up the the
companies' stocks by 9.2 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively.
Both companies make landing gear and other aerospace equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But the $1.49 billion deal didn't play so well in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Spreads between outstanding Goodrich issues and similarly rated
debt of other companies widened by as much as 10 basis points, or
0.1 percent, according to Gregory W. Lobo, senior fixed-income
portfolio manager at HGK Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the bond market's reaction to a part of the
deal calling for Goodrich, whose debt is judged only medium grade
by Standard &AMP; Poor's, to assume some $825 million of somewhat
speculative Coltec obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of the extra leverage,'' said Lobo, referring to
the Goodrich bonds. ``It strains the rating.''
</P>
<P>
   The mixed reception showed how a transaction seen as beneficial
for both companies can have nasty consequences for bondholders. It
also showed how sensitive the bond market remains to companies that
have anything less than the strongest balance sheets.

   Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust, Netscape and America Online: It
was a week of sizzling merger activity. Many investors believe that
such combinations are the key to creating shareholder wealth. But
A.T. Kearney, a management consulting firm in Chicago, has just
released a study that it says shows quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which examined 115 multibillion-dollar mergers around
the world in a variety of industries from 1993 to 1996, found that
58 percent of the corporate mergers failed to produce any extra
benefit for shareholders when compared with the performance of
their peers in the same industry, according to Michael R. Traem,
the A.T. Kearney vice president who prepared the study.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the study found that an even greater share of
companies, 62 percent, failed to outperform their peers in terms of
profit growth after the mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Using more subjective criteria, Traem said 75 percent of the
companies failed to meet the ``strategic goals'' that motivated
their mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the study concluded that mergers of equals
were less successful than acquisitions of smaller companies. It
found that 74 percent of top-performing acquirers had carried out
more than three mergers in the previous five years and that 80
percent of the top-performing combinations were between companies
in related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Not that superior returns are not possible. Of the mergers that
did create value for shareholders, the top performers increased
shareholder returns by an average of 25 percent.

<P>
   Carrot for a New Manager: A Stake Worth Millions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies often tinker with pay to encourage their
portfolio managers. But Davis Selected Advisors, which runs
well-known funds like Selected American Shares and Davis New York
Venture, has come up with an extraordinary plan.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's partners are granting Jeffrey W. Singer, the manager
of the new Davis International Growth, which will be available
starting Jan. 1, a multimillion-dollar stake in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Strings, of course, are attached.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works: The firm's six partners will buy ``several
millions of dollars'' of shares in Davis International, said one of
the partners, Andrew A. Davis. Depending on the fund's performance,
the partners will transfer varying amounts of shares to Singer, a
former analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, over the next three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   If the fund earns a place in the top 20 percent of its category,
Singer will receive all the shares. If the fund performs in the
second 20 percent, he will get three-quarters of them; in the next
10 percent, he will receive half of them. He gets no shares if the
fund's results are in the lower half of its category.
</P>
<P>
   The shares vest gradually, so Singer will receive one-third of
the shares he earns after three years, one-half after four years
and the balance after five years. ``We're big inside owners in our
own funds, and we like to buy companies that do the same,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Belden, the editor of No-Load Fund Analyst, a newsletter,
said the idea appeared to be a good one. ``This looks like an
extension of their long-term philosophy,'' Ms. Belden said.

 UNDATED: HMO profits. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York, where state approval is required for increases in
HMO premiums that exceed 10 percent, Empire Blue Cross and Blue
Shield recently received approval to raise rates for downstate
employers for a popular health plan by 15.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO industry has benefited from rapid consolidation, which
has left the surviving companies in stronger positions. Sixteen of
the nation's 25 biggest HMOs were swallowed by other managed care
companies in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few national carriers left: Aetna, Cigna,
United Healthcare,'' Ms. Finigan of J. Baker said. ``Because the
number is so limited, they are calling the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pinch is apparent in many places. In Chicago, a group of big
employers asked for bids from 11 local HMOs earlier this year. By
the time the negotiations ended, three had disappeared into mergers
and one had left town.
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of all insured workers now in HMOs or other
types of managed care, there are few opportunities left for
employers to lower costs just by transferring people to managed
care from traditional fee-for-service health plans. That process,
many experts say, was the prime factor in temporarily holding down
costs for employers.
</P>
<P>
   McKeever said managed care insurance was moving into
``underwriting cycles'' of three years of losses followed by three
years of profits, following a pattern in traditional insurance. In
the down cycle, insurers reduced rates to attract new business
until they lost money and ``had to either raise rates or exit the
business,'' he said.

<P>
   COLLEGE-GRADS-RECRUIT (Undated) _ Campus recruiting by Wall
Street firms and management consultants _ between them the biggest
hirers of freshly minted college graduates _ has become an
elaborate dance, with fierce competition on both sides. The
companies spend a bundle to try to snare the best and brightest,
and the kids go to greater and greater lengths to attract the
attention of the ``right'' company, just as they did four years
earlier to get into the ``right'' school. This year promises to be
fiercer than ever, with the downturn in the markets casting a dark
shadow over the promised riches on Wall Street and everyone hoping
to make it in the door before the feared hiring freezes set in. By
Andrew Ross Sorkin.

   BIZ-DAMS (Undated) _ Once the neglected stepchild of the
electricity industry, hydroelectric power gets a surprise shot in
the arm from deregulation. It turns out consumers will pay a
premium for power that comes from renewable sources like hydro
power. And their operators love them too, because they are cheap to
run and you can easily store power (i.e. water above the dam) for
use in peak periods. By Agis Salpukas.

   INVEST-ASIA (Undated) _ In the last year, exposure to Asia has
generally meant risking a bad case of the flu. The region's
economic turmoil has weakened demand, and the health of many
companies _ and their stocks _ has suffered. But some analysts see
signs of a possible Asian recovery. Economists at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, for example, forecast growth in gross domestic product

</P>
<P>
   BIZ-FOR-ME (Undated) _ While most of us wouldn't hesitate to ask
a confidant about his love life, his paycheck is a different story.
Sex may be private, but it is rarely secret. Money, however, is the
best-kept secret. It is no wonder. Mixed messages about money
surround us. At some point, we have all been taught that money is
the root of all evil, that it does not buy happiness or, as the
song goes, love. By Linda Carroll Martin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUTOS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-OLDSMOBILE (Undated) _ Putting televisions and
videocassette players in vans is nothing new. Builders of custom
vans have been doing it for years. But buying a custom van has
often meant accepting all that goes with it: crushed velour
curtains, for instance. Moreover, the size and shape of traditional
cathode-ray TV's usually require a ``pop-top'' _ a reinforced
fiberglass roof into which the monitor is mounted _ that can raise
a vehicle's height to more than 7 feet, barring it from many
parking decks. Oldsmobile's new Premiere edition of the Silhouette
minivan solves that problem by using a compact
liquid-crystal-display monitor as the centerpiece of its integrated
entertainment system. By Dan Neil. (Moved).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-MINIVANS (Undated) _ The minivan has become the object
of snickers and it seems at risk of being muscled aside by sport
utilities with comparable space plus a rugged image. Although the
minivan segment is not growing, it is far from dead. Auto makers
are frantically working to lure new buyers with vans that are
safer, more exciting, more luxurious and more practical. By Cheryl
Jensen. (Moved).

</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The idea of censuring President Clinton for his
conduct in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, rather than impeaching him,
is steadily gaining momentum in the House.
</P>
<P>
   That development reflects the awareness among lawmakers of both
parties that the votes to impeach Clinton on even a single perjury
count are in doubt, at least in part because opinion polls show
that two-thirds of the public wants him to remain in office while
about half backs censure.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats in particular support censure as a means of
condemning Clinton's misconduct without removing him, and of
shielding themselves from Republican criticism that they are being
too lenient.
</P>
<P>
   But as difficult as the politics of impeachment are, it is not
clear whether supporters of censure can build a majority for their
option, either, partly because some lawmakers harbor doubts about
its constitutionality. Moreover, the Republican leaders have the
power to prevent a vote on censure, and might do so if they
perceived that this would strengthen the chances of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 228 Republicans in the current Congress _ perhaps
more than 100 of them _ might vote against censure, senior
Republican aides say, because they think it either insufficient or
unconstitutional. So a majority of the 206 Democrats and 1
independent would most likely have to hold firm to win passage of a
censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   There are serious cracks within the Democratic ranks, though.
Many of the 35 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, for
example, oppose any punishment of the president, saying he is a
victim of a biased investigation by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel. Other liberal Democrats speak similarly.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Democratic aides express confidence, however, that the
party leaders would prevail among their rank and file by making an
impassioned argument for unity, just as they did on the resolution
to begin the impeachment inquiry itself. Only 31 Democrats voted
for the Republican version of that resolution, in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really for censure, but if there's a strong Democratic
consensus I'd reconsider,'' said the Black Caucus' chairwoman, Rep.
Maxine Waters of California, a strong voice on the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders were especially heartened by the
censure proposal offered on Tuesday by Rep. Paul McHale, D-Pa., who
had earlier called on Clinton to resign. Republicans had been
counting on McHale to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A central question for Republican leaders is whether to allow a
censure vote if impeachment, having been recommended by the
Judiciary Committee as expected, is then rejected by the full
House. Many lawmakers say any censure vote on the floor would most
likely come only after impeachment had failed.
</P>
<P>
   A vote to censure would give Democrats _ and perhaps two dozen
moderate Republicans _ political cover. And it would deny
conservatives the chance to paint Democrats who vote against
impeachment as endorsing a party of perjurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no impeachment, there will be a fallback censure
position,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, a senior
Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. ``The House will want
to speak to the conduct of the president. Democrats will want to do
that as well as Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Amo Houghton Jr. of New York, a moderate Republican, said:
``There will be a censure option. It's just a matter of what's
involved in the censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the House Republican leadership has stayed silent on the
question of censure, waiting for the committee and its chairman,
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, to make their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, whom Republicans have
chosen to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker, has not ruled out a
censure vote, but has suggested it might be more fitting in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, is actively
fighting any attempt to bring a censure resolution to the floor.
DeLay believes that by denying wavering lawmakers an alternative to
impeachment, fence-sitters will be pressured to vote against the
president or explain to their constituents why they let him off
scot-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a difficult road to bring a censure vote to the
House floor,'' said Michael Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida, the newly chosen fifth-ranking
House Republican, expressed strong reservations about a rebuke:
``How do you censure the president one week, and the next week have
him give the State of the Union or order the bombing of Iraq, when
you're rallying support for him?''
</P>
<P>
   With a majority of Americans opposed to impeaching Clinton, but
favoring some sort of reprimand, Democrats and some Republicans
warn that blocking a censure vote could backfire on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a political mistake for the majority party to be
seen as thwarting the clear will of the people, that Congress
admonish the President,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, a Virginia
Democrat on the judiciary committee.
</P>
<P>
   And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say that to be
effective, impeachment or censure needs to be bipartisan. ``We
certainly don't want this to appear to be a partisan lynching,''
said Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top lieutenants have signaled his willingness to
accept censure, saying he would be open to a ``serious and
reasonable'' compromise. Cabinet officers, including Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, a former Democratic Congressman from New
Mexico and former representative to the United Nations, have been
sounding out moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I had any advice,'' Rep. Christopher Shays, a
Connecticut Republican who opposes impeachment and censure, said
about his recent conversation with Richardson. ``I told him the
president should tell the truth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What a censure resolution would look like is unclear. McHale's
four-paragraph proposal is a searing condemnation of Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky and their efforts to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stronger than many Democrats would like to see, but
strong enough for Republicans to feel that the president's conduct
has been sufficiently condemned,'' said McHale.
</P>
<P>
   Some censure proponents have proposed fining Clinton or
requiring him to stand on the House floor and accept his
punishment. Support for these ideas appears thin. A fine would
require Clinton's consent to avoid constitutional hurdles, and many
lawmakers fear bringing Clinton to the floor for a scolding would
demean the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Among the roughly 100 Republicans who oppose censure there are
various factions. Some, like Shays, say a reprimand would set a
dangerous precedent. ``To censure or rebuke would open the door to
censure of the week, censure of the month,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of lawmakers cites the testimony from scholars
that censuring Clinton has no basis in the Constitution. ``The
Constitution establishes a process to deal with the misconduct of
the president,'' said Representative Charles T. Canady, R.-Fla.
``Impeach or not, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the judiciary committee, where there is virtually no support
among Republicans for a rebuke after or instead of an impeachment
vote, some Republicans say the committee's almost certain approval
of at least one impeachment article would be penalty enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the committee reports out a resolution, and it fails to
pass on the House floor, I believe he's still been censured,'' said
Rep. George W. Gekas, a Pennsylvania Republican on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, in particular, are pressing for censure as a way
to vent their anger at Clinton and preserve their integrity in the
history books. There are also electoral considerations. House
Democrats did not fare as well with older women voters in the
mid-term elections as they have in the past, and party leaders
believe a rebuke would help shore up support with that important
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some punishment,'' said Rep. Charles E.
Schumer, a New York Democrat on the committee who was elected to
the Senate in November. ``I don't want my children or grandchildren
reading in the history books that someone lied under oath, which I
think the president did, and was not rebuked for it in some way.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a
merger or some other business combination, America's economic
history is already being rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   In energy as in businesses like financial services,
telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and
technology have made unthinkable combinations practical, even
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an
additional pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago.
Crude oil prices have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this
year to levels, adjusted for inflation, not seen since before the
first oil embargo 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the oil companies, having spent years cutting their
costs, are desperate for further savings in order to continue
operating profitably with such low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil are the two largest, strongest competitors to
emerge from the nation's most famous antitrust case, the 1911
breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger than
either of them. They will also confront a British Petroleum PLC
made far more potent in the United States by its agreement this
summer to buy Amoco Corp. for $48.2 billion. Industry executives
say further deals on this scale are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both companies did not return calls Thursday for
comment on the talks, and it was unclear Thursday night what the
outcome might be.
</P>
<P>
   But if Exxon and Mobil agree to become one, antitrust regulators
are likely to be cautious about putting back together much of what
they long ago broke apart. Even so, most oil industry analysts
contend that improved efficiency from combining giant energy
companies would do more to lower costs than the more concentrated
ownership of gas stations and refineries would do to raise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the consumer,''
said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could prove
heaviest for energy industry employees. Analysts say that of the
about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and
the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would be
likely to lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, with Lucio A. Noto, both
have chief executives who have been preoccupied with the humbling
accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies were everybody's favorite targets during the
trust-busting era early this century and again during the Arab oil
embargoes of the 1970s. Now they seem especially vulnerable as
demand weakens in much of the world, especially in economically
troubled Asia, weighing further on already depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pitiful, helpless giants,'' said Ronald Chernow, the
author of ``Titan,'' a biography of John D. Rockefeller, Standard
Oil's founder.
</P>
<P>
   As such, these giants are compelled to continue cutting costs
and spreading the risks of their huge, expensive international
projects that are needed to develop oil reserves needed for the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil, with $58.4 billion in sales last year, might seem large
enough to undertake anything. But in competing for rights to
develop huge natural gas fields in Turkmenistan, a former Soviet
republic, Mobil was unable to match Shell's offer to build a
pipeline for $1 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies have decided that they cannot count on a rebound
in oil prices to revive their fortunes any time soon. Earlier this
month, the Energy Department predicted that the collapse of Asian
demand would continue to depress oil prices for nearly a decade,
and by as much as $5.50 a barrel in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
put off until March any decision on extending their oil production
cutbacks to prop up prices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, improving technology for exploration and production
and the opening of new regions to development have added to the
already huge supply of oil that is on hand now.
</P>
<P>
   In response, many energy companies have already begun a new wave
of cutbacks in their staffs and operations. To further reduce
costs, companies like Mobil are forming partnerships that stop
short of full mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mobil agreed to combine its European refining and
marketing operations with British Petroleum's, resulting in annual
savings of about $500 million. Shell and Texaco then formed a
refining partnership in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, an energy
analysts with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in
Houston, ``if you're an Exxon, how do you compete?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations of gas
stations in certain areas of the United States, analysts say they
have far more competition at the pump than before oil prices
collapsed in the 1980s. Thousands of convenience stores now also
sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies, and
foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their
supplies through acquired companies like Citgo.
</P>
<P>
   Under Noto, Mobil has been hunting for ways of becoming large
and lean enough to survive. He took the lead in the deal with
British Petroleum and has considered buying up smaller companies.
And he has made it clear that corporate or personal pride would
never block a deal. In the European agreement with British
Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses have come down from the fronts
of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos have gone
up.
</P>
<P>
   As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, an analyst
with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, ``If the price is right, egos
will not get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Mobil reportedly had further talks with British
Petroleum about other combinations, as well as talks with Amoco
about forming an American refining venture. The company was also
interested in Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. began looking to divest
itself of that oil and gas business. But no deals were reached.
More recently, there was speculation on Wall Street that Mobil had
been talking with Chevron Corp.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum purchase of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to
seek a deal, Hervey said. ``I don't think this whole thing would
have started if British Petroleum had not pulled the trigger,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly since the
August announcement towards an expected $2 billion in annual
savings, has put even companies as large as Exxon on the spot.
There, Raymond has so far concentrated more on making his
operations more efficient than on finding allies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater than
Exxon's, some analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness
to absorb a company of Mobil's size.
</P>
<P>
   Only the largest oil companies can afford to take advantage of
today's best opportunities. Finding new fields in the deep waters
off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of Mexico can require
platforms costing $1 billion or more. Producing oil in the states
of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and money than many
investors anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Noto was among the American executives invited by
a Saudi leader visiting Washington to greatly step up investments
in his country, too. Noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia
himself, building up Mobil operations including a huge refinery.
But any new partnerships with the Saudis might require both Mobil's
connections and Exxon's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon
was Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New
York. Even after the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, they
remained for several years in the same building in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Chernow, the Rockefeller biographer, noted that two pieces of
the Standard Oil trust are already likely to be united. British
Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s, and Amoco was
once Standard Oil of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The break-up of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has
often been cited as a precedent for the current antitrust action
against Microsoft. Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon
acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon would not be obviously larger than its leading
competitors, the way Microsoft is,'' he said. In the energy
business today, he added, ``there are other large dinosaurs that
stalk that particular jungle.''

ADVERTISING: AN AD TITAN GETS HIS DUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Minn., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Burnett, the adman behind the Marlboro Man, has been
selected as one of the 20 most influential business leaders of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Burnett started the Chicago agency, still bearing his
name, that has grown into one of the world's largest. Burnett, who
died in 1971 at 79, specialized in strong client relationships and
building brands through the creation of colorful characters _
``critters'' in the parlance of Leo Burnett Co. _ that personify
the products they peddle, from the rugged Marlboro cowboy to the
giddy Pillsbury doughboy to the tasteful tuna named Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett is the only advertising executive honored by Time
magazine in an issue saluting the business leaders, the third in a
series of six special issues called the Time 100. Among the Time
editors who compiled the list, there were two runners-up to
Burnett: William Bernbach of Doyle Dane Bernbach and David Ogilvy,
87, of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather.
</P>
<P>
   The issue _ titled ``Builders and Titans'' in the glib Timespeak
of tycoons and pundits _ is to come out on Monday. A companion
television program is scheduled to be broadcast by CBS at 10 p.m.
ET and PT on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other honorees are two whose firms are today clients
of the Burnett agency: Walt Disney of Walt Disney Co. and Ray Kroc
of McDonald's Corp. The list also includes Henry Ford; Bill Gates
of Microsoft Corp.; the cosmetics queen Estee Lauder, the only
woman, and Akio Morita of Sony Corp..
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at the 20th century without looking at
advertising,'' said Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time, the
news weekly published by the Time Inc. division of Time Warner Inc.
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising has affected our lives,'' he added, ``and made us
the type of consumer society we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Saporito, a senior editor at Time who is business editor,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is two-thirds consumer spending,'' Saporito said,
and if ``one component of consumerism is an informed consumer,''
advertising is important in ``giving the consumer information from
which to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Charlie the Tuna that voice of information?'' he asked,
chuckling. ``Not always. But clearly, advertising is a driver.''
</P>
<P>
   The selections of Burnett and the other business leaders were
made by a Time team that included Isaacson, Saporito and Stephen
Koepp, an executive editor, in consultation with advertising
industry executives and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   One agency executive polled was Patrick Fallon, chairman of
Fallon McElligott, the Minneapolis shop handling the Time account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo Burnett, David Ogilvy and Bill Bernbach are what most of
us in this business would consider the Big Three,'' Fallon said.
``But when they asked my opinion, I said there's no comparison:
It's one person _ Bill Bernbach, who for me personally changed the
face of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Saporito said: ``It was a really close call. There was a really
fierce group of Bernbach loyalists, and we heard from them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' he added, ``what people associate
advertising with in a television age is the types of images
associated with Leo Burnett. So he gets the nod.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the issue, Stuart Ewen, chairman of film and
media studies at Hunter College in New York, writes that Burnett
``built his reputation around the idea that `share of market' could
be built only on `share of mind,' the capacity to stimulate
consumers' basic desires and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   And the primary Burnett method for achieving that, Ewen writes,
was through characters like the Marlboro Man, ``for better or worse
one of the most enduring advertising icons ever devised,'' selling
Marlboro cigarettes for Philip Morris Cos.; Charlie, for Star-Kist
tuna; Tony the Tiger, for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, and the Jolly
Green Giant, for Green Giant vegetables.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The essay also discusses the significant shifts in advertising
since the heyday of Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though Burnett's talismans endure, they occupy a world where
consumers are increasingly caustic about the products that they
purchase,'' Ewen writes. ``The effort by marketers to capitalize on
the cynical mindset of an MTV generation has overwhelmed the quest
for universal human archetypes.''
</P>
<P>
   A small article accompanying the Burnett essay discusses
Bernbach, a co-founder of Doyle Dane, now part of the DDB Needham
Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, and Ogilvy, whose agency, now
known as Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, is owned by WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The article praises Bernbach, who died in 1982, for leading ``a
velvet revolution in advertising'' in the 1960s, ``relying on
creativity, sly humor and instinct.'' Doyle Dane work included the
famous ``Think small'' campaign for the original Volkswagen Beetle,
the ``We try harder'' ads for Avis and the ``Hey, Mikey!''
commercial for Life cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The article compliments Ogilvy for working for only those
clients ``whose products he felt were beyond reproach'' and
creating such enduring brand imagery as the dapper ``Man in the
Hathaway shirt,'' always sporting an eyepatch, and the bearded
Commander Schweppes, the veddy British spokesman for Schweppes
mixers.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that Burnett prevailed over Bernbach and Ogilvy
may be that he is one of the few founders of modern Madison Avenue
with a distinctive identity. His agency continues to promote the
red apples he set out in bowls at the office, his black copy
pencils and his sayings like ``Reach for the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo Burnett has always been a titan in our eyes,'' said
Richard Fizdale, chairman and chief executive at the Burnett
agency. ``You cannot work here for any length of time and not come
into contact with him.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fizdale described as the ``tiny eight-person shop'' that
Burnett began now ranks No. 13 among the world's agencies, with
estimated billings of $6 billion from clients like Disney,
McDonald's, Coca-Cola Co., Kellogg Co. and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co..
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Time selection is serendipitous for the
agency. After difficulties with lost accounts and turmoil among top
executives in 1996 and 1997, there has been a rebound in recent
months that included new assignments from P&AMP;G, Diageo PLC, H.J.
Heinz Co. and Sara Lee Corp.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Nov. 29,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HORROCKS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ In her latest film, ``Little
Voice,'' directed and adapted for the screen by Mark Herman
(``Brassed Off''), Ms. Jane Horrocks plays L.V. (for Little Voice),
an introverted working-class waif who holes up in her bedroom,
hoping both to escape the scalding remarks of her alcoholic mother
(Brenda Blethyn) and to recapture the comforting presence of her
late father by playing and re-playing the 33 and one-third records
from his collection of pop classics. For all her mother's seedy
boyfriend (a gold-chained Michael Caine) knows, L.V. is completely
mute. Then, as the sounds of famous female pop singers seep from
beneath her door and out the windows, he discovers that this mousy
young woman has a gift for impersonating divas. The rest of
``Little Voice,'' which opens on Dec. 4, documents his hapless
attempts to exploit L.V.'s talents _ and also shows a veteran actor
being bowled over by his younger co-star. By Margy Rochlin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-FILMS (Undated) _ Brazil has long been proud of its place
in world cinema. But these days the country, quite simply, is film
mad. Headlines appear on the front pages of the major newspapers
every time a Brazilian film wins an international award or an
Academy Award nomination. By B. Ruby Rich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-CREDITS (Undated) _ IN the beginning, there was simply
``The End.'' Now, there are gaffers, best boys and Celine Dion.
Hollywood movie credits, which began as modest lists, have grown
over the years into lumbering behemoths as extravagant _ and
seemingly as time-consuming _ as the films they accompany. By
Margalit Fox. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PENELOPE-CRUZ-FILMS (Undated) _ Screen beauties are hardly a
novelty, but even within the realm of celluloid sirens, the Spanish
actress Penelope Cruz elicits unusual adoration from her directors.
``She's simply gorgeous, he said helplessly,'' the director Stephen
Frears said, well, helplessly, of his decision to cast Ms. Cruz,
24, in her first American film, ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' The
Madrid-born performer plays Billy Crudup's consolation prize,
inasmuch as the woman whom the leading man really wants _ a
kittenish Patricia Arquette _ has chosen his best friend (Woody
Harrelson) instead. (The movie, set in the Southwest in the
aftermath of World War II, opens on Dec. 30.) By Matt Wolf.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT-BALLET (Frankfurt, Germany) _ In Europe, the
choreographer William Forsythe is widely considered the most
important dance maker on the planet. In his own country, the United
States, his name is probably known only to a limited number of
balletgoers who have seen his works in the repertories of the New
York City Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet or the Joffrey Ballet,
or perhaps performed by a touring company from across the Atlantic.
The visit of Forsythe and the company he directs, Frankfurt Ballet,
to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for six performances starting
Wednesday marks a decade since the troupe's last appearances in the
United States. By Roslyn Sulcas. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DONMAR-THEATER (London) _ A former hops brewery might seem an
unlikely source for Broadway. But the tiny Donmar Warehouse theater
in London has over time become a powerful producing entity way out
of proportion to its 251 seats. While maintaining a full level of
activity at home, the nonprofit theater has originated, in one form
or another and sometimes with outside collaborators, three highly
disparate productions currently on Broadway: ``Cabaret'' at Studio
54, which won last season's Tony Award for best musical revival;
Sophocles' ``Electra,'' with Zoe Wanamaker in the title role, now
in previews and opening on Thursday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater,
and ``The Blue Room,'' also in previews and opening on Dec. 13 at
the Cort Theater with Nicole Kidman in her Broadway stage debut. By
Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews George C.
Wolfe's new production of ``On the Town.'' (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SONDHEIM-FOLLIES-CDs (Undated) _ A new two-CD recording of
theater director Stephen Sondheim's score for ``Follies.'' By
Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-LISTEN (Undated) _ As mechanisms of sound reproduction
improve, the day may come when one cannot distinguish aurally
between sitting in Avery Fisher Hall in New York City (where this
concert took place) and listening at home with headphones, though
that day is a long way off. And with DVD and its future
developments, the time may come when the impression of facing an
orchestra can be reconstructed. But it is hard to imagine the
technology that would allow individual watcher-listeners to use
their eyes and ears with the range of choices available in any
concert hall: to fix attention on a cellist's bowing, to scrutinize
the field. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PLAYER-PIANO-CDs (Undated) _ Geneticists have their Dolly. They
also have the goods on Thomas Jefferson: the old miscegenator long
suspected, now betrayed by his own DNA. Where the progress of
science is concerned, art is rarely far behind, and now comes
Sergei Rachmaninoff, dead since 1942, walking among us again.
Telarc has released ``A Window in Time,'' a CD made from piano
rolls, and promises another in March. On the first, the great man
plays his own music and arrangements ranging from Bizet to ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' On the second, Rachmaninoff addresses the
significant (Chopin, Schubert, Mendelssohn) and the less
significant (Henselt, Rubinstein and bowdlerdized Bach, Beethoven
and Gluck). The music comes from a process developed by Wayne
Stahnke, who got his ideas working on the Voyager space mission for
NASA. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRUCKNER-MUSIC (Undated) _ Imagine the Bruckner symphonies shorn
of sentimental piety, and you're at the starting point of a
provocative cycle emerging on CDs. Through five symphonies, Georg
Tintner, 81, a conductor born in Vienna, casts Bruckner's grand,
emotionally charged structures in a refreshing light of restraint
and proportion. Reflected back is an aura of honest affection and
with it a paradoxical exchange: a beguiling intellectual beauty
where one often finds a cloistered spirituality. By Lawrence B.
Johnson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   JOHNSON-GEHRY-ARCH (Undated) _ Frank Gehry has changed Philip
Johnson's place in history, and both architects are the
beneficiaries. If Gehry hadn't come along, Johnson's work might
well be remembered as an emblem of a time when American
architecture lost its way. His restless rovings from movement to
movement and style to style offered giddy architectural
entertainment, particularly during his high-flying days of big
corporate commissions in the 1980s. But they demoralized many who
think that architecture should stand for something more than relish
for flirting with forms. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRASSAI-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ Next Sunday, an exhibition of
photographs by Brassai, called ``The Eye of Paris,'' will open at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. The result of 15 years of
research by Anne Wilkes Tucker, the museum's curator of
photography, it is the first major museum retrospective of
Brassai's work to be held in this country since one at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York in 1968. By John Russell. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   TV-PIONEERS (Undated) _ Since April 1996, the Television Arts
and Sciences television Archive of American Television has been
sending video crews around the country in a race against the
actuarial clock to interview the dwindling stock of television
pioneers. The list includes not only the Berles and the
Caesar-Cocas but also the technical geniuses like Philo Farnsworth
and the unrecognized heroes of television's early years like
Charlie Andrews, whose quirky genius inspired the widely
influential Chicago School of Television that brought, among
others, Studs Terkel, Dave Garroway and Hugh Downs to national
prominence. By Jeff Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN-JEWELRY-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ In 1955, Oppi Untracht, a
New Yorker who now lives in Finland, was spellbound by an
exhibition of Indian textiles and jewelry he saw at the Museum of
Modern Art. Since then Untracht (often with his wife, the Finnish
glass designer Saara Hopea, who died in 1984) has spent years
traveling the highways and byways of the subcontinent, studying
jewelry-making techniques and buying jewelry. His collection of
jewelry and photographs along with loans from museums and other
private collectors make up ``India: A Jewelry Spectrum,'' a
dazzling exhibition on view through Jan. 31. By Paula Deitz.
(Moved).

MARK O'MEARA IS IN DEMAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara has long been respected by his peers for not only
possessing one of the game's smoothest swings but for consistent,
winning golf.
</P>
<P>
   But not great golf.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has had a run of success since turning professional in
1980. The former U.S. Amateur champion has 16 victories,
$10,293,473 in career earnings and is a four-time member of the
U.S. Ryder Cup. Still, there was something missing in his
impressive resume _ a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's world as he knew it, however, ended April 12 in
Augusta, Ga., when he sank a birdie putt on the 72nd hole to win
the Masters for his first major title. He was at it again three
months later in the British Open, when he defeated Brian Watts in a
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara went from a good player to a great one almost overnight.
With it have come the spoils of victory, such as the 60,000 miles
he figures he'll log in less than a month. He'll be jetting to La
Quinta, Calif., where he will compete in this weekend's Skins Game
at Rancho La Quinta Country Club, then to South Africa for the Sun
City Challenge and, finally, to Melbourne, Australia for the
Presidents Cup early next month.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara suddenly is in demand all over the world, but he is more
than willing to put up with a little jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get tired,'' he said, ``well, it's not such a bad way to
make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year to remember for O'Meara, although the demands
on his time haven't afforded him the chance to think much about it.
But he has savored it, and understandably so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dream year for me,'' O'Meara said. ``I have been
very busy all year long. At 41 years of age, my 18th year on tour,
to finally break through and win my first major championship . . .
sometimes I don't take enough time to reminisce, but when I look
back and see that putt on the 72nd hole at Augusta National to win
the Masters, it gives me goose bumps, probably more so now then
when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the British Open, that is a tournament I have cherished
for many, many years. I felt like if there was a major that I was
going to be able to win, that would probably be the one. The
history behind that championship is unbelievable. I would say it
has definitely been one of my best years.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who also won the World Match Play Championship in a
36-hole duel with close friend Tiger Woods, said he remembers the
final-hole scenario at the Masters almost as clearly now as when it
happened more than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to mark my ball,'' he said, ``I took a couple of
deep breaths to try and relax myself as much as possible. As I was
lining up my ball, I thought to myself, `This is what I play for.'
Sooner or later, I knew I had to make a putt and that now it was in
my hands. Why not close the door?
</P>
<P>
   ``When it disappeared and my hands went into the air and the
fans got all excited, I think more shock and a little disbelief and
more joy went through my mind that I just won The Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara often has been asked what he can do for an encore in
1999. He answers by saying his year isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I constantly like to compete and play and win,'' he said. ``I
know that winning doesn't come all the time. When you look at the
best players of all time in the game of golf, the winning
percentage is really small. In the game of golf, you lose a lot
more than you win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my career has been one of consistency, with a little
struggle here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who defeated John Cook in the final of the 1979 U.S.
Amateur Championship and was named the PGA Tour's Rookie of the
Year in 1981, won just $31,711 in 1982 and $69,354 in '83. His
yearly winnings have never been less than $200,000 since then,
although there was 1994, when he earned $214,070 and his best
finish in a major was a tie for 15th in the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably been one of the more consistent players on the
tour for the last 15 or 16 years,'' O'Meara said. ``It takes a lot
of pride and hard work. So, hopefully, I can continue on that . . .
build on what happened here this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll turn 42 in January, but my best golf years are
ahead of me. There is no reason not to think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his thinking is his belief that age means nothing in
golf. Even friendly competitions against the 23-year-old Woods back
home in Windermere, Fla., a suburb of Orlando, don't leave him
feeling he's ready for the geriatric set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think with age comes wisdom,'' O'Meara said. ``There
is no question that a lot of the young players have more power,
quite a bit of talent and no fear. That is why I think they have
risen to an unbelievable level in such a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still also believe patience and learning from experience
also plays a role. I've said it before, and I'll say it again . . .
the golf ball doesn't know how old you are. It just kind of sits on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think age is a factor if you look out at the strength of,
let's say, David Duval or Tiger Woods compared to Mark O'Meara.
Sure, they have more strength, but there are lot of ways to win
golf tournaments, and I guess I proved that this year in winning
the Masters and British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age and wisdom from learning from your past mistakes can also
be a tremendous advantage sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it comes to his drawing power. O'Meara admitted
his marquee value isn't the same as, say, Greg Norman or John Daly,
but he has no problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that, and that's fine,'' he said. ``Sure, people
recognize me more and (fame) that comes along with that is really
nice, but I'm me and I can only be me. If people appreciate Mark
O'Meara for the kind of person and the player that I am, that's
fine and I appreciate that. If they come out and watch me, I'll
give them my best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of pride in the consistency I have had in my
career. So, if that is a way of determining someone's greatness,
then I've been good at that.''

 CANCUN: Maria Bustamante.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, Cancun had served Mexico's traffickers much
as other coastal resorts. It was a place to relax, to launder
profits and to take delivery of the occasional load of South
American cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police seized a tractor-trailer laden with cocaine
near Chetumal in 1995, a group of drug-enforcement agents,
including several military officers, traveled to Quintana Roo to
investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret July 1997 report to federal prosecutors, the
director of Mexico's anti-drug police, Lt. Col. Edgardo Cedillo
Gonzalez, outlined some explosive findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allow us to inform you that great quantities of drugs,
including cocaine, are being smuggled through Quintana Roo,
approximately four tons a week,'' states the report, a copy of
which was given to The New York Times by an opponent of the
governor. ``Among those implicated in the criminal organization is
the state governor, Mario Villanueva, alias `El Chueco.'''
</P>
<P>
   Police commanders were coordinating the drug shipments, the
report says, while the staff chemist at the local office of the
federal attorney general was employed by the traffickers to analyze
the purity of cocaine shipments. One Chetumal merchant was
routinely carrying cash bribes from the drug mafia directly to
Villanueva, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The officer's report identifies the smuggler in charge in the
state as Ramon Alcides Magana. Mexican and U.S. officials say
Magana is a former army lieutenant and federal police officer who
went to work for the powerful trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
as a bodyguard. He was promoted to manage Carrillo Fuentes'
operations in Cancun, shortly before pressure on the traffickers'
air routes prompted them to ship cocaine in speed boats into the
coastal marshes of Quintana Roo from Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva vigorously denied the accusations in the 1997 report,
emphasizing that enforcement of drug laws is a responsibility of
the federal government. ``We don't know what they do or where they
are,'' he said of the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   When he first learned of the report, Villanueva said he flew
immediately to Mexico City to protest his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I demand that you show me the files,'' he said he told
Madrazo, the attorney general. ``If I have something to do with
this, well, then investigate me!''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo took the governor up on his offer. He had the special
prosecutor, Mariano Herran Salvatti, question Villanueva in detail
under oath for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   After that appearance, Villanueva told Mexican newspapers that
both Madrazo and Herran assured him that he had been cleared.
``They told me I was clean,'' he recalled, ``that there was nothing
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herran told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that we could say Villanueva has been
exonerated, because only our investigation can determine that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he has nothing to do with drug trafficking just doesn't
correspond with what's happening.'' Herran continued, ``An
investigation with many lines of inquiry is under way, and at the
right moment the result will be made public.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigations have broadened, the traffickers in
Quintana Roo have grown more brazen.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the last year, officials said, Magana's gunmen
have kidnapped federal drug investigators. But when they made the
mistake of abducting an army lieutenant in a secret
narcotics-intelligence unit, they provoked a blow-torch response.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the kidnapping reached the defense minister, Gen.
Enrique Cervantes, just as the traffickers were starting to torture
the officer for information. According to officials familiar with
the incident, Cervantes flew into a fury. He sent one group of
soldiers, backed by armored personnel carriers, to surround
Magana's Mexico City home, trapping the trafficker's wife inside.
Then he sent three more planeloads of troops to Cancun, where they
started breaking down the doors of the traffickers' mansions.
</P>
<P>
   The raids turned up a trove of documents, Mexican and U.S.
officials said, including messages and notes that suggested that
state police officials had been alerting the traffickers about drug
agents' movements in Quintana Roo. The soldiers also found papers
to a car driven in Magana's escort convoy. It was registered with
the Quintana Roo police and assigned to Oscar Garcia Davila, whom
investigators identified as the leader of the lieutenant's
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Garcia had been hired to command police
operations in Cancun and the northern part of the state only months
after he had been purged from the federal police for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   After the army's June raids in Cancun, federal investigators
announced that they had identified Garcia as Magana's security
chief, and said they had discovered a state police credential
indicating that he was still on active duty. He is now a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, who still refers to Garcia by his first name, says
he knew nothing of his ties to the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know that Oscar was involved in that kind of
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of his six-year term, when most governors are
quietly preparing to retire or positioning themselves for another
job, Villanueva has been unusually busy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he became embroiled in a contretemps with U.S.
diplomats after the U.S. consul in Cancun complained that he had
been threatened by one of the governor's aides for complaining
about official foot-dragging in the investigation of the death of a
U.S. tourist.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Villanueva sent the state congress a package of
constitutional reforms, one of which sought to reduce the period in
which a public servant could be held accountable for crimes
committed during their time in office.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition deputies quickly dubbed it ``the impunity law.''
Faced with the prospect of an embarrassing debate that would focus
on his own political troubles, the governor quietly withdrew the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Another attempt to safeguard his future ended in a noisy
confrontation _ this time with the leaders of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   When Villanueva encouraged several of his closest associates to
seek the PRI's nomination to succeed him as governor, the party's
national leadership blocked their candidacies. After weeks of
infighting, the nomination was finally won in a September primary
by Joaquin Hendricks Diaz, a former army officer who had been seen
as a dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of his governorship does not bode well for
Villanueva. Relations between the two have been cool since 1995,
when Hendricks, as the PRI's state president, displayed an
independent streak that enraged the governor, several members of
the party said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Hendricks noticed plainclothes police officers outside his
home. Then a friend reported that the governor had ordered his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, Hendricks crawled into the trunk of a car and fled
Chetumal with one of his relatives at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the two men reconciled. And after Hendricks won
the PRI nomination this fall, the governor expressed support for
his candidacy. But Villanueva's frustrations with Mexico City
boiled over soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling, late-night speech last month to Quintana Roo's
PRI leaders, he accused both the party's national president,
Mariano Palacios, and its secretary general, Carlos Rojas, for
meddling in the state's affairs. In remarks that made headlines
around the country, he demanded an apology from Palacios and a
resignation from the leader's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas shot right back. Noting that Villanueva had garbled
Hendricks' name in the speech, he insinuated that the governor was
drunk when he delivered it. ``He was not in the best of
conditions,'' Rojas told reporters. Villanueva denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Were prosecutors to recommend bringing charges against
Villanueva, it would pose an agonizing choice for Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the case could weaken his authority. But pursuing it
aggressively might create new turmoil in the PRI just a year before
crucial national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva said he was not worried about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I abide by the law, and if something wrong has been done in my
administration, I'll take responsibility,'' he said. ``If they want
to put me on trial, there are lawyers who can manage things in
courts.''

MANY ARABS SEE DOUBLE STANDARD ON ISRAEL AND IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ From her jewelry shop on a busy street here,
Iman Khalidi is watching the confrontation between Iraq and the
United States with growing frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people in Jordan and across the Arab world, she has
nothing good to say about Saddam Hussein. But she is angry that
Western countries threaten to punish him for defying United Nations
resolutions while, she said, ``they just stand by as Israel does
the very same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely there is a double standard, and it makes us very
angry,'' Ms. Kahlidi said from behind a counter filled with silver
bracelets and earrings. ``When the U.N. demands that Israel
withdraw from occupied territories and Israel refuses, the world
does nothing. But with Saddam, he must do what the U.N. says or he
is bombed. It is so very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent signing of a new accord between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, and the resulting turnover of some occupied
land to Palestinian control, appears to have had little effect on
the widespread perception here that Israel enjoys a form of
international impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell the Arab man on the street that Saddam is a
murderer, he will agree,'' said a longtime adviser to King Hussein
of Jordan who asked not to be identified. ``But he will also ask
you when the United States ever forced Israel to accept a Security
Council resolution. This is what our people think. There is a sense
of injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders concede that they have not fully carried out
Security Council resolutions demanding that they hand more occupied
land back to Arabs and refrain from building settlements on such
land. But they say they cannot do so for security reasons. They say
they their recent handovers show their good faith, and that they
will hand back more land when and if their Palestinian counterparts
show a greater ability to control terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in many Arab countries desperately hope that Saddam
will cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors to head off a U.S.-led
attack. Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia are among nations that have
publicly urged him to do whatever is necessary to satisfy the
inspectors. But while Western powers see inspections as a way to
weaken Iraq, some Arab leaders hope compliance will ultimately free
Iraq of sanctions and allow it to rebuild its conventional military
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Arab countries do not fear Iraq at all,'' said Radwan
Abdulleh, a former dean of political science at Jordan University.
``On the contrary, they want Iraq stronger, so that it can fill the
regional power vacuum. They think Saddam is a dictator and deserves
to be punished. But they want Iraq strong enough to be a balance
against Israel and Turkey and Iran, although of course not so
strong that he can dominate the whole region.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Jordanians believe that air strikes against Iraq would
produce any positive result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Iraqi people who decide whether they want Saddam or
not, and they are capable of toppling him if they decide to,'' a
columnist at a leading Jordanian newspaper wrote earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi opposition groups say that with the millions of dollars
that the United States and Britain have promised them, their
prospects of toppling Saddam are bright.
</P>
<P>
   But many independent analysts of Arab politics are doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These opposition people are very nice, very civilized, but
they don't even talk to each other, much less work together,'' said
a European ambassador based in Amman. ``As for the Arab masses,
they may not sympathize with Saddam but they do sympathize with
Iraq, which they see as a victim of American aggression.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RECALLING RED'S WIT AND MODESTY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an early scrimmage in the Knicks' training camp in the
mid-'60s, the chief scout, Red Holzman, watched one of the rookies
he had scouted _ the team had followed his enthusiastic advice to
draft the player high _ and now anticipated that he would be a
productive member of the team. On the sideline, Scout Holzman
noticed a flaw in the player that he hadn't noticed before. He had
trouble getting through screens on his left. During a break in the
action, Holzman went onto the court to demonstrate to the player
how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look out of the corner of your eye and then fight
through the screen,'' Holzman told the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't look out of the corner of my eye,'' the player said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't?'' Red said, skeptically. ``What's so hard?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blind in the left eye,'' the player said.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman looked around to see if anyone was in earshot. No one
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mere,'' he said, and led the player to a corner of the gym.
Holzman whispered, ``Don't ever tell anyone you can't see, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' the player said.
</P>
<P>
   This story is revealed for the first time, since Holzman, even
some 30 years after the incident, and after enough successful draft
suggestions _ from Willis Reed to Walt Frazier _ and enough
successes as the coach of the Knicks to win two NBA championships
and earn him a place in the Basketball Hall of Fame, even after all
that, was still a little embarrassed about the player, who never
played in the league. But in a relaxed moment at dinner one night
he told the story, with the self-effacement and humor that had
become as much a part of him as was Selma, his wife of over 55
years.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the MSG Network has been broadcasting a half-hour
retrospective on Holzman who, as every basketball _ and perhaps
sports _ fan knows, died on Nov. 13, at age 78, losing a battle to
leukemia. His death came just four months after Selma died.
</P>
<P>
   To say that he missed Selma would be a gross understatement.
Just a week before he died, he attended the wedding of George
Kalinsky, the longtime official photographer at Madison Square
Garden. Holzman had not been feeling well, and Kalinsky called to
inquire after him. ``I'm OK,'' Holzman said. ``But I was thinking
about the gift I gave you and June. I don't know if it was
appropriate. Selma would have done better.''
</P>
<P>
   What made Holzman a successful coach? The reason as I see it,
and I covered the team in its glory years and grew in friendship
with Red after he left coaching in 1982, was that he gave people a
boost, was sensitive and thoughtful of their feelings, left them
with their dignity and even when being critical did so with an
underpinning of humor.
</P>
<P>
   But he could be tough. And many years after he had coached Phil
Jackson, the former Bulls coach called Holzman with condolences
after the death of Selma. Holzman recalled Jackson's saying, surely
recalling his days as a player for Holzman, ``Red, if you need
someone to scream and holler at you, call me any time.''
</P>
<P>
   If a friend hadn't called him in a while, he'd phone the friend.
``Where've you been?'' he asked. He wouldn't put the guy on the
defensive by saying, ``How come you haven't called?'' It was more
like, you must have been lost in the wilds of Borneo and couldn't
get to a phone.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner one night in a restaurant in Madison Square Garden,
the waiter and Holzman greeted each other. ``Is your soup hot
tonight?'' Holzman asked. The waiter said, ``Of course, Mr.
Holzman, absolutely.'' I wondered about that question, never having
heard it before. Then I realized what the coach had done. The soup
wasn't hot the last time he was there, he didn't want to embarrass
the waiter, but wanted to make sure the soup was hot this time.
When the soup arrived, it was piping hot.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, his humor could be wry. Even on his deathbed.
His daughter, Gail Holzman Papelian, recalled that when her father
was admitted to the hospital for the last time two weeks ago, he
was put into a bed in a room with another man. The other man kept
talking and talking. Red turned to Gail, with an irritated nod
toward the man. ``Doesn't miss a detail,'' Holzman said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   I once invited Holzman to lunch with Jackie Mason. Holzman was a
great fan of Mason's. Mason, however, has no interest in any sport
other than boxing. When I introduced the comedian to Holzman, I
said: ``Jackie, this is Red Holzman. He was the brilliant coach of
the Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason looked at Holzman. ``Doesn't look so smart to me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Red loved it. &QL;

<P>
   Many working Americans will pay 8 percent to 20 percent more for
health insurance premiums next year, the sharpest price increases
since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The rises in premiums follow several years of failed efforts by
health maintenance organizations and other managed-care companies
to stem growing medical costs. Chief among those increases are the
costs of prescription drugs, advanced surgical devices and
techniques and services to patients outside hospitals. Cost-cutting
has also been thwarted by legislation in a number of states that
prevent HMOs from restricting patients' access to specialists and
diagnostic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   As costs climbed, health plans for a time had trouble raising
rates significantly because big employers and purchasing groups
beat down their demands and even, in some cases, forced them to
swallow lower premiums. But now, after a wave of mergers,
acquisitions and departures of HMO companies from some communities,
there is less competition _ and the HMOs have found it easier to
raise prices to try to restore profits.
</P>
<P>
   As businesses and organizations from Sears and American Express
and the federal government to law firms and gas stations face
sharply higher premiums, many of them, reluctant to irritate
workers in a tight labor market, are sharing the increases
proportionately with their employees. But others are asking
employees to pay more for out-of-pocket charges or to pay larger
percentages of the premium costs.
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand employees of J. Baker Inc., a retail shoe chain,
will pay 9 percent more in premiums next year, reflecting a 9.2
percent increase, on average, in the company's overall premiums.
Out-of-pocket charges to employees for prescription drugs,
admissions to hospitals and visits to doctors and emergency rooms
will also rise.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Finigan, benefits manager at J. Baker, which is based in
Canton, Mass., said that without the added out-of-pocket charges
for drugs, physicians and hospital care, overall premiums for the
company would have risen 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel Corp., a telecommunications company based in Little Rock,
Ark., will pay 9.6 percent more, on average, to 80 health
maintenance organizations, but the increases will be much steeper
for many of Alltel's 17,000 employees because the company pays only
a set amount for each employee.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel pays about 80 percent of a $497 monthly premium for a
family in an HMO. The company is raising its contribution for the
first time in four years, by 4 percent, said Joe Meyer, manager of
corporate benefit planning. Even so, some employees will pay 31
percent more, or $19.42 more each month.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at other companies may soon face similar increases,
including higher out-of-pocket charges for drugs, visits to doctors
and hospital stays, benefits executives and consultants said. And a
growing number of employers will be transferring even more of the
costs to employees by 2000, said Tom Beauregarde, a principal at
Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some medium-sized employers in Florida with 500 or 600 workers
``are getting killed,'' said Becky Cherney, president of the
Central Florida Health Care Coalition, a group of large employers
in Orlando. Her members have three-year HMO contracts with 3
percent annual increases, but some middle-sized companies are
facing 20 percent increases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Costs are also sharply higher for small businesses, and some are
considering giving up health benefits, which would add to the 43
million Americans who do not have insurance. Neil Caggiano, owner
of the Glen Head Flower Shop in the Long Island community of Glen
Head, N.Y., with nine employees covered, is waiting for notice of
his 1999 rates, which take effect in February. ``If it goes up
more, we may not be able to offer it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two employees at Howes &AMP; Howes, a four-person law firm in
Raritan, N.J., began contributing $10 a week last month. Tim Howes,
one of the partners, said their payments would help cover an
increase of $60 in the firm's monthly premiums. ``We had to switch
to less comprehensive coverage and still pay an increase,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Riverdale Texaco in Morris County, N.J., will face an 11 percent
increase, to $720 a month, to cover the owner, Sal Risalvato, and
two full-time employees. Risalvato joined an HMO offered by Aetna
U.S. Healthcare when his former insurer left the state. ``If we had
taken a comparable policy, the increase would have been 20
percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the biggest companies, the increases have jolted
corporate benefits executives, who fear a return to the fast-rising
health costs of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Government
economists say they expect that the upswing will continue over the
next few years, adding hundreds of billions of dollars to national
health spending. Medical costs are now projected by consultants to
rise 6 percent, more than three times as fast as the annual rate of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While information on next year's premiums is still being
gathered, the trend is already clear. Medical costs are up 6
percent and HMO premiums are rising 8 percent, according to a
survey of 50 of the nation's largest companies and 1,000
medium-sized employers by BT Alex Brown Inc., a Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   Health benefits executives across the country confirmed the
findings in interviews. Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. reported increases for
next year averaging 8 percent to 9 percent, compared with 3 percent
this year, at 200 HMOs that serve 136,000 Sears employees and early
retirees. The company declined to provide an average amount of
employee contributions, saying there were too many variations.
American Express said it would pay 8 percent more, on average, for
33,000 employees in 150 HMOs next year, after paying virtually no
increases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal employees, whose health plan is the nation's largest,
will pay 7.4 percent more, on average, next year. The government
agreed to average increases in premiums of 10.2 percent, the
biggest since 1989. The employees will pay only part of the
increase because the taxpayers are absorbing part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison employees who are union members will pay 8
percent to 9 percent more next year for HMO coverage, under a
three-year contract. Edwin Ortiz, director of employee relations
for the company, said HMO premiums paid by the company were rising
5 percent to 13 percent, compared with 6 percent to 9 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employees Retirement System bargained
rates down in each of the last four years. Now it has agreed to
increases averaging 7.3 percent for 900,000 members, including a
10.75 percent increase for Kaiser Permanente. Thirty-one thousand
state employees who have family coverage from Kaiser, for example,
will pay $18.57 a month. Previously the full premium was covered by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The premium increases have been welcomed on Wall Street, where
most health maintenance organizations have been out of favor with
investors during several years of small or nonexistent profits.
Indeed, by last year, most health maintenance organizations were
losing money, according to Interstudy, a managed care research
center in Minneapolis, and many HMOs are still in precarious
financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised and shocked that the price increases
are coming through,'' said William McKeever, a health care analyst
at Paine Webber Securities, who added that the year 1999 could be
the ``best since 1993'' for HMO profits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In New York, where state approval is required for increases in
HMO premiums that exceed 10 percent, Empire Blue Cross and Blue
Shield recently received approval to raise rates for downstate
employers for a popular health plan by 15.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO industry has benefited from rapid consolidation, which
has left the surviving companies in stronger positions. Sixteen of
the nation's 25 biggest HMOs were swallowed by other managed care
companies in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few national carriers left: Aetna, Cigna,
United Healthcare,'' Ms. Finigan of J. Baker said. ``Because the
number is so limited, they are calling the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pinch is apparent in many places. In Chicago, a group of big
employers asked for bids from 11 local HMOs earlier this year. By
the time the negotiations ended, three had disappeared into mergers
and one had left town.
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of all insured workers now in HMOs or other
types of managed care, there are few opportunities left for
employers to lower costs just by transferring people to managed
care from traditional fee-for-service health plans. That process,
many experts say, was the prime factor in temporarily holding down
costs for employers.
</P>
<P>
   McKeever said managed care insurance was moving into
``underwriting cycles'' of three years of losses followed by three
years of profits, following a pattern in traditional insurance. In
the down cycle, insurers reduced rates to attract new business
until they lost money and ``had to either raise rates or exit the
business,'' he said.

DEMOCRAT HAS HAT IN RING, AND IN HAND, FOR PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Tenn.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Publicly, Vice President Al Gore refuses to
acknowledge the obvious: that he is running for president. Other
Democratic and Republican aspirants are also playing coy about
their designs on the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sen. Paul Wellstone: The liberal Democrat from Minnesota is
so unabashed about his ambitions that he was the first candidate to
establish an ``exploratory committee'' as an initial step for a
White House run. Already, the committee has helped finance
Wellstone's travels as part of his drive to build support.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the committee, the senator recently mailed a solicitation
letter to Democrats around the country _ liberals in particular _
asking them to give up to $750 to his committee. In the letter,
Wellstone, a former political science professor who was elected in
1990 and re-elected six years later, sounds out populist themes for
a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve leadership that comes to grips
with bread-and-butter economic issues and takes on powerful
interests,'' he wrote. ``The American people deserve a foreign
policy that truly reflects our democratic ideals and places human
rights at its center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must learn to strike a new balance with nature, conducting
ourselves as though the Earth is a precious gift we hold in trust
for our children and our children's children,'' the letter
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Wellstone got to the heart of his appeal: ``Our campaign
must be the opposite of cynical,'' he wrote. ``We will organize,
galvanize and energize. So I ask you again: Will you join me?'' He
asks for ``a check for $25, $50, $100 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   While many other presidential contenders insist that they are
still mulling over their decisions _ many are expected to announce
their candidacies early next year _ Wellstone noted that the early
primaries in 2000 and the demands for early fund-raising bring the
campaign season closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nov. 7, 2000, probably seems a long time away to you. (It does
to me!),'' he wrote. ``But the realities of present-day
presidential politics demands that any potential candidate who
relies heavily on grass-roots organizing must get started at the
earliest possible moment. That moment is now!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is widely viewed as the overwhelming early favorite for the
Democratic nomination, especially given his position as vice
president, an extensive fund-raising network at his command, and
the fact that, from top to bottom, the White House is behind his
candidacy. While Wellstone is considered a long shot, he is popular
among liberals and is trying to fashion himself as a force in the
process by being the candidate of the left.
</P>
<P>
   For well over a year, Wellstone has traveled the country, trying
to build support for a populist-style campaign. Routinely, he said,
he asked people two questions related to a presidential run: ``Can
I gather the necessary support? Can I raise enough money to run a
competitive campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he said in the letter, ``My travels during the
past year strongly suggest to me that the answer to both those
questions is `Yes.' For the balance of the year, I am committed to
devoting all the time and energy I can to continue traveling across
America to seek those answers.''

FORMER PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE CONVICTED OF SODOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The Rev. Canaan Banana, the former
president of Zimbabwe, was found guilty of sodomy Thursday by a
court in Harare, Zimbabwe, and faces up to 22 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The dock was empty, though, as the conviction was read. Banana,
62, apparently jumped bail last week and fled to Botswana, where he
is said to have asked for political asylum and then gone into
hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku issued an arrest order, revoked
Banana's bail, which included his deed to a mansion in Harare, and
asked his lawyer to try to persuade him to return for sentencing on
Dec. 10. Prosecutors are to seek extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Banana, a Methodist minister, had denied all the charges,
calling them ``a mortuary of pathological lies'' intended to
destroy his chances of a political comeback.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of 11 counts of sodomy, attempted sodomy and
indecent assault, all involving incidents with young bodyguards,
gardeners and cooks assigned to him when he was president, from
1980 to 1987. The charges grew out of the 1995 murder trial of a
police inspector, Jefta Dube, who killed a colleague. Dube said the
man had taunted him, calling him ``Banana's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 17-day trial in June, several witnesses, including
Dube, described seduction scenes the former president had enacted
with them. They said he had invited them into his library in the
executive mansion to play cards, gave them drinks, put music on and
insisted on teaching them to dance. As they danced, he groped and
propositioned them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   One said he had jumped out a window, another pushed the
president into the swimming pool and fled, and a third shouted so
loud that the first lady came in. Dube testified that his drink was
drugged, and he woke up to find his pants around his ankles. He
testified that he became the president's sex slave from 1984 to
1986.
</P>
<P>
   The topic has presumably been an embarrassment to President
Robert Mugabe, who has been in a public war of words with gay
Zimbabweans for three years, calling them ``worse than pigs or
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and President
Sam Nujoma of Namibia have followed suit and made remarks
derogatory to homosexuals. By contrast, South Africa's Constitution
recognizes gay rights and its sodomy laws were struck down in its
highest court last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has never commented publicly on the trial. Banana's
presidency was largely ceremonial, and Mugabe, prime minister since
independence in 1980, also took over the presidency in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A government-owned newspaper in Harare, quoting unidentified
people in the Botswana government, said Banana had been staying in
the village of Mogoditshane, near Botswana's capital, Gabarone, but
was not around when Botswana police officers went looking for him.

 RETAILERS SAY HOLIDAY-SEASON WORKERS ARE SCARCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year,
was looming across the mall like a dirigible. And with 85 hours to
go, Harris Friedman's sportswear store was already a wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, the place looks kind of shabby,'' said
Friedman of the Footaction U.S.A. store, in the Smith Haven Mall in
Lake Grove. Friedman said that he has so little help this holiday
season that he is forced to spend less time as the store's manager
and more as its locker-room attendant, picking up shoes, fetching
stray laces and folding uniforms. ``We've got the shoppers, but not
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said he had yet to find any acceptable holiday
employees, much less fill in the holes on his full-time roster for
Friday, the day that usually determines if a store will be in the
black _ or in a black hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are lazy. They don't want to work. They dress
terrible. I can't hire them,'' he said, explaining that he would
rather weather the holiday buying blitz with a smaller staff than
with an incompetent one. ``And the older people don't want to work
for six bucks. They want $9 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Asia's economic troubles have sent tremors through
the U.S. economy, retail stores _ particularly in suburban areas _
say they are struggling to find enough workers to staff their
outlets this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   With the lowest unemployment since the Vietnam War era and
better-paying jobs in other industries creating an especially taut
labor market, merchants say that as Christmas looms, they cannot
find enough people to take temporary jobs _ even when they pay a
premium over the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers, that could mean longer lines at checkout counters,
fewer sales workers to answer their questions and overworked
employees short on holiday cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a problem with the retail industry for the past few
years, but this year, it's the worst,'' said Rick Church, a retail
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional holiday workers _ young people, homemakers and
retirees _ are passing on the seasonal jobs available in the
nation's malls. So to try to lure workers, managers are coming up
with novel incentives like theater tickets, signing bonuses and
even retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever, we held a job fair this year,'' said
Terry Katula, marketing manager of Woodbridge Center Mall, in
Woodbridge, N.J. ``There's a lot of competition for jobs. People
have lots of choices, and retail is a very demanding field. It's
hard to find labor, let alone good labor.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who live in the affluent shadows of the shopping
complexes, the idea of a $7-an-hour job during the holiday season
is less palatable than a hand-me-down fruitcake.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Fortenza, 17, watched as the N-24 bus from New York City
arrived at Roosevelt Field, the gargantuan shopping mall in Garden
City on Long Island, where it dispatched a stream of passengers
heading to work at the mall. Fortenza, a high school student from
Valley Stream, said that although he once was an eager Christmas
season worker, this year was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sticking no feet in no shoes or frying burgers for six
bucks an hour, period,'' he said last week. ``Why should I? My
dad's doing all right.''
</P>
<P>
   How much an attitude like his will hurt the retail industry
remains to be seen. A seven-year economic expansion, an annual
inflation rate of less than 2 percent and a national unemployment
rate of 4.6 percent are all expected to bolster sales during the
holiday season, which can account for as much as half of a
retailer's annual profit. But that boom has a flip side, and a
scarcity of workers may cut into the bare-bones profits of
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question may be how shoppers react to a smaller
sales staff and less attention paid to them.
</P>
<P>
   In megamalls like Roosevelt Field _ 106 acres of glass and
marble and tile _ finding that perfect size 9 in chartreuse this
season may be as difficult as finding your car in the mammoth
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The malls need valets, and they need sales assistants,'' said
Bruce Van Kleeck, the vice president of the National Retail
Federation, an industry trade group. ``Staffing is a major issue
nationwide. The suburban areas don't have the labor pools.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice the reluctant would-be worker, Macy's is offering a 20
percent merchandise discount through January for seasonal help who
stay through Dec. 24 as well as a $300 completion bonus for sales
associates, said Linda Martin, a vice president for human resources
with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Those bonuses, however, are regional; workers in Nassau and
Suffolk counties on Long Island will get them because unemployment
rates are at an all-time low, 2.6 percent in Nassau and 3 percent
in Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in New York City, where unemployment hovers around 8
percent, will get no bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is generally easier to staff the New York stores,'' Ms.
Martin explained. ``But in some regions there is a lot of
competition, and because we seek a better caliber of people, it is
necessary to come up with unique methods of attracting potential
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vibrant job market is starting to filter down
to more traditionally depressed parts of the economy, soaking up
workers in the inner city. Victor Resis, 22, who lives in New York
City, was happy to take a job in the suburbs, despite the commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no work in New York City,'' he said after an hourlong
ride from the Jamaica bus terminal in Queens to his new $7-an-hour
stock job at Macy's in Roosevelt Field. ``You do what you have to
do to work. That's life. You have to make a living.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The big department-store chains have also taken to advertising
in college newspapers and on movie screens. If the labor market
gets too tight, Macy's may consider busing workers into
understaffed stores.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers' skittishness is palpable. In the suburban malls,
application displays compete with merchandise space. The sales
staff is encouraged to ask shoppers to apply. There are
theater-ticket giveaways, bonuses for employees who sign up their
relatives and friends, and even 401(k) plans to attract
part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palisades Center mall in West Nyack, ``help wanted''
signs hang in the windows of the large department stores, including
Filene's, as well as in the smaller mom-and-pop stores.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Steransak, the owner of Legends &AMP; Heroes, a sports
memorabilia shop, said the lack of workers has forced him to raise
the hourly salary he pays to $6.50 or $7 an hour from the minimum
wage of $5.15. Still, he said, he cannot find good help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever pays the most they go to,'' Steransak said, referring
to teen-age workers. ``They just switch jobs a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Steransak is looking forward to mid-December, when college
students come home on break.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to work,'' he said. ``They only have a short time,
and they want to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, he may be able to stop working 12-hour days.
Unfortunately, by then the holiday season will be almost over.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Cutrone, manager for Laura's Hallmark, at the Palisades
Center, said the store has raised the wages it pays to $6.50 an
hour and begun offering 401(k)s to part-timers in an effort to
attract employees. So far, she is happy to report, the strategy has
worked. Hiring for the holiday season began in October, and the
store is now almost fully staffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky,'' Ms. Cutrone said. ``Maybe it's that people who
come here want to work at a Hallmark's.'' Or maybe it's the promise
of early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Other shopkeepers said they were worried that the lack of help
could turn customers off.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Smith, 25, the assistant manager at the Body Shop in

EDITORIAL: A PRECOOKED PRIMARY SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Calif., N.H., Texas, Tenn., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 27: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is not yet halfway through his second term,
but many party regulars believe the race for the presidential
nominations in the year 2000 is already over, and that only an
unexpected political tsunami could keep Al Gore and George W. Bush
from being the winners. Their positions on the issues and success
as campaigners are obviously part of the reason. But another is the
tactical importance of an accelerated schedule of presidential
primaries, which will require enormous sums of money and name
recognition during the first few weeks of the election season.
</P>
<P>
   States have been racing to get their primaries at the front of
the calendar to enhance their impact on the nominating process.
California and New York will hold their elections on March 7 in
2000, as will most of New England. Legislatures in other states,
including New Jersey, are considering joining that pack. Eight
Western states are planning to hold a ``Big Sky'' primary the
following Saturday. Unless something changes, the nominations will
be decided over one long, expensive late-winter week.
</P>
<P>
   This is a recipe for voter alienation _ a rush of primaries that
are over before the electorate has even begun to think about the
presidential race, followed by a seven-month campaign between the
two winners. Front-loading the election season will make the
grass-roots contest in New Hampshire meaningless, since a
dark-horse candidate who wins there would have no chance of
surviving the big bicoastal primaries two weeks later. But the
primary crunch could lead to more reliance on the unrepresentative,
easily manipulated straw polls that state parties will begin
holding in 1999, well before primary season. The already battered
campaign finance system will take yet another lump, since public
matching funds for the presidential campaign are not distributed
until rather late in the primary season. The real decisions on
nominations will be made while candidates are still waiting for the
first check.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grossman, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
told a recent meeting of secretaries of state that he regarded
decline in voter participation as a ``threat to the future of
democracy.'' But in the same speech, he declined to make any
attempt to stop the pileup of early primaries in 2000. Grossman
claimed that there was no time to develop a new system before the
states submit their final plans in May.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics within the Democratic party believe the DNC's lack of
interest in the problem may have something to do with the fact that
the present schedule will help Gore. But right now, only the
National Association of Secretaries of State has shown any real
concern about the primary problem. The association has proposed a
system of regional primaries spaced out through the election
season, with the order rotating from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman is right that such a change would be far too
complicated to put into effect for 2000. But the two parties could
simply agree to push their entire primary season back by a month or
more. The date for the first post-New Hampshire primaries could be
moved from the first Tuesday in March to the first Tuesday in April
or May. That would please candidates for state and local offices,
who generally dislike being forced to begin their campaigns so
early. More important, it would give the public a decent amount of
time to get to know the candidates and consider their platforms. If
the parties want to see more voters participate in the process,
they must mold the process in a way that makes it easier for the
public to get involved.

 WASHINGTON: their recommendations. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, whom Republicans have
chosen to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker, has not ruled out a
censure vote, but has suggested it might be more fitting in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, is actively
fighting any attempt to bring a censure resolution to the floor.
DeLay believes that by denying wavering lawmakers an alternative to
impeachment, fence-sitters will be pressured to vote against the
president or explain to their constituents why they let him off
scot-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a difficult road to bring a censure vote to the
House floor,'' said Michael Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida, the newly chosen fifth-ranking
House Republican, expressed strong reservations about a rebuke:
``How do you censure the president one week, and the next week have
him give the State of the Union or order the bombing of Iraq, when
you're rallying support for him?''
</P>
<P>
   With a majority of Americans opposed to impeaching Clinton, but
favoring some sort of reprimand, Democrats and some Republicans
warn that blocking a censure vote could backfire on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a political mistake for the majority party to be
seen as thwarting the clear will of the people, that Congress
admonish the President,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, a Virginia
Democrat on the judiciary committee.
</P>
<P>
   And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say that to be
effective, impeachment or censure needs to be bipartisan. ``We
certainly don't want this to appear to be a partisan lynching,''
said Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top lieutenants have signaled his willingness to
accept censure, saying he would be open to a ``serious and
reasonable'' compromise. Cabinet officers, including Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, a former Democratic Congressman from New
Mexico and former representative to the United Nations, have been
sounding out moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I had any advice,'' Rep. Christopher Shays, a
Connecticut Republican who opposes impeachment and censure, said
about his recent conversation with Richardson. ``I told him the
president should tell the truth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What a censure resolution would look like is unclear. McHale's
four-paragraph proposal is a searing condemnation of Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky and their efforts to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stronger than many Democrats would like to see, but
strong enough for Republicans to feel that the president's conduct
has been sufficiently condemned,'' said McHale.
</P>
<P>
   Some censure proponents have proposed fining Clinton or
requiring him to stand on the House floor and accept his
punishment. Support for these ideas appears thin. A fine would
require Clinton's consent to avoid constitutional hurdles, and many
lawmakers fear bringing Clinton to the floor for a scolding would
demean the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Among the roughly 100 Republicans who oppose censure there are
various factions. Some, like Shays, say a reprimand would set a
dangerous precedent. ``To censure or rebuke would open the door to
censure of the week, censure of the month,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of lawmakers cites the testimony from scholars
that censuring Clinton has no basis in the Constitution. ``The
Constitution establishes a process to deal with the misconduct of
the president,'' said Representative Charles T. Canady, R.-Fla.
``Impeach or not, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the judiciary committee, where there is virtually no support
among Republicans for a rebuke after or instead of an impeachment
vote, some Republicans say the committee's almost certain approval
of at least one impeachment article would be penalty enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the committee reports out a resolution, and it fails to
pass on the House floor, I believe he's still been censured,'' said
Rep. George W. Gekas, a Pennsylvania Republican on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, in particular, are pressing for censure as a way
to vent their anger at Clinton and preserve their integrity in the
history books. There are also electoral considerations. House
Democrats did not fare as well with older women voters in the
mid-term elections as they have in the past, and party leaders
believe a rebuke would help shore up support with that important
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some punishment,'' said Rep. Charles E.
Schumer, a New York Democrat on the committee who was elected to
the Senate in November. ``I don't want my children or grandchildren
reading in the history books that someone lied under oath, which I
think the president did, and was not rebuked for it in some way.''

is clearly injurious to my career. What can I do? Columnist Ilana

 Employee appreciation can be shown in creative ways  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Mark Kindelberger is one of the few people in the world whose
teenage son coveted his ``employee of the month'' award. Perhaps
that's because the award wasn't a gold watch or a wooden plaque.
</P>
<P>
   It was the use of a new royal-blue VW Bug for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really nice perk,'' said Kindelberger, who works at
an Emeryville software firm called Extensity. ``Except for the fact
that when I took it home, my 18-year-old son snagged the keys and
we had to share it.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of companies like Extensity are experimenting
with creative new ways to reward their employees that go far beyond
the traditional cash bonus, wristwatch, plaque or trip to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   They're also extending performance rewards beyond their sales
forces _ to divisions like finance or customer service that rarely
were eligible for such incentives in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace experts say there are a couple of reasons for this
trend. With unemployment at 4.6 percent nationally and below 4
percent in most of the Bay Area, companies are scrambling for ways
to hold on to their best workers. At the same time, they are
reluctant to give outright raises that would permanently inflate
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? More employers are adopting one-time rewards to
motivate workers without permanently increasing the personnel
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two percent of employers now offer some kind of variable
pay plan, up from 47 percent in 1990, according to Hewitt
Associates. Employers now spend 7.8 percent of their payroll
budgets on rewards and incentives, up from 4.2 percent in 1990. A
few examples from around the Bay Area:
</P>
<P>
   _Autodesk sales manager David Nevin rewards customer service
people who work with his team by giving them gift certificates for
massages at an on-site health club.
</P>
<P>
   _PeopleSoft has a division that hands out seven hats each
quarter to the seven employees who embody the firm's core values.
One value is ``fun'' _ and the employee chosen in that category
gets a Cat-in-the-Hat-style hat.
</P>
<P>
   _Drake Beam Morin, the outplacement firm, gives every employee
10 ``pride'' cards. Each employee hands out the cards to other
colleagues who they believe have gone above and beyond the call of
duty. When someone accumulates eight cards, the company buys him or
her a $100 dinner for two.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional cash bonuses are still the most common form of
performance reward, followed by company-sponsored travel. Stock
options are also popular, especially in high-tech companies. But
compensation experts suggest that employers offering offbeat or
personalized rewards get more bang for their buck than those
offering a plain-vanilla cash bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zany stuff creates energy and creates a story _ a
multiplier effect,'' said Bob Nelson, author of the book ``1001
Ways to Reward Employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash is here today, gone tomorrow,'' said Peter Edmunds,
director of the New York Premium Incentive Show, a showcase for
different reward and incentive vendors. ``You don't tell the
neighbors, `My husband or wife got a $5,000 bonus.' But you sure as
heck tell them, `We're going to wine country because we won this
award.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies manage to deliver traditional cash rewards in
unusual ways.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Valley Homes, a Sacramento-area builder of prefabricated
homes, wanted to thank a manager who had put in seven-day weeks
getting a new production line started. So when the conveyor belt
for the new line started rolling, it carried a spring-loaded flag
with an envelope holding a $500 check.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also are putting new twists on travel incentives _
sending star employees on kayaking trips, hot air balloon flights
and daylong programs that let them pretend to be fighter pilots or
race car drivers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Having a Ball in Paris
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems last year took 3,500 of its top hardware
salespeople and their spouses to Paris for a week _ filling six
hotels and taking over the entire Palace of Versailles for a masked
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a logistics nightmare, but how often do you get to go
to a masked ball at Versailles?'' said Katherine Fox-Ehlert, who
manages Sun's contracts for meetings and special events.
</P>
<P>
   Not all good reward programs need to be anywhere near as costly
as Sun's Parisian extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Take PeopleSoft's hat program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they gave you a piece of paper as an award, you'd go back
to your office and no one would remember it,'' said Tracy Martin,
an analyst in the division that has the hat program. ``But people
put the hats on display in their office, and you think, `This
person was nominated by their peers. Next quarter it could be me.'
It's a nice reminder of what this organization is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Heart
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kouzes, a Palo Alto management consultant, has seen a lot of
rewards in his time. But the most meaningful was one that didn't
cost a penny _ a thank-you note from a boss to a worker's son.
</P>
<P>
   The note concluded: ``If your dad is as good a father as he is
at his job, you've got one fine dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This employee had gotten other rewards that cost a lot more,
but that's the one I've heard him talk about over and over,'' said
Kouzes, co-author of the forthcoming book ``Encouraging the Heart:
A Leader's Guide to Encouraging and Recognizing Others.''
</P>
<P>
   Unique, Yet Cost-Effective
</P>
<P>
   At Extensity, managers settled on the VW Bug award after looking
for something unique that wouldn't blow the budget of their
75-person firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first considered stuff that is fairly common, like dinner
for two or a weekend away, but we wanted to do something with a
signature to it _ with some cachet,'' said Elizabeth Ireland, vice
president of marketing. ``We're a startup with a financial
responsibility to our investors, so giving people a Ferrari or
Lamborghini was out of the question. We thought, `How about a
Bug?'''
</P>
<P>
   Extensity employees nominate each other for the award.
Kindelberger won in October after closing a major deal with the
University of California, the company's biggest client to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Bug has definitely generated a positive buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it in the hallway,'' said Kindelberger. ``No
one's to the point of lobbying to be the employee of the month, but
you think, `Maybe I'll be the one.' It's tangible, visible, and
it's fun. It's much better than the old idea of a ``president's
club'' award that is only open to salespeople, and that eliminates
half the company.''

TAR HEEL GUARD STEPS UP PASSING, SCORING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when Ed Cota was a scoring machine. He would
penetrate and finish with dazzling layups, and make jump shots from
all over the court. More than a few observers said Cota, who
averaged 31 points at Tilden High School in Brooklyn and 21 points
at St. Thomas More Academy in Montville, Conn., could not be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cota, a highly recruited prep all-American, enrolled at
North Carolina _ and was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when my scoring average went way down,'' Cota said with
a laugh, moments after scoring 11 points Wednesday in ninth-ranked
North Carolina's 54-47 victory over Purdue at Madison Square
Garden. ``I used to score a lot before I came to Carolina, but when
my scoring average went down it wasn't a problem because I just
like winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Now more Mark Jackson than Isiah Thomas, Cota is perhaps better
at directing an offense than anyone else in the country. On Friday
night he will bark calls, make assists and try to control the
game's tempo in the hope of leading the Tar Heels (5-0) to a
victory over No. 3 Stanford (4-0) in the championship game of the
Chase Preseason National Invitation Tournament. St. John's (3-1)
will face Purdue (4-1) in the consolation game.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Cota play, it is easy to see why Magic Johnson is
one of the athletes he most admires. At 6 feet 1 inch, Cota is 8
inches shorter than Johnson, but he possesses the same love of
teamwork and unselfishness that made the former Los Angeles Lakers
star so special. That quality makes Cota, who was raised in the
East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, stand out among today's
shoot-first, pass-second point guards.
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons with the Tar Heels, Cota, a junior, has placed
his name atop the North Carolina assists list, which includes Phil
Ford and Kenny Smith. The Atlantic Coast Conference assists leader
the past two years, Cota has a career average of 7.3 a game,
dwarfing the Tar Heels' next highest mark _ 6.1, by Ford. His 7.4
average last season was a school single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   Cota's love for passing is obvious this season. He
understandably averaged only 8 points as a freshman and sophomore,
because Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter, who were selected fourth
and fifth, respectively, in the NBA draft in June, did most of the
Tar Heels' shooting and scoring. But with graduation and the draft
taking their toll on the roster, Cota came into this season as the
club's leading returning scorer.
</P>
<P>
   It was thought that he would have to increase his scoring
dramatically for the Tar Heels to remain among the nation's elite
teams, but with two freshmen and a previously little-used sophomore
in the starting five, Cota has chosen to lift North Carolina the
way he always has _ via the pass.
</P>
<P>
   While his average has risen to 11.4 points a game, Cota enters
Friday's game as North Carolina's third-leading scorer this season
(behind center Brendan Haywood's 14.4 points a game and forward
Ademola Okulaja's 11.6). And despite not having a big scorer on the
club, Cota is averaging 9.2 assists a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game's not going to change,'' Cota said. ``I'm going to
still do what I'm capable of doing out there _ get everybody
involved and score at the times when I have to. I'm not looking to
come into the game saying, `I'm going to score 20,' or anything
like that. Whatever the defense gives me, I'll take. And as long as
we win, that's all that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   With a young, inexperienced team, Cota and Tar Heel Coach Bill
Guthridge admitted there would be nights when Cota would have to
step out of his traditional point guard mode and revert to taking
opponents to the hoop. When that time comes, Cota will be ready.
``I know that in the future I'm going to have to score more,'' he
said. ``And that won't be a problem.''

BLAIR STAMPS IRISH SPEECH WITH HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Judging by the reception he received here, you'd have
thought Tony Blair was captain of the All-Ireland hurling team.
</P>
<P>
   But all he is, really, is the British prime minister, and
Thursday he became the first one to speak to the Irish parliament,
which was created 80 years ago in defiance of the government Blair
now heads.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dail, Ireland's lower house, was formed as the
country's provisional government, the Irish were at war with the
British. But Blair's Thursdaystate visit underscored just how much
the relationship between these ancient enemies has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish gave Blair the opportunity to make history, and a
standing ovation, in gratitude for his efforts to promote peace in
Northern Ireland. Blair thanked them and said it was time to move
the relationship beyond one defined by ancient animosities.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Dail and the Seanad, the upper house of the
Oireachtas, or parliament, crammed into the small, U-shaped
chambers of Leinster House to hear Blair say, ``Ireland is in my
blood.'' Some of the parliament members sat on the royal blue
carpeted stairs, the only thing royal in Leinster House.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said his mother was born above her grandmother's hardware
shop in Ballyshannon, County Donegal. As a boy, he spent summer
vacations in Donegal, until the Troubles exploded in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was there in the seas off the Irish coast that I learnt to
swim, there that my father took me to my first pub, a remote little
house in the country, for a Guinness, a taste I've never forgotten
and which is always a pleasure to repeat,'' Blair said. ``Like it
or not, we, the British and the Irish, are irredeemably linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the upbeat nature of the Thursdayevent, Blair and his
host and Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, conceded that the peace
process is stalled. The main hurdles are the refusal of
paramilitary groups to surrender their weapons and the refusal of
Protestant unionists to allow members of Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political wing, to sit in the local government
until there is arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process is at a difficult juncture,'' Blair said.
``Progress is being made, but slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair cautioned against cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not underestimate how far we have come, and let us
agree that we have come too far to go back now,'' he said, to one
of several bursts of applause. ``Politics is replacing violence as
the way people do business. The Good Friday Agreement,
overwhelmingly endorsed by the people on both sides of the border,
holds out the prospect of a peaceful, long-term future for Northern
Ireland and the whole island of Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he gets letters from ``the victims of violence asking
why we are freeing terrorist prisoners. It is a tough question but
my answer is clear: The agreement would never have come about if we
had not tackled the issue of prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Blair's willingness to swallow such unpalatable
issues as early releases for paramilitary prisoners that set him
apart from previous British leaders, who could neither politically
nor personally stomach appeasing people they consider terrorists.
Blair is much admired in Ireland for his pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is time for Ireland, which has the most vibrant
economy in Europe, ``and a Britain emerging from its post-empire
malaise'' to form a closer alliance, especially on matters of trade
and European integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down through the centuries,'' he said, ``Ireland and Britain
have inflicted too much pain, each on the other. But now, the UK
and Ireland as two modern countries, we can try to put our
histories behind us, try to forgive and forget those age-old
enmities. We have both grown up. A new generation is in power in
each country.
</P>
<P>
   ``After keeping us apart for so long, Northern Ireland is now
helping to bring us closer together. But I do not believe Northern
Ireland can or should any longer define the relationship between
us. Our common interests, what we can achieve together go much,
much wider than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair was giving voice to what has become obvious in other ways:
Ireland and Britain never have been closer, nor more intermingled.
Britain is Ireland's biggest trading partner, and Ireland is
Britain's fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Six million first-, second-, and third-generation Irish people
live in Britain, more than 10 percent of the population. Several
members of the Irish national soccer team were raised in Britain
and speak with English accents. Irish playwrights are everywhere in
the London theater scene. Many of the most popular pop bands in
Britain _ U2, the Corrs, Boyzone, and Bwitched _ are Irish.
</P>
<P>
   His speech brought a long standing ovation from Irish parliament
members. Also applauding were some of the most influential Irish
politicians in recent years, including former premiers John Bruton
and Albert Reynolds, Nobel laureate John Hume, and even the Sinn
Fein leader, Gerry Adams, who nonetheless criticized Blair for
focusing too narrowly on the issue of weapons in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, was happy to see him. As Blair's
limousine left Leinster House, it drove past a small knot of
fundamentalist nationalists who believe all of Ireland's ills can
be traced to British colonialism, the last vestiges of which they
see in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them held a sign that said, ``British Withdrawal For a
Real Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As he drove by, Blair waved to them. They didn't wave back.

 Making Sure a Former Employer Isn't Bad-Mouthing You  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm a fairly senior manager who was laid off because of
downsizing and budget cuts three months ago. I received a severance
payment and outplacement help but have been unable to find work. I
recently began to suspect that the company was bad-mouthing me to
prospective employers. After a little arm-twisting, someone inside
the company confirmed that I was let go because my department
``wasn't making enough of a contribution.'' This was the first time
I'd ever heard this, and it is clearly injurious to my career. What
can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Your company told you that your termination was due to
budget reasons _ and that's the message they should be giving to
prospective employers, too.
</P>
<P>
   You should start out by diplomatically reminding the company of
this, according to San Francisco career consultant Charles Prugh.
</P>
<P>
   Call up your former manager. Mention politely that you're
worried you may have lost some job opportunities because of
negative rumors coming from somewhere within the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't confront or threaten him,'' Prugh said. ``Just ask him
to confirm that the company is simply giving out the facts: that
your termination was due to downsizing.''
</P>
<P>
   You may want to follow up with a similar call to the human
resources department. And if the bad-mouthing continues, you might
hire a lawyer to send a similar note in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Then get on with your main challenge: finding that new job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outplacement help, you may not be marketing yourself
as well as you should. Consider hiring a career counselor who's
familiar with your industry and its requirements. Don't rule out
interim or part-time positions: They could lead to permanent work.
</P>
<P>
   Get some support by joining a group like Forty Plus, a
job-seeking club for older workers that can be reached at (510)
430-2400. Broaden your network: Take an active part in local
professional associations or Internet discussion groups focused on
your industry.
</P>
<P>
   And take heart in the fact you're not alone: It's not at all
unusual for someone at a high managerial level to spend six months
or more looking for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I applied for a job and the company made me undergo a drug
test. My test came back negative, but the company declined to hire
me. Isn't it illegal for a company to make you take a drug test
before they've offered you a job? Shouldn't they pay me for the
time involved? And can I recover any damages from the company?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whoa, Nellie! You've got a bunch of mistaken ideas running
loose here. Let's rein them in:
</P>
<P>
   _It's completely legal for companies to ask job applicants to
take a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   _Companies don't have to pay you for taking a drug test, since
you're not yet an employee doing actual work for them. Think about
it: You don't get paid for time spent in a job interview, so why
should you get paid for time in a drug test?
</P>
<P>
   _Nobody's violated your rights here, so there aren't any damages
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there may be an understandable basis for some of your
confusion. Although there are no laws barring pre-employment drug
tests, there are laws against making job applicants undergo medical
exams.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to prevent discrimination against people with
health problems, the American with Disabilities Act says that
companies can't require medical exams of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   But companies do have the right to ask applicants to take a
medical test once they've been offered a job _ as long as the test
is related to their job duties and is required of all new employees
in that same job category.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I'm working as a temp and am unsure of my overtime rights.
Suppose I work more than 40 hours a week for a single temp agency,
but on two different job assignments. Am I entitled to overtime
pay? And how much overtime pay should I receive if the two client
companies each paid me a different hourly rate?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may have two different assignments, but you have just one
employer _ the temp agency. So if you clock more than 40 hours a
week for that agency, you should receive overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime pay is set by state and federal law at 1.5 times your
regular hourly rate of pay.
</P>
<P>
   What if you get several different rates of pay within one week?
</P>
<P>
   ``If two different rates are being paid, we would average those
rates,'' said Tom Grogan, assistant chief of the California
Department of Labor Standards Enforcement, which enforces state
wage and hour laws.
</P>
<P>
   So if you put in 20 hours of work at $10 an hour and 20 hours at
$14 an hour, your average hourly pay would amount to $12. And
overtime would come to 1.5 times $12, or $18 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   CORRECTION: Last week, I stated that companies don't have a
right to order employees to take their vacation at a particular
time. In fact, companies  &LR; do  &LR; have that right, according to Tom
Grogan, assistant chief of the California Division of Labor
Standards Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a common-sense perspective, I wouldn't overly restrict
when people must take vacation,'' Grogan said. ``But legally,
companies have the right to do that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Want to find some fun new ways to thank your high-performing
employees? But can't afford to give them an all-expense-paid
vacation to Bora Bora? Here are some ideas for unique but low-cost
employee rewards, from ``1001 Ways to Reward Employees'' by Bob
Nelson:
</P>
<P>
   _Give the person a two-hour lunch _ and pay for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   _Rent a sports car for a week for your star employee to drive.
</P>
<P>
   _Write five Post-It notes thanking someone for a job well done,
and hide them among the work on his or her desk.
</P>
<P>
   _Name a space after an employee. (The Suzy Jones Corridor, for
instance.)
</P>
<P>
   _Have a catering service bring lunch to an employee for a week.
</P>
<P>
   _Pay an employee's parking fees for a month.
</P>
<P>
   _Bake a batch of chocolate chip cookies for an employee or team.
</P>
<P>
   _Contribute to an employee's favorite charity.
</P>
<P>
   _Redecorate the employee's office with a design scheme of his or
her choice.
</P>
<P>
   _Buy an employee something from his or her favorite catalog.
</P>
<P>
   _Give the employee a three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _Volunteer to do an employee's least desirable task for a day.
</P>
<P>
   _Wash an employee's car in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   _Cover the person's desk with balloons.
</P>
<P>
   _Create a ``Good Tries'' booklet to recognize people whose
innovations didn't pay off. Be sure to include what was learned
from the project, so others can benefit.

VIKINGS USE FAST-BREAK OFFENSE TO TOP COWBOYS 46-36 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In the early 1990s, the Dallas Cowboys built a Super
Bowl championship team around a cadre of offensive stars _ a shifty
running back, a sure-handed possession receiver, a poised
quarterback _ plus a massive and powerful offensive line and a
punishing defense.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive philosophy embraced all the conventional notions
of pro football _ ball control and a balanced attack, with
substance over style.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings blew into Texas Stadium on Thursday with
an offense that turns most of those notions on their head.
</P>
<P>
   Ball control. Forget about it. Why not score on possessions of
three minutes or less if you can score five or more touchdowns a
game? Possession receivers. Yeah, right. If the possession is at
the end of a 50-yard heave and culminates with a point-after
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new millennium. And what better way to usher in
the new era than having a wonderful receiver like Randy Moss, who
turns every reception into a day at the circus and the Fourth of
July combined. Moss caught three passes Thursday and all three were
for touchdowns of more than 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cris Carter added a 54-yard touchdown reception and Leroy Hoard
had a 50-yard touchdown run as the Vikings strutted their stuff and
beat the Cowboys, 46-36, before a crowd of 64,366.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings (11-1) moved closer to sewing up the National
Football Conference Central Division, and home-field advantage
throughout the playoffs. The Cowboys (8-4) now know what they have
to look forward to if they meet the Vikings in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated matchup of the afternoon _ between Dallas'
brilliant cornerback, Deion Sanders, and Minnesota's sensational
rookie receiver, Moss _ never materialized because Sanders was
starring in his own version of ``My Left Foot.'' It's the story of
a fleet-footed National Football League cornerback with a badly
sprained big toe on his left foot that prevents him from running.
</P>
<P>
   Without Sanders, Moss put on his own show, a rousing version of
``Showboat.'' After one quarter, Moss had caught two passes for 107
yards and two touchdowns, with a 54-yard touchdown reception by
Carter sandwiched between them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moss' first touchdown reception came on a 51-yard pass from
quarterback Randall Cunningham off a flea-flicker play. Moss'
second one was on a 56-yard pass from Cunningham. It gave Moss 958
yards for the season, the most receiving yards by a Viking rookie
since Sammy White had 906 in 1976. The touchdown also put the
Vikings ahead by 21-6 with 2 minutes 41 seconds to play in the
first quarter. The Vikings looked like a runaway train.
</P>
<P>
   But then came a slight derailment. The Vikings, who entered the
game averaging 31.6 points a game, lost one component of their
high-powered offense in the second quarter when Robert Smith
sprained his right knee and did not return. Without the threat of
Smith in the backfield, the Vikings' offense lost some steam.
</P>
<P>
   It was a temporary setback. The Cowboys were able to deploy some
well-timed blitzes, putting extra pressure on Cunningham and
slowing the Vikings in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings also hurt themselves on foolish penalties during big
returns on special teams in the first half. They were penalized
twice, for 166 yards, on two returns by David Palmer _ one wiped
out a 90-yard touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cowboys' receivers were afflicted with a severe
case of the drops, not holding on to six catches they should have
made in the first half. Michael Irvin, normally a sure-handed
receiver, dropped two passes and looked completely out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys displayed their own big-play capability with a
67-yard touchdown pass from Troy Aikman to receiver Patrick
Jeffers, but the 2-point conversion failed. After a 45-yard field
goal by Gary Anderson with 16 seconds to play in the half,
Minnesota took a 24-12 lead into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys opened the second half with an 11-play, 76-yard
drive that was capped by a 2-yard run by Emmitt Smith, who passed
Jim Brown on the NFL career rushing list during the game, to help
make it 24-19 Vikings. The Cowboys had taken a slow, measured
approach to crawl back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But on Minnesota's first possession of the third quarter, the
Vikings went back into quick-strike mode, throwing deep to Moss and
getting a pass-interference call against Dallas safety Kenny
Wheaton, who was caught with a handful of Moss' jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-yard play gave Minnesota the ball at the Cowboys' 12 and,
on the next play, Hoard, who replaced Robert Smith, ran the ball in
for a touchdown. Moss caught a pass for the 2-point conversion, and
the Vikings were ahead by 32-19 with less than a quarter and a half
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys blew a great opportunity late in the third quarter
after Izell Reese intercepted a Cunningham pass and returned it to
the Vikings' 32. The Cowboy offense moved the ball to the 17, and
there was nearly a first-and-goal from the 7 after a pass from
Aikman to receiver Billy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But the play was wiped out when Dallas guard Flozell Adams was
penalized for a chop block. The 15-yard penalty moved the ball to
the 32-yard line, and Dallas wound up settling for a 48-yard field
goal by Richie Cunningham that made it 32-22.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings made the Cowboys pay for that underachievement on
the next possession, when Cunningham and Moss hooked up again. This
time it was a 56-yard touchdown pass play that helped make it 39-22
near the end of the third quarter. The Cowboys were running out of
time, but it did not matter, because they could not keep pace with
the Vikings' fast-break offensive attack. &QL;

KXTA SHTICKS IT TO BIG JOE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Joe McDonnell slid slowly down in a booth
Tuesday night at his favorite restaurant, Trani's. He couldn't seem
to decide whether he was too angry to talk about the decision last
week by KXTA-AM (1150) program director Mike Thompson to take him
off the air or so relieved he doesn't have to worry about his job
status at the station any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm baffled,'' McDonnell said finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell me I was doing a bad job. I was never given any
indication of that. All I can figure is he had a preconception of
me as a reporter and journalist _ and I won't disavow that _ but he
wanted pure shticks. And I'm not going to be that way because
people who do that have no substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier, Thompson waddled out onto Weyburn Avenue in
front of Blimpies sandwich shop in Westwood where McDonnell had
just finished doing a remote show in preparation for Saturday's
UCLA-USC game. As McDonnell put equipment away in his trunk,
Thompson told Los Angeles' most recognized and respected
sports-talk host that he decided the station would eat the rest of
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the mustard.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, getting a clear read on why this happened is
about as murky as the Arbitron ratings used to measure listener
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Not once during the four hours Thompson took over the airwaves
Monday and fielded calls from genuinely heartbroken callers during
McDonnell's regular 3-to-7-p.m. slot was a palatable answer given.
Instead of explaining how something like Karl Malone's two-hour
publicity stunt continues while someone like McDonnell was
expendable, the mantra Thompson delivered to at least the 50
callers who got through was the same: ``It was a business decision.
. . . We're taking the station to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings couldn't have mattered much to Thompson. The latest
numbers that the station shows its advertisers indicate that
McDonnell has been among the leaders citywide in keeping listeners
and increasing his quarter-hour rating with the all-important men
25-54 demographic during that four-hour afternoon period.
</P>
<P>
   So is that a level-headed decision?
</P>
<P>
   On his own Web site _ thebignasty.com _ McDonnell has been
quiet. A brief note in ``Joe's Views'' thanks his listeners for
their support. He writes that as soon as his contract is settled,
he'll be back to tell us ``exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that four days after quotes from him in the Daily News
indicated he felt his job was somewhat secure while the station
underwent a lineup facelift, McDonnell said Thompson told him the
decision to buy out his contract was expedited by that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with them firing me,'' said McDonnell, who
has worked at eight stations in L.A. since 1975. ``But it was one
of the most classless things he (Thompson) could do _ fire me in
the middle of the street while I'm at my car. Why was it so urgent
to do it right then? Why couldn't they treat me like a human being?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I asked if I could at least record a message _ just 20
seconds _ to thank the listeners on the air. He wouldn't even let
me do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said he felt ``kind of embarrassed'' but also pleased
by those who phoned the station Monday to express their
disappointment. He said he's received about 200 e-mails a day since
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the response was enough that station manager Roy
Laughlin, playing the good-cop role, phoned McDonnell Wednesday
morning and put an offer back on the table _ McDonnell can have the
10 p.m.-to-1 a.m. slot, left vacant by Ben Maller and Dave Smith's
pending move to the 1-to-3 slot when Malone's courtship with Vic
Jacobs ends.
</P>
<P>
   If McDonnell takes it _ and there's no reason to believe he will
_ it'd be an incredible change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've distanced myself already,'' he said Tuesday. ``As much as
I want to work in L.A., and it doesn't have to be in sports talk, I
wonder how long I want to keep doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending Thanksgiving with his relatives in La Habra,
McDonnell said he plans to just ``get out of town and take a long
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future of sports-talk in L.A.:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have questions about the direction of the station,''
McDonnell said. ``L.A. has always been a different market. If this
station turns out to be successful, great, because L.A. needs it.
But with what they're doing . . . I just have my doubts.'' &QL; 
NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting McDonnell's weekday afternoon spot starting Monday
will be Newy Scruggs, the KCOP-Channel 13 sports anchor and guest
host for Jim Rome's syndicated radio show, and Dan Denholm, who has
worked in radio and TV in Cleveland the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   The two have met. Once.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the morning team of John Ireland and Steve Mason,
the station's highest-paid employees, are expected to announce
their departure effective mid-December rather than stay on at a
reduced salary. Their stand-by replacement stands to be Brian
Whitman, Rick Dees' sidekick on Jacor sister-station KIIS-FM, with
some sort of support team.
</P>
<P>
   And when Malone's 1-to-3 show eventually suffocates itself,
Jacobs will take a cut in pay and a cut in hours, going back to
news reading and acting as a human promotional toy for Thompson to
send out on errands.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Jacobs to the news crew will likely mean the departure of
Jeff Biggs in another cost-cutting move. &QL; 
PARTING SHOT
</P>
<P>
   Psst . . . looking for the hands-down best team an all-sports
L.A. station could ever hope to want? Track down Steve Edwards and
Eric Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before Disney's purchase and subsequent contract
slashing, KABC-AM (790) had that duo in its drive-time slot drawing
ratings that a station like KXTA could only dream of today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's got to be a better spot to allow Brian Golden

FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS TO BE QUERIED ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee plans to call retired
military officers to testify about the potentially damaging effect
of President Clinton's behavior on the military code of conduct and
the Pentagon's ability to prosecute soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Tuesday, which will include testimony from judges as
well as people convicted of perjury, is intended to explore the
issue of ``double standards'' as the panel tries to make the case
that failure to punish the president for his actions in attempting
to cover up an affair with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky could
subvert the legal system, according to spokesmen for Republicans on
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with high-ranking former military officers indicate
that while a united front may be presented by the panel's witnesses
Tuesday, opinion is deeply divided about whether the impeachment
inquiry against Clinton has affected his standing as commander in
chief or the morale of the troops. Former officers are also divided
about whether the case has had any impact on the military's ability
to enforce a code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the military are bound by a rigid code of conduct and
a system of courts-martial that is separate from civilian law.
Defenders of the system say its rigidity is designed to keep and
maintain a high level of trust and order in the context of
life-and-death decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said: ``People in the
military are under a different set of codes that apply specifically
to people in uniform, so I'm not sure that the comparison is
particularly apt.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and congressional Democrats denounced the
committee hearing as a partisan ploy. And some retired officers
reacted with outrage, condemning the judiciary panel for involving
the military in politics and putting its leaders in the spotlight
where their comments could publicly undermine the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an abomination to draw the military leadership,
retired or not, into this contest,'' said retired Army major
general William Nash, a visiting lecturer at Harvard's Shorenstein
Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. ``It's obscene to draw
the military into a political battle. After all, impeachment is not
a legal but a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it was crucial for the military to weigh in on the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commander in chief sets the tone for the military,'' said
retired colonel Robert Maginnis, who runs a military readiness
project for the Family Research Council, a conservative religious
group. ``He has his finger on the button, and if he is cavalier
about the truth, it undermines trust.''
</P>
<P>
   By law, active military personnel are not allowed to speak out
against the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of ``double standards'' and sinking morale have
been raised in the context of high-profile military prosecutions,
particularly the case of Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, an Air Force pilot
forced out of the military last year for having an affair with a
married officer and lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   And the announcement this week of the Judiciary Committee
hearing coincided with news reports that the Navy had charged Rear
Admiral John T. Scudi with adultery, obstruction of justice, and
lying about two suspected affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation makes it harder for local level commanders
to maintain order and command, because the backdrop is that the
commander in chief isn't obeying our standards,'' said Mike
Breslin, a former instructor at the Air Force Non-Commissioned
Officers Leadership school in Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But many Pentagon officials and retired military officers said
the president is not bound by the code of conduct, and military
personnel understand that their commanders and the president
operate by different rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is members of the military aren't elected, and
they voluntarily decided to join and submit to a code of conduct,''
said Jeffrey Whitman, who served in the Army and is now an ethics
professor at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. ``The
president may be commander in chief, but he's not in the military.
There is no double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 67 adultery cases against military personnel
conducted during the Clinton administration, according to Jonathan
Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School. Sex
scandals in the military so dominated the headlines that Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen ordered a review and a tightening of the
military's code of conduct this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is an easy target, but in my opinion what really
troubles soldiers is the double standard that allows senior
officers to get away with murder while junior enlisted members get
prosecuted with zeal,'' said Scott Kisch, a retired captain in the
Marine Corps who now lives in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Christopher Pearson of Georgia's Army National Guard
said, ``At the end of the day, we're expected to do our jobs
without being affected by events not directly related to our
mission.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: THE PERCEPTION AND REALITY OF KEYSHAWN JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turkeys, 250 of them, were being given to school kids the other
day in the Bronx. Keyshawn Johnson had bought them and was
distributing them, showing his giving side. The calm, mature, quiet
side. A rare time when he allows others to grab center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Back in January during Super Bowl festivities in San Diego,
Johnson threw a club party heavily attended by some of the National
Football League's biggest stars. The party was for his youth
foundation, Key's Kids, based in Los Angeles, his hometown. Derrick
Thomas was there. So were Jerome Bettis and Bruce Smith and so many
others, an NFL star in every corner of the room. The music grooved.
The lights dimmed. The crowd inside, more than 500, celebrated. The
crowd outside, more than 500 in line, waited.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, some of the very peers who attended and smiled in his
face, would mock the event and him. It went this way: ``Key's
party? It was OK. Key? So hungry for attention. He thinks he's a
great player already and look what he's done. Next to nothing. He
likes the hype. But really, that's all Key is _ hype.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a sampling of the banter after Johnson's good deed. It
is the kind of talk that follows after an unflattering deed. After
a good game. After a bad game. It is the kind of stuff that follows
Keyshawn Johnson everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those thoughts come from people his friend on the Jets,
Chris Hayes, calls ``haters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haters, haters, and they come in all forms,'' Hayes said of
his term for what others call ``player haters'' _ guys who dislike
guys they in reality envy. ``Haters are going to be haters,'' Hayes
said. ``Anyone that truly knows Key separates perception from
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Now really, that's the crux of it with Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Perception. Reality.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they intertwine and become hopelessly muddled.
</P>
<P>
   Perception says he is all ``I,'' not a fiber of being a team
player in him. Totally interested in getting the ball, catching
passes, setting records at wide receiver, setting more records
after that, winning adulation, endorsements, movie roles, Hollywood
and on and on and on. All Keyshawn.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, though, is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   He is a newer-age Deion Sanders, offensive to some, difficult to
ignore, and as a football player, capable of backing up whatever he
barks.
</P>
<P>
   And that is one reason he strikes such a stinging chord with so
many. Turns out, he is often right.
</P>
<P>
   Listen:
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm in the heart, reaching hearts when I do
charity, that's all that matters to me,'' Johnson said before
practice on Wednesday as the Jets prepared for Sunday's visit from
the Carolina Panthers. ``When people say black athlete, inner-city
athlete, Generation X athlete, we know what that means. From the
streets to the game is what they are saying. But that is only part
of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``My success now _ I am more than a Rolex and a Ferrari. And you
will not understand me if you don't try and get to know me and get
a feel for who I am. If you don't, you end up just blinded by who
you're dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a household of 17, two families in one, and there
were nine women in all, strong black women. They taught me to be a
king. I think of myself that way, and that is the way I think of
myself as a football player _ and that is where the bad perceptions
from many come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a team player _ but I am an individual first. I am going
to shine. I know that I have electricity. My electricity can make
everyone soar. I want the football. I want to block. I want to win.
I want to do it all and I can. And I have to be the No. 1 guy with
the football. Not No. 2 or No. 3. It's like a company, a business;
I can't be a vice-president. I've got to be president. If I'm not
the No. 1 guy, I'm no good to you. That's who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a dart board. A bull's-eye. He is an easy target because
he is so eager, so confident, so hungry to succeed and to shine and
say so. Others see that and say calm down. Sit down. Shut up. And
they toss darts his way. They shoot arrows.
</P>
<P>
   If only Keyshawn could keep all of that attitude inside. Speak
softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, my mother taught me to speak my mind and to tell the
truth,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   And that the truth is the light of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'm gonna say what's on my mind,'' he said. ``Coach
Parcells understands that. He's the same way. I think he wants more
players like that, who will stand up and who will back it up and
make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   It is starting to come together for Johnson now. A breakout game
last week against Tennessee and a breakout season are setting the
stage. Center stage, for him.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the American Football Conference in touchdown catches
with eight; the last Jet to lead the AFC in touchdown receptions
was Wesley Walker with 12, and that was 12 years ago. And did you
know that Johnson through 41 games has one more catch than Jerry
Rice did through his first 41?
</P>
<P>
   It is his size (6 feet 3 inches, 212 pounds). His hands. His
speed. His improved routes, his fluid moves. His heart. His
courage. His desire. His attitude.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real thing. Attitude. Johnson has so much of it, and
it is still developing. He is still developing. He is 26. This is
his third pro season. He is just hitting his stride. He has yet to
become what he will be.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that so many, some even close, some only a few lockers
down from his, do not understand him. Don't know him. Don't care
much for his style. Wish he would sit down. Shut up.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets must have known what they were getting when they
drafted Keyshawn Johnson with the overall No. 1 pick of the 1996
draft. He did not try to hustle them. He has not tried to hustle
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shoot from the hip,'' Johnson said. ``A lot of people live
in a fictitious world. I speak reality.''
</P>
<P>
   His reality. He is the socket. He is telling us, his teammates,
his coaches, Jets fans, everyone, to stick their plugs in snugly
and get a jolt of his electricity. He has enough to charge us all,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Are we willing to dare try?

BALLOONS REINED IN, BUT PARADE-GOERS RAINED ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rain poured down in buckets, a third of the giant
balloons had to be withdrawn for technical problems, and
overhanging the whole affair was the stark memory of a terrible
accident last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade managed to strut two and
a half miles down Broadway on a cold, soggy, sometimes blustery
day, bringing smiles to the faces of children and a festive
beginning to the city's holiday season. The 72nd annual parade
brought together a dozen marching bands, 12 giant balloons and 18
floats to entertain an enthusiastic crowd, although four of the
balloons never made it past the starting point.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was smaller than the usual 2 million, a Macy's
official said, but how much smaller was not clear. Departing from
past practice, the Police Department did not provide an estimate of
the crowd and referred the question to Macy's, which could not
answer it. Officer John Seidl, a police spokesman, would not say
why the police had declined to provide an estimate, as they did in
last week's ticker-tape parade honoring John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The gray day was marked by shivering majorettes smiling almost
defiantly; giggling little boys perched on fathers' shoulders;
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani waving enthusiastically at marchers as he
stood and watched the parade at West 76th Street; occasional gusts
of wind strong enough to rip umbrellas apart, and robust cheers for
the Yankees manager Joe Torre and the pitcher David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extraordinary parade,'' said Ronnie Taffet, Macy's
vice president for public relations, noting that the Santa Claus
float, the last in the parade, arrived at Herald Square at almost
the exact moment when the sun peeped through the clouds.
``Everything was just perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Many watchers agreed. ``We're having a great time,'' said Beth
Davenport of Manhattan, a pediatric nurse watching the parade with
a group. ``If we stayed at home all day, it wouldn't have been so
special.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were not so pleased. ``Don't ask me if I had a good
time,'' said Joe Amaral, a construction worker from Ludlow, Mass.
``My brother-in-law made me come out in the rain. I'm soaking wet.
I bought a $6 umbrella and it fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the weather was obviously uncontrollable, parade
organizers seemed to have left little else to chance. This year the
city and Macy's instituted tough new rules and procedures to lessen
the chance of an accident like last year's, when the Cat in the Hat
balloon _ driven by fierce winds _ escaped from its handlers and
slammed into a lamppost, knocking off its horizontal arm.
</P>
<P>
   The falling lamppost arm struck Kathleen Caronna, 34, of
Manhattan in the skull and knocked her to the ground. She spent
nearly a month in a coma and suffered brain damage; she has sued
Macy's, the manufacturer of the lamppost and the city for $395
million.
</P>
<P>
   The cautious approach was evident in a decision to remove three
giant balloons before the parade even began, because a chamber in
each had leaked helium during the night. Those balloons were
Garfield, Spiderman and the Quik Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth balloon, Wild Thing, based on a character from the
Maurice Sendak children's story ``Where the Wild Things Are,'' was
removed after it struck a tree at Central Park West and West 77th
Street, the parade's starting point.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Wild Thing left only eight giant balloons in the
parade, seven fewer than the total number that have flown in some
previous parades. Earlier this year, five balloons were permanently
retired because they were too big, too awkward or, in the case of
Cat in the Hat, ``inappropriate,'' as a Macy's spokesman put it.
Macy's maintains a stable of 25 balloons that it rotates in and out
of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wild Thing, two other giant balloons were
introduced this year: Babe, a cinematic pig, and Dexter, a cartoon
boy genius.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new rules require that balloons be withdrawn from the
parade if sustained winds exceed a speed of 23 mph or if gusts
exceed 34 mph. Thursday's wind speeds never reached those limits.
</P>
<P>
   But Macy's and city officials had agreed, before the parade
began, to fly the balloons at a lower-than-usual altitude, making
them less susceptible to sudden wind shifts. Some occasionally
dipped as low as 4 or 5 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Some parade watchers objected to this change. ``The balloons
were too low,'' said Dillon De Young of Westhampton. ``They looked
too overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Others found it an improvement. ``We were able to see them
better because they were lower,'' said Maurice McGrath of the
Bronx. ``It was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other procedures were changed to enhance safety. The big
balloons were guided by up to 60 trained handlers each, 20 more
than last year. The 12 largest balloons had utility vehicles as
anchors and technicians with meters to check wind speeds at each
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Along the parade route, lampposts were rotated so that the
armatures would not jut into the street, trees were drastically
trimmed and stoplights were pivoted out of the way. And for the
first time, all handlers had to have passed a physical-fitness
test.
</P>
<P>
   There was also an enormous police contingent, with an officer
stationed approximately every 10 feet along the parade route. Some
parade watchers found this irksome. A CBS parade commentator
complained that the officers were preventing her from interviewing
people.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Sankey of Harrison said the officers were more interested
in keeping their areas clear of people than in ``getting us to see
the parade.'' She said, ``It was so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the police were helpful. ``They could have been
mean and rude, but they were nice,'' said Fred Mitchell, a tourist
from Heber Springs, Ark. ``They were fun. They told many jokes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the parade began at 9 a.m. at the south end of the American
Museum of Natural History, the announcer said, ``Let's have a
parade!'' But the memory of last year's accident hung heavily and
inescapably. ``I'm just scared,'' said Christine Arias, who lives
in New Hyde Park and was one of Babe's handlers. ``I don't want
anyone to get hurt. I just want a happy parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Caronna and her husband, Massimo, and their
19-month-old son did not attend this year's parade, said their
lawyer, John Q. Kelly. They were visiting Massimo Caronna's family
in Italy. Kelly said his client's recovery is far from complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a day-to-day battle,'' he said. ``Some days she'll take a
step forward and some days she'll take two steps back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that when Ms. Caronna returned home from the hospital
in February, the family ate the Thanksgiving dinner that Massimo
Caronna had put in the freezer after the accident. He said she had
never read her son ``The Cat in the Hat,'' the Dr. Seuss book she
had bought just a week before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The weather defined Thursday's parade. Although the National
Weather Service said just 0.59 of an inch of rain had fallen in
Central Park during the three hours it took marchers to complete
the route, the precipitation never let up, and at times it pounded
down hard.
</P>
<P>
   Near the parade's beginning, at West 64th Street and Central
Park West, grim-faced parents were towing confused, sopping-wet
children away from the crowd toward Columbus Avenue even as the
low-flying and much-beloved Big Bird sailed serenely behind their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   But many professed not to mind the rain, and a few even said
they welcomed it. ``A beautiful sunny day would be nothing,'' said
Ron, a handler for the Garfield balloon who declined to give his
complete name. ``This is a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Another parade worker also looked on the bright side. ``The rain
is good luck,'' said Sabrina Serio, a balloon handler from the
Bronx. ``It means the parade is going to go well.''

PROBLEMS FORESEEN WITH INSTANT CHECKS ON GUN BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Rifle Association got its number one
wish this year from Congress: a provision forbidding the FBI from
charging gun buyers a fee for new ``instant'' background checks
mandated by the 1993 Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, law enforcement officials said, is that the no-fee
policy threatens to sabotage the five-year, $250 million effort to
computerize background checks. The FBI is set to launch the second
phase of the Brady law Monday, at the height of hunting season and
the Christmas rush, when millions of guns are sold around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Financial jeopardy and bad timing are two of the many potential
problems with the instant system, which replaces the five-day
waiting period and subjects buyers of all guns to the law.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone _ gun-control advocates, the industry, even the FBI _
fears that the switch to a computerized system could be a
technological nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates don't like the fact that there won't be a
five-day waiting period. They say the waiting allows for
more-thorough background checks and a ``cooling off'' period for
individuals likely to commit a crime of passion.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how ``instant'' the check will be, not even the man
at the helm, Jim Kessler, section chief of the FBI's National
Instant Check System. Kessler said he is confident 6.8 million gun
sales can be checked annually by the system, which will tap into
several databases and be staffed by 500 people 17 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But with thousands of calls coming into his shop each day _ or
each hour on weekends _ he concedes that he can't be sure.
</P>
<P>
   And Kessler is worried that the project is underfinanced. A
proposed $10 fee for gun buyers would have covered the $91 million
cost of background checks. But after Senator Bob Smith, Republican
of New Hampshire, attached an amendment forbidding the charge to
this fall's mammoth budget bill, Congress appropriated only $42
million for the checks. There is no money to pay for court clerks
who may have to hunt down information, and no money to pay the 16
states that had agreed to continue running background checks for
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Since learning they could not charge a fee, Kessler said, some
of the big gun-sales states such as Florida and Georgia are
threatening to stop checking.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kessler testified before Congress against Smith's
proposal to kill the fee. ``I said then that my biggest fear is
that we would lose the point-of-contact states at the last
minute,'' he testified, ``and that's exactly what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, who with his staff has been working overtime for months
to create the system, said it is designed to handle only 6.8
million checks annually. It is anybody's guess, he said, how many
more millions of checks the FBI would have to perform if these big
states don't perform the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler has spent the past few weeks ``begging these states to
hang on until December,'' through the holiday crunch. ``I'm
completely confident as long as we don't lose them, but if we do,
it would slow the system down incredibly.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the fault of the gun industry, said Richard Feldman,
president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms
trade association. The group, like the NRA, thought the fee was a
veiled attack on the industry and an unfair burden on low-income
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was going to have to pay for the checks, and now we
all have to pay,'' he said. ``It is in every taxpayer's interest to
keep guns out of hands of criminals, and not just the concern of
gun owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Feldman said the industry is worried that if the system
slows, sales will be hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No dealer I know of has received any final or specific
instruction on how to go about the new procedure or what number to
call ... so I can't imagine we're not going to be slowed down,''
said Ralph Demicco, owner of Riley's Sports Shop in Hooksett, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Demicco said he supports the attempt to keep guns out of the
hands of criminals, but because of inaccurate or unreadable
records, some of his New England clients have unfairly failed the
Brady-mandated background check. He fears more glitches await.
</P>
<P>
   The instant check is designed to work this way: Gun retailers
call the FBI's instant check center, which routes the call to
Kessler's staff. The staff then runs the name of the buyer through
the agency's databases. Eighty percent of all checks are expected
to be cleared with a ``proceed'' response, 2 percent will be
``denied,'' and the remainder will be ``delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has three days to find the information needed to decide
whether the individual is mentally ill or a convicted felon,
fugitive, illegal alien, or domestic-violence abuser. The FBI will
be relying on state and county employees to help them track down
local records.
</P>
<P>
   If after three days, the resolution of the case is still
unclear, the FBI has no choice but to give the green light. Kessler
hopes gun retailers will choose not to sell the weapon in those
cases.
</P>
<P>
   What would be ideal, Kessler said, is to have the states do the
check themselves, but most _ including Massachusetts _ have opted
to rely on the FBI. Checks done locally are much more effective and
reliable, he said, because local officials understand how to read
their own records.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are instances when states would give a `deny' and we'd
give a `proceed' because they have records we don't,'' Kessler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear is how the centralized national system will pull
together all the databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds great,'' said Tom Diaz, a policy analyst at the
Washington-based Violence Policy Center, ``but instant check is
premised on a computer in the sky that doesn't exist.''

GERONTOLOGY NOTEBOOK: PARADOXES A MAJOR THEME AT AGING SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Minn., Ark., Ohio, N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Robert Kane, a physician and gerontologist from
the University of Minnesota, was talking about one of the paradoxes
of modern aging: ``Here we are, spending megabucks to understand
the genome, but at the end of the 20th century, we still don't have
a basic system of care that responds to chronic disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can study these tiny molecules, and rearrange them to
change the nature of life itself,'' Kane added. ``But we can't come
up with a health care system that really responds to what people
need.''
</P>
<P>
   He was among the 3,000 gerontologists who gathered here this
week for the annual conference of the Gerontological Society of
America. They included anthropologists, economists, psychologists,
nurses, philosophers and social workers. They discussed everything
from broad policy issues involving Medicare, Social Security and
long-term care to Alzheimer's disease to Milton's blindness as a
metaphor for aging.
</P>
<P>
   MOST NURSING HOMES LACK NURSING AND HOME
</P>
<P>
   With the meeting's theme, ``The Changing Contexts of Aging:
Opportunities and Challenges in the New Millennium,'' there was
plenty of discussion of paradoxes.
</P>
<P>
   In one session, Kane, 59, pointed out that the term nursing home
is a misnomer. The vast majority of nursing homes in this country
provide neither a homelike environment nor good nursing care, he
said. The average nursing home resident receives about 70 minutes a
day of actual hands-on care, mostly from aides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nursing home was not something we ever set out to
invent,'' Kane said in an interview. ``We just backed into it. We
need to find new approaches to care, to require services to be
brought to people in places where they live. You've got to start
with the person. Once you do that, all these artificial mechanisms
developed by payment mechanisms disappear. Most of our health care
is defined by payment, not by people's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Wiener, an expert on long-term care from the Urban
Institute in Washington, also raised the issue of payment. Without
additional public resources for long-term care, he said in a
session on policies on aging, the costs will become intolerable for
most people, especially those who are middle-income.
</P>
<P>
   In the same session, Robert Binstock, professor of aging, health
and society at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said
that essential policy changes involving Medicare and Social
Security would be politically feasible, despite the conventional
wisdom. It is projected that under current law the annual deficit
under Medicare alone will be $370 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Binstock dismissed what he called ``The Third Rail Myth: Touch
Social Security and you're dead.'' He pointed out that Ronald
Reagan was a major advocate for reducing Social Security benefits
in his first term, and that older voters gave him a larger majority
in his second campaign than in his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are just as diverse in their voting behavior as
younger people,'' Binstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the Medicare and Social Security programs can be made
to raise revenue and reduce costs, he added, ``without any
politicians suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   GERIATRIC NURSES RECOGNIZED WITH AWARD
</P>
<P>
   It was a gratifying conference year for geriatrics nurses. The
Gerontological Society, in partnership with the John A. Hartford
Institute for Geriatric Nursing of New York University, gave the
first Doris Schwartz award for outstanding contributions in
gerontological nursing research to Cornelia Beck, a professor of
gerontological nursing at the University of Arkansas, for her
research on elderly people who have cognitive problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, who is 85 and lives in Folkways Lifecare Community
in Pennsylvania, came to the conference in her wheelchair to
present the award. In the 1950s, Ms. Schwartz conducted the first
geriatric nursing research on chronic illness in aging.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in the number of older patients and the
shortage of doctors trained in geriatrics, more geriatric care will
be delivered by nurses, said Terry Fulmer, a registered nurse and
co-director of the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing. Of
60,000 nurse practitioners in the country, 10 percent are trained
in geriatrics, she said. ``We're finding they're very cost
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   A NARRATIVE APPROACH TO END-OF-LIFE DECISIONS
</P>
<P>
   The conference featured hundreds of workshops and sessions,
including highly technical ones on such topics as the ``Role of
Telomeres in Cell Senescence,'' and ``Do Genes Regulating Apoptosis
Contribute to Longevity in Humans?''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Moody, the director of the Brookdale Institute on Aging at
Hunter College in New York and a philosopher of aging, talked about
Charles Dickens and the novel he died before finishing, ``The
Mystery of Edwin Drood.'' Just as readers have to decide for
themselves who killed Edwin Drood, Moody suggested, people need
narrative approaches to help them make decisions about the end of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to help people complete the story of their lives,'' he
said, ``to think about life as a story that we're making up as we
go along.'' If a person is unconscious or demented or otherwise
unable to make decisions about medical procedures, Moody added, it
falls to relatives or other surrogates to complete the story. ``We
have to think, `Hey, what would the person want if I knew something
about their history,' '' he said. ``We have to help them tell the
story, whether they can speak out loud or not.''

A CELLIST RETUNES, RECALLING ANOTHER  
 STAND-UP COMIC FOR BLUE-BLOOD SET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 18-year-old cellist DANIEL LEE had to work for
his supper on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a supper at Le Cirque 2000, the restaurant on Madison
Avenue near 50th Street. (``It was, like, spectacular,'' he said.)
The guests had just attended a screening of ``Hilary and Jackie,''
a documentary based on HILARY DU PRE'S book about her life with her
sister, the cellist Jacqueline du Pre.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Jacqueline du Pre is one of Lee's idols. He knows
about her marriage to the conductor DANIEL BARENBOIM and her death
in 1987 as a result of multiple sclerosis. He has studied with her
teacher in London, WILLIAM PLEETH.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd arrived from the screening. Lee, a student at the
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia who had played with the
New York Chamber Symphony in Avery Fisher Hall the night before,
was introduced to the pianist BYRON JANIS. The guest who really
seemed to captivate him, however, was the supermodel IRINA.
</P>
<P>
   Lee sat down to play. Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just watched a movie about Jacqueline du Pre and it
talked about how in one of her performances, a string broke or the
peg that was holding it in place slipped,'' Lee said. ``The same
thing happened to me right there. I had to stand up and say I had
to retune my cello.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, and the second time around, everything went fine. But
then he complained _ politely _ that he had not been invited to the
film, only the dinner. No problem. He was quickly asked back, to a
screening next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee is a busy guy, and he had to say no. He has to take an
exam on Tuesday. He needs the study time.
</P>
<P>
   Stand-Up Comic for Blue-Blood Set
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ BROOKE ASTOR is many things: a nonagenarian (she is
96); a doyenne of philanthropy with an exuberant, single-minded
concern for New York City; one of the people for whom PETER
JENNINGS will take a night off. (He did so this month to escort her
to a book party that began at about the time he is usually saying
good night from his anchor chair.)
</P>
<P>
   And she is something of a stand-up comedian in the blue-blood
set.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner last week for directors of the Edith Wharton
Restoration Society, she stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before various Scribners and Auchinclosses, as well as
the honorary chairwoman of the event, H.S.H. PRINCESS ISABELLE of
Liechtenstein, Mrs. Astor talked about the importance of dogs (a
passion she shared with her old friend Mrs. Wharton).
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people in this room could say they knew Edith
Wharton?'' she asked, requesting a show of hands.
</P>
<P>
   Hers went up, but not many others.
</P>
<P>
   Then she apologized for being somewhat tired after a trip to see
a friend, LADY HATFIELD, in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear friend Lady Hatfield is rather cheap,'' she told the
crowd. ``She turns all the lights out at 10 p.m.'' This happened
when Mrs. Astor was taking a late-night stroll on the grounds of
the estate where Lady Hatfield lives. It turned into an all-night
stroll: She could not see the way back to the main house until
after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Brooke Astor was a scream,'' said LETITIA BALDRIGE,
using a word her etiquette books might not advise using in a
thank-you note.

   BIG BLUE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE FEET
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Kent Graham did not approach his pro debut on
Thanksgiving with cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   They were blue.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had dyed Graham's feet blue in practice the week before
the game, putting a colorless powder in Graham's socks and shoes
that turns blue when combined with any kind of moisture, like
perspiration. Although the dye is harmless, it takes about a week
to wear off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was raining that day in practice and my feet really got
soaked,'' Graham said Wednesday at Giants Stadium. ``Apparently,
there was blue stuff seeping out of my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was forced into the lineup against the Cowboys that day
in 1992 because of injuries to the Giants' two top quarterbacks,
Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil and Hoss were just looking at my feet and laughing,''
Graham said. ``I didn't get it and I didn't even notice until after
practice when I took my shoes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `What's this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Graham suspects that the wide receivers coach at the time,
George Sefcik, put the blue dye in his socks.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a trick that Graham found offensive, it's one he's
learned from.
</P>
<P>
   This year at the Giants' training camp, the rookie quarterback
Ben Anderson showed up one day with a case of blue feet.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone pointed the finger at Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, with a wide grin, Graham said: ``I don't know how his
feet turned blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue feet or not, Graham's National Football League debut did
not go well. The Cowboys were on the verge of their first Super
Bowl season under Coach Jimmy Johnson. On Thanksgiving Day in
Dallas they blitzed Graham _ and his eventual replacement Dave
Brown _ all day in a 30-3 rout. Graham completed 12 of 28 passes
for 151 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long time ago,'' Graham said today when asked what he
remembered about the day _ besides having blue feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being nervous,'' he said. ``I remember that I
almost threw up in the tunnel before the game. It was a dream come
true, starting on Thanksgiving on national TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham gets another shot on national television as the Giants'
starting quarterback Monday night in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more comfortable about it than I was six years
ago,'' said Graham, who has since started 18 other NFL games for
the Giants and Arizona Cardinals. ``But I'm just as excited to have
an opportunity on national television. I'm going to go out there
and attack the defense and I'm going to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, he may check carefully this week before putting
on his socks.
</P>
<P>
   RICE WANTS THE BALL
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci and 49ers quarterback Steve
Young made little of the controversy spawned by Jerry Rice's
complaints last weekend that he wasn't getting enough passes thrown
his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where he was venting,'' Mariucci said of
Rice, who is leading the National Football Conference with 61
receptions. ``He's got such high standards. But it's not an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters on a conference call, Young said: ``I
respect Jerry because his work ethic is so unbelievable. He works
for the ball, he deserves the ball. It's not that hard to throw the
ball to Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had trouble having enough balls in this offense.
It's very difficult to get it around to enough people when you only
have one ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was asked if he sent Rice flowers this week as he is
depicted doing in a popular television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that was a one-shot deal,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   STRAHAN AND HILLIARD HURTING
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive end Michael Strahan did not practice Thursday
because of back stiffness. Wide receiver Ike Hilliard, who sprained
his right ankle in Wednesday's practice, also sat out. &QL;

COMMENTARY: CHIEF CARVER AT FEAST OF FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Wohl learned everything he knows about carving
turkeys from his brother, Stanley, who used to run a deli. ``The
trick,'' Bernie said, ``is not to slice the meat off the bird. What
you do is take the entire breast off the bone first, then slice it
on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   There he was Thursday on another Thanksgiving, slicing away with
the sang-froid of a veteran counterman. Poor birds. One after
another, they disappeared, dozens of them even before the first
guests showed up, taking their seats at long rows of tables, just
in time for Wohl to emerge from the kitchen to say how sorry he was
to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish in many ways that we didn't have to have this dinner
here today,'' he told them.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't being rude, merely hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   His guests, well over 1,000, were a battalion from New York's
vast army of the homeless. On yet another Thanksgiving, they
shuffled down a flight of steps for a holiday meal at the Goddard
Riverside Community Center, on Columbus Avenue near West 88th
Street. Wohl, 68, has presided there as chief carver and executive
director for a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it was different.
</P>
<P>
   This was his last Thanksgiving as head of Goddard Riverside, one
of the larger social-services agencies in the city, operating more
than 500 low-income housing units and running an assortment of
programs for the elderly, the young and the homeless. Next week he
formally passes the reins to his deputy, Stephan Russo, and starts
a new life writing and lecturing on the mysteries and agonies of
settlement houses in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, though, was about his guests. Wouldn't it be
wonderful, he said before turkey dinners were laid before them, if
they had families and homes of their own to go to? ``But that,'' he
added wistfully, ``is not the way the world works.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the way the world works is that it leaves its unpleasant
chores to people like Wohl, who became something of an institution
on Manhattan's Upper West Side, mixing kindness with bluster,
concern with relentlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants the homeless anymore. Most New Yorkers, when they
are being honest with themselves, wish these people would just go
somewhere _ anywhere _ else.
</P>
<P>
   But this is one army that is not about to decamp, no matter how
much the city government tries sweeping it to remote corners so the
tourists won't stumble across it as they leave their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, Wohl said, is ``to see if we can help people come
back into the world.'' And it can be done, he told a group of men
and women who showed up on Wednesday at St. Ignatius Episcopal
Church, on West 87th Street, for a pre-Thanksgiving meal sponsored
by a Goddard Riverside program for the homeless called The Other
Place. ``There are so many stereotypes about homeless people,'' he
said, ``and that's what they are _ stereotypes. You're more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wohl made it his task to convince his Upper West Side
neighbors that they, too, are better than they may realize. West
Siders like to think of themselves as models of progressiveness.
``These are the West Siders who pride themselves on not being East
Siders, on celebrating the diversity of their neighborhood,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early '80s, Goddard Riverside racked up $100,000 in
legal fees defending itself against lawsuits brought by those who
did not want to see his new community center, then being built.
``People said yes, it's needed,'' Wohl said. ``But _ you know the
rest of the sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   You know it, too: not in my back yard. ``Put it in the Bronx
somewhere, they'd say,'' he recalled. ``Ah, but that's old news.
Why rehash it? Now they come over and sing Christmas carols.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly was no shortage of volunteers on Thursday to
cook and serve Thanksgiving dinner to the needy. Dozens of would-be
volunteers had to be turned away. Sure, some might dismiss them as
indulged yuppies out to feel better about themselves around the
holidays. Not Wohl. ``It's a way of getting involved in your
neighborhood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the era of human services,'' he continued. ``It's
funny how in America we've never solved the problems of food,
shelter and clothing.'' The deli man's brother started to slice
into another turkey, and then paused. ``It's not funny, I guess,''
he said.

USC YEAR HANGS IN BALANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a common belief that a USC football season
can usually be judged by how the Trojans fare against UCLA and
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   If true, a loss to the Irish on Saturday would certainly cast a
pall on what had looked like a better-than-expected year just two
weeks ago. But as coach Paul Hackett's inaugural season winds down,
the Trojans are also looking at a bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   USC is wondering if it can win its final two games and be
remembered for a more-than-respectable 9-4 record. It certainly
beats the alternative. In a nightmare scenario, USC could drop its
last two games and finish a mediocre 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   As if playing ninth-ranked Notre Dame on Saturday wasn't enough
motivation, the Trojans are also trying to place a positive legacy
on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's huge, the next two games,'' linebacker Chris
Claiborne said. ``To go 9-4 would be something special.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be an improvement over the previous two seasons, when
USC struggled with 6-6 and 6-5 records and didn't make a postseason
bowl trip. If the Trojans don't recover from their 34-17 loss to
UCLA, however, there exists the possibility they could finish just
a game above .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awful,'' offensive lineman Travis Claridge said.
``To go 7-6 would be a debacle. We worked hard in the summer. Real
hard. We would have nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before. The Trojans were 6-2-1 heading into their
final three games in 1992. Losses to UCLA, Notre Dame and Fresno
State in the Freedom Bowl left USC at 6-5-1 and cost Larry Smith
his job.
</P>
<P>
   History will not completely repeat itself because Hackett won't
lose his job if USC drops its next two games. But it will certainly
be easier for Hackett and his coaching staff to sell recruits on a
feel-good 9-4, or maybe even an 8-5 season, than the disappointment
of 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``These next two games will determine what has happened this
season,'' linebacker David Gibson said. ``It will turn out to be
respectable or a letdown. That loss to UCLA has put us on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we won seven games, that would not be a good season. We
expected a better season than 9-4 if that's what we end up with.
But considering it would mean we came in with a new coaching staff
and improved from what we did last year, it would be a good
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said that his goal all year has simply been for the
Trojans to improve and become a stronger football team in November
than September. It certainly seemed to be working, until five
fumbles against UCLA left an embarrassing feeling among the Trojans
and placed the rest of the year in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a setback Saturday,'' Hackett said. ``We must play
well in this game and in the bowl. We made some positive strides at
the end of the season. I don't see any reason it won't continue.
I'll be very disappointed if it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this has unofficially been considered a ``rebuilding''
year around USC, Hackett feels the Trojans have already earned a
niche in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to say we're in the top half of the conference,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he realizes USC supporters expect regular
postseason trips to the Rose Bowl, not the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said from the very beginning this is not an overnight
issue,'' Hackett said. ``We're on a scale where we're building. To
continue the same theme, we must improve. I think the key is we
have to just keep building.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means a victory over Notre Dame will probably be
necessary to erase the stigma that the season self-destructed at
its conclusion. If USC loses, its only consolation will be a bowl
trip for the first time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Even that isn't enough to placate some of the more hardened
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't count the bowl game, that's not the season,'' Claridge
said. ``If we go 8-4, that's not too bad. But there are still those
two losses (California, Oregon) we shouldn't have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, who is all but officially playing his final two games
before turning pro, is irked by the way USC has lost some games
this season, especially when the defense held Oregon to 17 points
and was basically taken out of the UCLA game by the offense's seven
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as much progress as we deserved,'' Claiborne said.
``But if we win the next two games we can end up the season pretty
good.''

COOLIO THRILLS GERMAN FANS WITH GANGSTA OR THEFT RAP
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ American rap stars have attracted big
audiences in Europe for years, so it was not entirely surprising
that teen-agers in the small southwest German town of Boeblingen
lined up along the street Thursday morning to see Coolio, whose
hits include ``Gangsta's Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary stop on a concert tour. For
rap-enchanted teen-agers, it was a chance to get an autograph. For
the stolidly middle-class residents of Boeblingen, Thursday marked
a real encounter with renegade American pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   In an event that people have been awaiting for months, Coolio
arrived at the local courthouse to face trial on charges that he
stole about $900 worth of clothes and assaulted a store clerk at a
local boutique.
</P>
<P>
   The rap star has said it was all a misunderstanding; his lawyers
are seeking an out-of-court settlement. It was, they say, a
promotional deal with the boutique that went awry. But the boutique
is pressing charges, and this town has not been as electrified in
years.
</P>
<P>
   The police cordoned off the street in front of the local
courthouse in preparation for Coolio's arrival. Hundreds of
teen-agers showed up, and television crews from around Germany came
to record the event. The courtroom audience was split almost evenly
between teen-agers in baggy jeans and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we usually write about are garbage incinerators,''
said Siegfried Dannecker, an editor at Boeblinger Kreiszeitung, the
town newspaper. ``I don't think we have ever seen such a mass of
media representatives in a Boeblingen courtroom. Our paper is
suddenly selling to an age group we usually don't reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Coolio himself showed little anxiety as he showed up for his day
in court. Dressed in a black shirt and pin-striped black suit, he
stomped out a cigarette outside the courthouse and signed hundreds
of autographs before walking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coolio wants the world to know that this is just a big
misunderstanding,'' said Bill Harris, the rap singer's tour
manager, who seemed amazed by the fuss. ``For the most part, he's
innocent. I think this was a little hyped up by the media.''
</P>
<P>
   By American standards, the alleged crime probably would not rate
much more than a mention on ``Entertainment Tonight.'' But in
Germany, where people follow rules with excruciating precision and
violent crime is unusual in small towns, it immediately became a
big story.
</P>
<P>
   The event in question, as the police might say, took place
almost exactly one year ago. Coolio and several band members
arrived at the boutique for a promotional autograph-signing
session. The musicians have said they were upset by what they
considered the low pay offered by the boutique. The store owners
charged that the rappers started to grab clothing as a way to get
even and injured a store clerk who tried to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the singer have already settled a civil lawsuit with
the store for about $2,900, but prosecutors have pressed ahead with
the criminal case. If convicted, Coolio could face a jail term but
would almost certainly be put on probation.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled for one more day of trial next month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Coolio has never faced charges in court, and this is a foreign
country,'' said the singer's attorney, Georg Strasser. ``It is all
very new for him. I am hoping that this can be settled with a
payment to a charitable organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Older residents expressed more alarm. ``There are so many women
working here alone, and they are already scared,'' said Angela
Erhart, a saleswoman in her late 40s at a store next to the
boutique that hired Coolio. ``I am sure that the woman there felt
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Thursday was a normal school day in Germany, about 200
teen-agers were on hand at the courthouse to catch a glimpse of the
excitement and debate the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what happened, but I think Coolio was
right because the people in the store refused to pay him,'' said
Murat Dinar, 17, a student dressed in baggy jeans and an oversized
blue jacket. ``I would have done the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But while rap music has a passionate following, even in small
towns like Boeblingen, many teen-agers were critical of the singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did what they say he did, then it was wrong,'' said
Anika Schaffer, 16. ``He has enough money to buy the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suspected that both the store and the rap singer were
simply using the case to generate publicity. ``I think this whole
story is just a big promotional move,'' said Jens Schuetz, a blond
17-year-old wearing baggy jeans and a baseball hat. ``Look how many
hits he had during the last few years: basically none.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate the allure that rap and hip-hop music
hold for teen-agers across Europe. Many fans revel in the fact that
it is inscrutable to their parents and makes for good dancing.

 OLD GUARD REPELS CHALLENGE AT STAID MARKS &AMP; SPENCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The clothes it sells are, mildly put, conservative. Its
line in precooked food caters to everyone from brown-bag lunchers
to dinner-party hosts too pressed to attend to the cuisine
themselves. Marks &AMP; Spencer PLC is _ in other words _ dependable.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, the venerable British retailer has been
roiled by the unthinkable: an unseemly board room tussle aired in
public after profits cascaded and the company stock plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's financial journals, moreover, gleefully picked over
what they called Marks &AMP; Spencer's parochialism and introverted
management culture, criticizing as slow footed its effort to take
its distinctive green-and-white storefront to a broader European
market. The company's autocratic chairman, Sir Richard Greenbury,
even flew back from India to halt disclosures about a power
struggle over the succession to his job.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the company _ known affectionately to many in Britain
as Marks and Sparks _ moved to stanch the bloodletting. After a
board meeting that lasted into Wednesday night, Greenbury's heir
apparent, Peter Salsbury, was named to succeed him, and an
insurgent executive who had sought to usurp him was pressed into
early retirement. Greenbury, 62 _ who had been both chairman and
chief executive _ was seen as having triumphed by securing the post
of nonexecutive chairman until 2000. Salsbury, 49, will be the new
chief executive beginning in February. The deputy chairman, Keith
Oates, 56, will retire in January after 15 years with the company.
</P>
<P>
   The markets were not impressed. Shares of Marks &AMP; Spencer, which
have underperformed the London Stock Exchange blue-chip index all
year, fell 21 pence Thursday, to 425 pence, reflecting investors'
assessments that the new chief executive might not be able to turn
around the company's sliding fortunes. Profits fell 23 percent in
the first half of 1998, the first drop in six years, and the
decline apparently precipitated Oates' bid for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in what has been known as Britain's most profitable
retailer comes after criticism by outsiders who said the company
had failed to introduce new ideas to remain competitive. Greenbury
has been with the company since he joined it at 17. Salsbury is a
Marks &AMP; Spencer lifer who joined after leaving the London School of
Economics 28 years ago. According to analysts who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, Oates _ with only 14 years at the company _
was seen as a newcomer with a background in finance rather than
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer pioneered the sale of pre-prepared food for the
upscale market in its stores, only to be challenged by other mass
market retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury. It bought Brooks
Brothers in the United States, but though the acquisition
introduced button-down Oxford-cloth shirts to a British mass
market, it has lost money. A global expansion plan valued at $3.7
billion was announced last year, just as consumer demand was about
to falter. And Greenbury insisted on a high level of British
content in his products, which made them expensive in Continental
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The woes escalated this month when Oates, the deputy chairman,
sensed he would be passed over for promotion to the top job when
Greenbury divided his titles _ a move that initially had been
scheduled for next May. According to reports in the British media,
Oates appealed to nonexecutive board members for support. That
brought Greenbury flying back from a vacation in India to put down
the revolt and defend his management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an ogre,'' he said. ``I'm blunt and I'm competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Thursday that he was ``disappointed to be retiring
early from Marks &AMP; Spencer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Greenbury said it was ``very sad that as part of the
modernizing of our top management structure, there is no longer a
full-time role for Keith.''

   TALKS BETWEEN OIL GIANTS REFLECT GLOBAL REALITIES
</P>
<P>
   The talks between Exxon and Mobil on a possible combination show
how global competition and advancing technology have made what were
once seen as unthinkable deals practical and even necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even industry giants have been forced to seek ways to cut costs
on huge, expensive international projects. In addition, oil
companies have decided that they will not be rescued soon by a
rebound in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS TO RISE
</P>
<P>
   Many working Americans will have increases of 8 percent to 20
percent or more on health insurance premiums next year in the
sharpest price increases since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC WON'T CUT PRODUCTION
</P>
<P>
   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
deeply divided over the best strategy for propping up sagging crude
oil prices, took no action on making further production cuts,
delaying any decision until March.
</P>
<P>
   DEFAULT EXPECTED ON SOVIET DEBT
</P>
<P>
   Russia has told Western bankers that it will renege on the terms
of repaying $28 billion in Soviet-era debt to creditors,
effectively paving the way for a default on interest payments next
month, bankers in London said.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETS GAIN IN ASIA AND EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in Asia and Europe advanced, as Japanese investors
awaited economic stimulus measures and the European markets
percolated with rumors of a big oil merger. Tokyo's main index, the
225-issue Nikkei, gained 134.30 points, or 0.89 percent, closing at
15,207.77. The index rebounded from a drop of 91.17 points on
Wednesday.

RACIAL DISPARITY SEEN IN IMMIGRANT HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A report commissioned by the Fannie Mae Foundation,
an arm of the federally chartered home-mortgage provider, shows the
extent to which race plays a determining role in where immigrants
live in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The study focuses on the conditions immigrants face in their
communities, rather than just their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The study, prepared by the Center for Real Estate and Urban
Policy at the New York University School of Law, shows that black
and Hispanic immigrants live in city neighborhoods with the highest
rates of serious crime, tuberculosis and unsafe buildings, and that
their experience is rivaled only by conditions faced by blacks born
in the United States. Immigrants from Europe, Asia and the nations
of the former Soviet Union, by comparison, live in neighborhoods
with fewer deleterious conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Nativity Differences in Neighborhood Quality,'' the
study builds on the findings of a previous Fannie Mae study of
immigrant housing. The earlier study, released in May, found that
black and Hispanic immigrants lived in the city's most dilapidated
buildings, paid the highest percentages of their incomes for rent
and had the lowest rates of home ownership. As in the new study,
those conditions were matched only by those faced by native-born
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our results suggest there is a racial hierarchy of
neighborhoods in New York,'' said Michael Schill, director of the
NYU real estate center. ``Blacks and Latinos live in worse-quality
neighborhoods than whites, regardless of whether they were born in
the United States or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report was prepared by Schill, Samantha Friedman of the
NYU center and Emily Rosenbaum, a sociology professor at Fordham
University. It examined six neighborhood conditions: crimes against
persons per 1,000 residents; tuberculosis cases per 10,000
residents; the percentage of buildings with safety violations; the
percentage of the neighborhood population on public assistance; the
percentage of subsidized housing units, and the availability of
physicians per 10,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   In every category except the availability of physicians,
immigrants from the Dominican Republic, other Caribbean countries,
Latin America, Africa and Puerto Rico lived in neighborhoods that
posted the top four or five rankings, indicating that they faced
the worst conditions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the category of crimes against persons, Puerto
Ricans, at 17.58 cases; Caribbeans and Africans combined, at 15.57
cases; Dominicans, at 13.99, and Latin Americans, at 13.02, lived
in neighborhoods with the second through fifth highest crime rates,
topped only by native-born blacks, at 19.01.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of tuberculosis cases per 10,000 residents,
Dominicans topped the list, at 34.99, followed by native-born
blacks, at 34.37; Puerto Ricans, at 31.66, and Latin Americans, at
29.48.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on data from the 1996 Housing and Vacancy
Survey, which is considered the city's best source of housing data,
as well as on crime and other housing statistics. The Housing and
Vacancy Survey, conducted every three years by the Census Bureau,
sampled 15,752 households, of which 5,933 were headed by
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, immigrants from the former Soviet Union live in
neighborhoods that rank particularly well with respect to crime,
disease and unsafe housing _ even when compared with native-born
whites. The crime rate for neighborhoods occupied by those
immigrants ranked lowest on the list, at 8.69 incidents per 1,000
residents, compared with 9.39 for native-born whites.
</P>
<P>
   With tuberculosis as an indicator of the prevalence of disease,
Soviet immigrants experienced the lowest rates of exposure, 17.52
cases per 10,000 residents, while the rate for native-born whites
was 18.31. And in terms of housing safety, the average number of
buildings with code violations for Soviet immigrants was 0.14,
compared with 0.23 for native-born whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians do well on these indicators,'' said Rosenbaum,
``largely because of their concentration in relatively well-to-do
neighborhoods like Forest Hills and Manhattan Beach, and even
Brighton Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a relatively higher proportion with college
educations, compared to other groups,'' she said. ``But I think
part of it is that they are white. It's really race and ethnicity
that drive the difference between the ethnic groups.'' The two
groups with higher proportions of college educations than
immigrants from the former Soviet Union were those from Southeast
Asia, and from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, taken as a group.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of physician availability for every 10,000
residents _ based on the location of the doctor's primary office _
immigrants from the Indian subcontinent had the lowest number of
doctors in their neighborhoods, 20.64; those from the former Soviet
Union had the second lowest number, 20.79, and native-born whites
had the most doctors available, 37.61.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Bayer, director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, said
the study was commissioned because ``Fannie Mae is committed to
eliminating discrimination in the mortgage financing system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges that the study shows we must address,''
she said, ``is how to reach people who may not have access to
information about the home-buying process. We really think that
there's a great improvement in neighborhood conditions when there's
a higher proportion of homeowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Schill said the public-policy implications of the study ``are
that stepped-up enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, such as the
Federal Fair Housing Act, and investment in minority neighborhoods,
such as that promoted by the Federal Community Reinvestment Act,
are likely to go a long way in improving conditions of immigrants
living in this city.''

MADISON AVENUE IS WORLD'S HIGHEST-RENT RETAIL ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the holiday shopping marathon begins Friday, bells
are ringing on Madison Avenue. There are Christmas chimes, of
course, and the jingle of cash registers (or at least the whisper
of platinum plastic). But the peal most audible to store owners and
real estate agents is of celebration, tinged ever so slightly with
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue between 57th and 72nd streets has just been
officially declared the most expensive stretch of shopping space in
New York, in the United States and in the world. To rent 1 square
foot of space there costs an average of $550 a year, according to a
survey by Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, the big international real estate
firm.
</P>
<P>
   That may not surprise anyone who has ambled down the avenue
lately, but it does represent a change from just a year or two ago,
when Fifth Avenue was a far more expensive spot to open a store,
and Causeway Bay in Hong Kong was the most expensive retailing real
estate on the planet. Just five years ago, it seemed as if almost
every block of Madison was pocked by an empty storefront.
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, the current state of Madison Avenue illuminates
some of the most powerful economic trends now shaping New York: the
shrinking globe, the resurgent stock market and, of course, all
those tourists.
</P>
<P>
   And boy, are they out there, dressed in bright hues and sensible
shoes, jamming what used to be the exclusive shopping district of
Fifth Avenue between 57th Street and Rockefeller Center. While some
of the most glamorous names in selling _ like Bergdorf Goodman and
the jeweler Harry Winston _ are still on Fifth, so are all the
stores that sell sneakers and blue jeans and Bugs Bunny wabbitiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that 57th and Fifth have lost their cachet,''
said Susan Kurland, a director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. For
expensive retailers, particularly those from Europe, she added, the
area just has too many ``mid-America mall-type tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the most chic stores have been flocking to this
stretch of Madison, where real estate costs are only slightly ahead
of those on Fifth and 57th.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers whose names are best known to the devoted
readers of Vogue are lining the avenue: Cerruti is opening its
first American store near 67th Street, Gianfranco Ferre is
expanding at 70th, Gianni Versace is revamping at 68th, next to the
new Max Mara store, and Hermes, a stalwart on 57th Street, has
plans to move to Madison at 62nd. And that's just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Tourneau, which specializes in lavish watches, has two stores on
Madison that are just two blocks apart _ but worlds away from each
other. On 57th is the ``Time Machine,'' four floors of loud music,
flashing lights, video screens and zillions of watches, from the
$18,500 Paul Newman Rolex (``pre-owned,'' though not by the movie
star himself) to $40 plastic Swatches decorated with teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   At 59th is a more traditional jewel box of a store, full of
glass and wood cases, solicitous salespeople and gleaming
``timepieces.'' No plastic. Prices start at about $200, and get as
high as $43,000 for a gold Patek Philippe wristwatch, even higher
for antique jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-seventh is a must-see for anyone visiting New York,''
said Anthony D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau,
which opened its store there last year. ``Upper Madison Avenue,''
he added, ``is a must-see for a certain type.'' That's the rich
type, the European type, the big-spending type.
</P>
<P>
   When designers are asked why they must be on Madison, they tend
to claim that they sort of stumbled on the perfect spot for a
store, which just happened to be on Madison.
</P>
<P>
   For example, following in the footsteps of Giorgio Armani, who
two years ago opened two stores on Madison, Donna Karan recently
announced that she would open a shop for her most luxurious line
between 68th and 69th streets. Real estate experts say the
clustering of designer stores on Madison is no accident.
``Retailers are feeling the necessity to be around each other, to
keep up with the Joneses,'' said Robert Cohen, senior managing
director of RKF &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   International _ mostly European _ names dominate big stretches
of Madison, and foreign tourists are among their biggest customers.
Even, perhaps especially, if the same brands are available back
home. (Baccarat, the French crystal store, was recently full of
French people.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 6 million foreign tourists spent $1.3 billion just on
shopping in the city, according to the New York City Convention and
Visitors Bureau, while the 27 million American tourists spent less
than $600 million in shops.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the number of visitors from abroad is down slightly
because of the economic turmoil in Asia. But the number of
travelers from Europe and Latin America has increased, the board
said.
</P>
<P>
   For designers and manufacturers trying to appeal to these
shoppers, Madison Avenue today serves as a genteel, expensive
billboard. Most of the stores sell only their own merchandise, not
products produced by others, as department stores and traditional
boutiques do. Probably half of them, real estate mavens estimate,
have moved to the avenue in the last three or four years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is the billboard effect that makes retailers willing to pay
more per square foot than, in many instances, they can possibly
hope to recoup by selling even the most expensive handbags or
shearling coats. ``They're loss leaders,'' said Ms. Kurland of
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   That is not true for all of them, of course. Both Armani and
Timberland report that they do big business on Madison Avenue. But
for most of these stores, ``if they are making money, it is not
much,'' said Howard Davidowitz, a longtime retailing analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what he called ``the hiccup in the financial markets,''
Davidowitz said he expected this to be a great Christmas for city
retailers. Other forecasters are a bit more subdued, but far more
optimistic than they were just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue should benefit from the recovery of the stock
market _ which hit an all-time high this week _ because it puts
money in the pockets of ``the more established rich of the Upper
East Side,'' said Alex Cohen, the research director of Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield. On the other hand, many bond traders have lost their
jobs, and Wall Street bonuses are likely to be far lower than they
were last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the stock market's gyrations appear to have unnerved
consumers, who tell pollsters that when doing their holiday
shopping, they are more interested in ``value'' _ retail-speak for
cheap stuff _ than they were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the alarm bells come in. While a poor Christmas
season is hard on all retailers, it can kill those with high real
estate costs to cover. That fact has been easy to ignore for
several years, at least until last summer, when the stock market
plunged and economists began predicting that a recession might
occur. ``I sincerely hope rents are coming to some sort of peak,''
said Cohen of RKF, ``because they have been getting a little out of
hand.''

CITY BUDGET OFFICE SENDS OUT THE WORD: CUT YOUR BUDGETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration told city agencies this
week to cut their budgets for next year, in part to offset an
anticipated $500 million revenue loss from the elimination of an
income tax surcharge on city residents' salaries, the mayor's
budget director said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harding, the director of the Office of Budget and
Management, said he had sent a memorandum to city commissioners
Wednesday asking them to find $600 million to $700 million in
budget cuts for fiscal year 2000, starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Guiliani is to present his preliminary budget in
January. Harding said the city must close a $2 billion gap between
projected revenues and spending.
</P>
<P>
   A memorandum asking commissioners to scour their departments for
cuts has become an annual rite under Giuliani before he unveils his
budget proposals. But the cuts requested this week go deeper than
the appeal last year, when the budget gap was between $600 million
and $800 million, Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's request was smaller because city coffers were
swelled by increased tax receipts courtesy of Wall Street's good
fortune. Since the summer, Giuliani has been warning that dips in
the stock market will shrink the city's capital gains tax revenues.
Those reduced expectations and the income tax cut led to this
year's requests, Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deficit that needs to be cut is greater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had warned earlier this month that the tax break would
mean cuts in the city's $34 billion budget. But the level of cuts
was not known until this week's memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   In a budget pact announced on Nov. 17 after a five-month
standoff between the mayor and the City Council, the two sides
agreed to eliminate the 12.5 percent income tax surcharge. The
surcharge, enacted in 1991, raises $500 million each year but was
to expire on Dec. 31 unless the City Council asked the state
Legislature to extend the tax.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about a third of that projected deficit will be made
up by budget cuts. The rest of the money will come from revised
estimates of tax revenue, as well as from other non-tax sources of
income, like land sales, Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies have until the second week in December to present their
proposals to the budget office.
</P>
<P>
   Various departments have been asked to make different levels of
cuts, Harding said by telephone from North Carolina, where he was
celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday. He said he did not have
information available on how much each agency had been asked to
trim.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Police Department and other uniformed services
had been asked to absorb smaller cuts. Most of the Police
Department's expenses come from salaries, and the mayor does not
want to reduce the number of officers on the force, Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other departments' budgets cannot be cut because of federal
requirements or matching money from federal or state agencies, he
said. That means the largest cuts would have to come from other
departments in which personnel costs make up smaller parts of the
budget, like the Department of Transportation. A spokesman for that
department said he was unaware of memorandum.

TEN YEARS AFTER THE FACT, PAIN LINGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erik Affholter watched his team safeguard the quarterback and
the football about as well as a jimmied lock on its way to a
devastating loss in a really big game.
</P>
<P>
   Westlake High's two-point setback to San Marcos in a first-round
Southern Section playoff game last week reminded Affholter, a
Westlake assistant coach, of a monumental game he was a part of 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Westlake committed two turnovers that San Marcos converted into
touchdowns. In Affholter's mind the Warriors gave away the victory,
just as his USC team did a decade ago in the game he'd just as soon
forget.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 26, 1988, USC and Notre Dame squared off in a
regular-season finale at the Coliseum that, for only the 24th time
in history, featured the nation's two top-ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was tradition, not some mathematic histrionics, that
delivered the game of the year. The Irish were No.1 with a 10-0
record. The Trojans had an identical mark and some ugly scores to
settle (6-27, 7-19, 3-37, 37-38, 15-26, the sum total of five years
of unmitigated frustration at the hands of their longtime rivals).
</P>
<P>
   There was a renewed sense of pride on both sides, each program
having brushed itself off and climbed back into the top five after
a few rough rides. The Irish had bucked their championship
tradition under coach Gerry Faust while the Trojans had chafed
under the reins of coach Ted Tollner.
</P>
<P>
   Faust and Tollner were long gone by 1988, replaced by Lou Holtz
and Larry Smith, respectively. Holtz, who never saw an opponent who
didn't crease his worry lines, tried in the days leading up to the
game to paint his top-ranked team as the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The bettors didn't beg to differ, installing the Trojans as
4{-point favorites on the strength of a Coliseum home-field
advantage that, for this week, anyway, came complete with temporary
bleachers that thickened the throng to 93,829.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement surrounding the game had been building for weeks.
Affholter, a senior receiver by way of Agoura High, knew it wasn't
just another renewal of a rich rivalry that dated back to 1926, and
he was enlisted to do a network television interview.
</P>
<P>
   During halftime of ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was insane,'' Affholter said of the carnival atmosphere
that made for one lively holiday week.
</P>
<P>
   About the only person who was more subdued than usual was the
Trojans' Heisman Trophy-contending quarterback Rodney Peete, and he
had a medical excuse. No sooner had the senior shaken a case of the
measles than he came down with laryngitis. Peete didn't regain his
voice until Thanksgiving Day, 48 hours before kickoff. So for all
but one of the week's practices the job of calling out the
quarterback cadences fell to freshman Todd Marinovich.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game arrived, Peete's voice held up a lot better than
the rest of him. The Irish, led by linebacker Frank Stams, blitzed
Peete repeatedly and the Trojans' offensive line was helpless to
slow the onslaught, much less stop it. Peete paid for every one of
his 44 passes (23 of which he completed for 225 yards).
</P>
<P>
   If Peete had any germs left to spread, Stams surely caught them.
Every time Peete turned around, there Stams was. He sacked Peete
three times, separating Peete's left shoulder the first time he
flattened him, at the end of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Peete's counterpart, Tony Rice, had torched the stingiest run
defense in the land for a 65-yard touchdown run to give the Irish a
7-0 lead in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   USC was trailing 14-7 late in the second but had the ball in
Notre Dame territory. Peete threw a pass intended for John Jackson,
but Jackson slipped and Stan Smagala snared the ball, then raced
down the sideline, leaving behind all of his pursuers save for
Peete.
</P>
<P>
   Peete had made the touchdown-saving tackle on safety George
Streeter in the second quarter after tossing his first interception
of the day and he was gaining on Smagala until Stams stopped him
cold with a blind-side block.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes passed before Peete was able to peel his body up
off the Coliseum turf. Smagala proceeded to do what no other
defender had done during Peete's USC career _ return one of his
interceptions for a touchdown. On the strength of Smagala's 64-yard
score the Irish took a 20-7 lead into the intermission. They won
27-10 as the Trojans never were able to rise from the grave they
dug themselves in the first half when they committed an ungodly
four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Affholter had set single-season and career records for
receptions with one of his catches in the first half. The reception
that secured him a place in the Trojans record books caused him
great pain. He cracked his femur on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could barely walk,'' Affholter recalled. ``At the time I
thought it was a charley horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain persists to this day. All these years later, it's a
tossup which hurts Affholter worse, the chronic ache in his leg or
the 1988 team's scarred legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It remains difficult for Affholter to accept that Barry Sanders
beat out Peete for the Heisman, the Trojans went on to lose to
Michigan in what was, for them, an anticlimactic Rose Bowl and USC
wound up seventh in the final Associated Press poll. It doesn't
make him feel any better to know the highest a USC team has
finished since then was eighth the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get many opportunities in sports to capture the
greatest prize,'' Affholter said. ``We were on the doorstep and we
didn't get through the door. That was a good Notre Dame team, I'll
give them that. But we absolutely expected to win. When it came
right down to it, they beat us in the turnover game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to deal with,'' Affholter added. ``I'm still
dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he didn't bother sugar-coating things when he
addressed the Westlake players after their season-ending loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them (the hurt) will never go away,'' Affholter said.
``All you can do is learn to deal with it.''

BOYS BURNED IN SCIENCE EXPERIMENT SCHEDULED FOR SURGERY

BY MARY SCHUBERT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With their families spending Thanksgiving at their
bedsides, two high school students remained hospitalized Thursday
with severe burns that will require skin-grafting surgery this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Chris James, 17, of Stevenson Ranch was listed in critical but
stable condition at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks
Hospital, said charge nurse Helena San Marco. James suffered
third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body, including his
hands, arms, chest, shoulder and face Wednesday when a homemade
cannon built for a physics experiment exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Also hurt in the incident was Hart High classmate Nolan LaMar,
17, of Castaic, who suffered burns on 12 percent of his body. San
Marco said he was listed in good condition at the burn center.
</P>
<P>
   LaMar and James are scheduled for grafting surgery Saturday.
Surgeons must first cut away dead and contaminated tissue around
the students' wounds to prevent infection.
</P>
<P>
   The physics class was meeting on the football field of the
campus in Newhall, an L.A.-area suburb, when the explosion
occurred. Students had fashioned the cannon devices to propel
tennis balls out of apple juice cans by igniting liquid methanol.
</P>
<P>
   A third student, Jesse Honea, 17, was released from a Valencia
hospital Wednesday for respiratory difficulty resulting from the
blast.
</P>
<P>
   James' most life-threatening injury was to his vocal cords,
which were severely damaged by super-heated air generated by the
blast, said Dr. A. Richard Grossman, medical director at the burn
center in the L.A. suburb of Sherman Oaks. The explosion also
damaged James' lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses have been changing the dressings over his wounds twice a
day, and James is sedated to relieve the pain, San Marco said. The
teen also has been placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep him as comfortable as possible,'' the
nurse said. ``He's responsive; when we talk to him, he'll shake his
head. He can't talk because he's got a breathing tube down his
throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached on a family vacation in Utah, Superintendent Bob Lee
said the William S. Hart Union High School District won't take any
official action on the incident until school resumes next week. By
then, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department report will be
complete, and district officials will have ``a chance to talk to
some of the students to find out what happened,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have any information probably until the middle of
next week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the district is reaching out to the families to
provide any assistance they need. ``The teacher was pretty well
shaken by it, also,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, James will have to undergo surgery in which doctors
will examine his lungs and vocal cords. Since the incident, James
has been fed intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   His family members, meanwhile, have been keeping a vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents, his siblings, aunts, uncles _ they're not all (in
the room) with him, but they're at the hospital,'' San Marco said.
``His parents and siblings are the only ones we're allowing to
visit (with him) at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman already has operated on James' hands to prevent
gangrene and to relieve the swelling caused by the burns and to
improve circulation, San Marco said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone sent flowers to both boys _ not allowed in their rooms
because of their conditions _ and another well-wisher sent a pair
of angel figures, San Marco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman called earlier who knows them casually from school,
and she wants to start a fund for the boys,'' San Marco said.
``There are people calling to see if there's a place they can
donate blood.'' &QL;

HESS VISITS JETS AND UNVEILS BIG DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Perhaps Leon Hess knows something. The
84-year-old owner of the New York Jets paid his annual Thanksgiving
Day visit to practice Thursday, and for a change he is allowing
himself to think of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   How close is this team to a Super Bowl? ``I dream about it all
the time,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been times when even dreaming was too much to bear.
Even in 1986, when the team started 10-1. Hess was asked then for a
comment about the success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not,'' he said. ``My heart's been broken too many
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets went on to lose their final five games.
</P>
<P>
   Through the good times and the bad times, though, Hess has kept
ticket prices down. The Jets are traditionally the lowest-priced
seat in the National Football League. Even though the games have
been sold out since the team moved to the Meadowlands in 1984, the
Jets consistently led the league in no-shows. But now every home
crowd this season has topped 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a lot better than 30,000 or 40,000 no-shows,''
Hess said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Hess was one of five partners who rescued the Titans
from bankruptcy court for $1 million and then created the Jets from
a mountain of paper debt. He bought out his last partner in 1984,
and became the sole owner of a team, which is probably now worth
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   His retiring style as owner masks a steely resolve that marks
his dealings in the oil business, in which he is a major
international figure. Hess stepped down only two years ago as the
day-to-day head of Amerada Hess Corp., but is still in the office
daily. He has dealt personally with Col. Moammar Gadhafi and
officials of the Arab Emirates, as well as heads of Caribbean
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Hess has left the running of the Jets to others and seldom
attends practices once the season starts. He will, however, usually
wish the players well in the locker room before games. Afterward,
he stands quietly off to the side with several friends while the
players get dressed. Hess started to attend Thanksgiving practice
in 1977. He has not missed one. And Thursday, as he has every year
on this day except once, he also addressed the team.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking inside the practice bubble during a halt in the
workout, Hess singled out coach Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick,
his chief assistant, to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him so animated,'' tight end Kyle Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Hess has not seen his team tied for first at this
time of season very often. He knows that if the Jets win their
final five games, starting Sunday with the Carolina Panthers at the
Meadowlands, they will capture the American Conference East
Division. No wonder he told the players in his perpetually husky
voice Thursday: ``It's a five-game season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us to be thankful for Bill Parcells,'' said center
Kevin Mawae, who added, ``Parcells was beet red.''
</P>
<P>
   That pleased Mawae, who does not see his coach in an
embarrassing position very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Parcells doesn't believe everything he said,'' Mawae
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview _ Hess has held only three formal news
conferences in his 35-year association with the team _ he was
animated and hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have wonderful coaches, a wonderful spirit with the team,''
he said. ``We may have a setback from time to time, but we'll come
back. I hope that we do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hess is enjoying what is happening this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it a hell of a lot more than 1-15,'' he said,
reflecting on the 1996 record that led to the arrival of Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his memory is long enough that he tempers his excitement
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic and I stop there,'' Hess said.
``It's a heck of a letdown when it goes bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he may dream about the Super Bowl _ he was there
once, 30 seasons ago _ he is reluctant to predict how far this club
can go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let the coach do the talking,'' Hess said. ``He's the
boss. The whole team is his, as if he owned it. And it's his
decision on what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has described Hess as an owner who ``doesn't say too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always pretty much encouraging,'' Parcells added.
``Very thoughtful. He's very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   When they first talked about Parcells' taking over the team,
Hess was very accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told me, `What do you need?' He's one of those guys
you don't need anything written down,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was 9-7 in his first season, and he is poised for the
playoffs in his second, but he refused to speculate whether Hess is
more upbeat in this winning season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a point of reference,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he returned to his point of reference. ``It hasn't been
that enjoyable for me: 9-7, 7-4,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ BILL PARCELLS is going to pay the team's $10,000 fine that was
levied by the league. The Jets did not open the locker room to the
news media after Sunday's victory at Nashville. ``I'm going to pay
it myself,'' Parcells said. ``I understand what the league policy
is and I was in no way trying not to make the media access
available. I thought I made a prudent decision for my team. It's
not like the five other teams that played there earlier. I've got
40 guys in the media. Some teams had eight writers with them. I
just did what was best for my team.'' He was also fined $10,000 by
the league last year for failing to disclose a late-week injury to
center ROGER DUFFY.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parcells would not comment on BRYAN COX's charges of league
racism involving the player's $10,000 fine for unnecessary
roughness against the Tennessee Oilers. &QL;

EARL KIM, 78, COMPOSER OF AUSTERE, DAZZLING WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earl Kim, a composer whose music valued economy, precision and
quietude, and who was an important mentor to younger composers
during a 23-year career at Harvard University, died Nov. 19 at his
home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently been diagnosed with cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim received the most public attention for works he wrote for
the violinist Itzhak Perlman, which were were somewhat out of
character for the composer. In 1979 Perlman gave the premiere of
Kim's Violin Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Avery
Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Though a compact, 20-minute, one-movement piece, the concerto
teems with an almost romantic lyricism and brilliant writing for
the violin. Following this, Kim composed a set of dazzling violin
caprices for Perlman that have become popular with many violinists.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Kim's music was modest of statement and
infrequently heard outside contemporary and chamber music circles.
He was a modernist in the sense that his musical language was
steeped in contemporary procedures, including touches of the
12-tone idiom. But his voice was deeply personal: aristocratic,
restrained, with not a note wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was especially admired for his vocal works. Versed in
several languages, he selected texts of distinction by authors like
Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Rilke, Anne Sexton and, his favorite, Samuel
Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   The spareness, abstraction and mystery in Beckett's writing was
reflected tellingly in Kim's many musical settings, including
``Exercises en Route'' and ``Earthlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Kim's vocal works use the singing voice traditionally.
But he was especially noted for his melodramas, in which the words
are spoken or quasi-sung, accompanied by spare instrumental
gestures. Bethany Beardslee and Benita Valente were among the
singers who championed Kim's vocal music, and Dawn Upshaw took the
title of her album ``The Girl With Orange Lips'' from one of the
songs in his cycle ``Where Grief Slumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim was born in Dinuba, Calif., on Jan. 6, 1920. In 1939, he
began studies in composition at the University of California at Los
Angeles with Schoenberg; the following year he transferred to
Berkeley, where he worked with Ernest Bloch. From 1952 to 1967, he
taught at Princeton. He then accepted a position at Harvard,
eventually becoming James Edward Ditson professor of music. He
retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was active in political causes. In 1983, as president of
Musicians Against Nuclear Arms, he participated in a concert at
Avery Fisher Hall to raise funds for Physicians for Social
Responsibility. In 1990, he refused an invitation to join a music
panel of the National Endowment for the Arts to express his
opposition to ``all forms of censorship of the arts,'' as he wrote
in a letter published in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Martha Potter, a violinist; a
daughter, Eva, of Cambridge, and a daughter from a previous
marriage, Shawna Kent of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's last major work, ``The White Hour'' for chamber orchestra,
was given its premiere this year by the Boston Chamber Music
Society.

ON MEAN STREETS, ANYONE CAN BE 007

  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks like any other brand-new BMW 540i. But try firing a .44
Magnum at the ``540i Protection'' _ it handles bullets as blithely
as Superman does. Still, no car can do everything that the Man of
Steel can; the 540i Protection still has to be driven around tall
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking armored cars here, automobiles that have been
fortified to withstand attacks by shady characters with guns or
crowbars in their hands and larceny, or worse, on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Turning out these cars, customized to keep the enemy out, is a
growing business: O'Gara-Hess &AMP; Eisenhardt, the armored-car
division of the far-flung Kroll-O'Gara security company, has opened
factories in four countries in the last five years. Until 1993, it
did all its work at its Cincinnati headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, too, sees demand for armored cars that do not look like
armored cars. The bottom line, BMW says, is the bottom line:
Installing security equipment at the factory is less expensive than
having the materials added after a car has left the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   BMW maintains that these after-market alterations weaken the
cars they are meant to strengthen. ``It is a fact that work of this
kind often means a loss of quality,'' said Edward Hightower,
manager of 5- and 7-Series cars for BMW of North America. ``And you
don't have the body panels being disassembled, as by an
after-market supplier, which in most cases voids the manufacturer's
responsibility.'' Or, by another name, the warranty.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gara-Hess disputes the idea that a specialty coach builder
cannot do the job. ``To answer the idea that we're going to mess up
the car, we've never, ever had that complaint, not even once,''
said Dan Heimbrock, O'Gara-Hess' marketing manager. ``You're only
adding a couple hundred pounds, the majority of it glass. The
competency has to be that you put the glass in right and put the
trim back. It's not tremendously complicated. The hard part is how
do you make sure that the armor is integrated into the body of the
car so that the bullets don't go through _ ever.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep that from happening, O'Gara-Hess' Lincoln Town Car has
reinforced body panels and an armored roof. BMW's 540i Protection
(yes, the ``P'' word is part of the name) comes factory-equipped
with everything needed to outgun and outrun the average armed
assailant, from a bullet-resistant body and windows to run-flat
tires.
</P>
<P>
   That is also everything that Bonnie and Clyde could have wished
for in a getaway car, though BMW's marketing pitch is aimed at
potential victims _ high-profile types whose names are more likely
to appear in the gossip columns than on most-wanted posters.
</P>
<P>
   BMW insists that the 540i Protection was not designed with drug
lords in mind. ``That's certainly not something we're promoting,''
Hightower said. ``We're not promoting or targeting any illegal type
of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Gara-Hess goes a step further, running background checks on
customers. ``There are enough lower-end companies that don't care
who they serve, particularly in places like Colombia,'' Heimbrock
said. ``If someone shows up on our doorstep with a suitcase full of
money, we don't just hand them the keys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess &AMP; Eisenhardt, predecessor of O'Gara-Hess, began as a maker
of ambulances and hearses and got into the armored-car business at
the request of the Secret Service in the 1940s. Heimbrock said
today's customers were ``people who are afraid of rape, abduction,
kidnapping or armed assault.'' All are high-profile people, he
said, and most fall into one of three categories: celebrities,
politicians or captains of industry. ``Outside the United States,
the market is much broader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW 540i Protection has mats of a plastic tissuelike
material called aramide fiber _ which BMW says is lighter and
stronger than bulletproof vests _ tucked like insulation behind the
body panels and the back seat. If a hapless attacker tries to drill
his way in, BMW says the material will wrap itself around the drill
bit, rendering it useless.
</P>
<P>
   BMW also replaces the conventional windows with reinforced glass
made with nearly invisible steel fibers. Don't try to roll down the
rear windows to wave at crowds: As a precaution against would-be
assassins, the windows do not move. Also, hope that
sledgehammer-wielding attackers miss the mark. At least one auto
writer _ a latter-day Clark Kent _ managed to crack the glass with
a forceful heave at a demonstration arranged by BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower said the changes added only 255 pounds of weight,
raising the car's 0-to-60 acceleration time to 6.7 seconds, only a
half-second slower than an unarmored 540i. And while the car may be
intended for people who like to shift for themselves in the real
world, they must accept an automatic: The 540i Protection is not
available with a stick shift. It goes 21.4 miles on a gallon of
premium, the same as an ordinary, thin-skinned 540i. Hightower said
the price had not been set; the 540i Protection will cost more than
the $51,670 sticker of an ordinary 540i with an automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gara-Hess offers modifications on 20 brands of cars. It
charges $45,000 to convert a Lincoln Town Car, not including the
car. It is, Heimbrock said, ``a logical, affordable, practical
piece of personal security equipment'' _ one that is designed to be
driven away from danger. That means the car has to keep running. So
the battery is encased in bullet-resistant material. (``It can take
multiple ballistic impacts or even penetrations from bullets,'' he
said.)
</P>
<P>
   The O'Gara-Hess Lincoln has armor on the roof and sides, but not
the floor (that is an option). The idea is to provide what
Heimbrock called ``protection against what the common criminal
uses, which is typically easy-to-conceal handguns and
submachine-gun types of threats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too often will you see a street thug with an M-16,'' he
said. ``The rebels up in the mountains have those, but the guy
who's going to rip off your watch, he's going to come up with a
9-millimeter handgun.''

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S CAPITAL MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 27:
</P>
<P>
   In drafting New York's death penalty statute three years ago,
Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature set out to avoid
defects that could render it unconstitutional. Even so, they
approved a flawed plea-bargaining process that now poses the first
test of the new law before the state's highest court, the Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a section of the statute that specifically prohibits
the death penalty when a defendant in a capital case reaches a plea
agreement with prosecutors. The maximum sentence a defendant who
pleads guilty to capital murder can receive is life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As a legal matter, this should not be a difficult call for Chief
Judge Judith Kaye and her colleagues. The plea-bargaining section
is remarkably similar to a provision that led the U.S. Supreme
Court, in an important 1968 case, to strike down a North Carolina
death penalty statute, finding that it unconstitutionally penalized
those defendants who demanded a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Two lower state appellate decisions in the past year have upheld
New York's scheme. But the attempts to distinguish it from the
North Carolina case do not stand up to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, for example, that in contrast to the disapproved
North Carolina rules, a New York defendant cannot plead guilty
without a prosecutor's consent. But it is hard to see how that
small difference alters the fact that both statutes
unconstitutionally scare people away from a jury trial by inducing
them to plead guilty rather than risk the possibility of a death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Other jurisdictions maintain room for plea bargaining in capital
cases. But it is noteworthy that New York is alone among death
penalty states in having a statute that links the possibility of
the death penalty to the exercise of the constitutional right to a
jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal experts find the provision unconstitutional. Whether
that conclusion requires overturning the whole statute is a harder
call that depends largely on how the Court of Appeals reads the
``severability'' clause the Legislature included in the law in an
attempt to prevent the possible unconstitutionality of one
provision from overturning the entire death penalty statute.
</P>
<P>
   But, plainly, the drama in this case goes beyond the validity of
the state's death penalty law. The Court of Appeals has been under
intense criticism from Pataki and other politicians in recent years
for its willingness to safeguard the constitutional rights of
criminal defendants, and among court-watchers there is concern
about the impact of all the political pressure on the court's
jurisprudence. The outcome here will say much about its continued
integrity and independence.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHEN A LAW FIRM IS LIKE A BASEBALL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state of Washington followed California earlier this month
when it voted to eliminate state-sponsored affirmative action in
education and government contracts. But the nation as a whole has
moved in the opposite direction since California's Proposition 209
raised fears of a national movement that might resegregate higher
education and the professions, deepening racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of civic disaster, even hard-line
conservatives have taken a more moderate stance, seeking ways to
limit affirmative action instead of killing it. The new tack among
conservatives is to frown on race-sensitive policies in most
contexts, while endorsing them in the municipal services and in
public colleges on the premise that publicly financed institutions
should be racially representative to keep taxpayer support.
</P>
<P>
   The historian Abigail Thernstrom presented a troubling variation
on this theme last month in The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Thernstrom
argued that African-Americans who attended middling and ``allegedly
dead-end colleges'' had done so well professionally that they had
no need of access to first-tier institutions like Harvard, Duke or
the University of Chicago. In the Thernstrom theory, elite
universities could resegregate with no foreseeable harm to
African-Americans _ as long as middling colleges continued to
provide broad access.
</P>
<P>
   This view is noxiously classist and historically naive. Studies
of work-force integration show that African-Americans are routinely
required to have far more impressive credentials than whites, even
when competing for the same jobs. For whites, elite university
degrees are a nice enhancement. But for African-Americans, those
same degrees are required just to get in the door.
</P>
<P>
   The ``black superstar'' effect was first documented in, of all
places, professional baseball. The sport portrays itself as the
ultimate meritocracy and pats itself on the back for hiring Jackie
Robinson at a time when other sports still barred
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 years ago, a study of lifetime pitching and batting
averages by sports sociologists at Northeastern University showed
that black players had to outhit and outpitch their white
counterparts by substantial margins to win and keep their jobs.
Baseball managers who had come of age when the game was all white
had difficulty recognizing baseball talent when it came with a
black face. Mere journeymen could have long and profitable careers
_ as long as they were white. But among African-Americans, only
stellar and above-average players would do.
</P>
<P>
   These inequities are rooted in the logic of slavery and are
based on the myth that blacks are intellectually inferior. As a
consequence of this myth, black people face substantially higher
barriers to employment than whites _ especially in the elite
professions where whiteness has historically served as an unstated
job requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Elite law firms today are roughly analogous to professional
baseball teams 50 years ago. The old-money firms are notoriously
clubby and overwhelmingly white and have only in recent decades
dropped policies that excluded women and African-Americans. But
residual racism finds fertile ground in an interview process that
makes less than it should of objective qualifications _ and far too
much of subjective judgments about an applicant's personality and
suitability to the ``culture'' of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard University legal scholar David B. Wilkins is
researching these problems in a national project. He published some
of his early reflections in a 1996 article in The California Law
Review. Wilkins notes that black law firm applicants with average
grades are less likely to be hired than whites with the same
transcripts. Black partners are far more likely than whites to have
attended Harvard or Yale.
</P>
<P>
   The ``black superstar'' effect is especially pronounced at the
top-rated law firms. A partner at the Chicago firm of Sidley and
Austin told researchers that law firms set ``higher standards for
minority hires than for whites. ... If you are not from Harvard,
Yale or the University of Chicago, you're not adequate. You're not
taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of race-sensitive admissions policies argue that black
students who come from mediocre public schools could enhance their
transcripts and professional opportunities by attending less
competitive universities where they could more easily excel.
</P>
<P>
   That option is open to whites _ who get hired and reach partner
status with degrees from middling law schools. But black students
who pursue such a course are locked out of elite firms. This
process has been best documented in law, but related studies show
it at work well across the corporate spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The Thernstrom theory _ that African-Americans can achieve equal
professional access without attending Harvard, Yale, Princeton or
the University of Chicago _ is wrong on its face. The country may
yet get there, but we have a long way to go.

NEW SERIOUS SIDE TO CHILD'S PLAY ON WEB
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By PAMELA MENDELS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For four years, children who visited the Cyberkids Web site have
found puzzles, interactive stories and other activities intended to
appeal to the 7- to 12-year-old crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the young visitors have encountered a new and
decidedly less playful feature: a consent form that must be
downloaded, copied, signed by mom or dad and mailed to Cyberkids
before the children can join in certain activities, like entering
contests or using chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It is intended to let the publishers of Cyberkids know that
parents approve of their children's taking part in features in
which the child might disclose such personal information as an
e-mail address. Although Julie Richer, president of Able Minds
Inc., the San Francisco company that publishes Cyberkids, is not
completely happy about the form, she posted it because she wants to
comply with a federal law that has yet to take effect but is
already shaping children's online experience.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act of
1998, quietly entered the books last month, when President Clinton
signed the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks to protect children's privacy by requiring, with a few
exceptions, that commercial Web sites aimed at children obtain
parental permission before collecting personal information, like
names, addresses, phone numbers or Social Security numbers, from
children under 13.
</P>
<P>
   It is separate from a similarly named law, the Child On-Line
Protection Act, which is intended to shield children from
commercial pornography. That recently passed law is being
challenged on First Amendment grounds by a group of free speech
advocates and Web publishers in a lawsuit that recently led a
federal judge in Philadelphia to block its enforcement temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with the pornography statute, some believe that
the privacy law could exercise a greater influence on what children
see and interact with online.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education,
a public interest group in Washington, said: ``I really believe the
online privacy bill will have the most impact on children's online
experience, because it will help guide the development of this
online media culture for children. It focuses on content and
services directed at children, rather than focusing on what is not
intended for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Montgomery hailed the law for protecting children from
online marketers who otherwise might be tempted to use showy
contests, animated cartoon characters and the like to extract
information that parents would rather keep private. But businesses
are worried about the law's unanswered questions, many of which
will be taken up as regulators begin drafting the rules for how the
statute is to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The law does have the backing of some major industry players,
among them America Online, which has a children's section, and Time
Warner Inc., which has a site aimed at children. In a statement,
Arthur Sackler, a Time Warner vice president, said the law was ``a
compromise produced by the interested parties and not without some
pain to business.'' But he said he believed that commercial Web
site operators thought that regulation was important ``for that
special age category.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates have raised different concerns about the law.
Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, favors
online privacy protections for adults, too, and would have
preferred legislation based not on parental consent, but on the
idea of privacy for all.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed in part in response to a survey by the
Federal Trade Commission this year. After examining 212 children's
Web sites, the regulators found that though 88 percent of the sites
collected identifying details from their young visitors, only 23
percent advised them to seek their parents' permission before
disclosing the information.
</P>
<P>
   The new law helps correct that, said David Medine, associate
director for financial practices at the commission. ``It puts
parents in control of information collected from young children,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still much about the law that has to be worked out. For
one thing, it is unclear when it will go into effect. The law
specifies that its effective date can be up to 30 months from the
date it was signed. But Medine predicts that commission officials
will finish drafting regulations for carrying out the law much
sooner, so that the measure could be in force in 18 months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What exactly will be in the regulations is another big question.
Among the thorniest issues to be decided is exactly how parents are
to provide consent to the Web site operators.
</P>
<P>
   When the measure was discussed in Congress, legislators made it
clear that consent delivered by regular mail or some kind of online
credit card verification scheme would be acceptable. But the most
obvious way to give consent online, through e-mail, was viewed with
skepticism, in large part because it is easy for a child to send
disguised e-mail that seems as if it comes from a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Medine said he hoped that by the time the law went into effect,
technology would offer a solution, either through digital
signatures or another tamper-resistant mechanism that would give an
e-mail message the stamp of authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the industry is worried, said John Feldman, a Washington
lawyer who represents Web sites that offer children's content. If
only slower methods of granting permission, like postal mail, are
acceptable, he said, that will put a damper on the very quality
that makes the Internet so compelling: its ability to transmit
information instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy concerns have already had an effect on some children's
online selling strategies. Time Warner's Sports Illustrated for
Kids Web site used to market the print version of the children's
sports magazine by asking children interested in subscribing to
submit their names and addresses and other information by e-mail.
The e-mail message was followed up by a subscription letter to
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   That practice changed several months ago, largely in response to
privacy concerns. On the Sports Illustrated for Kids site, visitors
find a form to be printed out and sent back by regular mail. There
has been a price for the change: The number of subscriptions that
come from the Web site has fallen about 90 percent, the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richer, of Cyberkids, wonders if the law will also have an
unintended consequence, pushing children into sites meant for more
mature audiences, because it will be cumbersome for them to get
permission to view some children's sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is making it harder for kids to get into Web
sites specially targeted for them,'' she said. ``So where are they
going to go? Adult sites.''

ILL WINDS BLOW AFTER ANGELS SIGN VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Today is traditionally the biggest shopping day of the
year. But if you're a major league baseball team that waited until
after Thanksgiving, the coolest Bernie Baby is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's signing of Bernie Williams by the Yankees for $87
million over seven years, and of Mo Vaughn by the Angels for $80
million over six years, settled the fates of baseball's top two
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   It also settled the debate about whether baseball, after its
1998 year of exclamation points, has returned to good grace
following the strike-shortened 1994 season and subsequent fan
disenchantment.
</P>
<P>
   In a word: No.
</P>
<P>
   Although the contract figures were not unexpected, the enormity
was again stupefying, not to mention sobering to those drunk on the
gee-whiz theatrics of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to conclude that baseball was back, Sports
Illustrated and other chroniclers confused the '98 season's
short-term euphoria with long-term health. Spectacular and
inspiring as was the home-run chase, it was a one-time thing.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the widespread public response to
McGwire or Sosa matching their feats a year later would be a
resounding, ``So?''
</P>
<P>
   The pennant races have been baseball's annual constants. Last
season, there were few, because the wealthy haves were so superior
to the many have-nots. The postseason had more than a few moments,
but will be remembered by the dominance of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Given the personable natures of manager Joe Torre and nearly all
of his players, and the balanced, more selfless style the Yankees
evinced, their dominance was not nearly as odious as it would have
been with past Yankee teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge payroll that produced the quality depth on the
roster crushed hope of the underdogs. Economic inequality remains
baseball's apparently incurable cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If you've followed baseball, you know that isn't news. What is
news is that the Angels have abandoned the comfort of a have-not
position.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Walt Disney in drag, and you have a rough approximation
of the shock value in the signing of Vaughn by Anaheim. Under
former owner Gene Autry, the Angels, despite the rich Orange County
market, never drew especially well, never went big time and never
won much in the shadow of the venerated Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, that hadn't changed under ownership by The Disney Co.
Sure, they tricked up the ballpark, but that's what theme-park
hucksters do.
</P>
<P>
   But by massively overpaying for Vaughn, the Angels have jumped
naked into the pool at the party. And while everybody stares,
they're seeking more attention, because they are desperately trying
to sign Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit may well sign with Arizona, perhaps as soon as
today. But the Angels' sincere pursuit indicates they are tired of
their traditional September chokes. They also have become aware of
the obvious: There is nobody in their way in the American League
West.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Texas Rangers are under new and more aggressive
ownership, Disney has the resources to overspend with the best.
With Seattle taking a more conservative path and Oakland a
non-player financially, Disney recognizes that negative cash flow
during the season will be outweighed by regular postseason
contention through the game's easiest portal, the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers setting fire to their own traditions and
market, the opportunity is at hand to make a move. It is a move
apparently reserved for those media mega-corporations that have a
greater need for programming than they do cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   If the forecasted sale of the Yankees by George Steinbrenner to
another media giant, Cablevision, goes through shortly, not only
will it signal the biggest sale in North American sports history,
it will create even more economic separation.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision would join Disney, Fox (Dodgers) and Turner (Braves)
as baseball owners who don't have to care whether their team makes
money as long as they fill 162-plus days a year with programming.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball still has room for individual owners such as Dick
Jacobs in Cleveland and Peter Angelos in Baltimore, but ultimately
their days are numbered. The imminent sale of the Yankees and the
recent sale of the Dodgers have ratcheted up franchise values so
high that smaller-fry ownerships have almost no choice but to cash
in. And even individual owners are no panacea: See Florida's Wayne
Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   The aggravating irony in all of this is that ownerships somehow
manage to conceal their potential gains in franchise equity while
extorting cities for tax money to stem temporary cash-flow losses.
But as has been said many times, no one has ever gone broke
underestimating the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly non-glamour franchises in places like Minnesota,
Kansas City, Montreal and Pittsburgh are not as valuable. But those
owners, when they choose to sell, stand to recoup more than their
investment.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Vaughn and Williams are unimaginably rich this
morning, and Johnson may be soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Unit appears to have won his gamble. A while ago he was
convinced that Mariner ownership wouldn't pay him Greg Maddux
money. So he pitched poorly enough to get himself traded out of
Seattle, yet well enough with a new rent-a-team to have multiple
suitors willing to play him $12 million-plus annually, and
guarantee him four years.
</P>
<P>
   By age 39, at the end of a four-year deal, Johnson may need
bifocals to see the strike zone. If John Kruk was afraid to stay in
the batter's box when Johnson had good vision, imagine the hitters'
dismay in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Much as I have criticized ownership for bungling the Johnson
affair, his pending contract in this market at his age would be the
equivalent of swallowing an anvil. That doesn't excuse Mariner
management from failing to finesse Johnson into a much earlier,
cheaper, shorter signing, nor does it get them off the hook for so
far failing to replace his annual 20 wins, nor the extra 8,000 or
so tickets he was worth per appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It does make the point that baseball's marketplace is warped
beyond recognition for the vast majority of its teams. In the real
world, it is absurd to suggest Vaughn is worth $13 million to play
a season of baseball. Then again, it is absurd to pay Ken Griffey
Jr. $8 million, so the Mariner predicament in this fantasy world is
one of degree, not kind.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another in the next couple of years, Mariner owners
are going to have to pay Griffey and Alex Rodriguez more, perhaps
considerably more, than the deals recorded this week, just to keep
up with the Angels. The other choices: Sell the club, or be happy
to share the bottom rung with Montreal and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   If that predicament is a truer indicator of baseball's health,
then McGwire and Sosa will need to hit 99 homers apiece in '99 to
keep everyone fooled.

NEWS ANALYSIS: CHANCELLOR ISN'T AROUND TO EXPLAIN LOWER SCORES
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three months ago, the city Board of Education gave
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew a 25 percent raise and an extension of
his contract, saying that the school system was on the way up. But
new state data raise troubling questions about how much impact the
chancellor's policies have had on the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, state education officials announced that because of
declining scores on a state reading test, they had added 21 schools
to the list of failing schools in the city, bringing the total to
97 schools, the most in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Then this week Crew reluctantly confirmed that state test scores
had declined not just in the worst schools but in schools across
the city. In response to requests from news organizations under the
Freedom of Information Act, he released data showing that
third-grade performance on a reading test given last spring had
dropped 4.2 percentage points, while sixth-grade scores had dropped
5.3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Crew made his announcements by press release, and declined to
elaborate. When the state list of failing schools came out, he was
on a personal trip to Connecticut, according to a spokeswoman. When
the state test scores were released he was away for the
Thanksgiving holiday.
</P>
<P>
   His silence and distance spoke volumes. For a chancellor who has
promised to fashion a ``performance-driven'' school system, the
decline in test scores and the rising number of failing schools
were troubling developments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a change in state law gave Crew more direct control
over superintendents and principals. But how well he has used his
increased power _ and whether it is better than the old system _
has to be measured not just in salutes up the chain of command but
in how his policies play out in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   As Crew begins his fourth year, he is discovering _ as other
chancellors have before him _ that it is hard to control what
happens in 1,100 schools. A look at state test scores over much of
the last decade shows them fluctuating according to the dictates of
some kind of chaos theory, a little better here and a little worse
there, but ultimately not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, because of political expedience, any chancellor
tries to make a big deal of scores that go up a few points from one
year to the next, when what's important is the long haul,'' said
Raymond Domanico, executive director of the Public Education
Association, a nonprofit group that monitors school performance.
</P>
<P>
   Crew was not reticent when it came to celebrating improvements
in school performance. A year ago, he traveled to Albany to join
State Education Commissioner Richard Mills in a triumphal
announcement that 18 failing schools in New York City _ more than
ever before _ had improved enough to be taken off the list of
``schools under registration review.'' (Another 18 were taken off
this year, while 21 were added.)
</P>
<P>
   Last June, he called a press conference to announce jubilantly
that scores on a reading test given by the city had risen by 2.3
percentage points, the second consecutive year of improvement.
``This is not a fluke,'' Crew boldly declared at Board of Education
headquarters in Brooklyn, surrounded by nearly all of his district
superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Domanico suggested that Crew had made too much of the good news
and not enough of the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Crew and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have all but ignored the state
monitoring and test scores this year. Last August, when Crew was
granted a four-year contract extension and a $50,000 raise, to
$245,000, his supporters cited the results of the city test,
deflecting questions about reports from some school superintendents
that state scores had gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Crew has increased central control of the system, but has shied
away from other, more costly, initiatives that parents and teachers
say could touch children's lives more directly, like reducing class
size and allowing schools to do more direct hiring of teachers.
Last year, the average elementary school class in the city had 28
pupils compared with 22 in the rest of the state, according to
state statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rudy Crew really wants to raise standards, which is just
rhetoric, if that's the truth, the only way it can be done is by
following the lead of other school systems in the country,'' said
Cecilia Rubino, a parent who is active at her son's school, P.S.
321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ``We have to support our teachers by
realizing that if there is that number of children in the room,
some of them are just going to slip past.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides to Crew say he is not trying to paper over a problem.
Rather, they say, he believes the city test is simply a better
measure of students' reading skills than the state test.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the chancellor values the city test, schools may
have spent more time preparing for it. ``That message definitely
got out,'' said Robert Riccobono, superintendent of in East New
York, Brooklyn. The only district that showed a notable increase in
state reading scores _ up 11 points in third grade and 14 points in
sixth grade _ was the chancellor's district, which consists of
schools taken over by Crew because they were failing.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Tobias, director of assessment for city schools, said he
would not be able to analyze the data from the state test until
scores for schools outside New York City had been reported. If
scores in the rest of the state also declined, he said, that would
be a red flag. Such unanimity, he said, is often caused by
something about the test _ perhaps test preparation or a change in
questions _ rather than by what children learned in class.

SENATORS DOMINATE ISLANDERS 4-1 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ Nearly two months into the season, it is
becoming increasingly difficult to predict which Islanders team is
going to show up on a given night.
</P>
<P>
   One night, they find a way to beat one of the league's most
talented teams in the Philadelphia Flyers. On the very next night,
they cannot find the net against the less talented Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, 24 hours after defeating Philadelphia on Long
Island, the Islanders were defeated by the senators, 4-1, in front
of 14,607 at the Corel Center. The loss ended the Islanders'
two-game winning streak and was Ottawa's fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders (10-12), who have not beaten the senators (10-6-3)
since 1996-97, were shut down by a stifling zone trap defense and
nearly shut out by goalie Damian Rhodes, who made 26 saves.
Islanders goalie Wade Flaherty, who started for just the second
time this season, made 28 stops. Flaherty has lost both starts.
</P>
<P>
   The senators got goals from Aleksei Yashin, Vaclav Prospal,
Lance Pitlick and an empty-net goal from Shaun Van Allen. The
Islanders got their goal from defenseman Scott Lachance at 13
minutes 51 seconds of the third period, bringing them to within
3-1. By then it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   During the first period the Islanders struggled on offense. But
the senators scored only once against Flaherty, who was outstanding
in turning away 11 shots. Their first goal was scored by Yashin at
18:46. His shot was stopped by the pad of an Islanders defenseman,
but the puck came right back to Yashin, who beat a sprawling
Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty continued to rescue the Islanders in the second period
_ he had 12 more saves _ but Ottawa scored again on a rebound shot.
At 18:18, Prospal put the puck past Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   KENNY JONSSON, the Islanders' top defenseman, who sustained a
concussion last week against the Colorado Avalanche, did not travel
with the team to Ottawa. He scored the first goal in the Islanders'
4-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday night, but
left the game with a headache after the second period. He remained
in New York on Thursday for further testing and rest. His return is
not likely until the Dec. 2 game against the Rangers, at the
earliest.

RARE STAMPS WORTH $1 MILLION ARE STOLEN AFTER SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What Jeffrey Forster considers art looks to most
people like a stack of old mail. But in the rarefied world of
philately, his collection of 1869 stamps _ most still affixed to
their original envelopes _ are masterpieces worth an estimated $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Forster's precious collection was stolen outside
the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where it had been one of
several collections on display at the Postage Stamp Mega Event.
</P>
<P>
   Forster, 53, a lawyer from San Jose, Calif., said the theft
occurred on Sunday afternoon as he left the exhibition hall with a
locked briefcase holding his stamp collection and two other pieces
of luggage. Forster said he set his bags near the curb and turned
his back for a few seconds to hail a cab. When he turned back
around, the briefcase was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they had no leads in the case, but Forster said
he remained hopeful the stamps, which are fully insured, would be
found. In a telephone interview Thursday, he said he was offering a
$25,000 reward for the return of his collection.
</P>
<P>
   The theft, believed to be the largest ever of rare stamps,
brought a sad end to one of the most prestigious stamp exhibitions
of the year and has ignited panic among stamp collectors across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a shiver through the hobby,'' said Bill Welch, editor
of the American Philatelist, the journal of the 56,000-member
American Philatelic Society. ``It simply underscores the point that
when you're traveling with your stamps, you can't let them out of
your grip for one second.''
</P>
<P>
   Linn's Stamp News, a weekly publication based in Sidney, Ohio,
that is sent to some 70,000 subscribers, reported the theft on its
front page under the headline ``Million-Dollar Collection Swiped
from a New York Sidewalk.'' Its publisher and editor, Michael
Laurence, said collectors who heard the news have discussed plans
to increase the insurance on their stamps and ways to make stamp
exhibitions safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are like rare works of art,'' Laurence said.
</P>
<P>
   The theft was most distressing, of course, to Forster, a
business lawyer who spent 25 years acquiring his collection and
exhibited it at stamp shows around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectors of stamps, just like art collectors or collectors
of rare books, are caretakers of history,'' he said. ``We are
simply preserving these things for the next generation of
collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   The stamps in Forster's collection, issued for eight months in
1869, are rare because they were examples of the first two-color
pictorial stamps ever printed in the United States. Before this
series, stamps featured only the faces of dead presidents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 12-cent-stamp was a green stamp depicting the steamship
Adriatic. The 15-cent stamp had a brown-and-blue scene of Columbus'
arrival in the New World. And the 24-cent stamp was a
green-and-violet vignette of the famous Turnbull painting of the
signing of the Declaration of Independence that is so detailed,
Forster said, that with the help of a magnifying glass it is
possible to distinguish the faces of the signers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these stamps came out, people hated them,'' Laurence
said. ``They didn't like the two colors and they thought it was
inappropriate to put pictures on stamps. But collectors loved them
from the moment they were printed.''
</P>
<P>
   Forster's collection was also rare, he said, because the stamps
are affixed to their original envelopes, and many of them traveled
to exotic corners of the world, including Natal, the South African
province, and St. Helena, the South Atlantic island where Napoleon
died in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Often the letters took weeks to reach their destinations, making
stops at several international post offices along the way. At each
stop, the envelope would be stamped with a date and the name of the
town. The more postal markings on a stamp and its envelope _ called
a ``cover'' by philatelists _ the more valuable it is to the
collector.
</P>
<P>
   Forster said one of the most valuable pieces in his collection,
an item valued at $50,000 to $60,000, is a bright yellow 10-cent
stamp, with an eagle on a shield, that is affixed to an envelope
that was sent in 1870 from Rochester to a city in the old West
German province of Baden called Bruchsal. The envelope had markings
from post offices in New York City, Bremen and Bruchsal, where it
arrived three weeks after it was mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Another valuable stamp in the Forster collection is the 90-cent
stamp of President Lincoln, his image in carmine and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamp collectors do this because it's fun,'' said Laurence,
himself a collector for 50 years. ``The hunt for rare items takes a
lot of determination and dedication. It's a great way to learn
about history, and a great way to learn about geography.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a financial incentive, he acknowledged. ``The
economics of it are quite good, too,'' he said. ``Rare stamps, over
time, have held their value rather decisively.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Forster said that while saddened by his loss, he
will continue to hunt for gems on the corners of old envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamp collecting is a passion for me,'' he said. ``Even though
it's sort of a dark day right now, it will still remain a
passion.''

VALENTIN BEREZHKOV, 82, INTERPRETER FOR STALIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Valentin Berezhkov, a Russian who interpreted for Stalin and
Molotov at conferences that they, Roosevelt and Churchill attended
during World War II, died Nov. 20 at his home in Claremont, Calif.
He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   At his death he was the Diane and Guilford Glazer distinguished
visiting professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had the good fortune to be witness to some of the
events that have helped shape our century,'' Berezhkov wrote in his
volume of memoirs, ``At Stalin's Side: His Interpreter's Memoirs
from the October Revolution to the Fall of the Dictator's Empire''
(1994, Carol). He was also a Soviet diplomat and a journalist
during the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, with the Soviet system disintegrating, he and his
wife Valeria moved to Claremont. He went on to teach at Pomona,
Pitzer and Harvey Mudd Colleges, all in California, before going to
Occidental. The subjects he taught included World War II and the
Cold War. He also lectured widely about Russia and about
Russian-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   In his book Berezhkov, a tall, strapping man with flowing white
hair, recorded his impression of Stalin when he first saw him, late
in 1941 in Moscow. At that time Berezhkov was a promising young
interpreter. He had been picked to work for Stalin, who was meeting
with a British-American delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took a look at him, I felt a shock,'' Berezhkov wrote.
``He was completely unlike the image of Stalin I had formed in my
mind. He was short and haggard, his tired face, covered with
smallpox scars, was the color of the earth. His uniform hung
loosely on his lean frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezhkov also recalled: ``Stalin always treated me in the same,
even indifferent, manner. Sometimes it seemed to me that he was
looking right through me.'' But he described Stalin's fury after he
was kept awake by a blind peasant's barking dog: He ordered a guard
to kill the dog, saying that if the guard failed to do so, ``I will
order you killed, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the book came out, Berezhkov recalled that
sometimes Stalin would ask a nervous subordinate suspiciously:
``Why don't you look me in the eye? What are you afraid of? Why are
your eyes shifting around?''
</P>
<P>
   Berezhkov also wrote that just before Stalin met with Roosevelt
at the Tehran Conference in 1943, the Soviet leader paid careful
attention to the placing of the furniture, and ``It occurred to me
he might be nervous before his meeting with Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the two leaders got together, he recalled, ``They asked
about each other's health, spoke about the harm of smoking and the
benefits of fresh air. It was beginning to look like a meeting of
old pals.'' At the conference, attended also by Churchill,
agreement was achieved about the extent and scheduling of military
operations against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Berezhkov was born in St. Petersburg, studied English and German
and received an engineering degree in 1938 from the University of
Kiev. After serving in the Soviet navy he went on to become an aide
to Molotov, the Soviet foreign minister, and an official of the
Soviet Embassy in Berlin in the period leading up to the German
invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1940 he accompanied Molotov to Hitler's office in Berlin
and shook hands with Hitler. ``His palm was cold and damp,'' he
wrote in the book, ``giving me an unpleasant sensation, as if I
were touching a reptile.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war Berezhkov became a journalist in the Soviet Union
and rose to be a high editor of the foreign affairs weekly New
Times and of the journal U.S.A. Economics, Politics and Ideology.
In 1974 he received a doctorate in international relations from the
Soviet Academy of Science in Moscow. From 1978 to 1983 he was a
high official of the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Berezhkov's 1940 marriage to his first wife, Galina, ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his second wife, Valeria, whom he married in 1966, he is
survived by two sons, both of Moscow: Sergei _ who interprets for
President Boris Yeltsin and for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of
Russia _ and Alexei; and five grandchildren.

BABBITT CONSIDERS PROTECTION PLAN FOR 400,000 ACRES NORTH OF
CANYON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Threats from encroaching civilization are leading Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt to consider greater federal protection for
a vast swath of Arizona wilderness at the west end of the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400,000 acres of the North Rim's Shivwits Plateau are
under study for a possible national monument.
</P>
<P>
   It is some of the most isolated, mysterious and surprisingly
beautiful land in the Southwest, settled by Mormon pioneer ranchers
last century and coveted by hunters for trophy mule deer.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape flows from pine-studded volcanoes, across
grasslands and waves of pinon-juniper shrub to multicolored gorges,
reaches of the Grand Canyon that are not within the million acres
of Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the plateau _ named Shivwits for a band of Paiute
Indians _ is subject to a variety of development pressures: uranium
and copper mining, housing subdivisions and wildcat roadways carved
by off-highway vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is nowhere I know of _ in the lower 48 states _
where you have this great, intact expanse that is not all chopped
up,'' Babbitt said at the end of a fact-finding tour of the area
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also happens to be the most pristine rim area in the entire
Grand Canyon system. It is the most wild. Some people might say
then, `Why bother?' My response is, that is the lesson of history:
If you don't think about it before the problems are on you, then
you have controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument _
declared without any advance notice by President Clinton in the
heat of the 1996 presidential campaign _ there is no imminent
development of coal, oil or other resources here.
</P>
<P>
   The area is crossed by fewer than 25,000 vehicles annually, and
some places like Kelly Point, overlooking a 180-degree turn of the
Colorado river, is visited by fewer than 200 people each year.
</P>
<P>
   But after touring the area with his top assistants, regional
land administrators and some of the nation's leading
conservationists, Babbitt said he fears it is only a matter of time
before this land is discovered by the general public and pressure
mounts to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty or 100 years from now, it could be very different,'' he
said. ``We need to think carefully about how we manage this for the
long term, as part of our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of surprising local interests and blind-siding local
politicians, Babbitt wants to avoid the backlash that erupted after
the Grand Staircase-Escalante move. He wants to talk with ranchers,
hunters and Arizona's congressional delegation, starting with Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., to build a consensus before recommending any
particular action to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers, miners, loggers and oil drillers were not invited on
Babbitt's initial rendezvous, and they remain suspicious of the
secretary's motives.
</P>
<P>
   They fear an erosion of property and development rights, noting
the region's evolution of federal land restrictions _ wilderness to
monuments to parks _ over the past century, as steady as the
Colorado River's roar through the Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, environmentalists see an opportunity to close the
loop on a region of northern Arizona and southern Utah they
envision as a massive wildlife stronghold, a place where the modern
world's march of species extinctions could be halted, and even
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Antiquities Act, Congress as well as the president can
establish a national monument, and Babbitt is weighing the
intricate legal ramifications of the various ways the area can be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open to a big, wide-ranging discussion. Legislation has
not been easy to come by in the last six years,'' Babbitt said of
his time at Interior.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Arizona governor is determined to take action.
And with only two years left in the Clinton administration, Babbitt
knows his time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'd like to bring it to closure on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts have already begun, Babbitt said, to heal the damage
inflicted by over-grazing, over-logging and suppression of natural
fires across the Shivwits.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four years, Babbitt has nurtured a forest
restoration project on Mount Trumbull, one of the highest peaks on
the Canyon's north rim. And regional chiefs of the National Park
Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management are working in
tandem to restore grasslands by setting controlled fires, removing
an overabundance of shrubs and restricting livestock numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt says more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Simply expanding Grand Canyon National Park, however, would mean
an end to hunting and ranching, destroying some of the cultural
values of the area that Babbitt said he wants to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Heaton's grandfather homesteaded a ranch at the mouth of
Whitmore Canyon, where upward of 600 head of cattle roam the
Canyon's esplanade. And Heaton's helicopters annually fetch about
10,000 river rafters up from Whitmore Rapids to the Heaton family
dude ranch on the canyon's rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a land grab. I think it's just a way of
enlarging Grand Canyon National Park,'' said Heaton, whose
80,000-acre ranch once included an additional 50,000 acres to the
east, before Congress passed the Grand Canyon Enlargement Act of
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Arizona Strip is a place we love because it's our
home. We don't need the government to close it up so we can't use
it. If they end up taking it away from us, that would be
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees no need for the government to take any further actions.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bundy's father and grandfather homesteaded land just west of
Heaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that they would meet with us and set some guidelines,
so we know where we stand,'' said Bundy, who together with uncle
Atwood, cousin Orvel and nephews Arlin and Denice run upward of 580
head of cattle across 60,000 acres of the Shivwits that federal
land managers refer to as ``Bundy Country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a change like that, you're sort of scared,
because you really don't know what they might want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Snyder, spokesman for People for the USA!, formerly People
for the West!, is worried that Babbitt is trying to divide his
organization, which promotes ranching, mining, logging and oil
drilling on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said his members believed Clinton abused his power when
he declared the 1.7 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very much against the way that was done, and how
many acres he took,'' Snyder said. ``If it (Babbitt's discussions)
is aboveboard . . ., if he's looking for consensus with hunters and
ranchers, I would think that would greatly ease the way.''
</P>
<P>
   A national monument designation, Babbitt said, would allow
hunting and ranching to continue, but would block development of
mines and subdivisions, push noise from tourist aircraft farther
from the canyon, and preserve the natural quiet, isolation and the
wildness of the place.
</P>
<P>
   After hiking through snow to the top of 6,990-foot Mount
Dellenbaugh, Babbitt ran his fingers along the black rocks where
three deserters from the original Grand Canyon mapping party of
John Wesley Powell scraped their names in the blistering August of
1869.
</P>
<P>
   ``This . . . really is classic canyon country,'' Babbitt said.
``I wasn't expecting to see such wonderful examples of great, long
mesas running all the way out above the river; of colorful side
canyons; the pine forests; the way the land kind of drapes down off
these rims.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is only a few hours' drive from booming Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Taylor, BLM field manager for the Arizona Strip _ the 3
million acres of Arizona separated from the rest of the state by
the Colorado River, said not a week goes by without calls from
real-estate speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rapidly expanding area,'' said Ed Norton, vice
president of National Trust for Historic Preservation, who believes
the Clinton administration should move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake to wait until you can do everything
when you can do something. I think we have some real momentum here,
some real positive groundwork that has been laid,'' Norton said of
Babbitt's fact-finding tour.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kiernan, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Association, said he believes this is an opportunity for Congress
to reflect the recent polls across the nation, where land
preservation moves were widely approved by voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Shivwits, if it happens, would be the first new national
monument in Arizona since 1972, when Congress approved the obscure
Hohokam Pima National Monument south of Phoenix. But it would be
big enough to contain all of Arizona's 17 other federal monuments,
memorials and historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   And it would help connect a circle of parks, monuments and
wilderness areas that Kelly Burke, director of the Grand Canyon
Wildlands Council, said will be needed in the future to prevent
wildlife from slowly disappearing on ever dwindling islands of
undeveloped wild land.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists are finding that many forms of wildlife need vast
areas to survive, to migrate, to diversify their genes, to move
with shifting climate conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to protect and restore native biodiversity and the
ecological richness in this whole area,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Barnard, president of the Grand Canyon Trust, said his
group is seeking a way to plan the future of what he calls the
``Greater Grand Canyon,'' which includes almost all of northern
Arizona and southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a national monument designation could connect together some
of these fragmented jurisdictions and provide an overlay of
consistent conservation management, and restoration of wildness,
and restoration of healthy ecosystems, we'd be all for it,''
Barnard said. &QL;

MCCAIN EXPLORING OPTIONS IN IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., says he'll need to make
a decision in the next few weeks on whether to run for president.
In the meantime, he's been stepping up his contacts in the two
states that would matter most.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Iowa Republican Party says McCain called
after the Nov. 3 elections ``and asked if his people could come
visit with me.'' McCain also sent the Iowa media English and
Spanish versions of a videotaped campaign ad he used in his Arizona
re-election campaign, said the chairman, Steve Grubbs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sent similar videotapes to party leaders in New
Hampshire, said Stephen Duprey, state GOP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Enclosed with the tapes was a memo that said, in essence: You
can be conservative, but you have to stand for something, not just
be a naysayer. The memo sounded GOP themes of fiscal conservatism,
a strong national defense, and pragmatic but compassionate
government programs, according to Duprey.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, which will hold its caucuses in February 2000, is
traditionally the first step in the winnowing process for
presidential candidates. New Hampshire's primary comes closely
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, 62, who easily won a third Senate term on Nov. 3,
insists he hasn't decided whether to run for president, and there's
no reason to doubt him. But at the least, his deliberations are
entering their final phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through a process now where I'm considering it, and
I have to make a decision in the next few weeks,'' McCain told
CNBC's Chris Matthews this week. The senator was not available to
elaborate, said his press secretary, Nancy Ives. Ives said that
even if McCain made a ``personal decision'' in the next few weeks
to seek the presidency, he might not announce his intentions until
later on.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is ``currently in the process of talking to his family,
his constituents in Arizona and to opinion-makers about the
process,'' Ives said. McCain has a wife, Cindy, and four school-age
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (also) talking to those who have had a role in other
presidential campaigns and getting a feel for what he would need to
go through to run a successful campaign,'' Ives said.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that candidates must begin organizing at
least by the early part of 1999 to successfully raise funds, hire
campaign consultants and build staffs in key states for the next
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential candidates, in cluding Steve Forbes and Lamar
Alexander, who both ran unsuccess fully in 1996, already have
staffs in Iowa. Like McCain, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who tops
the field of possible GOP contenders in many polls, has no Iowa
staff.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Iowa activities _ he also visited the state for GOP
events in May and August _ have led some McCain watchers to assume
he's already running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word is trickling out of Iowa that McCain is beginning to
round up staff to work the Iowa presiden tial caucuses, which take
place 15 months from now,'' Broadcasting and Cable magazine
reported last week. The magazine tracks the senator because of the
influence he exerts on the telecommunications industry as the
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, members of McCain's staff say they understand why his
forays into the Iowa and New Hampshire political machinery may have
nurtured expectations that he will run. But his staff says McCain
is merely talking to as many people as possible to gauge what
chance he might have of winning the GOP nomination and the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In his contemplations, McCain has sought advice from noted Re
publican strategists, including Ken Duberstein, President Reagan's
for mer chief of staff; and Vin Weber, a former Minnesota
congressman. Weber has been described by the National Journal as
``one of the strongest Republican strategists of the Reagan-Bush
era, a member of the leadership with strong conserva tive stands on
issues from taxes to abortion and also a shrewd political
realist.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is making all the right moves, New Hampshire GOP chair
man Duprey says.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator spoke to the New Hampshire GOP women's Li
lac Luncheon in May and was the guest of former New Hampshire Sen.
Warren Rudman in early fall.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a good working knowledge of Iowa, too, and not just
because of his visits. Two of his top staff members, Mark Salter in
Washington and Arizona-based ad ministrative assistant Deb Gullett,
are from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain probably would be considered a non-traditional
candi date in the Iowa caucuses. Conven tional wisdom says
presidential candidates must move to the right and show the party's
conservative colors in advance of the early GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has been cultivating an independent streak. In fact,
he says he doesn't mind being called a ``maverick'' as long as it
is also noted that he is a serious legislator.
</P>
<P>
   McCain generally earns high marks from conservative groups for
his votes on abortion, gay rights, welfare reform and other issues.
But he bucked his party's leadership in pushing both an
anti-tobacco bill and a measure to reduce the influ ence of big
money in federal campaigns. Both bills ultimately died.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said during the campaign finance debate that his
sponsorship of the measure could hurt his presidential chances by
alienating some of the big givers to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   But Grubbs said McCain would find his niche among Iowa voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd get pretty passion ate support from some people,
which is all you need to get going,'' Grubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 100,000 people participate in the Iowa caucuses. It's a
very small universe.'' &QL;

MUSEUM DIRECTOR CONSIDERING RUN FOR MAYOR'S OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betsy Gotbaum, executive director of the New-York
Historical Society and a former New York City commissioner of parks
and recreation, has been in and out of city government for almost
three decades without running for office. But on Thursday, she said
she was thinking of running for mayor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' the never-shy Ms. Gotbaum, 60, told a caller after
her husband, the retired municipal labor leader Victor Gotbaum,
dropped a hint in a television news interview that his wife might
be interested in becoming the first woman mayor in the city's
history.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may not seek a third consecutive
term, and, with almost three years to go, the field is wide open.
Some Democrats most often mentioned as possible candidates are the
City Council Speaker Peter Vallone; City Comptroller Alan Hevesi;
Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, and Public Advocate Mark
Green. Ms. Gotbaum's name has occasionally come up in the last few
months, but most active Democrats said they considered her a long
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gotbaum, who has been a teacher, an investment banker and a
fund-raiser, has worked for social-service organizations, the
Police Department and the city's Board of Education. She was parks
commissioner during the administration of David Dinkins, and knows
city politics and virtually all the movers and shakers in town.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has not explored campaign fund raising or tested
the waters for support. But, she said: ``I have more experience
than a lot of people. I've worked for almost every mayor since John
Lindsay. I raise a lot of money. I've never run for office. But
that's not a bad thing. Who knows? I could get there.''

SOWARD EXPECTS TO MAKE BIG SPLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If R. Jay Soward is talking, he must be healthy.
Or at least nearly healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Soward was in high spirits Thursday looking toward Saturday's
game with Notre Dame, although he said he was not quite 100 percent
recovered from the sprained ankle he suffered three weeks ago
against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to start. I'm to going to return kicks. I'm going to
return punts. I'm going to do it all,'' Soward said. ``They're
going to have to carry me off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he is eager to return punts because he hasn't had as
many opportunities as he would prefer this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it as much as this season as I should have,''
Soward said. ``I will do it a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward has split time with Larry Parker on punt returns after a
couple early-season fumbles. He did not return punts or kicks
against UCLA because he was not completely recovered from the ankle
injury.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said Soward's ankle was about 80 percent
recovered during the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   After Hackett said he would hold Soward out of Thursday's
practice, Soward ended up practicing most of the session before
getting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the coaches to just pick your spots with him,'' Hackett
said. ``I came out here and he was returning punts and kickoffs. I
decided to shut him down for 48 hours. He can make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Two true freshmen: If Notre Dame chooses to go with freshman
quarterback Arnaz Battle, it could be the first time in the series
that both teams start nonredshirt freshmen at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Bob Davie said he hasn't decided who will
start, but Battle is expected to get the nod over sophomore Eric
Chappell.
</P>
<P>
   Regular starter Jarious Jackson is out after partially tearing
the medial collateral ligament in his right knee against LSU last
week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Better news for Gibson, Davis: Although two key defensive
players received treatment Thursday and did not practice, Hackett
believed linebacker David Gibson and defensive tackle Ennis Davis
will both be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was encouraged,'' Hackett said. ``I feel both will be ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notre Dame arrives: Notre Dame landed in Southern California
on Thursday night and will practice today in Orange County. Because
of the uncertainty over the Irish's quarterback position, Davie has
taped remarks to be played at today's annual Notre Dame-USC
luncheon in Los Angeles. The luncheon traditionally hosts both
school's coaches.
</P>
<P>
   __ Penalty race: The Trojans actually dropped to third among the
Pacific-10 Conference's most penalized teams after having just
three infractions against UCLA. Through 11 games, USC has 109
penalties, which is six less than conference-leader California and
three less than Oregon State. Both of those teams have completed
their season, so the Trojans, with two games remaining, will
probably win the title.

RECOVERY OF RELIC CONFIRMS PARISH'S FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whether it was prayers or detectives that finally
flushed the thief, no one can say. But two days after an amulet
said to contain a sliver of bone from St. Jude vanished from a
Roman Catholic church in Brooklyn, it was back home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A local resident found the amulet near a park bench outside the
Bayview Houses shortly before noon on Thanksgiving Day, the police
said. The resident, the police added, then took it back to St. Jude
Roman Catholic Church in Canarsie, where it has rested since the
parish was established 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Jude is our patron saint, the patron of hopeless causes
and difficult cases,'' said the Rev. Matteo Rizzo, the parish
priest. ``I can't help but think he was guiding or directing things
to make sure the amulet came back to us safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said he believed that the amulet, which has the relic
hanging inside from a cloth cross, had been stolen sometime Tuesday
night. It was discovered missing on Wednesday morning by workers
preparing for a children's Mass, and detectives from the 69th
Precinct were dispatched to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked around the clock interviewing churchgoers and
neighbors, Rizzo put out the word that no questions would be asked
if the amulet miraculously reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Joseph Cardinale, head of the 69th Precinct detective squad
and a former parishioner at the church, said it was unclear why
anyone would steal the polished brass encasement, noting that it
had virtually no material value. He said detectives speculated that
someone had mistaken it for gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the people who took it were juveniles with nothing
better to do,'' Cardinale said. ``Because it was locked up, they
felt it had value.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who found and returned the amulet was not a suspect,
Cardinale said, adding that the man had asked that his name not be
released.
</P>
<P>
   The amulet is now locked in the church rectory, where it will
remain until protective wrought iron can be installed around its
case, Rizzo said before blessing his Thanksgiving dinner. He added
that nothing had ever been stolen from the church before, although
there was evidence that a few weeks ago someone tried to force open
a collection box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' he said, ``that people are so troubled or
desperate that they would come into a house of worship and commit
such an act of desecration, but maybe their conscience did finally
bother them. I'm just glad St. Jude has heard our prayers. Thank
God.''

SURGEON ATTACKED IN BROOKLYN HOSPITAL ELEVATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A surgeon who was on his way to visit a patient was
repeatedly stabbed in an elevator of a Brooklyn hospital Thursday
during an apparent robbery attempt, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Magdy Bouraee, 48, was in stable condition Thursday night
with wounds to his neck, face and arm at Lutheran Medical Center,
where the attack occurred and where he has worked for nearly 20
years, said Myles Davis, a senior vice president at the hospital.
The wounds were not life-threatening, and Davis said that the
prognosis for Bouraee, who underwent surgery, was ``excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Bouraee withdrew cash from an automated teller
machine in the hospital's lobby around 3:15 p.m. and then walked 25
feet to the elevator and got in with another man.
</P>
<P>
   Between the lobby and the fourth floor, where Bouraee was going
to check on one of his patients, the man grabbed him from behind in
a choke hold and stabbed him four times, in the neck, near the
right eye, in a forearm and a hand, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   When the elevator stopped on the fourth floor, the attacker
fled, leaving the doctor slumped in the car, Davis said. A large
folding knife was found in the car, he said. It was not known
whether any money was taken, Davis said, but police said robbery
appeared to be the motive for the attack. Police said they had no
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to say whether a video camera was in the
elevator, but he said the hospital was secure. He said that in his
nearly 20 years at the hospital, he had never heard of any attacks
there.
</P>
<P>
   Bouraee, who attended medical school in Cairo, lives in Bay
Ridge, Brooklyn, with his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   He was not scheduled to work Thursday, but hospital officials
said doctors often visited their patients on days off. A neighbor
of Bouraee, Chris Reinke, described him as equally devoted to his
family and his profession.

JAPAN'S FINANCE MINISTER MAY STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a key figure in
efforts to revive Japan's economy and stave off a global recession,
suggested Friday that he would step down formally from politics and
from his Cabinet post at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move, which has apparently been in the works for a while,
may raise questions about Japan's economic policy, in part because
Miyazawa had more credibility and connections with the West than
other Japanese politicians. But it is unlikely that Miyazawa's
resignation will lead to dramatic changes in Japanese economic
policy, and he may well continue to exert enormous influence from
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, finance ministers in Japan generally have less
influence than the bureaucrats who work under them. Miyazawa was
unusually authoritative, for he was a former prime minister as well
as a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat. He also tended to agree
with the judgments of the bureaucrats working under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I have to make sure the budget gets done right,''
Miyazawa said Friday, as quoted by Kyodo News Service. A spokesman
for his office said that Miyazawa will step down as finance
minister when he resigns as leader of his political faction within
the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, who heads what is effectively the second-most-powerful
political faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, suggested
that he would step down from that party position at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the departure from formal politics of Miyazawa,
who is 79, reflects a generational shift that has been taking hold
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa has been considered one of the two most influential
politicians in Japan, along with Noboru Takeshita, who still has a
strong grip on the political strategy behind the scenes. Within the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Miyazawa's resignation will make
way for Koichi Kato, 59, who will take over Miyazawa's faction and
will become a candidate for prime minister in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians like Kato have been exerting greater influence on
major policy and personnel decisions, and it was partly because of
his opposition that the Liberal Democrats rejected proposals to
stimulate the economy by cutting the national consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians who are even younger, such as Nobuaki Ishihara
and Yasuhisa Shiozaki, both Liberal Democrats, have at times gained
surprising influence in helping build the party's strategy on
economic and banking policy.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa has helped shape Japan's policy for years, particularly
in economic relations between the United States and Japan. At
virtually every step of the way, he has been the architect of the
nation's strategy to rescue the banking system and to revive the
recessionary economy, Japan's worst since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although U.S. officials have generally admired him _ he
speaks almost perfect English _ there has been annoyance in
Washington lately that he has not pushed for more stimulus of the
Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa was the prime minister for three years, until 1993. For
many Americans who have not met him, he is probably best known for
holding the state banquet that was an embarrassment for President
Bush. It was Miyazawa's lap into which Bush threw up when he
suddenly fell sick on an official visit to Tokyo.

SPORTS BUSINESS: A STUDY IN MUTUAL NEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Does the collapse of the talks for Cablevision
Systems to buy a majority of the Yankees mean that Cablevision is
less likely to retain the team's cable-television rights on the MSG
Network?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful. First, the sale does not seem dead. Second, no
competitor to MSG has emerged for the Yankees' rights. A rival
would have to be built from scratch. ESPN wants to jump into the
regional sports cable business and could find building a local
channel anchored by the powerful, highly rated Yankees
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George should have been looking at alternatives before
he started trying to sell the team to Cablevision,'' said Bob
Gutkowski, president of the Marquee Group, a sports marketing
company, and the former president of Madison Square Garden. ``But I
think that deal will get done. It makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Cablevision-Yankee sale talks would have to
have been extremely acrimonious for Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner to snub MSG in the next cable deal. Certainly there is
no doubt that Charles Dolan, Cablevision's chairman, was upset by
the Steinbrenner camp's leaks in the news media about the price of
the deal and Steinbrenner's role after the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But Dolan knows MSG needs the Yankees, and Steinbrenner knows he
will still get a lot of cash by renewing the MSG deal that expires
after the 2000 season. ``The importance of the programming hasn't
changed,'' Gutkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Well before Cablevision bought Madison Square Garden, it
understood the dramatic, transformative role that buying the
Yankees rights played in turning MSG into a year-round service with
more than six million subscribers, triple the number before its
Yankee telecasts began in 1989. Cablevision's SportsChannel New
York service lost the Yankees' rights to MSG during a ferocious
bidding war in 1988, in the days before MSG and SportsChannel New
York (now Fox Sports New York) came under the same Cablevision
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' value to MSG means that Cablevision would gladly
pay extra to retain the team's rights, more than the current $40
million-a-year average. Cablevision wants to buy the Yankees to
keep the team on MSG in perpetuity and away from potential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The next best thing to buying most or all of the Yankees is to
own the television rights. ``It's preventive medicine against
encroachment from competitors,'' said Spencer Grimes, an analyst
for Salomon Smith Barney. ``You're preserving the value of the
regional network.''
</P>
<P>
   PAY-PER-VIEW PRESSURE
</P>
<P>
   When Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis fight on March 13 to
unite their heavyweight titles, they will be under pressure to make
a pay-per-view splash, even if TVKO shouldn't expect more than
700,000 buys.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Holyfield and Lewis lack charisma; together
they're not an electrifying duo, like Holyfield-Mike Tyson. Living
on past ferocity and current unpredictability, Tyson ropes in
casual and curious pay-per-viewers. Holyfield and Lewis are more
for core boxing fans who don't want to miss the unification bout,
but may see a dull fight.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two Holyfield-Tyson fights were the top
pay-per-view shows in boxing history, generating a combined 3.5
million purchases. In all, Tyson has been featured in seven of the
top 10 pay-per-view events, averaging 1.4 million buys.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has co-starred in three other top 10 pay-per-view
events, against George Foreman (1.45 million buys), Buster Douglas
(1.06 million) and Riddick Bowe (929,000), who all, to a degree,
lifted Holyfield's profile more than Lewis will.
</P>
<P>
   AIRWAVES
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets linebacker Bryan Cox delivered a vicious forearm
blow on Sunday to Tennessee's Eddie George as he was headed down to
the turf, CBS' Mark May praised Cox's initiative. ``I like that by
Bryan Cox,'' May said. ``As long as you don't get caught, you kind
of like that in a player _ that's nasty.'' (If there had been a
penalty flag, May would not have liked the play?)
</P>
<P>
   May's analysis was dumb at the time and sounds dumber in light
of Cox's being fined $10,000 on Wednesday by the National Football
League. Maybe Cox's post-fine tirade, in which he labeled the NFL a
racist organization, will lead to some intelligent commentary from
May, who is also black.

SEAHAWKS BEEF UP OFFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Tony Berti was almost 1,500 miles from home
and playing a strange position on a new team. But he couldn't have
been more thankful Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy business,'' the veteran offensive lineman said
after the Seahawks' Thanksgiving Day practice. ``I just got here
last night. But I'm excited for the opportunity and just happy to
have the chance to play again this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks signed Berti earlier in the day to a contract for
the rest of the season at the NFL minimum salary _ which in this
case will be 5/17ths of $325,000. To clear a roster spot, guard
Andrew Greene was released.
</P>
<P>
   Berti was released off injured reserve by the San Diego Chargers
on Tuesday and agreed to a deal with the Seahawks after clearing
waivers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get out of there since I've been healthy,
which was about six weeks ago,'' Berti said.
</P>
<P>
   The signing was not done in reaction to the news that center
Kevin Glover will miss the rest of the season with two herniated
discs and a pinched nerve in his back.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Berti started 30 games at right tackle
for the Chargers the past four seasons, and he can help the
Seahawks if someone is injured this season and challenge for a
starting job next season. Berti was playing right guard on the
scout team in practice on Thursday, but he could replace Howard
Ballard at right tackle next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a chance to get a look at a good player,'' vice
president of football operations Randy Mueller said. ``He's been a
starter in the league. He's got experience at tackle and guard.
It's pretty hard to pass on him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Chargers did _ twice. Berti was placed on injured
reserve in August after he had arthroscopic surgery on his left
shoulder to repair a partial tear in his rotator cuff. The club
knew it was only a six-to-eight-week injury, and that putting Berti
on IR meant losing him for the season. The Chargers released him
this week to clear room under their salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to numbers at the end of training camp, and I was
the odd number out,'' Berti said. ``There were some conflicts
between some ex-coaches and I last year. Some things happened that
were unfortunate. The Chargers wouldn't have kept me for next year,
I don't think.''

   Berti probably won't play Sunday against the Tennessee Oilers at
the Kingdome, but coach Dennis Erickson echoed Mueller's sentiments
about Berti's future with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good addition for us,'' Erickson said. ``We liked him
coming out of college and what we've seen from him in preparing for
the Chargers when we've played them in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover's situation was portrayed as potentially career-ending by
Erickson on Wednesday. But Thursday, Mueller said Glover would need
only arthroscopic surgery to remove the disc fragment that is
pinching the nerve in his back and causing numbness and pain in his
left leg. The rehabilitation period would be six-to-eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery is scheduled for the week of Dec. 7, Glover said,
unless his back takes a dramatic turn for the better in the next 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbness is always there,'' Glover said. ``The pain kind
of comes and goes. When the piece hits my nerve, I get real bad
shooting pains down my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover is remarkably calm when he discusses the possibility of
his 13-year career being over. That's because he has played in the
NFL since 1985, at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen far too many of my friends and teammates carried off
on stretchers,'' Glover said. ``So I'd be the last one to sit
around and complain about any injury. My career has gone too well
to do that. Whatever happens, I'm thankful for the time I have
had.''

   Granik says lockout hurting everyone &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
How to divide $2 billion?
</P>
<P>
   That's the dilemma facing NBA owners and the National Basketball
Players Association as the lockout drags on, now into its 150th
day.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to curb a salary scale that was spiraling ever
upward, NBA owners imposed the lockout July 1 until a new
collective-bargaining agreement could be reached with the players.
</P>
<P>
   Talks aimed at ending the lockout often have been bitter; the
only four-letter words apparently not uttered were ``take less.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides signed a labor agreement in 1995, but owners put
in a clause that allowed them to void that deal if the players
received more than 51.8 percent of basketball-related income (BRI).
Last season, teams paid out 57 percent of revenues to salaries and
are now looking for ``cost certainty,'' hoping to significantly
reduce the percentage of money going to player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   One way to do that would be to eliminate or restrict the Larry
Bird exception, which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to
re-sign their own free agents. The Bird exception is what allowed
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett to land the six-year, $126 million deal
from the Timberwolves that is so often used to illustrate
out-of-control salaries. It is a provision players are
understandably loath to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues have sprung up recently, such as the owners' demand
for a so-called ``timing rule'' change, which would force teams
that sign another team's free agent to give up the right to go over
the salary cap to re-sign their own Bird-exception free agents,
which was the case in the past _ a change the players are
resisting.
</P>
<P>
   But commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik
and the owners have stood firm, refusing to lift the lockout even
though it has caused the NBA to miss regular-season games for the
first time in its 52-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has lost 179 games through Friday and would be unable to
get up and running until Dec. 26 at the earliest, which would mean
a total of 358 games lost by then.
</P>
<P>
   Another casualty has been Saturday's planned bargaining session,
which was canceled by the league after a breakdown on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready, willing and able (to negotiate),'' union
executive director Billy Hunter said. ``I think Russ' last words to
me were that he would get back to me when he thought it was
appropriate. So what I'll do is wait. Just wait until he gets back
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik, who described himself as having a ``pessimistic''
outlook on the league's labor problems, recently took time out of
his schedule to discuss the lockout with the Houston Chronicle:
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Can David Stern declare an impasse in the negotiations, and
if so, will he?
</P>
<P>
   A.) Sure, he could, but one thing I can promise you is that it
will not happen. The owners have decided that they are going to
stay locked out until they make a fair deal. We are not going to
have a season if we don't have a fair deal. All those rumors about
us implementing something in December are baloney.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) There was talk that some player agents would push for a
strike come playoff time should the league declare an impasse,
which would cost the owners a significant amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   A.) I don't know what they (the agents) are thinking, but I'm
really telling you for sure that it (an impasse) won't happen.
We're just going to stay locked out, and if that means we miss the
whole season, then unfortunately we'll miss the whole season.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Here's a hypothetical question _ suppose you were a third
party being called in to review what the owners have on the table
and what the players have. If that were the case, do you think you
would believe that the two sides are so far apart to where there
are no discussions going on and there is talk of canceling the
season?
</P>
<P>
   A.) Of course you wouldn't believe that. I have people that I
know from some other areas who are very savvy businessmen, and they
say to me, `You can always make a deal when it's just about money.'
They say that there must be something here more than just money
involved. But I say, `No, it's primarily about money.' Yes, I think
a third party would have a hard time understanding why we can't
figure out how to divide up $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Is it getting hard for you to understand how that can
happen?
</P>
<P>
   A.) Sure, it's hard for me to understand. I can't understand the
positions the players have taken, but they've taken them and taken
them very strongly. That's what we have to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Some of the players feel that if the league would come in
with an absolute bottom-line offer, then it would stimulate
discussions within the union and be a big step toward ending the
lockout. Why don't you do that?
</P>
<P>
   A.) Yeah, but everybody in that position would say the same
thing to the other side: `Well, if you would just come in and tell
us absolutely what your bottom line is, then that would really be
helpful.' (laughs) Maybe they should do the same. Maybe they should
do that if they think that's a good way to negotiate. The problem
is that we're so far apart, even in the notions that we're talking
about, that it's not about how you negotiate it. We re-opened
because we reached too high a percentage (of BRI devoted to
salaries). So what's their proposal? That we should do more for the
minimum players, which we have agreed to do, and that we should do
more for the middle class, which we have agreed to do, at least in
part. And then, we shouldn't take anything away from guys at the
high end. Well, all that means that we are going to spend even more
money. So we're not on the same planet, and I don't know how we get
on the same planet. Their notions are all that the percentage
should go up, and that's something where the owners have said that
if we don't start getting (the percentage) down in a meaningful
way, then we don't have a business that we want to operate. It's
that simple. And I don't know how to convince the players of that.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Why is this change in the so-called timing rules so
important to the owners, considering how adamantly opposed the
players are to such a rule?
</P>
<P>
   A.) If you remember, this all started six months or more ago
about the Larry Bird exception. We wanted a hard cap, and what we
heard from the players was, `The one thing we can't give up is the
Larry Bird exception.' So we've kind of jumped through hoops to
keep that Larry Bird exception alive. But we're saying from our end
that what we have to do is get the percentage (of BRI) down, and
that's not going happen if teams can first go sign free agents
while keeping their Bird free agents on the shelf, and then go over
the cap (by re-signing) their Larry Bird players. If you want to
use the Larry Bird exception because you have some key players on
your team that you want to keep and pay them over the cap, then do
that. But don't try and do both. It's just another example of where
the players want us to spend more money, not less. That's not going
to get a deal done. We're saying that we've worked out something
where we can keep the Bird exception, but we want you to keep it in
the spirit of the Bird exception, not just as some device that
allows you to keep going over the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But can the continued lockout really be good for the owners?
</P>
<P>
   A.) It's terrible for the owners, but the only thing that would
be worse would be continuing to play under an economic system that
makes no financial sense. So they (the owners) don't have a lot of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) While you don't want to set a drop-dead date as to when the
season will be canceled, realistically you have to admit that the
window of opportunity is closing as far as saving the season, don't
you?
</P>
<P>
   A.) I think we are getting more and more concerned, and I think
that's one reason we have said that even though we haven't made any
progress, we think we owe it to ourselves and our fans to give it
one more shot. We're not going to set a drop-dead date because that
would just sound like a threat. But we just know that eventually as
each day goes by, we're all going to turn around and realize that
we can't play a season. But to just throw a date out there now,
that's not going to make it any easier to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Are you concerned with the general apathy on the fans' part
over the postponement and possible cancellation of the NBA season?
</P>
<P>
   A.) I'm not sure what's better, to have apathy or an uproar. I
don't know which is worse. But I can understand fans feeling upset
about what's going on and not understanding it. But there's not a
lot we can do about it, unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Has the NBA decided what is going to happen to peripheral
things on the NBA calendar, like the All-Star Game, the trade
deadline and the date at which contracts become guaranteed for the
rest of the season?
</P>
<P>
   A.) The truthful answer is no. I kind of believe all those
things will have to be done, but I think that if we could make a
deal everybody is going to be very flexible on those kinds of
issues and understand that we're going to be in an extreme
situation and that we're going to have to make special kinds of
rules for a year. But we haven't spent any time thinking about
those things yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) It was widely reported that tremendous progress was made on
a number of issues in last Friday's bargaining session. Was that
the case?
</P>
<P>
   A.) Well, I think we made a little bit of progress Friday, which
is more than we made prior to Friday. But we're still very, very
far apart on a wide range of issues, so I'm not particularly
optimistic right now.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) What is it going to take for progress to be made in future
negotiations?
</P>
<P>
   A.) I don't know. I'm getting very discouraged, so I don't know.
It's hard for me to see where the progress is going to come from.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) Is there any one issue you can define as the major point of
contention?
</P>
<P>
   A.) I can't. There's too many. There's at least half a dozen
very, very important issues that we're nowhere close on.
</P>
<P>
   Q.) There's no way to prioritize those?
</P>
<P>
   A.) I really don't see any.

WILLIAM MILLER, CHEMIST WORKED ON A-BOMB TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Taylor Miller, an organic chemist and expert in fluorine
chemistry who worked on the team that built the atomic bomb in
World War II, died on Nov. 15 at the Cayuga Medical Center in
Ithaca, N.Y. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Miller spent 41 years on the faculty at Cornell University,
where he was a professor of chemistry from 1947 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Winston-Salem, N.C., he graduated from Duke
University and received a Ph.D. in organic chemistry there in 1935
before joining the Cornell faculty as an instructor the next year.
His early research in organofluorine chemistry led to his
recruitment for the Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   The task was to create materials, like lubricants or pump oil,
that would not react with highly corrosive uranium gas. His team
developed novel polymers that made possible the separation of the
fissionable isotope uranium-235.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the American Chemical Society, he received its award
for creative work in fluorine chemistry in 1974. He was also a
member of Britain's Royal Society of Chemistry, and in 1986 he was
awarded the Moissan Centenary Medal in Paris, named in honor of
Henri Moissan, who discovered the element fluorine in 1886 and won
a Nobel Prize in chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is survived by his wife of 47 years, Betty Robb Miller,
and his brother, Robert L., of Panama City, Fla.
