<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Chairman Sees New Liberia Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The current Chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Ghana's
President Jerry Rawlings, is to launch a new peace initiative in
Liberia, an ECOWAS official said today in the Ghanaian capital of
Accra.
</P>
<P>
Victor Gbeho, the ECOWAS Chairman's special representative in
Liberia, was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying that
military aspects of the Liberian peace accord signed in the
Nigerian capital of Abuja last August have stalled.
</P>
<P>
He said that Rawlings would convene, as soon as possible, a
meeting of foreign ministers of the ECOWAS committee of nine on
Liberia to discuss how to move forward.
</P>
<P>
He will also step up his campaign for foreign donors to
provide logistics for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Liberia, which was plunged into civil war in December 1989
when former civil servant Charles Taylor invaded the country, has
seen no peace in spite of about one dozen peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja Accord, under which the country was to return to
civilian rule in one year, has fallen behind schedule as the
important issues of encampment, disarmament and integration of
fighters into the society are yet to be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Britain To Give Grant Of 6.4 Million US Dollars To Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is to receive a
grant of 3.5 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 6.4 million US
Dollars) from Britain.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued here today by the British High
Commission here said that the money would provide a balance of
payment to the government of Tanznia.
</P>
<P>
The British pledge to resume aid was made by the British
Minister for International Cooperation, Ms. Linda Chalker, during
her visit to Tanzania early this year.
</P>
<P>
Britain along with some other donor countries had stopped
granting aid to Tanzania in November, 1994, due to poor tax
collection by the government which led to a loss of over 70
billion Tanzania Shillings (about 127 million US Dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The document stated the importance and the advantages of a

Libya, Malta, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia
and Turkey).
</P>
<P>
The proposed priorities of action include the establishment of

<HEADLINE> Chirac Stresses French Support for Lebanon's Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said here today his country supports Lebanon's independence and
sovereignty and respects the security of Lebanon's territories
within its internationally-recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
In his address to more than 100 members of the Lebanese
parliament and senior government officials, Chirac recalled a long
history of friendship between the two countries, noting that
France will never stop the struggle for a just and comprehensive
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of (1989) Taif Accord, and since the end of
the 15-year civil war in 1990, the era of peace, reforms and
reconstruction has come, said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon had constituted a "model state" in this region,
because in Lebanon all the citizens of various classes and sects
are co-existing and sharing the administration.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he has noted a real huge change, as well as a
gradual process of reconstruction in Lebanon in the past years.
</P>
<P>
The future would only be created by the Lebanese themselves,
and on their shoulders is a responsibility to give the peace a
real meaning, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The political reform (in Lebanon) should be completed in a
framework of respecting the public freedom and democratic value
which are desired by all the Lebanese," the French president added.
</P>
<P>
"France believes that the peace is approaching," he said. "And
it hopes that 1996 will be a decisive year in which peace
agreements between Syria and Israel, and between Lebanon and
Israel, will be concluded."
</P>
<P>
"Only through the just and lasting peace, Lebanon can recover
its sovereignty on all its lands, in accordance with of the United
Nations Security Council resolutions, especially resolution 425,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to dispel Lebanon's fear that the fate of this
country could be decided in another place, the French president
stressed that a peace which is not "freely" agreed with by the
Lebanese people and ignores Lebanon's whole rights on the
sovereignty will be an "incomplete peace."
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival in the Lebanese capital this
afternoon on the first leg of his tour in the region, the French
president held a meeting with his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a French president to Lebanon since
it gained independence from a French mandate in 1943, and this is
also the first visit by a Western president to this country since
the end of the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Americans Sent Checks to Support U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
received 666 checks from 1,421 U.S. citizens who expressed support
for the organization, a U.N. spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for the secretary-general, said at
today's news briefing that the total amount received as of March
31 stood at 8,587.84 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first two checks came here in last September and the number
of personal checks addressed to U.N. increased month by month
since then. March saw arrival of 308 checks, representing a 50
percent growth over February and tripling that in January.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Department of Public Information also provided copies
of letters from U.S. citizens who criticized U.S. Administration's
arrears.
</P>
<P>
In a letter published by the New York Times, Hudson Stoddard
wrote, "It is high time for the United States to fulfill its legal
and financial obligations to the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"More than 200 citizens of my town recently sent personal
checks for $4.40 each to the United Nations, representing a per
capita share of America's arrears of $1.2 billion," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a token, to be sure, but we are dismayed by the
refusal of this great nation to meet its treaty obligations," he
added.
</P>
<P>
A letter written by Judith Inskeer and Ronald Inskeer and
published by Gannet Westchester on March 26 read, "As concerned
world citizens, we are dismayed by the United States is in arrears
in paying its dues to the United Nations. Responding to an e-mail
suggestion, we wrote a check to the U.N. for $14, two people's
share of the debt, and sent it to Sen. D'Amato with a letter
asking him to forward the check to the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations was owed 3.2 billion dollars as of March 15,
including 1.3 billion for the regular budget and 1.9 billion for
peace-keeping operations. The arrears of the United States alone
amounted to 1.2 billion dollars. The chronical financial crisis
has limited the organization's programs and hampered its
activities.

<HEADLINE> UK Finance Minister Launches By-Election Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke predicted today that the ruling Conservative Party
will win the by-election in Staffordshire despite an opinion poll
showing the Opposition Labour ahead, according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
The by-election is caused by the death of sitting Tory
parliament member Sir David Lightbown last December. Under a
convention of the House of Commons, a by-election is held within
three months of the seat becoming vacant. The British government
has decided to hold the by-election on April 11.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 general election, Lightbown won the seat with a
majority of 7,192.
</P>
<P>
It is generally considered that the by-election would be
bitter, with Labour fighting to maintain its poll momentum by
taking another by-election scalp.
</P>
<P>
And now the government is facing the prospect of its majority
in the parliament falling to one from the present two.
</P>
<P>
But during his campaign to back Tory candidate Jimmy James,
Clarke tried to convince voters by arguing that economy in Britain
is growing and the area is "poised to benefit" from Conservative
policies.
</P>
<P>
However, one official at Conservative Central Office admitted
that the date for the by-election was "unfortunate" because most
voters would not feel the benefit of one percent reduction in the
basic rate of tax until receiving pay packets at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper commented that the political
significance of the by-election is that it will test the extent to
which economic recovery is feeding through to a political recovery
for the Tories.
</P>
<P>
So far 13 political parties have named their candidates in the
fight for the seat.

ATHENS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos and his Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Pirinski underlined
their determination to further strengthen relations and promote
cooperation between the two Balkan neighbors after talks here
today.
</P>
<P>
Pirinski arrived here last night for a two-day official visit.
Prior to his meeting with Pangalos, Pirinski had separate talks
with Greek parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis and President
Kostis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Pirinski expressed particular satisfaction
over the assurances he had received from the Greek side that the
bilateral agreements recently signed concerning the waters of the
Nestos river, road arteries and border posts, would be ratified by
the Greek parliament immediately after Easter.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian foreign minister said there had been an identity
of views and ''readiness'' of the two countries to further develop
bilateral relations in the economic and commercial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Pirinski also noted an identity of views with regard to the
approach to problems in the Balkans, stressing the need for this
approach to be made with the participation of all the countries of
the region, on the basis of the principles of international law
and inter-Balkan cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said Pirinski had briefed him on the first-ever south
Balkans meeting on security cooperation in Tirana which greece did
not attend because Romania and Serbia had not been invited to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos reiterated Greece's position that no countries in the
region should be excluded from such meetings, which, he added,
should also be prepared better.
</P>
<P>
He said the next such meeting would be organized by Bulgaria
and expressed the hope that Greece's positions would be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Pirinski said that Sofia's positions on the issue were
identical with those of Athens, adding that Bulgaria's defense
minister had conveyed this "message" to the Tirana meeting.

LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture accounted for 1.5
percent of Britain's gross domestic product last year and 2.1
percent of the workforce, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times reported today that the data show that farmers
have enjoyed several years of rising incomes.

Last year, total income from farming rose 25.6 percent as grain
prices reached record levels and the weakness of sterling meant
European Union prices were higher for UK producers.

The value of farming's gross product in 1995 rose 14.8 percent
with interest payments up 11 percent and the cost of labour rising
just 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction to IRA's Easter Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
said today that the Easter message issued by the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), which refuses to renounce violence as a means to
settle the conflict in crisis-laden Northern Ireland, was not all
doom and gloom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Irish Radio, the Sinn Fein leader said the IRA
still recognized peace had to be achieved through negotiation
though it had refused to give up its campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the search and the need for peace settlement of
the conflict in Northern Ireland remained as urgent as it did 18
months ago.
</P>
<P>
But he once again demanded that the British government drop
preconditions on Sinn Fein's entry to the planned all-party talks
on the future of Ulster to be held on June 10.
</P>
<P>
John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party
(SDLP), the largest Catholic party in Northern Ireland also in
favor of the reunification of the whole Ireland, said that the
IRA's statement had contained some "positive elements", because
the IRA had indicated to facilitate unconditional peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The British government denounced the IRA's message but at the
same time said that the prospects for all-party talks would be
immeasurably improved if Sinn Fein was involved.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster economy minister Baroness Denton repeated that
the IRA ceasefire must be restored if Sinn Fein was involved.
</P>
<P>
She said that the government was working to open doors and find
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Ken Maginnis, security spokesman of the Ulster Unionist Party
which defends British rule over Northern Ireland, condemned the
IRA's statement, saying that the message meant that the IRA would
not restore cease-fire before the all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the smaller, but more radical
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said, he was not surprised by the
IRA's position because it was a "terrorist organization".
</P>
<P>
He urged the British government to "face up to reality" and
"put them down".

<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban student
militia said today that the newly declared Emir-ul-Momineen, head
of all Muslim believers in Afghanistan, was not parallel to the
government.
</P>
<P>
A source in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar told Xinhua by
telephone that the Taliban also said that the Emir-ul-Momineen is
not equivalent to an interim government either.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said that once they get hold of the capital Kabul,
the new Emir-ul-Momineen will become the head of the government.
</P>
<P>
They said the declaration of Taliban leader Mulla Omer as the
new Emir-ul-Momineen will not further divide Afghan people, as was
accused by the four-party alliance of the Supreme Coordination
Council of Islamic Revolutionary Afghanistan during a high-level
meeting held here today.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Islamic religious scholars from Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Iran have gathered in Kandahar, the headquarters of
the Taliban for a meeting since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mulla Omer was declared the
Emir-ul-Momineen for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A Peshawar-based journalist who is currently covering the
Kandahar meeting confirmed the holy war declared against Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and said it was declared by Afghan
religious scholars in a holy decree issued at the Kandahar meeting
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a moving ceremony to declare war against Rabbani, a holy
cloth of Islamic holy prophet Mohamood was shown to participants.
</P>
<P>
Pupils were raising slogans and women were weeping at the sight
of the holy cloth.
</P>
<P>
Aman-ullah Khan, an Afghan leader, declared holy war against
the British government 61 years ago by showing this piece of holy
cloth, the journalist told Xinhua.

LUSAKA, April 4 (Xinhua)-- Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority
(TAZARA) is currently installing a new communication system to
boost its efficiency and make the railway more competitive, a
TAZARA official announced today.
</P>
<P>
The railway's public relations officer Mwase Lungu told
reporters here that the company had now introduced a reliable
customer information service known as rail trackers to provide
spot information regarding the whereabouts of cargoes.
</P>
<P>
The rail trackers, an advanced cargo information system, were
developed and installed by the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD), Lungu said.
</P>
<P>
He said, UNCTAD officials would also install computers at
TAZARA's major stations at New Kapiri Mposhi, Mpika, Makambako
and Mbeya to be linked with the head office in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiaries from the whole system were Zambia,
Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The system will provide transport operators and auxiliary
professions with reliable, useful and immediate data on railway's
operations taking place on transport modes.
</P>
<P>
The 1,680-kilometer railway, linking coastal Tanzania and
landlocked Zambia, was built with Chinese assistance in 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Says No Policy Changes for SEZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng says that basic
policies for special economic zones and the Shanghai Pudong New
Area will remain as they are.
</P>
<P>
The remark came at a meeting on SEZs in Zhuhai, in south
China's Guangdong Province on April 3, where Li emphasized that
the government is determined to develop SEZs. The SEZs'
fundamental policies, and their position and function in opening
up, in reforms, and in modernization will remain unchanged, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government's decision for the SEZs is
correct, and that the reforms and development have been a success.
</P>
<P>
It is quite normal for some policies and methods to be changed
or perfected as the reforms and development increase, he
added. But, this will not affect the zone's advantages, and will
only strengthen them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about these advantages, he said that SEZs are a window
on reforms and opening up, and pilots for reforms in the economic
system, and should continue to experiment boldly and lead the
country in establishing a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Li said that each SEZ should work out specific plans to adapt
the economic growth mode to local realities. He called on them to
create new advantages in opening-up and reforming, and get
practical experience for managing foreign-funded enterprises with
laws.
</P>
<P>
Special economic zones should set an example for and should be
a driving force behind other parts of the country, which is
crucial to the economic development of central and western areas,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Processing companies in the SEZs are encouraged to move to the
central and western parts, he said, and that all enterprises are
encouraged in the same way to invest in these areas and develop
inland markets.
</P>
<P>
Li said he has high hopes for SEZs, saying that they should
serve as examples for other parts of the country in the promotion
of cultural and ideological progress, and in the improvement of
social security as well.
</P>
<P>
SEZs should not only be a model of reforms, opening up, and
economic development, but of cultural and ideological progress as
well, he noted, emphasizing that, under no circumstances, can
temporary development be allowed to be made at the expense of
cultural and ideological progress.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that priority be given to ideological and
moral construction, that free rein be given to the fine tradition
of the pioneering spirit, and that the efforts to build a clean
and efficient government and the struggle against corruption be
continued.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng visited Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Zhongshan cities from
March 30 to April 3.

<HEADLINE> UK May Take Legal Action over EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering to take legal action against the European Union (EU)
over its ban on British beef exports, according to British
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Parliament on Wednesday, Hogg was quoted as
saying that the EU ban was "not justified" and the British
government may take the case to the European Court of Justice to
try to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
"As to the legality, we are looking earnestly and urgently at
the legality of what has been done," he told MPs.
</P>
<P>
Local analyst say that any legal action could take many months,
and might prolong the crisis of confidence in British beef.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Hogg refused to endorse a package of
measures agreed by his EU counterparts to eradicate BSE, or mad
cow disease, and restore consumer confidence to Europe's beef
industry because they would not end the ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, EU agriculture commissioner, was quoted as
saying "it was too early to set a date" to lift the ban, as he was
determined to see new measures put in place before addressing the
issue of lifting the ban.
</P>
<P>
"We want to lift the ban as soon as possible, as soon as the
measures have an impact," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new measures include Britain's plans to destroy meat from
4.5 million older dairy cows at the end of their working life and
a wider slaughter of cow herds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British farmers have warned the government would
have to shoot them first if they want to kill their cows in a BSE
clampdown.
</P>
<P>
Antony Gibson of the National Farmers Union (NFU) is quoted by
the BBC television as saying he could not see any circumstances
under which it would be justified to kill entire herds.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Alliance Rejects Taliban Choice of Religious Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A high-level meeting of the
Afghan four-party alliance, the Supreme Coordination Council
Islamic Revolutionary Afghanistan (SCCIRA), today rejected the
Taliban student militia's decision on the country's religious
leader.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held here and chaired by former Afghan president
Sibghat Mujaddadi rejected the nomination of Taliban leader Mullah
Omer as the country's Emir-ul-Momineen, the head of all Muslim
believers in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"At present not a single Afghan qualify the criteria fixed in
the holy and sacred religion of Islam for an Emir-ul-Momineen,"
said a spokesman for Mujaddadi.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Islamic religious scholars from Pakistan,
Afghanistan and Iran have been attending a meeting in the southern
Afghan city of Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban, since last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The religious scholars pledged allegiance to Mullah Omer and
declared him the Emir-ul-Momineen.
</P>
<P>
The SCCIRA meeting said that a new Emir-ul-Momineen could
further complicate the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged the Taliban to cancel the decision, because
almost all Afghan leaders are now involved in internal fighting,
which is against of the norms of Islam, and not a single Afghan
fulfills the criteria for an Emir-ul-Momineen.
</P>
<P>
The late Maulvi Jamil Ur Rehman, head of Kunar province, and
incumbent Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani had declared
themselves as Emir-ul-Momineens of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting said neither of them fulfilled
responsibilities and duties of an Emir-ul-Momineen, and accused
them of pushing the country further into destruction and
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a report from Kabul said the Afghan
government today dismissed the Taliban militia's declaration of
holy war on Kabul as "ridiculous".
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched holy war on Wednesday during the Kandahar
meeting and refused outright to negotiate an end to fighting
around the besieged capital Kabul, just a day after UN peace envoy
to Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri told the government that the Taliban
were ready for talks the next day.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that the apparent stark contradiction
between the message conveyed by a top Taliban leader to Mestiri
and the one issued at the Kandahar meeting simply served to
highlight an ideological struggle within the faction.
</P>
<P>
"The two vastly contrasting signals show that the divisions
between the two opposing strands within the Taliban leadership are
now coming to the fore," a foreign ministry source was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the Taliban took control of most of the southern part
of Afghanistan during the last two years by force, they had not
declared holy war previously on any faction, as they claimed their
sole aim was to set up a peaceful Islamic state.

PYONGYANG -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
said today it will no longer maintain the status of both the
military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone (DMZ)
stretching across the divided Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The KPA (Korean People's Army) side shall give up its duty,
under the armistice agreement, concerning the maintenance and
control of the military demarcation line and DMZ," said a
statement released by a KPA spokesman at Panmunjom in the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said all the DPRK's personnel and vehicles
will no longer bear distinctive insignia and markings when
entering the joint security area at Panmunjom and the
demilitarized zone. The statement, which described the two steps
as "self-defensive measures," did not explain what was meant by
the KPA "giving up its duty" to maintain the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused South Korea of ignoring the 1953
armistice agreement by bringing tanks, artillery and heavy weapons
into the DMZ, deploying a large number of armed military personnel
there and building large military facilities in the zone.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Jailed for Opium Possession in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Larnaca Assize Court
today sentenced an Iranian to a two-year-and-half imprisonment for
import and possession of 410.35 grams of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency (CNA), Mahdi Vahabi from
Tehran was arrested upon arrival at Larnaca International Airport
on January 17, when a trained police dog found the drugs hidden in
his luggage.
</P>
<P>
Vahabi admitted that he had bought the drugs for personal use,
and that he did not know its possession was illegal on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the judges explained that the crimes, which the
Iranian admitted he had committed, were quite serious and that
the only appropriate sentence was that of an immediate
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The judges said, however, that they took into consideration
his young age, the lack of previous convictions, his cooperation
with police to shed light on the case, his confession and
the fact that he was using the drugs for himself.

HAIKOU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao today called on local
Party committees and officials to adhere to the correct political
orientation and to make greater efforts in the course of advancing
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during a visit to south China's Hainan
Province, where Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, talked about making
a strong political guarantee for goals of the next century. To do
so, he said, local committees and officials of the CPC must:
</P>
<P>
-- adhere to the Party's basic theories and to the Party line;
</P>
<P>
-- maintain the political situation of stability and unity and
a stable and orderly social environment;
</P>
<P>
-- provide strong spiritual and intellectual support for the
reforms and opening up, and for economic development; and
</P>
<P>
-- strengthen the building of party organizations, and offer
a strong organizational guarantee for economic construction and
social development.
</P>
<P>
Hu reiterated that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic line are
fundamental political guarantees for the country's modernization.
</P>
<P>
He also urged officials to strive to realize the
end-of-the-century goal by immersing themselves in the realities
of life and in the masses of people throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> IRA Refuses to Renounce Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
announced today that it is ready to help set up "meaningful" peace
negotiations, but warned that it would continue its campaign of
violence.
</P>
<P>
In an Easter statement issued in Dublin, the IRA asserted that
the current position of the British government prevents all those
in Ireland with a democratic mandate from sitting around the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the hopes of last Easter had been "slowly and
resentlessly strangled by Britain", it argued.
</P>
<P>
It said: "The IRA, whose mandate for armed struggle derives
from Britain's denial of the fundamental right of the Irish people
to national self-determination and sovereignty, has made its
position clear. We reaffirm that position."
</P>
<P>
The IRA declared that it remains fully committed to its
republican objectives, namely the reunification of the whole
island of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It stressed: "So long as Britain persists in its denial of
national and democratic rights in Ireland, then the IRA will
continue to assert those rights."
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments have agreed that all-party
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland would be convened
on June 10, but they stressed that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, would not be admitted to the talks unless the IRA gives up
violence and restore its cease-fire which it shattered with a big
bomb explosion in east London on February 9.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Nablus To Cool Tension between Police, Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat arrived in Nablus this afternoon in an effort
to calm down a tension between local Palestinian police and
students.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Arafat decided to set up special guard units for
Palestinian universities to prevent people not engaged in studies
from entering university campuses.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat ordered Nablus police chief to be removed
from his post and transferred to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 Palestinian police entered the An-Najah University
campus Saturday and fired bullets and tear gas to disperse
hundreds of Hamas supporters protesting against the arrest of Hamas
activists by the Palestinian security forces. During the raid a
number of students were injured.
</P>
<P>
An investigation has since been carried out under the
instructions of Arafat. On Wednesday, several hundred students
from An-Najah university and other West bank universities
gathered in Ramallah in protest against the raid, while the
legislative Palestinian Council met in the city for a two-day
session.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was consequently shadowed by the
intra-Palestinian tensions.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Nablus by helicopter from Ramallah where he
attended the PC meeting. After the meeting Arafat also visited
the family of Tayseer Lawzi, a Fatah activist in Ramallah.

<P>
PYONGYANG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) said today it will no longer maintain the status
of both the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone
(DMZ) stretching across the divided Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The KPA (Korean People's Army) side shall give up its duty,

<P>
The statement also said all the DPRK's personnel and vehicles

demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which described the two steps as "self-defensive

its duty" to maintain the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement accused South Korea of ignoring the 1953
armistice agreement by bringing tanks, artillery and heavy weapons
into the DMZ, deploying a large number of armed military personnel
there and building large military facilities in the zone.
</P>
<P>
This had turned the DMZ into an "armed zone and a new attack
position for the invasion of the north", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has made us no longer unilaterally observe
articles of the armistice agreement concerning DMZ," said the
statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
</P>
<P>
The six-kilometer-wide demilitarized zone, established by the
armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953, extends roughly along
the 38th parallel that marked the divide between North and South
when the war began in 1950.

<HEADLINE> Fruit Trees Helping People of Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- In 1990, farmers' income from
fruit only accounted for one twentieth of their total income in
mountainous Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China, but
by 1995, per-capita net income averaged 1,446 yuan (about 174 US
dollars), one-eighth of which came from fruit.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has become a major fruit producer, with fruit
production reaching 56 kg per capita in 1995, against 21.6 kg in
1990.
</P>
<P>
People used to blame poverty on the shortage of farmland. On
average, each person owns 0.27 ha of hilly land and only 0.057 ha
of paddy field.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, the autonomous regional government
encouraged people to take advantage of geography and the
subtropical climate to plant fruit trees over the past decade, and
in recent years, has given priority to tract development in the
mountains and has helped fruit growers to have more access to
markets.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, Guangxi's total value of fruit
production saw an annual increase of 22 percent, to seven billion
yuan (about 843 million US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The region has 12 national-level and 68 regional-level fruit
trading bases, with fruit planting increasing from 320,000 ha in
1990 to 730,000 ha in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the 730,000 ha, only 270,000 are producing fruit, but
experts say that after five years, when the trees are bearing
fruit, they will bring 20 billion to 30 billion yuan to the
region.

<HEADLINE> New S. Africa Customs Regulations Welcomed In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Shipping agents in Zimbabwe have
welcomed the decision by South Africa's Customs Department to
revise stringent regulations on transit cargo moving through
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today, the Shipping and Forwarding
Agents's Association of Zimbabwe said the revised regulations
will not adversely affect Zimbabwe's economy, currently heavily
dependent on South African trade routes.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa Customs Department last November proposed new
regulations that would call for a cash deposit for Zimbabwean
imports and exports equivalent to 125 percent of the actual duty
paid if the goods were being imported into South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The association said the regulations had since been
significantly revised following strong criticism received from
the private sector in neighboring countries, among them,
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
It said the South Africa Customs Department had stated that
under the revised regulations, which came into effect on March 1,
and that legitimate traders would not be affected by the
requirement for a cash deposit, provided certain criteria were
met.
</P>
<P>
"The revised regulations for goods moving through South Africa
will not cause disruption to traffic and will not adversely
affect the economy of Zimbabwe," the association said.
</P>
<P>
It said the South Africa Commissioner of Customs had pledged
that the regulations would be revised on an on-going basis, and
was inviting recommendations to improve the system.

<HEADLINE> Mediators to Persuade Hamas Leaders to Stop Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- An 11-member group of
Palestinian mediators are due to travel to Jordan on Saturday to
persuade the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, to stop
anti-Israeli attacks, Israel Radio said today.
</P>
<P>
Among the mediators is Marwan Barghouti, secretary-general of
the Fatah movement in the West Bank and a member of the
Palestinian Council.
</P>
<P>
The group will meet Hamas leaders in Jordan and ask them to
stop anti-Israeli attacks to reduce tension in the Palestinian
areas following the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) crackdown
on Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Since the recent wave of Hamas suicide bombing attacks in
Israel, the Palestinian police have arrested more than 600
Hamas activists.
</P>
<P>
Some Hamas activists captured by the Palestinian police said
that the Hamas leaders abroad were responsible for directing the
armed attacks.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the PNA crackdown, the Hamas organization in
the Gaza Strip last week vowed to resume suicide attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian mediators have issued a joint statement calling
on Hamas to end suicide attacks and on the PNA to release Hamas
activists.
</P>
<P>
The team has also visited some jailed Hamas leaders to
try to launch a dialogue between the Islamic extremist
organization and the PNA.

MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Chess Federation president
Andrei Makarov on Thursday called for more international pressure
to nib the plan for a world championship match in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Makarov said that should Baghdad host the match, it "will cover
FIDE (the International Chess Federation) and all chess lovers
with shame."
</P>
<P>
Early, FIDE under the reins of Kirsan Ilumzhinov, planed to
stage its world championship match between Russian Anatoly Karpov
and American Gata Kamsky in Baghdad in June.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion triggered off protests from the U.S. government
as well as chess circles in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Makarov said only joint efforts of national chess federations
could make FIDE leaders to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
European chess federations are scheduled to meet April 27-28 in
Utrecht, the Netherlands, to tackle the issue.

<HEADLINE> Liu Limin Wins Speciality at China's Champions' Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 4 (Xinhua/OANA) -- World University Games gold
medalist Liu Limin saved her energy at the heats to chalk up the
women's 100-meter butterfly crown here on Thursday at the China's
Champions' Tourney.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who clocked a disappointing 1:01.61 for the fourth spot in
the heats, stormed back tonight to touch home first at 59.57
seconds for a margin of 0.04 seconds ahead of teenager runner-up
Cai Huiyu.
</P>
<P>
Cai, a native of Shanghai, was also second in the heats at
1:01.33.
</P>
<P>
"I was not satisfied with the results," said Zhao Ge, coach of
Liu, "the timing is abnormal for her."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the heats, Zhao pinned the hope upon Liu, saying she
would take the gold medal with ease.
</P>
<P>
But Liu was not at her top form today physically, the coach
explained, adding "I don't think she performed well, neither in
the preliminaries nor in the finals."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Cai, 16, gold medalist in the Urban Games
last October, amused herself with the silver medal as her timing
was her career best.
</P>
<P>
"However, I am not surprised at the result," said the
1.74-meter girl in a confident manner.
</P>
<P>
Qu Yun, top finisher in the heats, had to settle for the third
position.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona Olympic gold medalist Lin Li took the silver at
2:30.64 in the women's 200-meter breaststroke which was won by
another veteran Yuan Yuan, world championship silver medalist.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, national record holder of the event, clocked in 2:28.53,
which was 2.28 seconds behind the best of the year set by Amanda
Beard at the U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
Han Xue, world short course 50-meter breaststroke record
holder, finished a miserable fifth.
</P>
<P>
The men's 100-meter backstroke title went to Zhao Yan who
clocked 56.77 seconds by chopping 0.73 seconds off the national
mark set by Lin Laijiu five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lin finished a modest fourth place.

<HEADLINE> Goals for China's Housing Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest heavily in
residential housing in the next five years to provide nine sq m
per capita in housing by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
This means China will build more than 1.2 billion sq m of new
residential housing during the five-year period, Li Zhendong,
vice-minister of construction, told a national meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The amount of investment for the effort will account for about
five percent of the country's gross domestic product during the
period, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country is expected to put 236 billion yuan into
real estate development, a majority of which will be for housing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country invested 1.05 trillion
yuan in housing construction from 1979, when the reform and
opening up policies were initiated, to last year, completing a
total floor space of 2.55 billion sq m.
</P>
<P>
The per capita residential area rose from 3.6 sq m to 7.9 sq m
during the period, surpassing the goal of the Eighth Five-Year
Plan, which was 7.5 sq m for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the country provided housing for a total of 50
million urban families who were having serious difficulties during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The massive "Anju" (Comfortable Housing) project was launched
last year, with the goal of providing housing to low- and
medium-income city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Chinese government will set aside five billion
yuan in loans for the move, Li said.
</P>
<P>
While increasing housing, China also started a pilot project
for urban residential zones in 1990, to improve housing quality
and raise design standards.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Labor Unions Fails to Carry out Sit-in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Due to the security measures taken
by the security forces, Lebanon's powerful General Workers
Confederation (GWC) failed this afternoon to carry out a sit-in
planned to protest against the government's failure to meet workers
demands.
</P>
<P>
Labor union sources reported that the military forces and
police imposed a blockade around the GWC's headquarters on
Bdarou Road and prevented labor unionists from going out of
the building.
</P>
<P>
And the security forces also took tightened measures around
the parliament building, in front of which the sit-in had been
planned to take place.
</P>
<P>
The GWC called for the sit-in to press its demand during a
visit by French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in the Lebanese capital at 3:00 p.m. and is
scheduled to address the 128-seat parliament around 6:00 p.m..
</P>
<P>
According to their original plan, union leaders gathered in
the headquarters at 2:00 p.m. and they would leave for
the rally venue an hour later. But the government measures
foiled their plan.
</P>
<P>
The GWC, which groups various trade unions with an
estimated membership of 400,000, is demanding a 76 percent wage
increase with a retroactivity to January 1, 1996, and a
doubling of the minimum wage level to 500,000 Lebanese pounds
(313 dollars) from the present level of 250,000 Lebanese
pounds.
</P>
<P>
And it also asked the government to scrap a three-year-old ban
on street demonstrations and to suspend an implementation of a
controversial law aimed at organizing the country's broadcast
media industry by slashing Lebanon's 200 private TV and Radio
stations to no more than 20.
</P>
<P>
President of the GWC Elias Abu Rizk read out a statement,
which were planned to be read before protesters in front of the
parliament, in the confederation headquarters instead.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Abu Rizk stressed that the GWC persists
in the right of strikes, demonstrations, sit-ins as well as
other forms of expressions which are guaranteed by the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to take more actions to defend freedom, democracy and
"daily bread for living."
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that this was the second time for the
government of billionaire Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri to
thwart the powerful GWC without a face-to-face confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The government foiled another GWC plan to stage demonstrations
in major cities by authorizing the army to maintain law and order
and to enforce the demonstration ban. The army imposed in the
country a 11-hour curfew to prevent the labor unions from going
out to streets.

HONG KONG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Museum of history has
decided to extend by three months the on-going exhibition titled
"the Maritime Silk Route: 2000 Years of Trade on the South China
Sea" until the end of July, a spokesman of the museum said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, jointly presented by the Hong Kong Museum of
History, the Guangzhou Museum and the Guangdong Provincial Museum,
presents more than 100 exhibits including precious artifacts
unearthed along the South China coast, ship models, historical
pictures and rare relics recovered from Han tombs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that it introduces visitors to the
all-but-forgotten 2,000-year old Maritime Silk Route which began
from Guangzhou and then crossed the South China Sea and the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the show was originally scheduled
to be held from January 22 to April 28, but since its opening, it
has generated much interest, especially among teachers of Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
He said that many teachers and scholars are particularly
interested since the exhibition coincided with the curriculum of
secondary school Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he said, the museum will organize a second
round of lectures and educational activities during the extended
period of the exhibition.

High-yield hybrid rice has been planted on 13,000 hectares of
China's fields, the official said, and local governments have
taken planting the hybrid rice as a means of increasing grain
production.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been held responsible for training a number of
researchers, most of them young, and business executives in the
field of management, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Torch Plan, which was designed to apply high-tech
developments to production, has been used in conjunction with Plan
863, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Torch Plan has been applied in 52 state-level high-tech
development zones since it was launched seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the zones had implemented 6,000
projects, generating 181 billion yuan in industrial output value
and earning 3.35 billion US dollars from exports.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, China's high-tech industries are still
small in scale and account for only 10 percent of the country's
industrial added value, but with a good beginning and promising
prospects, and they will continue to grow.

<HEADLINE> Macao Imports New Type of Street Cleaning Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Macao has imported three new type of
street cleaning vehicles equipped with more efficient facilities and
five large special garbage transport trucks.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Macao Cleaning Co. Ltd. said the new vehicles
will be put into use soon to improve working efficiency, taking the
place of old type of street cleaning carts.
</P>
<P>
Made in the Netherlands, the new street cleaners have a much
stronger dust catching ability and is capable of holding four cubic
meters of garbage. The old street cleaning cart can only hold one
cubic meter of dust.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by using its specially equipped long vacuum pipe,
the new cleaner can clean places that can hardly be reached in
normal ways.
</P>
<P>
The five new garbage transport trucks are said to be the most
advanced model in the world. Each has a holding capacity of 12 tons,
thus largely improving working efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the new vehicles and related equipment
cost it over 10 million Patacas (about 1.30 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company now collects more than 450 tons of garbage each day,
about 80 percent of which are refuse of daily life.

BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China is successful in the fields
of biology, outer space, information science, lasers, automation,
energy, and new materials has drawn the world's attention,
especially in 36 items of key technology included in Plan 863,
drawn up by the government for high-tech research and development.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, vice-minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission, said that Plan 863, which began 10 years ago, has
helped development of high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
"The plan has allowed China to gain a footing in the global
high-tech arena," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the State Science and Technology
Commission, Chinese scientists have made a breakthrough in key
technology of super-computers for the 1990s and developed the
Shuguang-1000 large-scale parallel computer.
</P>
<P>
The Computer Integrated Manufacturing System Engineering
Research Center won a University Leader Prize from the American
Society of Manufacturing Engineers (ASME) in 1994. Last year the
Beijing No.1 Machine Tool Plant, applying CIMS techniques, won an
Industry Leader Prize from ASME.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Chinese scientists have also developed a
submarine robot capable of operating at a depth of 6,000 meters,
and that Plan 863 has been playing an important role in speeding
up development of high-tech industries and improving traditional
industries.
</P>
<P>
Genetic engineering in pharmaceuticals has laid the groundwork
for China's bio-technology industry, which has in turn provided
new means for agriculture to achieve sustainable growth. CIMS has
brought enormous economic returns to manufacturers, and robots
have been useful in pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The information industry has created a number of products with
Chinese intellectual property rights and good market prospects.

<HEADLINE> New Round Of Fighting Erupts In Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Serious fighting has erupted
between the forces loyal to Osman Hassan Ali Atto and those of
General Mohamed Farah Aidid in South Mogadishu today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which still continues is reported to have claimed
lives of many people including civilians. At this early stage, no
exact casualty figures are available since fighting is also
covering the area surrounding the main hospitals of South
Mogadishu, Benadir, Medina and Digfer.
</P>
<P>
According to our sources, fighting broke out when peace
negotiations between the opposing sides deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the two sides including General Abukar Aftoje, a
prominent general belonging to the Habar Gidir clan, were
mediating since the outbreak of Merca port conflict. General
Aftoje and his mediating men have left the country for Nairobi,
Kenya Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of General Aidid have put a precondition for the
mediation effort that Osman Atto's men should pull out of the
strategic points in South Mogadishu they occupied after
withdrawing from Merca, which was strongly denied by Osman Atto's
top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
These strategic points included the former US Embassy and the
university compound occupied earlier by the United Nations forces
during their failed operation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The loud noise of the anti-aircraft missiles, 106mm recoilless
rounds and heavy machine-guns being used by the warring sides
were heard throughout the war-torn capital.
</P>
<P>
At least two rounds of 106mm recoilless gun have hit the main
Bakara market of South Mogadishu where they caused heavy damage
to human lives and property.
</P>
<P>
According to supporters of Osman Atto, their men have repulsed
attacks by what they called the self-appointed forces of General
Aidid.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, militiamen of General Aidid have claimed a
victory over Osman Atto's men. However, there's no independent
confirmation in regard to the opposing claims.
</P>
<P>
Each side accused the opposing side of igniting the war.
However, there were reports that General Aidid has ordered his
men to disarm what he called the traitors of the Somali
government.
</P>
<P>
People in Mogadishu were shocked at the renewed fighting
between Osman Atto and General Aidid both of whom belong to the
same subclan of Habar Gidir. Hundreds of people were seen fleeing
the area of fighting, carrying very little of their belongings to
the relatively safer areas of the city. Dozens of patients were
also evacuated from Digfer and Benadir hospitals for safety
reasons.
</P>
<P>
This new round of fighting in Mogadishu started on a day when
a high-mission delegation from the European Community and the
United Nations is due to arrive here to meet leaders of the
Somali communities.
</P>
<P>
The delegation visited Somalia's central town of Beletuein
this morning. After visiting Mogadishu, the mission will also
tour Bardera and Kismayo in southern Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate on Eradication of Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen Weidian, a member of the Chinese delegation to the 52nd
session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, said that to
eradicate torture, which exists in almost every country, the
international community needs to strengthen cooperation in the
relentless fight against it on the basis of the Convention Against
Torture.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the adoption and effective implementation of
legislative, judicial and administrative measures by individual
countries in accordance with their specific conditions are vital
to the eradication of torture.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that a ban on all forms of torture and strict
punishment of all criminal acts of this kind are provided for in
Chinese laws. China's Constitution also provides for the
protection of all the basic rights of Chinese citizens from any
form of infringement.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law and other laws set
forth definitive provisions that allow no person, under any
pretext, to subject others to torture or maltreatment or to insult
their dignity, and that victims of torture have the right to claim
compensation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"These provisions have provided a practical and effective legal
framework for the prevention of torture," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's signing and ratification of the Convention
Against Torture gives further expression to its determination and
readiness to join other countries in the effort to gradually
eliminate all forms of torture.
</P>
<P>
In practise, Chen said, the Chinese government and judiciary
attach great importance to the investigation and handling of cases
involving torture.
</P>
<P>
While strengthening supervisory mechanisms by formulating and
improving rules and regulations on the prevention of torture, the
Chinese judiciary deals with every complaint of torture promptly
after it is filed, and those found guilty are punished according
to law, he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Chen said, China's procuratorial organs have
made timely suggestions for the correction of illegal practises in
investigation and adjudication procedures, and in custody or
detention.
</P>
<P>
Criminal cases involving the abuse of civil rights and personal
freedoms, such as illegal detention and using torture to coerce
confessions, have also been investigated and dealt with in an
earnest manner.
</P>
<P>
"Facts showed that law enforcement supervision has been greatly
strengthened in China," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example the amendment to the Criminal Procedure
Law recently adopted by China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendment, which guarantees the Chinese citizen's
legal rights and interests, will prevent cases from being
misjudged or framed, as well as prevent violations of human rights
during legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The amendment "indicates that China's criminal procedures and
the judicial system as a whole are improving and becoming more and
more mature," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Plan to List Chinese Airline Stocks in NY Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The decision to list the stocks of
two Chinese airlines in New York remains unchanged, a spokesman
with the Civil Aviation Administration of China said today.
</P>
<P>
The remark came in response to a Hong Kong newspaper report a
few days ago, which said that the plan to list China Eastern
Airlines and China Southern Airlines in New York has been
suspended and that the responsibility rests with CAAC. The
spokesman called the report "groundless".
</P>
<P>
The two state-owned airlines, which were chosen by the State
Council to experiment with issuing stock and with listing
overseas, have been preparing for the action with help from
intermediate organizations over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a great deal of progress has been made
in preparing for the listing, and that the delay was caused by
differences in the Chinese and western accounting systems, in how
property in land is handled, and in the specific method of
approach.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that CAAC has never waivered in its decision to
list the two airlines in New York, and has, in fact, been working
with relevant departments for the listing.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese FM in Nepal for Talks on Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Bhutanese Foreign Minister Dawa
Tshering arrived here today for a new round of bilateral talks on
the Bhutanese refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
The 7th-round talks on the refugee issue would be the first
Nepal- Bhutan dialogue at the foreign minister level on the
lingering problem between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Six rounds of bilateral talks at the home minister level from
1993 had made no progress on the settlement of the nearly 100,000
Bhutanese refugees living in Nepal for more than six year.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese refugees have been living in eight camps in
eastern Nepal since Bhutanese authorities compelled those of
Nepalese origin to flee their homes in Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries differ on how to repatriate the refugees
since the first-round talks on the issue in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Nepal maintained that all these refugees should be repatriated
while Bhutan only agreed to take back those it considered to be
genuine Bhutanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
As the Bhutanese refugees came to Nepal via the Indian
territory, the Nepali government earlier had asked India to
mediate the issue but India insisted that it was a bilateral issue
and could only be settled between Bhutan and Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Arrives in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived in Beirut this afternoon on the first leg of his
tour of the region where he will also visit Egypt and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's special plane landed at the Beirut International
Airport at 3:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
When the French President stepped down the plane, he was
greeted by his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials described Chirac's visit to this country as
"historic" in view of the fact that it is the first visit by a
western head of state since the end of Lebanon's civil war in
1990.
</P>
<P>
In addition to meetings Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri,
Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri and other political leaders,
Chirac will also address Lebanon's 128-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
He will also have talks with Lebanese religious leaders, the
foremost of whom is Patriarch Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, spiritual
leader of the Maronite Catholic community.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is scheduled to visit the headquarters of the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon at the southern Lebanese coastal
town of Naqura Friday afternoon and hold a meeting with commander
of the interim forces Stanislaw Franciszek Wosniak.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's military forces and police have tightened
security measures in Beirut, especially after a sit-in
by the powerful General Workers Confederation in front
of the parliament building this afternoon in protest against the
government's failure to meet workers' demands.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in, intentionally timed to coincide Chirac's
scheduled address in the unicameral house, has evoked the
government's anger and opposition from various economic and
political forces.
</P>
<P>
Some known allies of the labor unions, including the Hezbollah
or Party of God, the Socialist Progressive Party and the National
Syrian Socialist Party, announced that they would not participate
in the sit-in.
</P>
<P>
As part of the administration's efforts to show a fresh image
to its state guest and to the world, the security forces have
removed from the airport road portraits of late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Khomeini and Imam Musa Al-Sadr, the former head of the
Lebanese Shiite community who mysteriously disappeared during a
visit to Libya in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Main roads in the Lebanese capital, as well as those
leading to Jounieh, the provincial capital of the Christian
heartland of Kesrouan, and Bkirki, seat of the Maronite
Patriarchate, have been heavily decorated.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Megacities Biggest Future Threat to Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
warned today that the growth of megacities will become the biggest
threat to health in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Rapid urbanization will make some 61 percent of the world's
population urban residents by the year 2025, and they will face
increasing health problems as a result, according to the WHO.
</P>
<P>
The trend will apply in particular to the developing world.
"Even Africa, which is overwhelmingly rural today, will be a
predominantly urban continent in less than 30 years," the
organization said.
</P>
<P>
Polluted air, water and food in densely-populated cities will
constitute major threats to health in the next century, said the
WHO, citing the current spread of such highly communicable
diseases as measles and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Cholera epidemics can result from the lack of clean water, and
dysentery and diarrhea from inadequate sanitation and solid waste
disposal, it said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unemployment, overcrowded housing, deteriorating
municipal health services and drug abuse will cause mental stress.
</P>
<P>
The WHO urged efforts to improve urban health and tackle
environmental problems, inviting more municipal authorities and
city halls to join its Healthy Cities Program that began 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"From a modest beginning of 30 cities in 16 European countries,
Healthy Cities has spread quickly to more than 1,000 cities on
every continent", said a WHO official with the program.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that there will be dozens of
cities with populations ranging from 10 million to 18 million by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that between 1950 and 1995, the number of cities
with a population above one million more than doubled from 49 to
113 in the industrialized world, while increasing six-fold from 34
to 213 in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Improving Infrastructure With World Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 4 (Xinhua) - An official in Liaoning Province
says that two World Bank loans, valued at 188 million US dollars,
have helped a wide range of infrastructure projects in the cities
of Shenyang, Dalian, Fuxin, Yingkou, Anshan, Benxi, Fushun and
Jinzhou, since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The projects will greatly help reduce urban pollution and raise
the re-utilization rate of resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that a third package for urban infrastructure to be
financed with World Bank money, worth 150 million US dollars, is
undergoing feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
When all the projects are completed, the water supply and
sewage treatment capacity in Liaoning's urban areas will increase
by 940,000 tons and 1.25 million tons a day, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the water and air quality in the cities will
be considerably better," the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Problems in Liaoning's urban infrastructure have resulted in
great economic losses, according to the official, who cited an
annual loss of 1.7 billion yuan caused by water pollution along
two major rivers.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Urged Use of Legal Instruments for Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) today appealed countries to take existing legal,
administrative and other measures in their environment protection
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In a news release published here today, UNEP Executive
Director Ms. Elizabeth Dowdeswell said, "UNEP will continue to
provide the tools for a safer environment."
</P>
<P>
But she added that it is up to countries to take them up and
use them. "If they do so, then the episodes such as the one in
Mombasa will not occur," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The top UNEP official referred to a ship carrying toxic
chemicals which had left Mombasa harbor of Kenya last Friday
looking for a home for its cargo.
</P>
<P>
The toxic cargo labelled "Marine populant" is owned by the
Rechem International Services of Gwent, England. The ship MV
Barrister arrived at the Port of Mombasa last December from
Zanzibar where the cargo had been for the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
However, seven shipping companies in Kenya refused to ferry
the consignment to the UK after the ship dumped it at Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
As the controversy surrounding the ship's eventual destination
and mode of transport intensifies, the coming into force of a
unique legal instrument -- Bamako Convention on the Ban of the
Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and
Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa -- seems to have
been overlooked, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The Bamako Convention came into force on March 20, 1996. It is
indeed a landmark event in the efforts of the African countries
to deal with the international trade in pesticides and hazardous
chemicals, said Ms. Dowdeswell.
</P>
<P>
She noted that "public awareness and the law have to be used
as effective instruments to ensure that the desired policy
balance is achieved."
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa incident also demonstrates the need for shared
responsibility between exporters and importers, particularly when
it comes to hazardous substances.

The pre-man ancestor, who has a body the size of a rabbit and a
head the size of a ping-pong ball, is believed to be five million
years older than his African neighbor, and could be the earliest
ancestor shared by anthropoids including monkeys, apes and humans.
</P>
<P>
The fossil is a complete lower jaw bone of anthropoid primates
unearthed by the joint team at a field site along the Yellow River
in north China's Shanxi Province, a location harboring secrets of
early evolution of anthropoids, a Washington-based Science
magazine reported in an article to be published tomorrow (Friday).
</P>
<P>
"The finding suggests that the earliest human-like or apelike
creature first appeared in China rather than in Africa," a Chinese
researcher said.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, international anthropologists had believed
that anthropoids originated in Africa, and later spread to other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The find challenges the current idea proposed by Elwyn
L. Simons, a U.S. anthropologist, who reported last year that the
oldest well-documented anthropoids came from 36-million-year-old
rocks in Egypt, suggesting that such creatures appeared in Africa
not long before then.
</P>
<P>
Months after the Simons report, a Sino-U.S investigation team
found the first complete lower jaw bone of an anthropoid primate
dating some 40 million years ago at Zhaili Village, Yuanqu County,
Shanxi Province on the northern bank of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Geologists said that the site, which is now cold and dry, was
warm and humid 40 million years ago, with various kinds of
creatures roaming in a broad-leaved jungle, dotted with rivers and
lakes.
</P>
<P>
Among the creatures were a group belonging to the extinct
primate family Eosimiidae. One of the group members, now called
Eosimias centennicus, was considered the owner of the jaw bone.
</P>
<P>
"The jaw bone has many features that link Eosimias to
anthropoids," said Wang Jingwen, an associate research fellow of
the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology
(IVPP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and head of the
expedition team.
</P>
<P>
"The incisors are vertical, the second lower incisor is larger
than the first, the premolars are obliquely oriented, and the
angle of the back of the jaw bone is rounded," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The find reinforces the discovery of three Eosimias teeth in
1994 in east China's Jiangsu Province, which provisionally dated
anthropoids at 45 million years ago," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Previously, for the lack of convincing evidence, scientists
were reluctant to believe that the owner of the three teeth
belonged to the anthropoids.
</P>
<P>
"The fossils of Eosimias centennicus confirm eosimiid primates
status as anthropoids," Wang says.
</P>
<P>
"The Eosimias is the earliest well-known fossil anthropoid, and
it's also important because it is so primitive that it really is
the only good evidence we have of what early anthropoids would
have looked like," K. Beard, a researcher at the Carnegie Museum
of Natural History in Pittsburgh told Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Science magazine's paper was jointly written by
Prof. Tong Yongsheng, Prof. Huang Xueshi and Wang Jingwen from
IVPP, and K. Christopher Beard and Mary R. Dawson, from Carnegie
Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, who went to the
site together.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Jingwen said that his expedition team is
planning to return to Zhaili Village next month in the hope of
finding an Eosimias skull.

<HEADLINE> Single Currency Could Harm British Business, Lang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Board of Trade president
Ian Lang Wednesday warned that a single European currency could
prove harmful to British business if adopted without full and
careful consideration of possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
The British government would not allow other European
governments to use the threat of trade sanctions to bully Britain
into signing up for a single currency, Lang told a forum on
European policy.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the claim made by Jacques Santer, president of the
European Commission, that any delay in achieving European Monetary
Union by the target date of January 1, 1999, would undermine the
internal market.
</P>
<P>
"Let me be clear: the success of the single market does not
require a single currency," he told his audience, noting that
there had been no mention of a single currency in the Commission's
blueprint for a single market and that it was working well at
present without one.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with the introduction of a single currency,
there would be a temptation to expand the provision of structural
funds to meet pleas for help. The burden would fall on countries
like Britain which are major contributors to the community.
</P>
<P>
The result would be higher levels of public spending and higher
taxes, which would impose additional burdens on British companies
and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Lang conceded that a single currency would benefit businesses,
at least for those operating in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, innovation in banking was helping to reduce
transaction costs, making it easier and cheaper for business to
deal in different currencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that "making sure our interests are fully secured
is not the policy of anti-Europeanism, but the politics of common
sense."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ministers Nominated in S. Leone (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Although the proposed cabinet
will have about five lawyers, a number of university lecturers
and business entrepreneurs, many of the appointees "remain
unknown or are not of high profile figures in the political
spectrum."
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to judge how strong or what impact the
cabinet will make in tackling the country's host of problems,"
one West African diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
But many western diplomats "are less impressed with the
cabinet's composition" and are expressing concern that "political
heavyweights have not been brought in."
</P>
<P>
Many Sierra Leoneans interviewed called the proposed cabinet
"too bloated to withstand the country's cash strain."
</P>
<P>
Government supporters described it as "a national
reconciliatory cabinet with expertise that will bring the needed
windfall and heal deep political wounds."
</P>
<P>
However, there is the "conviction that (Kabbah) has opted for
a technocrat cabinet than one dominated by politicians," a
supporter of the opposition United National People's Party (UNPP)
observed.
</P>
<P>
Crucial to the parliamentary exercise, however, is how the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which has been waging a
four-year rebel war, would assess the proposed list.
</P>
<P>
RUF leader Foday Sankoh and Kabbah are due to meet on April 15
in Cote d'Ivoire and although Sankoh said repeatedly that his
organization is not interested in any cabinet appointment, the
issue "is certain to come up at the meeting," diplomats here
said.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's march to democracy still has its own slow
motion, one diplomat concluded.

LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Joko Suprianto and
Chinese world champion Ye Zhaoying retained their top spots in the
men and women's singles events as the International Badminton
Federation (IBF) issued the latest world rankings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian ace Suprianto, who suffered a humiliating defeat

<P>
Han Jingna, Yao Yan and Wang Chen of China were seen holding
the sixth, seventh, and eighth slots.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles rankings, Chinese duo Ge Fei and Gu Jun
have lost their top position to the South Korean pair Gil Young Ah

</P>
<P>
There were also no changes in the first three positions in the
men's doubles rankings, but Huang Zhanzhong and Jiang Xin of China
dropped further to the sixth position.
</P>
<P>
Chinese mixed doubles players Liu Jianjun/Sun Man, who had an
early exit at the All-England Championships, slipped from number
two to the fourth place.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Crash Kills All 33 People Aboard Brown's Plane: CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- All 33 people aboard U.S.
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's plane which crashed in southeastern
Croatia Wednesday were dead, the U.S. Cable News Network (CNN)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
After an overnight search by Croatian police and troops along
with U.S. rescue workers and helicopters, all 33 bodies of the
victims have been found, the report said. Only one woman
reportedly survived the fiery crash, but she died as a helicopter
airlifted her to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
However, until the early morning, the White House and U.S.
State Department still refused to confirm the death of the
54-year-old cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
Brown was leading a group of U.S. businessmen on a tour of the
former Yugoslavia to seek opportunities for economic
reconstruction when his military plane hit a hillside in stormy
weather approximately 3 kilometers northwest of the airport that
serves the walled city of Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that the plane carried 27 passengers
including Brown and a group of leading American businessmen and
six crew members.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ministers Nominated in S. Leone (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Tejan
Kabbah on Wednesday nominated 24 people to Parliament for
approval as ministers of the cabinet, calling it as a "national
reconciliatory" one.
</P>
<P>
But as he has not dealt with the problems with the rebel
Revolutionary United Front, the country's march to democracy
remains long and arduous, diplomats here predicted.
</P>
<P>
One of the nominated, former Interim National Electoral
Commission (INEC) chairman James Jonah, is proposed for the post
of permanent representative to the United Nations, an appointment
which will carry a cabinet rank "to enable him to report directly
to President Kabbah and undertake special assignment."
</P>
<P>
Many observers believe it is unlikely that Parliament will
reject the list when the assembly session resumes next Thursday
after the Easter break.
</P>
<P>
The 24 nominees include two women. Shirley Gbujama, a former
ambassador to Addis Ababa and now a member of parliament, is
proposed to be Minister of Tourism and Culture.
</P>
<P>
The other woman, Mrs Amy Symthe, is expected to head the new
Ministry of Gender and Children's Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 24 are presently members of parliament and,
according to the constitution, will have to resign if they are
approved for cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
Two of the proposed ministers, whose parties gave "alliance
support" to Kabbah's presidential runoff, are leaders of the
People's Democatic Party (PDP), Thaimu Bangura, slated for
finance, and Aiah Abu Koroma of the Democratic Center Party
(DCP), intended for presidential and parliamentary affairs.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maigore Kallon,
worked as a deputy foreign minister in the early 1960s under the
government of Sir Milton Margai.
</P>
<P>
The other new portfolios include the ministries of national
reconstruction, resettlement and rehabilitation, employment and
industrial relations and local government and community
development -- all to be headed by technocrats.
</P>
<P>
The former public relations officer of the military government,
retired captain Abdul Rahman Kamara, is recommended for the post of
lands, housing and country planning.

<HEADLINE> Belarus to deepen long-term, stable cooperative ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Foreign Minister
Vladimir Senko today expressed his country's willingness to deepen
long-term and stable cooperative ties with China.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing today,
Senko said that there has been rapid growth of Belarussian-Chinese
relations and an excellent atmosphere for political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with this," he said, adding that exchange
of visits by leaders of the two countries bears great significance
on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This was Senko's first official visit to China as foreign
minister. He has travelled to the country at the invitation of
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko visited Beijing early
last year, followed by Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Senko said that bilateral exchanges and cooperation in economic
fields, is very important in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the two countries have done enormous work in this
field, and will bring about greater achievements in the future, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He described as "encouraging" the 60 percent growth rate of
bilateral trade last year, saying that there remains great
potential.
</P>
<P>
The possibilities are ample for Belarus and China to cooperate
in automobile manufacturing, production of integrated-circuits,
aviation and space technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also answered questions raised by students of the Foreign
Affairs College.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day stay in China, Senko is expected to meet
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, and to hold
talks with Qian Qichen on bilateral relations, and other issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
Senko, who arrived in the Chinese capital earlier today, will
also tour the city of Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south
China.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Foreign Donations to Chinese Disabled: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China always welcomes the care,
support and donations rendered by foreign friends, groups and
corporations to Chinese disabled people and children, said

</P>
<P>
Shen made the remarks when asked to comment on a fundraising
activity organized by an American in Beijing's Lidu Hotel on March

</P>
<P>
Fund raising activities by foreigners should go through normal
procedures, Shen stated.
</P>

Organizations involved in fundraising in China must be
registered, and such activities must apply to relevant authorities
in advance, Shen said, adding that this is a question of legal
procedure, which is practised in many countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the fundraising event in Lidu Hotel on March 30, Shen
gave the following account:
</P>
<P>
After the officials from the Social Groups Administrative
Office of the Beijing Municipal Government learned that the Philip
Hayden Charitable Foundation would organize a major fundraising
dinner in the Lidu Hotel, they asked the organizer if the
foundation had been legally registered in China, and whether the
organizer had legally applied for a large gathering, as well as
staging a fundraising activity.
</P>
<P>
The organizer admitted that the Foundation had not registered
with relevant Chinese authorities, and he had not applied for
legal approval to hold the event. Then the organizer stopped the
fundraising activity while the dinner continued.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Jiangsu Province is
ploughing money into its agricultural industry in a bid to curb
price hikes and safeguard the interests of farmers.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts, the province is offering preferential
prices for electricity to producers of fertilizer, pesticide and
plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
This year's electricity consumption by the agricultural
industry is expected to amount to 3.2 billion KWHs. The price cut
will save considerable sums of money to help the producers save
costs.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will also put aside 15 million yuan
from provincial coffers, with supply and marketing cooperatives
offering another seven million yuan to subsidize imports of
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 17 million yuan will be used to subsidize bank
loan interest for reserves of relief-oriented fertilizer,
pesticide and diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
As a result of government policies, the price for much needed
urea was five to ten percent lower, and that of plastic sheeting
per ton is as much as 1,000 yuan (120.48 US dollars) lower than
the cost in neighboring provinces in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Miao People Benefit From Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- For farmer Wu Jiawang, the
significance of mastering the Miao language far exceeded using it
as a tool of writing, reading and talking. It helped him escape a
life of poverty and debt, and brought him profits.
</P>
<P>
Wu's father had difficulty in working when he was young. So the
whole family owed several thousand yuan to others, and they became
the poorest among their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
To help his family escape poverty, Wu attended a literacy class
on Miao language, then he studied at a scientific class, which was
taught in Miao language.
</P>
<P>
Very soon Wu mastered several technological skills to breed
pigs, ducks, and to plant rice in a scientific way. Within two
years Wu had repaid the debts.
</P>
<P>
Wu said, "It is the Miao language which helped me become
literate, brought me technological skills and helped me escape
poverty."
</P>
<P>
The Miao language also brought benefits to local residents in
many other aspects.
</P>
<P>
Popularization of the Miao language in the Tujia-Miao
Autonomous Prefecture of Xiangxi, central China's Hunan province,
started more than a decade ago. The Miao language in western Hunan
province was listed as one of the languages created for ethnic
minority groups in 1958.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, local authorities launched a series of
tuition programs. These programs included opening literacy classes
in rural areas, technical training in Miao language, school
teaching in Miao language, and a combination of the Miao and
Chinese languages.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of literacy-class qualified farmers
reached 84 percent. In 1992, 87 percent of graduates from the
experimental classes went to a higher school. By 1995, all
graduates from such classes went to a higher school.
</P>
<P>
Mastering Miao language has shortened the time it takes for
local residents to learn the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Local resident Hu Guisan mastered more than 1,500 Chinese
characters within a year after he mastered the Miao language.
</P>
<P>
Popularization of Miao language not only helped local residents
become literate and escape poverty, but also helps to protect the
Miao culture.
</P>
<P>
Eight books on Miao folk legendary stories, poems and old
sayings have been published, and there is more material about Miao
nationality in other collections.

<HEADLINE> All-round Exam For China's Non-Governmental Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 non-governmental
schools in China are to face a tough examination this year.
</P>
<P>
The results of the nationwide test will determine which schools
can continue, and which must close down.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement made by the State Education
Commission (SEC) in Beijing today, China will conduct a
comprehensive examination of all non-governmental schools,
including higher education institutes during this year.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from educational departments at various levels will
check the principles, and way schools are run, school regulations,
advertising or brief introductions of enrollment, quality of
teaching, certificates granted by the school, school names, and
its property, in accordance with laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The results will be made public. Unqualified schools will have
to be rectified within a limited period, or be closed.
</P>
<P>
An SEC official definited the positive role played by
non-governmental schools, saying that to develop non-governmental
schools is an important part of current reforms of the educational
system, as well as a principal way of speeding up educational
growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, several striking problems did appear. Some
schools did not follow the correct principles for the running of
educational establishments, and ran against state regulations in
student enrollment, fee charging, and certificate granting.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental schools were asked to employ qualified
financial accountants who should make separate account books for
the state property in the school, investments of people running
the school, and property earned by school running.
</P>
<P>
Provisional statistics show that China now has more than 4,000
non-governmental elementary schools and middle schools, which make
up 0.5 percent of all elementary and middle schools in
China. There are over 800 approved non-governmental colleges
across the country, with 10 of them allowed to grant
state-recognized certificates.

in the skies.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) today
announced in Beijing that the two were the best air carriers of
1995.
</P>
<P>
They were both conferred with awards for best on-board service,
and each got awards for best ticketing and cargo transport
services respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is the third consecutive year the Shanghai-based China
Eastern won the best service award since the CAAC started the
nationwide contest three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Air China and China Eastern rank among the top players in
China's air transport market, with revenue from international

second in the world, after Quantas of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Service has become a focus of public concern in recent years,
with fast spreading economic prosperity in China.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC, as the government body overseeing the civil aviation
industry, has invited inspectors to supervise the service of
airlines, and made random surveys among travellers.
</P>

To standardize services, the CAAC has worked out a set of
quality standards of public air transport service, which conform
to international practices.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Donation To Help Rebuild Bosnian School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has collected a
donation of 3.2 million Malaysian ringgit (about 1.28 million US
dollars) from Malaysian students and teachers to help rebuild a
school destroyed in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Education Minister Najib Tun Razak said at the
donation-receiving ceremony that the school, which would be
identified soon with the cooperation of the Bosnian government,
would be a symbol of friendship between the students and teachers
of Malaysia and their counterparts in the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the school can provide the best education to the
Bosnian children," Najib said.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, the education minister also said the donation
will be handed over to the Bosnian government by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad during his visit to Croatia, Bosnia and
Macedonia in the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who was also present
at the ceremony, was overcome by emotion and excused himself and
left the podium without completing his speech.
</P>
<P>
With wavering voice, Mahathir said: "Bosnia is an extraordinary
tragedy which should not have happened in the modern world."
</P>
<P>
According to Mahathir's aides, this is the first time in 15

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has vowed to improve the
living standards of its citizens during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a drive by the capital to become the most
advanced metropolis in the fields of education, science and
technology, morales and democratic building in China.
</P>
<P>
The vision for the future emerged at the 4th Session of the
10th Municipal People's Congress of Beijing. The session closed

The local legislature has approved a new five-year plan, and a
series of 15-year goals set for local economic development and
social progress, in an effort to tighten its status as the
country's political and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
To achieve those goals, the capital aims to register an annual
nine percent GDP growth in the next five years, and vows to
improve the living standards of local residents.
</P>
<P>
At today's closing session, Wang Tong was elected vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the Municipal People's Congress, to
replace Tie Ying, who was dismissed from her post for severe
violation of law and regulations in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang, born in Wuxi city in east China's Jiangsu Province,
started working in Beijing in 1953. He was once in charge of the

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Ruins Draw Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China is planning a theme
park that will give people a chance to experience an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Modern technology will be used to enable visitors to live
through the adventure of shaking buildings and moving land.
</P>
<P>
The site proposed for Earthquake City is Tangshan City - scene
of a massive quake 20 years ago that claimed 200,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The ruins of the city have become a major tourist attraction,
drawing two million visitors, including specialists from China and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake measuring 7.8 degrees on Richter scale which
struck this north China city on July 28, 1976 and took the lives
of more than 200,000 people and left seven major ruins, now on a
Central Government protection list.
</P>
<P>
One ruin is a factory workshop previously 20 meters high and
covering about 10,000 square meters. The walls, pillars, and the
framework of the structure were totally destroyed in the quake.
</P>
<P>
Another attraction is the library of the Hebei Provincial
Mining and Metallurgy College. Curiously, the first floor of the
five-story building was crushed by the quake while the other parts
remain almost intact, standing on the ruins of the first floor
except for moving some one meter northeastwards.
</P>
<P>
Tourists can also see how the earthquake moved roads, and
shifted drainage pipes, house foundations and trees.
</P>
<P>
Tourist authorities in the city are now preparing for the
construction of an artificial "earthquake city", which will employ
modern technology to give people knowledge on earthquakes, and a
sense of the adventure.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Launch Anti-Poverty Project in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A large aid-the-poor project
backed by the World Bank is scheduled for launching in June in
north China's Shanxi Province, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive agricultural development project, involving a
World Bank loan of 100 million US dollars and 870 million yuan in
counterpart domestic funds, is different from other Chinese
agricultural projects financed by the World Bank, as it is
directly related to poverty reduction, said Juergen Vogele, a bank
official who has closely followed the preparation work for the
project over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The Shanxi project consists of 47 sub-projects covering water
conservancy, forestry, animal husbandry, transportation and
processing of farm produce. Vogele pledged to make it an example
of the World Bank's aid-the-poor projects in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
The project covers the province's two areas with a
concentration of people mired in poverty -- Yuncheng and Luliang,
which have a combined population of 5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
To date, Shanxi has utilized World Bank loans valued at 230
million US dollars, according to Liu Guichuan, an official at the
provincial department in charge of the bank's loans.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao
Shi called for broader and closer Sino-Russian cooperation here
today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting at the Smolny Palace with St. Petersburg Mayor
Anatoly Sobchak, the chairman of the Chinese National People's
Congress Standing Committee said there is great potential for
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He cited St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, as the
most expected partner for this cooperation, because it leads
Russia in industry and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Sobchak, for his part, noted the positive development of
cooperation with its sister city Shanghai in economic and cultural
fields in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said the city would seek stronger ties with Shanghai through
inter-parliamentary and inter-governmental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qiao arrived here Wednesday from Moscow, where he met with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Federation Council Speaker Yegor Stroyev and State

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Tianjin Benefits Chinese, Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin-based Otis Elevator
Co. Ltd has found its assets valued at over four times what they
were when the Sino-US joint venture was first set up in this north
China coastal city in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has become one of the hottest spots for foreign
businessmen due to the favorable investment environment which has
emerged along with the opening policy.
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis made by the Tianjin Foreign Trade
Commission in 1995, the gross industrial output values of 10
state-owned firms were sixfold what they had been before they
joined hands with foreigners, sales incomes increased 5.6 times,
and fixed assets, three times.
</P>
<P>
Experts have said that neither Chinese nor foreign firms lose
in the battle for market competition, although more vehement
competition has been provoked by the pouring in of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said Tianjin has kept orienting the
foreign funds into state-owned enterprises which have great market
potential, and attached great importance to attracting
technologically-advanced and market-leading transnational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
A survey released by the provincial authorities said that 27
out of the top 500 firms in the world have invested in 45 projects
in Tianjin, involving four pillar industries of the city: the
mechanical and electrical, chemical, metallurgical and automobile
sectors. As a result, the technological gap between the city and
the developed countries has been narrowed.
</P>
<P>
The city government set up in 1994 a special body to smooth the
co-operation between Tianjin's state-owned firms and large-scale
foreign-funded firms and to offer comprehensive services to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Local government data show that the gross industrial output
reached 115.7 billion yuan-worth last year, up 16.3 percent from
the previous year. Part of this achievement should be attributed
to the co-operation between domestic companies and international
investors, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Life in Quake-Hit Yunnan Getting Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Life is returning to normal after
two months of relief and reconstruction work in the Lijiang area
of southwest China's Yunnan Province, which was rocked by a strong
earthquake on February 3.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say reconstruction started on February 10 when
preliminary emergency relief work came to an end. Materials for
power stations, farming and housing were transported to the
disaster-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the earthquake, the provincial government decided to
set aside nearly ten million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars)
to renovate two hydraulic power stations, and they organized teams
of technicians to carry out repair work.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, more than 3,000 tons of chemical
fertilizers, together with other materials for farming, were sent
to all counties stricken by the quake.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the provincial government decided to allocate
another 60 million yuan to revitalize businesses, and rebuild
water conservation projects, medical institutions, infrastructure
and local administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the reconstruction, and expansion of cement and
brick factories is well under way to ensure the supply of building
materials.
</P>
<P>
With the impending rain season local governments are taking
effective steps to upgrade residents' shelters, classrooms and
student dormitories.

<HEADLINE> China's Trains on Fast Track Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's rail system is heading
for a fast track future, with express trains that move quicker and
carry more passengers.
</P>
<P>
The country is to launch a massive upgrading of its railway
lines and equipment in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Following the introduction of the historic Shanghai-Nanjing
express that boosted China's railway travel speed from around 60
km to 140 km per hour for the first time, officials from the
Ministry of Railway said two or three similar trains will be
opened within this year. Included will be a high speed express
link between Beijing and Beidaihe, the most popular coastal resort
in north China.
</P>
<P>
Next year another express train will run on the
Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
As experience accumulates, large-scale promotion of the new
trains will be started on China's 60,000-km railway system, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the railway authority is also taking measures to
introduce more heavy-duty freight trains with carrying capacities
up to 10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
One drawback is that this will inevitably produce a conflict
between the needs of faster passenger trains and heavier freight
trains that run on the same line.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the passenger trains and freight trains must
be separated, railway experts said.

<HEADLINE> Storytelling Comes Back in East China's Jiangsu Province (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Telling stories in Suzhou dialect had been very popular
entertainment among ordinary people in the area during the past
100-plus years, particularly later when TV and films could only be
watched in big cities. Places for storytelling had flourished in
the hundreds of towns and villages of south Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Cai Kun, director of the Bureau of Culture of Changshu City,
said that the city once had 108 places for storytelling. However,
the prosperity did not last long. Only one of them was left
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and departments of culture noticed the
problems and allocated funds to rebuild storytelling places.
</P>
<P>
"I would feel like something has been lost if I missed
listening to storytellers one day," said 71-year-old Shen Baohua,
while making a pot of tea for himself.
</P>
<P>
Shen was one of the frequenters of the Deyilou Tearoom where
people gather nearly two hours ahead to listen to the story-teller.
</P>
<P>
Pu Jia, an elementary school student, was special among the
aged audience. Together with her grand-father, Pu Jia said that
she learned more about history after listening to the interesting
stories.
</P>
<P>
College student Chen Jianfang who is in his 20s believes that
storytelling is an elegant art.
</P>
<P>
"Karaoke cannot compete with the elegant art, for it is only a
kind of leisure culture staying at the surface," Chen said,
suggested that storytellers should not be afraid to bring their
elegant art to campuses.
</P>
<P>
"They should be confident about college students' ability to
appreciate art," he said.

<HEADLINE> Storytelling Comes Back in East China's Jiangsu Province (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A chapter in one of China's old
traditions is making a comeback, after being virtually beaten into
extinction by TV and karaoke bars.
</P>
<P>
The ancient art of storytelling in traditional tearooms is
turning over a new leaf.
</P>
<P>
Changshu City once had more than a hundred storytelling places
-- a few years ago the number had dwindled to just one.
</P>
<P>
Story-fan Bai Yannian, a retired worker, was often lost in
memory when he listened to professional storytellers in the
tearoom of the Deyilou (Complacency) Building.
</P>
<P>
"I worried a lot about having no place to listen to stories a
few years ago," Bai said, adding that it was very convenient to
enable older people to listen to storytellers, while drinking tea in
the well-decorated tearoom.
</P>
<P>
The Deyilou Tearoom was located in Changshu, a city in southern
part of east China's Jiangsu Province. Changshu was not alone for
having such places. Dozens of its neighboring cities and towns,
including Zhangjiagang and Jiangyin have also joined the revival,
by bringing back the traditional art. Signs can be spotted beyond
some restaurants proclaiming: story telling inside.
</P>
<P>
Bai, and other storytelling fans, only spent two yuan drinking
tea, and listening to stories told in Suzhou dialect, the one
popular in southern part of the Yangtze River, which sounds
similar to Shanghai dialect.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhengdong, head of Suzhou Story-telling and Ballad
Singing Troupe, and manager of the Deyilou Tearoom, said that his
tearoom is a pure welfare place of entertainment. Most visitors
were aged. The two yuan each of them paid could hardly meet the
costs of tea and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Zhang used part of the money made by selling special local food
and drinks to subsidize the business of storytelling.
</P>
<P>
Deyilou Tearoom spent 150,000 yuan (about 18,000 U.S. dollars)
to establish the storytelling place. Zhang plans to open several
more places for storytelling in towns and villages. He and his
troupe were trying to create more stories, and coach new
storytellers, so that the traditional art can be carried on
generation by generation.

account deficit and wants the military to justify its huge
spending plans.
</P>
<P>
He wants the military to present a list prioritizing all their
proposed buys.
</P>
<P>
The Thai military's proposed shopping list before the year 2006
is estimated to cost 74.47 billion baht (about 3 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current account deficit amounts to some 300 billion
baht (12 billion US dollars), or 8.1 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has launched a massive
publicity drive as it prepares for implementing its smoking-ban
law in public places.
</P>
<P>
The local law was passed by the Beijing Municipal People's
Congress last December and will become effective as of May 15 this
year.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that at least half of the male adults in the
capital smoke. As of May 15th Beijing smokers will find it
difficult to smoke in public.
</P>
<P>
Different publicity campaigns are being held in government
departments, work units and residential communities to make
residents, especially smokers, more aware of the ban.
</P>
<P>
A number of government departments have banned smoking in
meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
The Haidian District government plans to outlaw smoking in 21
schools and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Some public places without "No-Smoking" signs have now fixed
the signs, and voluntary supervisors have been trained to inspect,
and enforce the ban.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing, an important venue for China's political activities, has
already announced a smoking prohibition in its meeting halls,
lounges and corridors.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Opens For 17 Somali Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen Somali factions opened
talks in North Mogadishu yesterday following an appeal made by
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed last month.
</P>
<P>
The talks are focussing on the convening of a national
reconciliation conference in which a transitional government will
be formed, according to the Secretary General of the Somali
Salvation Alliance (SSA), Mr Mohamed Ramadan Arbow.
</P>
<P>
The factions participating in the talks include the SSA of Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, the United Somali Congress of Somali National
Alliance (USC/SNA) under Osman Hassan Ali Atto and the United
Somali Congress (USC) led by lawyer Abdullahi Moallim Abdulle.
</P>
<P>
During their first meeting yesterday, the SSA submitted to the
other factions a written document proposing the formation of a
transitional government for Somalia for the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
SSA leader Ali Mahdi suggested that a five to seven member
presidential council under the leadership of one chairman be
formed for the country.
</P>
<P>
The proposed government system will be characterized by the
balance of power#,that is, a house of representatives, the
judicial and the executive authorities, according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known how long the on-going meeting will last.
</P>
<P>
It's widely believed that the factions will not invite their
main rival General Mohamed Farah Aidid to the talks.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid is currently enjoying his self nominated government in
Baidoa, which he captured last September.
</P>
<P>
The 17 factions have issued an appeal to the international
community to help the Somalis protect their natural water
boundaries from toxic wastes, which are said to be directed to
the unguarded Somali waters.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Forecasters Predicted China Quakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese seismologists predicted
with accuracy the strong earthquake that hit northwest China on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
The scientifically-based warning has proved that the medium and
long-range forecasts by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional
Seismological Bureau is accurate.
</P>
<P>
The bureau told a seminar last year about its seismic forecasts
for in 1996. The meeting was told that tests pointed to
earthquakes measuring 6 to 7 magnitude on the Richter scale would
possibly occur in the Xekar-Uchia area (that is Jiashi County in
Kashi Prefecture which was hit by earthquake on March 19) during
the period from December 25, 1995 to March 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
At a national meeting on seismic forecast held early this year,
the State Seismological Bureau confirmed this forecast. The
Xekar-Uchia area was listed as one of the places in the country
which may be hit by earthquake this year.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Seismological Bureau has
accurately forecast several earthquakes. Last year, four of the
five places listed by the bureau were hit by earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months this year, four earthquakes
measuring above 5 magnitude on the Richter scale hit this
northwest region of the country. Three of four earthquakes were
previously forecast by the regional seismological bureau,
including the 6.9 magnitude earthquake which hit Jiashi County on
March 19, and aftershocks measuring 5.3 magnitude on the Richter
scale.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang now has more than 40 seismic forecast stations. Local
officials said that it would be of great significance to seismic
forecasting in Xinjiang, and the whole country if remote metering
technology is used in this regard.

<HEADLINE> University-Run Science Parks Boom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Scientific and technological parks
run by Chinese universities have boomed over the past several
years. Statistics show that more than 30 parks across the country
are operating successfully.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, some universities with intensive
high-tech knowledge, and advanced research achievements, have set
out to establish scientific parks. Their aim was to make full use
of their intellectual resources, and boost the application of
their research projects into practical production.
</P>
<P>
The Dongbei University in northeast China was the first to open
such a park in 1989, which has developed a key business for
software programming, and automation equipment.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, the university plans to invest 500
million yuan (about 60 million US dollars) to 600 million yuan in
the park, making it China's largest software production center.
</P>
<P>
The Scientific Park run by the Shanghai Polytechnic University
has put 39 scientific and technological achievements into
production over the past three years, and the sales income from
the park's products reached 25.47 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Parks set up by the Harbin Polytechnical University, Qinghua
University, Nanjing University and the Beijing University are all
operating well.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Qinghua University, one of China's top
institutions of higher learning, has made plans to raise money
from investors and financial organs to boost its scientific park,
which is expected to generate an output value of tens of billions
of yuan early next century.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe these parks are playing a significant role in
promoting scientific advancement, as well as improving teaching and
research in universities.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Dykes Beat the Great Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province,
known for its numerous lakes, has remarkably enhanced its ability
to resist severe floods by stepping up the building of embankments
and dykes.
</P>
<P>
The province, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze
River, has the longest embankment on the Yangtze River, and its
largest tributary Hanjiang River, as well as 1,000 other rivers
running across the province.
</P>
<P>
At present, the cumulative length of dykes along rivers in the
province totals 10,000 kilometers, with the embankment of Yangtze
River and Hanjiang River extending as long as 7,050 km.
</P>
<P>
The province, frequently hit by flooding, has put in extensive
manpower, funds and materials to reinforce dykes since New China
was founded in 1949. So far the province has completed total
earthworks of 1.7 billion cubic meters, 50 million cu m of
stoneworks, and concrete construction of 600,000 cu m.
</P>
<P>
The vigorous reinforcement of embankments has enabled the
province to successfully fight against five severe floods between
1954 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up a responsibility system to concentrate
on the protection and administration of embankments, and
established 12 embankment administrative agencies and 1,000
protection stations.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 km of embankments, or 40 percent of the total in the
province, have so far reached protection targets.
</P>
<P>
The 85-km-long key embankment in the middle and lower reaches
of the Hanjiang River has been evaluated as a first-class
embankment by the Ministry of Water Resources, the only one of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Increases Transport Fares  (by Zhao Xinkao, Liu Ruiping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Fare hikes, to be effective today,
for domestic land, sea and air transportation will be between 9.2
and 66.7 percent in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The new fares were set in light of the fact that current fares
were below operational costs, according to a statement by the
Ministry of Transportation received here today.
</P>
<P>
The current fares, it said, were unable to cover the increases
in prices of vehicles, fuel, spare parts, employees' salaries and
other price components.
</P>
<P>
If the fares were not increased, the situation would disturb
transportation services in the country, it added.
</P>
<P>
The lowest fare hike, 9.2 percent, will be for the economy
class of passenger ferries serving routes with a total trip of
between 10.1 and 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
The highest hike, 66.7 percent, will be for the taxi.
</P>
<P>
Fares for students riding city buses will remain the same at
100 rupiah (4 US cents).
</P>
<P>
Before today's increases, city bus, taxi and train fares hadn't
changed since 1991, and fares of inter-city bus, passenger
ferries, domestic passenger ships and domestic scheduled flights
had not increased since 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, operational costs of transportation providers have,
over the last five years, increased due to inflation, changes in
foreign exchange rates, hikes in the salaries of employees of
transportation companies, increments in vehicle maintenance costs
and higher prices of fuel and oil, vehicles, spare parts and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons that speak for an increase in
transportation fares. First of all, transportation fares were
last raised in January 1993. Adjusted for inflation over the last
three years, fares have actually declined by almost 30 percent in
real terms.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, all vehicles have a foreign exchange component which
means that their capital and maintenance cost have been rising
with the depreciation of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, transportation firms have to pay their employees at
the government-mandated minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto explained the rise
after Wednesday's cabinet meeting that if existing fares were
maintained, it would limit the supply of transportation means and
result in a decline of services -- both in terms of safety and
convenience.
</P>
<P>
Haryanto said that the increase was decided on after
consultation with parliament and the Indonesian Association of
Transporters, adding that it took into account the interests of
consumers, transport operators, vehicle owners and government
capability.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Aburizal Bakrie felt the fare hike will not have a significant
impact on the price of goods, saying that 'a 20 percent increase
in transportation fares will bring up the price of goods by one
percent.'
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the general public, especially the ordinary
workers responded the hikes bitterly.
</P>
<P>
The fares hike will for certain affect the vast majority of
Indonesians, notably those on fixed incomes. The minimum daily
wage of worker is just 4,600 rupiah (2 US dollars). If spending
on transportation fares increased by up to as high as 66.7
percent, it will surely burden the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
The general public also may be perplexed by the fare hikes
because fuel prices -- which are usually the main reason for
increases -- have not been raised since 1993.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that the government should see to it that the
objective of the fare increases -- expanded and better services --
be achieved. the government also should practice tighter
supervision to ensure that transportation firms conform with
traffic regulations, and better pay for employees to discourage
the reckless driving.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Obesity Drug Invented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Scientists recently created a
drug which may lead to the development of an anti-obesity
medication for people, according to Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The drug enhances the effect of one of the body's own
appetite-dampening signals, a substance called CCK that acts on
nerves in the digestive system.
</P>
<P>
Scientists first discovered the body's natural enzyme that
wipes out CCK, then created a compound that prevents it from
acting.
</P>
<P>
To test whether the interfering compound would dampen appetite
by letting CCK hang around longer, they deprived mice of food for
20 hours and then injected some of the animals with the compound,
called butabindide, before offering food.
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the treated mice ate 30 percent to 40
percent less than the untreated mice did.
</P>
<P>
The finding provides a new way to study other body substances
that affect appetite.
</P>
<P>
Scientist are confident that this or a closely related drug
will be used in humans someday.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Play Key Part in Making Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Local committees of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's major
advisory body, are playing a vital role in submitting valuable
proposals for the country's social and economic developments.
</P>
<P>
In March last year 23 CPPCC members in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region proposed the extension of railway
communications into southern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Following thorough investigations, the central government
decided to set aside 4.9 billion yuan (about 589.7 million US
dollars) to construct another 900 km of railway lines in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Responding to proposals handed in by CPPCC members in Xinjiang,
the central government also pledged to boost education and arrange
some key projects with regard to water conservation, farming,
animal husbandry, energy and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai CPPCC members conducted a five-month survey about
the city's environment for foreign investment, and then submitted
some valuable proposals to the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The proposals called for better service, more efficiency and a
proper legal environment for foreign investors, higher quality of
senior managers, a solution to the problem of power shortages,
more green land in the urban areas and cleaner city.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city government has worked out concrete rules
to ensure a better use of foreign investment. Government officials
who neglect their duties concerning the approval of foreign-funded
enterprises will receive administrative penalties.
</P>
<P>
And the city government has taken measures to solve other
problems mentioned in the CPPCC members' proposal.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC members in south China's Guangdong Province submitted
suggestions on how to promote river shipping, high-tech industry,
anti-disaster education, and ensure sufficient supplies of
vegetables and grain to urban residents.

The farms, covering a total of 42,447 ha, were handed over for
the planned resettlement last year by the Ministry of Lands and
Water resources, which is responsible for land acquisition.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Illegal Immigrants Beaten in Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Larry Smith, Sheriff of the
Riverside County, California, said today that the video-taped
beating of his deputies was "clearly an excessive use of force."
</P>
<P>
Tracy Watson and Kurtis Franklin, two white deputies of
Riverside County clubbed two suspected illegal immigrants from
Mexico Monday after a high speed chase into Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
The beating, video-taped by overhead TV news helicopters and
aired on national networks, provoked nationwide condemnation and
prompted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to launch a civil
rights probe into the case.
</P>
<P>
"From what I saw in the videotape, it appears that there's a
clear case of excessive use of force," said Smith. "In my opinion,
from what I saw in the tape, that level of force was not needed."
</P>
<P>
The video tape showed a deputy clubbing a man on the back and
shoulders, even as the man fell, face down, on the ground. The
deputy also clubbed a woman who got out of the cab on the back and
grabbed her by the hair, pulling her to the ground.
</P>
<P>
At least one other deputy struck her with his baton. Neither of
the victims appeared to resist or attempt to get away from the
officers.
</P>
<P>
The woman, identified as Leticia Gonzalez, 32, of Xocheca,
Mexico, had bruises, a split lip and a possible concussion. The
second victim, identified as Enrique Funez, 30, is her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights groups and Latin American communities called the
beating a pattern of violence and racial abuse among
law-enforcement officers not only in southern California but
across the nation as well.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Latinos demonstrated outside the Federal Building in
Los Angeles, declaring the beating an example of "institutional
violence against the Latino community."
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is an ugly reminder of the violent hate
crimes that several police officers engage in to manifest their
hatred towards minorities," said Hector Brolo, national president
of the Mexican American Political Association.
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union reprimanded the Sheriff's
Department of Riverside County for having made "woefully
deficient" efforts to diversify its force. Although Latino
population topped 25 percent in the county two years ago, only 13
percent of the officers are Latino.
</P>
<P>
A group representing 15 civil rights groups also blamed the
incident on rising anti-immigrant sentiment across the nation.
"This is what gave these officers permission in their minds... to
do what they did with impunity," said Joe Hicks, executive
director of Multicultural Collaborative.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, a video-taped beating of black motorist Rodney
King by white police officers led to a three-day riot in Los
Angeles, which left 58 people dead and nearly 3,000 others
injured.

<HEADLINE> Suspects of New Suicide Bombers Arrested in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian police in Gaza
have arrested three Hamas activists suspected of planning suicide
bombing attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official today was quoted by Israel Radio as
saying that the security forces in Gaza detained three men who
were carrying four suitcases of explosives ready to carry out
fatal operations.
</P>
<P>
The arrest took place on the eve of the week-long Jewish
Passover Holiday. Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak warned Tuesday that Israel has intelligence
information that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad still intend to carry
out attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hamas issued a leaflet threatening to launch new
suicide attacks against Israel in retaliation for crackdown by
Israel and the Palestinian Authority against Islamic militants
following a spate of suicide bombing attacks in major Israeli
cities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security authorities have stepped up preventive and
emergent measures against any possible attacks during the festive
period which began Wednesday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military
authorities announced that, starting from 6 o'clock this morning,
Nablus is a "closed military zone" to Israelis, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The order was made due to security reasons and the ban will
remain until further notice.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority (PA) President, Yasser Arafat, is due
to visit the autonomous West Bank city today, reportedly to try
to calm down tensions between Palestinian police and residents
stemming from a violent raid into An-Najah University campus last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 500 police entered the university, the largest university
in the West Bank with 7,000 students enrolled, and fired bullets
in the air and tear gas to disperse hundreds of Hamas supporters
protesting at the arrests of Hamas members by the Palestinian
security forces. Several students were wounded.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, several hundreds of students from An-Najah and
other West Bank universities protested against the raid outside
the first session of the legislative Palestinian Council (PC) in
the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held an audience with the students to hear their
complaints and grievances after the police failed to disperse them
by firing warning shots into the air.
</P>
<P>
During the PC session, Arafat said that the police did commit
human rights violations during the raid on An-Najah campus last
week.
</P>
<P>
He also announced to transfer Colonel Ala Hosni, Nablus police
chief, to Gaza and additional steps will be taken against him.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew by helicopter to Ramallah from Gaza Wednesday
to attend the two-day PC session, first to be held in the
West Bank.

<HEADLINE> China Has Great Life Insurance Potential: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's huge life insurance
market potential has yet to be tapped, a senior industry expert
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tongyuan, vice director of Shanghai Insurance Institute,
said that the increasingly important role played by commercial
insurance in China's social security system has helped create
good opportunities for the development of the life insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
Per capita life insurance spending in China was worth 1.4 US
dollars in 1993, compared with 3,457 US dollars for Japan and 332
US dollars for Hong Kong, Wu quoted official statistics as
revealing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's life insurance premium income is just 0.3
percent of its gross domestic product, as against 9.94 percent for
Japan and 1.82 percent for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, China's life insurance premium income
accounts for 30.9 percent of all insurance premium incomes. The
proportion is 78 percent in Japan.
</P>
<P>
World Bank estimates have projected China's total insurance
premium income at 250 billion yuan (about 30 billion US dollars)
by the end of this century, with that of life insurance expected
to reach 100 billion yuan. Currently China's yearly life insurance
premium income is over 20 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China's life insurance sector has the firm backing
of a rapidly growing economy, increasing individual purchasing
power, ever-increasing risk awareness, and a huge population,
which is expected to approach 1.3 billion by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Defector General Joins Iraqi Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- General Nizar Al Khazraji, Iraq's
former army chief of staff who defected to Jordan last month, has
announced that he joined the Iraqi National Accord movement, an
exile group opposed to the regime of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Khazraji, who has been granted to stay in Jordan for one-month
but not political asylum, was described by Iraqi exiles as a
credible and honest military officer, according to today's
English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi National Accord movement opened its regional office
here last week.
</P>
<P>
Breaking a self-assumed silence more than 10 days after he
arrived here following his defection from Iraq, the general, a
Shiite from southern Iraq, accused Saddam regime of destroying
"the sovereignty and integrity of Iraq, its people and its armed
forces."
</P>
<P>
"The desolation of Iraq was created by Saddam's belligerent
and ill-conceived policies which have and will destroy Iraq and
the region," he said in a statement issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources, Khazraji did not address
the media after his defection through northern Iraq and arrival
in Jordan before Wednesday because he was involved in "intense
contacts" with other Iraqi groups and did not want to state a
public position until he was sure of broad support.
</P>
<P>
The sources declined to reveal the outcome of the general's
contacts.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats and media here did not show great interest
in the former army chief of staff, doubting whether he will
have vital military information since he has been living in a
low profile in Iraq for several years.
</P>
<P>
They also doubt his ability to gather all the Iraqi exile
opposition groups around him after Hussein Kamel, the son-in-law
of President Saddam Hussein, who defected to Jordan last August,
failed to do so and got killed following his return to
Baghdad.

WELLINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
recorded an operating surplus of 3.3 billion NZ dollars (2.2
billion U.S. dollars) in the eight months to February, show
Treasury figures released today.
</P>
<P>
The surplus is 826 million dollars (554 million U.S. dollars)
ahead of the same period last year and 1.3 billion dollars (872
million U.S. dollars) more than forecast.
</P>
<P>
Higher tax revenues, net foreign exchange gains from the
appreciating NZ dollar and better than expected earnings from
State-owned enterprises contributed to the surplus increase.
</P>
<P>
But there is no word from the Government about how to spend the
surplus and analysts are waiting for this year's budget due to

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- This, the largest industrial city
in east China has vowed to further reduce the overall discharge of
major pollutants this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan worked out at a municipal working
conference on environmental protection for this year, the
authorities will ensure the smooth operation of three major sewage
pipes to treat 2.2 million tons -- 40 percent of the total -- of
waste water daily, tighten control of industrial pollution
resources on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, and ensure
that 90 percent of the sources of drinking water reach the
required standard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 300 industrial boilers throughout the city
which do not conform to the environmental protection standards
will be upgraded or scrapped. The control of motor vehicle exhaust
will be strengthened. And 50 percent of the urban area will be
freed from loud noise.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the garbage detoxication treatment rate
will be raised to more than 90 percent, and the control of
dangerous industrial waste and medical waste will be improved.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or so the city has put a brake on the
worsening environmental pollution. In an environmental quality
appraisal carried out by the National Environmental Protection
Agency, Shanghai edged into the top ten Chinese cities in terms of
the comprehensive index for the first time last year.

<HEADLINE> Safer Measures Urged For Chernobyl-Type Nuke Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 nuclear experts at the
conclusion of a three-day international forum today called for
urgent measures to improve safety of the Chernobyl-type nuclear
reactors.
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), reviewed and assessed safety measures adopted since the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a leak from the Chernobyl reactor injured thousands of
people and caused environmental damage in a huge surrounding area
in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 Chernobyl-type reactors are now still in
operation in Eastern Europe, and in Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
At the Chernobyl reactor, experts noted, a second protective
shield is needed to fend off an immediate risk of collapse and
radioactive release.
</P>
<P>
If the "sarcophgus" building now in place falls, they said,
radioactive materials would be released into the air contaminating
an area up to 30 kilometers around the reactor.
</P>
<P>
For other reactors, experts from 25 countries recommended
upgrading in core design and monitoring, instrumentation, accident
analysis, fire protection and operational safety.
</P>
<P>
The forum started on Monday.

<HEADLINE> New Trend of Chinese Investment Abroad in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese investment abroad will
follow a road of diversified development in future, the
Beijing-based magazine "Economy and Information" reported.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC) show that Chinese enterprises have
set up 4,839 businesses in 130 countries and regions in the form
of joint venture, exclusive investment or co-operation.
</P>
<P>
More than half of these businesses are profitable, 28 percent
are breaking even and 17 percent are running at a loss.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, state-run or collectively-owned enterprises
constitute the main body of overseas investors. The country will
in the future allow enterprises of all ownerships, including
foreign-funded joint ventures, privately-owned and share-holding
firms, to invest in places other than China under the principle of
developing a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The article outlined the following trend of Chinese investment
abroad in the future:
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese enterprises will provide their foreign partners with
equipment, technology and management expertise as their capital in
future instead of the single form of providing funds as they did
in the past;
</P>
<P>
-- Indirect investment, or investment in securities and stocks,
will gradually become an important form of Chinese investment
abroad, though it is risky compared with direct investment;
</P>
<P>
-- More overseas businesses will be formed by merging or
purchasing local firms;
</P>
<P>
-- Developing countries will become the first choice of Chinese
investors as they provide more preferential treatment and are rich
in natural resources and manpower;
</P>
<P>
-- The emphasis of investment will be mainly on the service
trades and high technology;
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese companies abroad will align themselves with
transnational corporations to conduct joint development;
</P>
<P>
-- Operational businesses will become localized in terms of
management, finance, personnel and wages; and
</P>
<P>
-- The investment scale of Chinese firms will be expanded to
cope with fierce international competition.

<P>
KUNMING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 million yuan has been so
far invested in developing biological resources in southwest
China's province of Yunnan in recent years, and these efforts have
paid off.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Yunnan has set up production lines to

<P>
The province now has a spiral algae base with an annual
production capacity of 200 tons, and another base with an annual
capacity of 600 tons is now under construction. It has also
planted 3,000 hectares of coffee bushes, which produce 2,000 tons
of coffee annually, and three million cymbidium orchid trees.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the development of fruit drinks and pollution-free
vegetables is being speeded up.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the end of this century the sales
volume of the province's biological resources products is expected
to reach 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is rich in biological resources. The varieties of the
province's animals and higher plants account for more than 50
percent of the country's total.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brown Presumed Killed in Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. State Department
spokesman today presumed that U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown
was killed when his plane crashed in a mountainous area near
Dubrovnik in southeastern Croatia earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Asked at a briefing whether it was "the formal position of the
U.S. government that Secretary Brown is presumed dead," Department
spokesman Glyn Davis replied, "That is the formal position of the
government."
</P>
<P>
Brown, 54, was heading a delegation of leading American
business executives to the Balkans to seek opportunities in the
economic reconstruction in the region.
</P>
<P>
Aboard Brown's plane, a military version of the Boeing 737,
were 33 passengers including 6 crew members. American TV and radio
broadcasts quoting American and Croatian rescue workers reported
tonight that at least eight of the 33 passengers had been
confirmed dead in the crash, but the fate of Brown remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
Davis said that the U.S. government had a manifest of those on
board Brown's plane but it would not make it public until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher had decided to cut short his vocation in California
and return to Washington immediately to deal with the things
concerning the crash of Brown's plane.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has so far declined to say
Brown had been killed, told employees at the U.S. Commerce
Department this afternoon that he believes Brown was "one of the
best advisers and ablest people I ever knew, and he was very, very
good at everything he ever did."
</P>
<P>
Whether he was the commerce secretary or civil rights leader or
something else, he was always out there just giving it his all,"
the U.S. President said.

SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- This, China's biggest industrial
center has for the first time elbowed its way into the top ten in
a national environment assessment of 37 cities in 1995, according
to a report from China's environmental protection departments.
</P>
<P>
The result shows that the metropolis has made headway in
managing municipal environmental and ecological protection at a
time of rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Authorities attribute the achievement to the setting up of four
noise-control communities and 17 pollution fallout-control
communities, which cover 40 percent and 100 percent of the city,
respectively, helping the metropolis to meet the national
standards in terms of these nuisances.
</P>
<P>
The municipal public security departments and communications
departments have joined hands in strengthening supervision of the
rule forbidding vehicles to blow their horns in urban areas, which
proved to be effective in reducing noise.
</P>
<P>
The city's Hetianlu area has spent eight years removing 14
heavily polluting plants and transforming 22 plants that
discharged waste water, waste gas or waste residue at a cost of
about 1.1 billion yuan (about 132 million US dollars).
</P>

Shanghai has also intensified the management of construction
sites, which has played an important role in improving the quality

NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States has blocked
the formation of a dispute settlement panel under the aegis of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to arbitrate in its row with India
over its import quotas on woolen garments, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The US voiced its opposition to India's appeal to form a panel
to resolve the dispute at a meeting held in Geneva on March 27.
The spat with the US over woolen garment quotas is the first
dispute that India has taken to the WTO. A final decision on the
issue will be taken at another meeting in Geneva on April 17.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been dragging on since April 18 last year when
the US announced its decision to impose quotas on three Indian
garment categories. The categories and quotas were 45,750 dozens
of men's jackets, 37,487 pieces of ladies' blouses and men's
shirts.
</P>
<P>
The issue was taken to the Textile Monitoring Body which ruled
in India's favor in the first category, against her in the third
category and left its decision ambiguous in the second category of
ladies' jackets.
</P>
<P>
The chorus of complaints from its domestic industry has
prompted the US move to stonewall the formation of the panel, the
same sources said.

<HEADLINE> hke040422-- Amendment to Anti-Child Sex Bill Rejected by Thai MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of Parliament of Thailand
have rejected an amendment to an article of a draft
anti-prostitution bill.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment sought jail terms of two-20 years and
fines of 40,000-400,000 baht (1,600-16,000 US dollars) for patrons
of prostitutes aged 15 or less.
</P>
<P>
MPs preferred the original provision, which prescribes jail
terms of two-six years and fines of 40,000-120,000 (1,600-4,800
dollars).
</P>
<P>
One male MP, Chatchawal Chompudaeng, said that the proposed
penalty was too harsh.
</P>
<P>
The proposed penalty against brothel users was even harsher
than that prescribed in the Criminal Code against those who commit
acts of common violence against minors, an MP said.
</P>
<P>
Democrat MP Laddawan Wongsriwong said the vote on Wednesday
left her with the impression that most of her male counterparts
wanted to spare brothel users harsher penalties.
</P>
<P>
She added that prostitution, particularly child prostitution,
would never be suppressed because MPs were part of the problems
and were reluctant to solve it.
</P>
<P>
However, the House approved another amendment, under which
procurers would face harsher jail terms of 10-20 years and fines
of 200,000-400,000 baht (8,000-16,000 dollars) if the procured
prostitutes are 15 years old or less.
</P>
<P>
If the prostitutes are aged 15-18, procurers would face five-15
years in jail and fines of 100,000-300,000 baht (4,000-12,000
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indian Power Company Sees 18.2 Pc Rise in Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Power stations of India's
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) generated 93,468 million
units of electricity during the current financial year 1995-96
(from April 1,1995 to March 31,1996) registering an increase of
18.2 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
The coal-based NTPC units recorded an impressive plant load
factor (PLF) of 78.80 percent and a high availability of 85.23
percent, NTPC sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Ramagundam Super Thermal Power Station achieved a
distinction by running its 500 mw unit continuously for 406 days,
surpassing all previous records of continuous run by any
generating unit in the country.
</P>
<P>
The corporation earned an estimated profit of 12,354.7 million
rupees (358.11 million US dollars) during the year against
11,245.5 million rupees (325.96 million dollars) during 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
NTPC achieved all the targets under the memorandum of
understanding signed with the government for the ninth consecutive
year in the area of capacity addition, generation, availability
and financial parameters, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Power generation by NTPC was 24 percent of the total generation
in the country during the year, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> India Gives 100 Pc Refinance on Credit to Boost  Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The granting of 100 percent
export refinance on credit provided after February 16,1996 is
expected to spur exports as banks will now be comfortable in
extending loans to the exporting community, bank officials said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) to grant
100 percent export refinance to banks on incremental increases in
the export finance granted to exporters has been welcomed by
bankers.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, there will be a tightness but it will be
rectified in the medium and long-term when banks resorts to
encouraging export credit. The number of exporters going in for
credit will automatically increase, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
Under the RBI terms and conditions, scheduled commercial banks
will be provided export credit refinance to the extent of 45
percent of the total outstanding export credit eligible for
refinance. Any incremental increase, however, in the export credit
granted to the bank is eligible for 100 percent export refinance.

<HEADLINE> WHO: No Proven Link Between "Madcow", Human Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Experts emerging from a World
Health Organization (WHO) meeting announced today there was no
proven link between madcow disease and a human sickness.
</P>
<P>
The more than 30 medical scientists and veterinarians, from
seven nations, met here for two days behind the closed door in an
urgent manner.
</P>
<P>
The madcow disease, officially known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), together with its suspected link with a
newly found variant of the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD),
has aroused widespread fears.
</P>
<P>
British officials reported a total of 10 recent cases of CJD, a
deadly degenerative brain disorder -- first found in Britain in
1986 -- with similar symptoms and effects to BSE in cattle.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts at the WHO meeting noted, a tie-up between
BSE and the new form of CJD was "the most likely hypothesis."
</P>
<P>
Consumption of milk, milk products or gelatine are safe, they
declared. And there would be minimal risk to people from eating
beef if strict controls were enforced on how cattle were fed and
sick animals destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The WHO gathering recommended that any parts of any animal that
had shown signs of a transmissible form of BSE should be barred
from entering the food chain of either animals or humans.
</P>
<P>
Further research into BSE and CJD is needed to address public
concerns, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> "Unabomber" Suspect Taken Into Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A former college teacher
suspected by relatives of being the "Unabomber" was taken into
custody on Wednesday while federal agents searched his residence
near a mountain pass in Montana.
</P>
<P>
News reports said the suspect was named Ted John Kaczynski and
had been using many aliases. For several weeks, federal agents
have been following the suspect.
</P>
<P>
A federal law enforcement official said Kaczynski was taken
into custody so that he would not interfere with the search of his
home, but he was neither arrested nor charged.
</P>
<P>
The Unabomber is thought responsible for three deaths and 23
injuries over nearly 18 years.
</P>
<P>
A Theodore J. Kaczynski, born May 22, 1942, in Chicago,
graduated from Harvard in 1962 when he was barely 20 and taught as
an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of
California at Berkeley in the 1967-68 school year, according to
Harvard and Berkeley records. He resigned in June 1969.
</P>
<P>
"We like the looks of this guy as the Unabomber, but we don't
have make-or-break evidence yet," the Associated Press quoted one
federal law enforcement as saying, "We have some writings that
match up, but we don't have his tools yet."
</P>
<P>
Members of the man's family found some old writings of his
while cleaning out a place where he once lived in Chicago, and the
writings raised their suspicions, said two federal officials
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The family approached an attorney in Washington, who called the
FBI, to alert them, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Unabomber's spree began in 1978. The most recent came April
24, 1995, when a timber industry executive was killed in
Sacramento, California.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the New York Times and Washington Post
published, in the Post, his 35,000-word treatise on the inhumanity
of industrial society after he promised to stop planting bombs
that kill people.
</P>
<P>
For three years, a San Francisco-based task force of two dozen
agents from the FBI, Treasury Department and Post Office has been
searching for clues.

<HEADLINE> Massive Arms Stock Unearthed in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 4 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's security authorities on
Wednesday unearthed a massive stock of arms and ammunition which
was buried in a lorry park at Grandpass in the heart of the
capital city Colombo, according to security sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The arms and ammunition are believed to have been buried by the
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have
been waging a 13-year war for a separate state and recently
launched assaults on important installations in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Police, in a pre-dawn raid on a deserted 20-perch parking lot,
found four kilos of type C-4 plastic explosives, 20 rounds of
ammunition, two hand grenades, a time bomb switch, a nine-volt
battery and five cyanide capsules in a garage on the location.
</P>
<P>
Later police dug up the entire premises with a caterpillar
machine and unearthed more lethal items which included two kilos
of explosives and lot of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The watcher of the car park was arrested. The owner, a
Sinhalese, is away in Japan. The parking lot had been leased to a
suspected hardcore LTTE cadre who was using the location to load
and unload lorries traveling between the north and Colombo.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that at this same premises the LTTE had parked
the two vehicles they used in the last November attack on two oil
installations in Colombo.

<HEADLINE> Measures Sought to Salvage Bangladesh's Garment  Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers
and Exporters Association (BGMEA) has suggested a package of
measures to salvage the fledging garment industry from the adverse
impact of the country's staggering political impasse.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was contained in a statement issued Wednesday by
BGMEA President Redwan Ahmed, which included, among other things,
four-month working capital for each individual factory, and
functioning of the ports, customs houses, banks inside the ports
and shipping offices round the clock.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his grave concern the BGMEA president said that
about 1,000 garment factories had already closed down and the
existence of several hundred others was also threatened due to
lack of logistic support.
</P>
<P>
"The industry has lost some 170 production days because of the
strikes, blockades and non-cooperation programs during the
22-month-long political turmoil," he said, adding that it
resulted in accumulation of huge liabilities mounting to tk 4.25
million (about 106,000 US dollars) for an average size factory.
</P>
<P>
The association urged the authorities to take necessary steps
to salvage the export-oriented industry, otherwise about 60
percent of the factories will remain without any production for at
least 2 months due to order cancellations and delayed delivery of
raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has suffered a prolonged political impasse because
of the then government-opposition conflict. The then opposition
parties enforced an indefinite non-cooperation movement since
March 9 to press their demand for cancellation of the February 15
parliamentary polls held by former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
Following the resignation of the BNP government and dissolution
of the parliament on March 30, the opposition has withdrawn their
agitation programs. The country is now in the process of next
parliamentary elections under the newly-formed non-party caretaker
government led by chief adviser Habibur Rahman.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Calls For End to Ethnic war </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 4 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has called on all political parties to support the
government to end the country's ethnic war, according to a news
release here today.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government last August put forward a devolution
package to establish a Union of Regions with wide powers being
devolved on them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of pensions to fishermen on
Wednesday, she said "I urge political parties not to sabotage the
devolution process but to suggest improvements to our plans".
</P>
<P>
The president believed that the majority of the country's
people support the concept of devolution and the need to solve the
genuine problems of the Tamils, the release said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the country needed political leaders who set
aside the vote mentality in tackling national crisis. The
president urged political parties and the people to work with the
government to solve the ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamils-- two major ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate state since
1983, More than 50'000 people have been killed in the country's
ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the government troops were waging a
war against the Tamil rebels and not the Tamil people. The
government had in fact acknowledged that Tamils had genuine
grievances which should be redressed without delay, she added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Resume Incentives to Boost Rice Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is expected to
resume incentive payments to boost exports of low-grade rice from
the second crop.
</P>
<P>
The Rice Policy Committee, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Viravan, has agreed to give rice exporters ten U.S. dollars
per ton for shipments of rice with grades lower than 10 percent as
well as broken rice and parboiled rice.
</P>
<P>
The committee said on Wednesday that the incentive will be
offered from April 15 to May 15, hoping that the measure will lead
to sales of at least 300,000 tons of the 1.4 million tons of
low-grade rice expected from the second crop.
</P>
<P>
Amunay said that the ten-dollar incentive led to increased rice
exports last season.
</P>
<P>
Total paddy output from the second crop is estimated at 3.8
million tons, up 0.9 million tons from last season, and is due
between April and June. The paddy yield predicted in April alone
is at 1.4-1.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The committee earlier had already approved a package of
financial support to promote second crop exports, including credit
at the interest rate of 5 percent to rice millers and exporters.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar's Agriculture Sees Rapid Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The latest Myanmar official figures
show that the country's agriculture, which is the mainstay of its
national economy, has developed at a high speed in the past four
fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of agriculture for the last four-year
plan (1992-93 to 1995-96), which ended on March 31, stood 8.8 per
cent against the annual target of 5.6 per cent, showing a firm
base for the long-term economic progress in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since paddy is a main crop for Myanmar's agriculture, more
attention has been paid to paddy production. Therefore, paddy
output in the country increased year by year standing at over 14
million tons in the 1992-93 fiscal year, the beginning year of
the last four-year plan, then at over 16 million tons in 1993-94,
over 18 million tons in 1994-95 and over 19 million tons in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Along with the paddy output increase, more rice is being
exported by the state. Myanmar's rice export stood at 1 million
tons in the 1994-95 fiscal year and it is targeted at 1.5 million
tons in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture contributes 40 percent to the total gross
domestic product (GDP), 65 percent to job opportunities, 35
percent to export and 40 percent to foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The steady and high-speed development in agricultural sector
brought about a great advance in Myanmar's economy. According to
the official figures, there is 8.2 percent annual growth in the
last four-year plan against the target of 5.1 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The achievements in agricultural sector were made through five
reform measures: 1. extension of cultivated area by reclamation of
fallow and virgin lands, 2. provision of sufficient water supply
by extension of irrigation and flood protection embankment
facilities to step up multiple cropping, 3. encouragement of
agricultural mechanization, 4. increased use of improved
agro-practices including utilization of chemical fertilizer and
pesticides and 5. increased production and use of quality seeds.
</P>
<P>
For example, since 1988, a total of 64 dams and reservoirs were
built and altogether 0.405 million hectares of land could be
irrigated for cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government issued last week the targets of the
short-term five-year plan (1996-97 to 2000-2001 fiscal year),
targeting an average increase of six percent per annum for the
country's economy and 5.4 percent for agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that Myanmar has a vast potential of
development in agricultural sector and Myanmar's agriculture will
continue to stand at the high-speed development in the coming
years.

NANNING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China did border trade with Vietnam valued at 11.8
billion yuan during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>

The trade has been growing rapidly since China and Vietnam

of ports of entry over the five-year period, bringing to 19 the
total number of ports of entry there, including three state

<HEADLINE> European Nations Meet to Curb Military Tech Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Officials from 31 West European and
former East Bloc countries concluded a two-day meeting here today
on curbing the international transfer of military technology.
</P>
<P>
The officials tried, behind the closed door, to work out
details of a possible new mechanism replacing that of the former
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).
</P>
<P>
According to Austrian foreign ministry officials, the talks
were centered on institutional establishment, but official
confirmation would be unlikely before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
COCOM was set up in 1949 by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to prevent high-tech military transfers to the
then Warsaw Pack nations headed by the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, COCOM was dissolved on March 31,
1994, amid controversies among its members on policies involving
technology transfers under new international environment.
</P>
<P>
As successor to COCOM, an agreement was signed last December at
Wassenaar, a small Dutch town outside the Hague, by 28 NATO,
ex-Soviet bloc and industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Wassenaar Arrangement provides for the regular
exchange among member nations of information on the export of
military equipment, and of dual-use goods that can be used for
peaceful as well as military means.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the recent meeting, officials reportedly agreed
to open a new forum in Vienna to carry out the regime's function.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Ocean Resources Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's State Oceanic
Administration (SOA) has issued 30 project proposals to tap
oceanic resources with the aid of investment and advanced
techniques from both China and abroad, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Dengyi, director of SOA, his agency hopes to
use these projects to mobilize public interest so that the plans
and programs of China's Oceanic Agenda 21 will be incorporated in
the work blueprints of all relevant fields and government
departments at different levels.
</P>
<P>
The agenda, designed to guide the sustainable development of
oceanic resources in line with the United Nations' Agenda 21 on
sustainable development, was recently made public.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 projects, 12 were especially designed for foreign
investors, such as one to sustainably use and comprehensively
manage the country's coastal zones. The coastal-zone project will
require some 40 million yuan for constructing ports and protecting
the coast's fragile ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 chapters of China's oceanic agenda are sections on
environmental protection in oceans and seas, oceanic disaster
prevention and reduction, and the use of scientific techniques to
sustainably exploit oceanic resources.
</P>
<P>
Moderately rapid development of oceanic resources is the
agenda's overall perspective.
</P>
<P>
International co-operation is indispensable in exploiting the
world's interconnected oceans and seas, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Production Up in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China pumped 38.7 million tons of
crude oil in the first quarter of this year, more than in the
same period last year, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The growth was due to efficient management and intensified
operation in new oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Of the output, 35.3 million tons were produced by onshore
oilfields under the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), 2.8
percent, or 950,000 tons, more than in the same period last year.
The original goal for daily production was exceeded by 2,500 tons.
</P>
<P>
Oilfields under the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC)
produced 3.4 million tons of oil in this quarter, representing a
62 percent increase. CNOOC pumped 8.4 million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Total production last year was 149 million tons of oil, two
percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
CNPC expects to produce 139 to 141 million tons of oil this
year while CNOOC looks forward to an output between 13 million and
14 million tons. A CNOOC spokesman said operations indicate the
target will be reached.
</P>
<P>
New oilfields have contributed to production increases.
Development in Karamay and Tarim in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region and Liaohe in Liaoning province was accelerated. Daily
production was high.
</P>
<P>
Good results were also achieved in oilfields in Jilin and
Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
In the country's major oilfields such as Daqing, Heilongjiang
Province, and Shengli, Shandong Province, underground water was
under control due to the adoption of proper techniques.
</P>
<P>
By February, the water content in onshore oilfields averaged 81
percent, an increase smaller than expected. The spread of water in
old oilfields is a natural occurrance.
</P>
<P>
Production in oil oilfields declined due to the decades of
exploitation, but the decrease was at a lower rate than last year.
</P>
<P>
In old oilfields, measures for enhancing production were taken
and resulted in efficiency. By February, 71 percent of the
thousands of measures taken were successful, eight percentage points
higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, an additional 570,000 tons of oil were produced in
January and February, 130,000 tons more than in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Production in a year's first quarter is usually lower than that
of the rest of the year as most of the onshore oilfields located
in the cold and windy northern part of the country are bothered by
bad weather and natural disasters. But this year, production was
not affected.
</P>
<P>
And production during Spring Festival, usually a time for many
Chinese to take holidays from work, showed little drop this year.
</P>
<P>
Overall, production and operations in this quarter established
a good beginning for both this year and the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000), according to the CNPC source.

BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 million youths across
China will receive training to upgrade the quality of China's
industries and make their products more competitive in a market
economy, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and
two ministries recommended yesterday that 90 percent of state
enterprises and half of the non-state owned firms should join in
the training program in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"We are aiming to bring out 20 million able technicians, and
100,000 technical pioneers in the process," Yuan Chunqing, a
central committee official, was quoted as saying at the opening
ceremony of the three-day Enhancement Meeting for the National
Young Technical Vanguards Drive.
</P>
<P>
About 10 million young workers will receive training this year.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yongsan, vice-minister of Labor, said that it is imperative
to train millions of competent technicians. As a result of the low
quality of workers, the labor productivity in China was only 12 to
25 percent of the average in advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the National Young Technical Vanguards Drive started two
years ago, about 1,000 enterprises have started the training
efforts, jointing the 100 firms conducting the program on a trial
basis, Lin was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining world peace and
stability is a top priority to which all governments, parliaments
and people should be devoted, a top Chinese parliamentary leader
said today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee Tian Jiyun told Belgium's Senatorial Commission of
Foreign Affairs that without peace and stability, the human race
cannot survive and progress.
</P>
<P>
Turning to trade between China and Belgium, Tian said Belgium
was a small but highly industrialized country while China was a
large but developing country with rich natural resources and huge
markets. Further cooperation in bilateral trade would be
beneficial to the economic development of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Tian said the Chinese economy has improved tremendously over
the last 18 years due to its open-door policy. However, compared
with developed countries like Belgium, China still lags far
behind.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to enhance cooperation with all countries in
efforts to catch up with developed nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
After his speech, Tian answered questions raised by members of
parliament on human rights, Tibet and family planning.
</P>
<P>
Tian is on a five-day visit to Belgium, part of a three-country
European tour which has already taken him to Ireland. His next
stop is Iceland.

<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate in
March stayed within the government expectation at 11.8 percent,
according to the National Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
Although it remained unchanged from February's rate, the figure
doubled the 5.6 percent inflation rate recorded in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said the 11.8
percent inflation "was expected" due to the "recurrent effects" of
a rice crisis which hit the country last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is expecting that the double-digit
inflation rate will drop to a single-digit rate by May.

<HEADLINE> France Wages Campaign Against Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) - The French government today
announced a broad range of plans to control worsening air
pollution of the country.
</P>
<P>
The plans will step up air monitoring throughout the country,
allowing authorities to curb car traffic when pollution reaches
alert levels.
</P>
<P>
The use of non-polluting fuels will be encouraged and the civil
service would set an example by using less polluting cars.
</P>
<P>
The government would also take steps to encourage motorists to
skirt Paris and ease traffic congestion at motorway toll gates.
</P>
<P>
Pollution meters would be installed in city centers to keep the
public informed on air quality and the first annual "Clean Air
Day" will be organized in September to raise environmental
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Some 2 billion francs (500 million U.S. dollars) will be
allocated for a five-year research project on improving air
quality, according to the plans.
</P>
<P>
A scientific survey earlier this year said 260 to 350 deaths a
year in Paris and 30 to 50 in Lyon on heart ailments were due to
pollution from cars and factories.
</P>
<P>
Dozens more in the two cities were dying prematurely of
respiratory problems, it said.

<HEADLINE> Artist Active in Promoting Beijing Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Shen Xiaomei, a famous Beijing
Opera performer and member of the Beijing Opera Theater of Jiangsu
Province, told Xinhua that her great wish is to contribute
something to traditional opera, which has suffered from a decline
in the size of its audience in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To remedy this, Shen opened courses in Beijing Opera at some
schools in this provincial capital, including Nanjing University,
the Nanjing Economics Institute, Zhonghua High School, and at
Youfu-Xijie Primary School.
</P>
<P>
She also sponsored a Beijing Opera lecturers' group at her
theater to give regular lessons, mostly information and
performance skills of the art form, which is regarded as the gem
of Chinese performing arts, to students in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Her actions were warmly welcomed by students. Peng Yan, a high
school student, told Xinhua that she "gradually fell in love with
the art form after taking the course."
</P>
<P>
A student at Nanjing University said that most college students
don't dislike Beijing Opera, they just don't know anything about
it. He said that Shen's lecture helped him learn that the opera is
both deep and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
Shen's efforts brought a response from Nanjing University,
which listed Beijing Opera as an elective course for its
students.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Electric Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China has developed an
electric-powered bus that can travel as far as 120 km with each
charge at a speed of 90 kph.
</P>
<P>
The 51-seat, 230 hp bus is so far the most powerful electric
bus in the world. It is 12 m long, 2.5 m wide and 3.5 m high, and
weighs 14 tons.
</P>
<P>
The bus was jointly developed by the Chinese Commission of
Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (Costind)
and the American Northrop Gruman Company, under a Sino-US
agreement signed in October 1994 for switching the defense
industry to civilian production.
</P>
<P>
Cai Hongkui, deputy director of Costind's Electric Vehicle
Research and Development Center, said that the co-operation has
been so successful that the whole design and manufacture of the
two prototype buses took only eight months after the formal
agreement was signed in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
On March 25 this year, a celebration was held at the Shengli
Bus Company in north China's Hebei Province for the completion of
the prototype buses.
</P>
<P>
The main body of the buses, decoration and operation
instruments are all Chinese-made, but the power system, the
cooling system and the air-conditioners were made by Northrop
Gruman, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the American side highly appreciates the quality
and performance of the prototype and holds that it will be very
competitive in the international market. He noted that both
parties have agreed to take the bus to the October exhibition in
Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Trolleybus Company, which took part in the
development work, is very interested in the electric bus. Its
general manager Zhang Guoguang said the company is waiting to put
the non-luxury model into operation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Cai said he expected that the non-luxury model will come off
the production line in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The luxury model will probably be put into mass production by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Cai said, he is very optimistic about the future
of the electric bus, as the Chinese government is backing the
project.

understanding and friendly cooperation as well as agreements on
cultural cooperation, and coordination between the two countries'

</P>
<P>
The documents were signed between Estonian President Lennart

</P>

At a joint press conference after the signing ceremony, Meri
expressed his welcome to the union that Russia and Belarus agreed
Tuesday to establish, but ruled out his country's participation in
the integration process of the Commonwealth of Independent States

</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, Estonia seeks to integrate into Western
Europe politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Snegur said that Moldova opposes a political, not an economic
integration of the CIS, and that Moldova will stick to its policy
of economic reform and cooperating with Western countries.

WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- ATLANTA officials Wednesday
defended their police force and an investigation into the armed
hold-up of a New York corrections official last month, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said in a statement her
officers acted properly after Robert Chace, a probation official
from New York state, was robbed of his wallet at gunpoint in
front of a downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
Chace's boss sent a scathing letter to Atlanta Mayor Bill
Campbell last week saying police seemed unconcerned about the
March 16 incident and failed to respond quickly when given a
description and partial tag number of the robber's vehicle.
</P>
<P>
With Atlanta Olympics only a few months away, officials
have been trying to allay the security concerns of visitors
expected to jam downtown streets adjacent to sporting venues.
</P>
<P>
Harvard said that a 55-member security team, fitted with
bright blue jackets and white pith helmets and paid for by
downtown businesses and hotels, began daytime and evening
street patrols last week.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta City Council approved an anti-loitering
ordinance on Monday that would allow police to arrest anyone
who hides or runs away from a police officer or tries car door
handles, or whose conduct causes "reasonable alarm."

WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The fate of the 33 people,
including U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, aboard a crashed
U.S. Air Force jet plane in Croatia still remained unclear as most
of the passengers have not been found.
</P>
<P>
But Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said that the
54-year-old U.S. cabinet member was killed by the crash which took
place today while the plane was approaching the airport in
Dubrovnik, Croatia, in stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
Granic said in a letter of condolence to U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher that he was shocked and sad to learn the

</P>
<P>
Croatian TV reported that all aboard the jet were killed.

The U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies presumed today

by the crash. But he later amended his comments to say Brown was
considered missing.

<P>
The bodies of four people -- three men and a woman -- were
already found at nightfall, Croatian sources said.
</P>
<P>
A woman survivor of the plane crash died on her way to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
There were 27 passengers and a crew of six aboard the T-43 jet,
a military version of the Boeing 737 airliner.
</P>
<P>
Brown and his entourage of American businessmen were on a
mission to promote trade and investment in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and European military and government officials have ruled
out the possibility that the plane was shot down by any hostile
fire.
</P>
<P>
Two senior U.S. defence officials, who asked not to be
identified, told the press in Washington that there was no
indication of any hostile fire at the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
They were quoted as attributing the crash to adversary weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources said that at least 50 vessels, including small
boats, police vessels and passenger ships, are taking part in the
search of the victims and the plane wreck.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that chances of anyone surviving the crash was
slim to none.

<P>
WELLINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jim
Bolger said this morning he expects his government to stick to the
coming general election later this year.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement on the radio after the defection of
another MP of his National Party.
</P>
<P>
National MP Peter McCardle left the party Wednesday to join the
 opposition New Zealand First Party, on the ground that he differs
with the National on the issue of tackling unemployment.
</P>
<P>
His defection surprised many of his colleagues as he pledged
his loyalty to National only one month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The departure has left the National and its allies as a
minority government, with a total of 49 seats in the 99-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although the possibility of an early election has increased,
Bolger said "my expectation is we'll still go through to an
October-November election, that's my expectation."
</P>
<P>
On the government's stability, he said "it's just a mere
fraction more difficult, that's all."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro today called upon members states of the United
Nations to fulfill their obligations.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the U.N. General Assembly, President
Scalfaro stressed that peace is a value that concerns everybody,
and everybody must share the responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say to those states which belong to the United
Nations but do not fulfill their obligations: do you not realize
that by neglecting the commitments to which you have freely
subscribed -- even when such neglect may not be your real
intention -- you end up not being on the side of peace, the rights
of man, freedom, and justice?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro made the statement at a time when the United Nations
is in a deep financial crisis. It is owed by member states 2.9
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the biggest contributor to the world
organization, owes 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. U.N. estimates say
the organization is facing a shutdown in November this year for
lack of cash.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been punctual in honoring its assessment and is the
sixth-largest contributor to the regular budget of the United
Nations. In 1995, it contributed over 150 million U.S. dollars to
the budget for the peacekeeping forces.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali was "shocked and saddened" to learn today
that U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's aircraft had crashed on a
hillside near Dubrovnik of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.N. chief said that Boutros-Ghali, who is
visiting Japan now, called on all nations in the area to cooperate
in the search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general greatly admires the work that Secretary
Brown has been doing to advance the wellbeing of people everywhere
through deepened ties of commerce and trade. His current mission
was regarded as particularly important and deeply appreciated in
view of the desperate need of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia
for international assistance in their process of peace building,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A military plane carrying Brown and business leaders crashed in
stormy weather when they were traveling from Tuzla,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, to Dubrovnic, Croatia. Croatian officials said
that the tail section of the plane was discovered on the
mountainous Croatian coastline, four bodies had been found and
there was at least one survivor.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and European military and
government officials have ruled out the possibility that a plane
carrying U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown was shot down by any
hostile fires.
</P>
<P>
The Brown's plane, a military version of Boeing 737 airliner,
crashed a few miles outside Dubrovnik, Croatia, in stormy weather
earlier this afternoon local time, U.S. government and European
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old U.S. cabinet secretary was heading a delegation
of leading American businessmen to visit the Balkan nations
looking for opportunities in the post-war economic construction in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Two senior U.S. defense officials, who asked not to be
identified, told reporters that there was no indication of any
hostile fire at the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
They said that they believe the terrible weather was the main
cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike Mccurry still refused to confirm
that Brown's plane had crashed, but said that large-scale search
and rescue operations were underway both on land and in the
Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources said that at least 50 vessels, including small
boats, police vessels and passenger ships, are taking part in the
search.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that chances of anyone surviving the crash
were slim to none.
</P>
<P>
Brown, the most prominent black in the Clinton administration,
had planned to spend three days in Bosnia and Croatia, meeting
with American troops, local government figures and business
leaders.

<P>
BELGRADE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic and a U.S. senate delegation said today they believe
that the two countries will continue active cooperation in the
interests of strengthening peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed at the meeting that continual political
dialogue between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the United
States presents a good basis for stepping up bilateral
cooperation, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The u.s. delegations was headed by Republican Senator Arlene
Specter from Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic and the U.S. delegation were satisfied that the
international peace Implementation Force (IFOR) was met with
understanding and cooperation from all sides in Bosnia, which is
reflected in the implementation so far of the peace agreement,
especially its military aspect.
</P>
<P>
Both parties also attached special importance to the
preparations for the elections of both entities in Bosnia -- the
Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb state of Republika Srpska.
The elections, slated for September, will contribute to the faster
normalization of the situation, the return of refugees and the
restoration of communication links, especially the protection of
citizens and their personal security and that of their property.
</P>
<P>
It was also said that the speedy economic reconstruction of the
entire territory of Bosnia is important and requires faster and
more concrete material aid by the international community.

<HEADLINE> 110 Bodies Unearthed From Mass Grave in Western Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- About 110 bodies have so far been
exhumated in a mass grave near the Serb town of Mrkonjic Grad in
western Bosnia, the Tanjug news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Most bodies dug out from the mass grave had visible traces of
violence and torture before death, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The exhumation started on March 30 on an unmarked 70x50 meter
grave in which the bodies were buried. The digging is expected to
end later this week.
</P>
<P>
An expert team, headed by Belgrade pathologist Professor Zoran
Stankovic, identified last Saturday that 20 people had been
brutally massacred and many more had been beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
"Identification is slowed down because most of the killed had
no documents," said the agency quoted Stankovic as saying.
</P>
<P>
The area of Mrkonjic Grad and neighboring Sipovo, captured
during an offensive by a joint force of Bosnian Croats and the
regular Croatian army last autumn, was returned in early February
to the Serbs in compliance with the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Town officials in Mrkonjic Grad said that several more mass
graves in the region would be investigated in similar ways.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of international organizations, domestic and
foreign reporters, and large numbers of victims' relatives and
others are daily present at the unearthing in the Mrkonjic Grad
cemetery where at least 200 bodies of Serb civilians and soldiers
are believed to be buried.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities reiterated Tuesday to the United Nations
special rapporteur for human rights, Elisabeth Rehn, that nothing
has been learned about the fate of 2,000 Serbs missing during last
autumn's Muslim-Croat offensive against Serb territories in
western Bosnia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton this afternoon paid a visit to
the family of Ron Brown who was presumably killed in a plane crash
in southeastern Croatia earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons, dressed in dark suits and looking very solemn,
were carried by limousine to the home in an affluent residential
complex known as Chatworth and "wanted to comfort" Brown's wife
Alma and their family, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy visited the
Brown's family with condolences. Brown worked for Kennedy before
going to the Urban League and Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Brown, 54, was appointed U.S. secretary of commerce by Clinton
on December 12, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Born in Washington, D.C., on August 1, 1941, Brown was raised
in Harlem in New York City.
</P>
<P>
After serving from 1963-67 in the U.S. Army in Germany and
South Korea, Brown worked for the U.S. National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Air Force plane carrying Brown crashed in stormy weather
en route from the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla to Dubronik,
Croatia, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of Brown's plane has been spotted in the Adriatic
Sea near Croatia, but Brown's fate is still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that chances of anyone surviving the crash were "somewhere
between slim and none."

Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, stressing that Lebanon
would be responsible of the security on its lands after Israel's
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi said at a banquet held in the Beirut Presidential
Palace in honor of visiting French President Jacques Chirac, who
arrived here this afternoon on the first leg of his tour in the
region, that "if the precious parts of our lands are not
liberated, the wound will remain open, and our sovereignty and
independence will remin incomplete."
</P>
<P>
"When Israel withdraws, we will be responsible of the security
on our lands," Hrawi emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He called for implementation of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, especially resolution 425, which provides for
Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon and the respect for the
principles of 1991 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking a regional peace which will return to Lebanon
and Syria their rights," he said. "Lebanon and Syria have chosen
to cooperate and coordinate for an achievement of just and
comprehensive peace and for all the countries' recovery of their
security, sovereignty and independence."
</P>
<P>
"That is the meaning of an interlock between the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
"There will no peace in the region without Lebanon and Syria,
or at the two countries' cost," the Lebanese president added.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi noted that Lebanon entered the peace process "with all
its courage and confidence, and with collective definite decision
of the nation," and that is for reaching just and comprehensive
peace.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Israel for the failure to achieve progress in the 13
rounds of negotiations between Lebanon and Israel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He called for a distinction between the legitimate resistance
against foreign occupation and terrorism. "Lebanon is against
violence and terrorism," he said. "And Lebanon used to be a
victim of terrorism."

<HEADLINE> 181 Bodies Exhumed from Mass Graves at Mrkonjic Grad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 181 Serb bodies were
exhumed from two mass graves in the Bosnian Serb town of Mrkonjic
Grag today, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
This has ended the exhumation of Serb victims killed during and
after the large Muslim-Croat offensive on the western parts of the
Serb entity of Republika Srpska in the autumn of 1995.
</P>
<P>
These areas were returned to the Serbs on February 4 in line
with the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts, headed by Belgrade Professor Zoran
Stankovic, were continuing the identification of the victims, most
of them found without any documents. So far, about 60 victims have
been identified.
</P>
<P>
Stankovic said that autopsies showed that most of the victims
were killed by blunt objects struck on the heads.
</P>
<P>
Military prosecutor Srboljub Jovicinac stated that 26 more
localities were being investigated in Mrkonjic Grad area, where
mass graves are most likely to be found, but some of the
localities are not yet accessible because heavy snow still covers
the ground.
</P>
<P>
Present at the exhumation, which began at an unmarked grave on
March 30, were representatives of international organizations,
domestic and foreign reporters, and large numbers of victims'
relatives and other people.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Serb authorities reminded U.N. special
rapporteur for human rights Elisabeth Rehn of the Serb concern
about the fate of 2,000 Serbs missing in the Muslim-Croat
offensive on the Serb territories last autumn.

<HEADLINE> Nzo To Sign Regional Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua)-- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo would represent South Africa at the signing
of the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty (ANWFZ) in the
Egyptian capital Cairo next Thursday, the Department of Foreign
Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Nzo left the country for a two-week
diplomatic visit to North Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
According to a document released by the department, the ANWFZ
would make the African continent the third zone to be established
in a densely populated area of the world after the idea was first
mooted in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)'s Declaration
on the Denuclearization of Africa in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear free zones already exist in Latin America and the
Caribbean and the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The Headquarters of the African Commission on Nuclear Energy
(AFCONE) envisaged by the treaty would be located in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ANWFZ, commonly known as the Treaty of Pelindaba after the
area near Pretoria where a joint United Nations-OAU group of
experts finalised the draft, was approved by the OAU and endorsed
by the UN in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was aimed at preventing a nuclear arms race on the
continent and stopping African and other states from introducing
nuclear explosive devices into the continent, said the document.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at promoting African cooperation in the
various uses of nuclear technology for economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AFCONE comprises 12 members elected for three
years by parties to the treaty who would also fund the
commission's budget. enditem

<HEADLINE> Namibia Passes Non-discriminatory Law For Married Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua)-- Namibia's national assembly has
passed a bill removing discriminatory laws against married women from
the statute books, the South African Press Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The married persons equality bill was initially rejected by the
National Council, which reviews legislation, and sent back to the
national assembly where it was passed with minor amendments.
</P>
<P>
The National Council, in its report to the national assembly
rejecting the principle of the bill, claimed that the legislation
contained ''strange and exotic'' key provisions, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, several women's organisations later said the National
Council had deliberately misinterpreted some clauses.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the new law, husbands and wives enjoy equal status as
the heads of the household. The law also provides for wives to be
domiciled separately from their husbands.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation applied only to marriages in and out of
community of property, added the report.
