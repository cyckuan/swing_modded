CALM PREDICTED FOR DISNEY METING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES  Early indications are that the stormiest aspect of
this year's annual shareholders meeting for The Walt Disney Co. may
be the weather.
</P>
<P>
   When shareholders gather in Seattle on Feb. 23 they are expected
to overwhelmingly agree with the entertainment giant and reject
three shareholder proposals. And even though Disney's stock price
is down 17 percent from last spring's all-time high, Disney
representatives do not expect a repeat of 1997's marathon in
Anaheim when speakers vented for hours about the massive severance
package for Michael Ovitz and Chairman Michael Eisner's
incentive-laden 10-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from Anaheim, we really haven't had a contentious
meeting,'' spokesman Tom Deegan said.
</P>
<P>
   This month's gathering is the first in Seattle for a Disney
annual meeting. The purpose is twofold: reaching out to
shareholders in the Pacific Northwest and highlighting Disney's Go
Network portal service on the Internet, designed with Infoseek and
Seattle-based Starwave Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1,500 and 2,000 shareholders are expected to attend the
meeting at the Fifth Avenue Theater. Eisner is expected to
highlight the company's achievements using the Go Network as a
visual aid. The rest of Disney's shareholders _ the company has
2.07 billion shares outstanding _ are expected to vote by proxy,
with ballots already arriving in mailboxes across the country this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Votes will be taken on a request that Disney's board not adopt a
``poison pill'' plan without approval from shareholders; requiring
a report to shareholders on the company's Y2K preparations; and
requiring a report on compliance with rules for Disney
manufacturers and licensees.
</P>
<P>
   The ``poison pill'' resolution has an outside chance of passing,
according to Desmonde Printz, a senior analyst with New York-based
Proxy Monitor. He cited several reasons: It received 43 percent
support of votes cast last year; it is not binding on management;
and poison pills have become flash points for shareholder activism.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Francis G. Forsyth Jr. makes the usual arguments
_ pills, which make it nearly impossible to complete a hostile
takeover, force bidders to negotiate with boards rather than
shareholders; since shareholders own the company, they should have
the right to decide what is a fair price; and pills tend to
entrench management.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's argument is that the current pill, adopted in 1989,
will expire in June and the board has already decided not to
replace it. But the board wants the ability to reinstate a pill in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Printz noted that, given Disney's market capitalization of $73
billion, the company is an unlikely takeover candidate but added
it's not a moot issue just because Disney is doing away with the
pill later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage of the resolution would put the company on notice that
a majority of shareholders are opposed to such a scheme _ at any
time in the future _ unless they first approve it,'' he said. ``We
consider this position to be eminently reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K resolution, by Dean V. Shahinian, argues that a computer
failure could damage client relationships, reputation and financial
results. Disney said it has made the disclosures sought, including
two pages in the annual report, and said that a mailing to Disney
shareholders would be costly and serve no useful purpose. Proxy
Monitor agreed with the board.
</P>
<P>
   The contract supplier standards resolution, authored by a
variety of human-rights groups to prevent sweatshop and child labor
abuses, would require Disney to establish an independent monitoring
program and adopt policies to ensure a ``sustainable living wage.''
Similar proposals received 9.1 percent backing in 1997 and 8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Disney noted it has been enforcing a code of conduct for
suppliers since 1997 and said its current approach of monitoring
the suppliers on its own will work best and that it is unrealistic
for Disney to impose additional wage levels at the more than 18,000
facilities that produce Disney merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Proxy Monitor agreed, noting, ``The company has made a
good-faith effort to ensure that its contract supplier standards
comply with its code of conduct. The corporation appears to realize
that due to media scrutiny of these issues it is in Disney's own
self-interest to ensure that the code of conduct is enforced.'' &QL;

MCI AND EDS FORMS ALLIANCE INVOLVING $15.5 BILLION OVER NEXT
DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a complex transaction, MCI Worldcom said Thursday that it
would sell its computer-services business to the Electronic Data
Systems Corp. for $1.65 billion as part of a broader alliance
between the companies that involves up to $15.5 billion in revenue
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has four main elements. First, MCI Worldcom will
pay EDS $5 billion to $7 billion over the 10-year contract to run
its computer systems. In exchange, EDS will pay MCI Worldcom $6
billion to $8.5 billion over the same period to handle its
telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   The third part is the acquisition by EDS of MCI Systemhouse, an
information technology services provider in Ottawa, for $1.65
billion in cash. Finally, EDS and MCI Worldcom will cooperate on
offering new kinds of communications and data services, including
electronic business applications.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Heller, the president and chief operating officer of
EDS, said in a telephone interview that the company had been
seeking a closer relationship with a large telecommunications
provider for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use, in support of our customers, a lot of
telecommunications services, so we need access to the latest
technology in the communications business, at the lowest price,''
he said. ``It behooves us to have a closer relationship with
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller said MCI was the most attractive potential partner
because it has its own global data and communications network and
is growing rapidly. The acquisition of Systemhouse was a further
benefit, because it will make EDS one of the largest information
technology services providers in Canada, where it has not had a
significant presence.
</P>
<P>
   John Sidgmore, MCI Worldcom's vice chairman, said the company
had considered acquiring another systems integrator, including EDS,
to augment Systemhouse but had decided on this deal instead. ``We
were trying to find a partner that could provide us with
world-class information technology,'' he said. ``It was kind of a
no-brainer, picking EDS. We just believe on faith that they can run
computer systems better than us, and I know we can run
communications systems more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal appears complex, ``both companies are going to
wind up doing what they do best,'' Sidgmore said. ``Even though
there are billions of dollars changing hands here, at the end of
the day, each company is going to be executing its core business.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that they expected more than 12,000
employees, primarily in the United States and Canada, to move to
EDS from MCI Worldcom and Systemhouse. About 1,000 EDS employees
will be offered jobs with MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said this deal, coupled with a similar arrangement
between IBM and the AT&AMP;T Corp. in December, could put pressure on
competitors, like the Computer Sciences Corp., in information
technology, and the Sprint Corp., in telecommunications, to form a
partnership of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, MCI Worldcom reported fourth-quarter earnings of
$428 million, or 23 cents a diluted share, compared with $95
million, or 10 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue
quadrupled, to $8 billion from $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected MCI to earn 22 cents a share, according to the
First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings. Results have been
consolidated to reflect the merger of MCI and Worldcom last year
and MCI's 19 percent economic interest in Embratel Participacoes
SA, Brazil's national communications provider.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MCI Worldcom shares rose $4.1875, to $80.4375, in
NASDAQ trading. EDS closed at $48.3125, up $2.4375 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

FINAL STADIUM DEAL MADE BY PATRIOTS AND ROWLAND _ WITH PUNT
OPTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass. )  By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Nearly a month behind schedule, the New
England Patriots agreed to a final stadium deal with Gov. John
Rowland Thursday after winning a provision that lets the team back
out if the many problems with the riverfront site cannot be solved
in time to allow a kickoff in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The football team's owner, Robert K. Kraft, took a two-hour bus
tour of Hartford Thursday after approving the agreement, which runs
about 300 pages and makes partners of the state and the Patriots
for 30 years. Lawyers for both sides worked into the evening
reviewing the document. ``It's a situation that is good for both
sides, and we both understand what our responsibilities are,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators representing Hartford protested the secrecy
surrounding the negotiations and said they had no idea what was in
the final version. Two state senators and nine state
representatives, all Democrats from the Hartford area, wrote a
letter to the Republican governor, protesting the ``lack of
response'' from his office when they sought details about the
state's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told virtually every day, `We'll get you something
tomorrow, we'll try to get you something in a couple of days,' and
we've never seen it,'' said State Senator John W. Fonfara.
</P>
<P>
   The state is to build a $375 million stadium for the Patriots in
downtown Hartford in return for a 30-year lease. Both sides had
said that only details remained after the state legislature
approved the framework of a deal in December, but the negotiations
turned tense after the state was unable to guarantee immediately
the removal of an 11-acre steam plant and energy company that now
occupy the site.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that under the agreement, ``legally, there's
no way out of it unless we can't get the site prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The steam plant has not agreed on a buyout offer, but Rowland
said in an interview that he would go to court, if necessary, to
evict the energy company and get the toxin-laced land cleaned up in
time for the Patriots to move in by 2001 or, more likely, 2002.
Under the state's powers of eminent domain, Connecticut can condemn
the land for a public purpose in return for its market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can condemn the thing tomorrow morning, and we can have a
bulldozer there Monday,'' Rowland said. ``Then you go to court and
then fight over the value. So that option's open.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who remained a steadfast stadium booster as the Jan.15
deadline for the development agreement came and went, had joked
that lawyers for the two sides were haggling over farfetched
possibilities like ``what happens if there's an earthquake on the
50-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it turns out that the team wanted no part of a backup
site the city was considering, and agreed to sign the deal only
after it specified that the stadium would be built along the
Connecticut River at the junction of Interstates 84 and 91.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the legislature said the stadium would be in
Hartford but did not specify the site in case the state could not
solve financial and environmental problems with the riverfront
site, Adriaen's Landing, where the soil and ground water is laden
with the carcinogenic remnants of a coal plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' the governor said, ``the development agreement says
it's going to be Adriaen's Landing. If the site's not ready, then
they can walk away.'' If the preferred site does not work out, he
said, ``we can look for a new site mutually, or we can scrap the
whole idea.'' But he said he was confident that the Adriaen's
Landing project would work out.
</P>
<P>
   C.T.G. Resources Inc., which owns the steam plant and has its
headquarters on land that is to be part of Adriaen's Landing, said
the company was considering an offer for the plant from the
Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority, a quasi-public agency that
runs and regulates plants that convert trash to energy.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft got a break from the stadium talks during his bus tour of
the city, which included looks at the most blighted neighborhoods
and points of local pride like a workshop that trains young people
to become woodworkers and carpenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see what's going on, and was very much into the
ride,'' Mayor Michael P. Peters said afterward. ``This is going to
be his home.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from statements by Senators
sitting in judgment in the impeachment trial of President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS:
</P>
<P>
   Olympia Snowe &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it, I find the President's behavior
deplorable and indefensible. If I were a supporter, I would abandon
him. If I were a newspaper editor, I would denounce him. If I were
an historian, I would condemn him. If I were a criminal prosecutor,
I would charge him. If I were a grand juror, I would indict him.
And if I were a juror in a standard criminal case, I would convict
him of attempting to unlawfully influence a potential witness under
Title 18 of the United States Code.
</P>
<P>
   However, as a United States Senator, in an impeachment trial, I
have but one decision: does the President's misconduct, even if
deplorable, represent such an egregious and immediate threat to the
very structure of our Government that the Constitution requires his
removal? ...
</P>
<P>
   After due consideration of all the factual circumstances
relating to this one finding, and the constitutional dictates and
implications of this matter as a whole, I am persuaded that the
President's wrongdoing can and should be effectively addressed by
the additional remedy expressly provided by the framers in the
Constitution _ namely, trial before a standard criminal court. And
I am further persuaded that future Presidents, and future
generations, can be effectively deterred from such wrongdoing by
this impeachment and a potential prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The President's behavior has damaged the office of the
Presidency, the nation and everyone involved in this matter. There
are only two potential victims left _ the Senate and the
Constitution _ and I am firmly resolved to allow neither to join
the ranks of the aggrieved. From the day I swore my oath of
impartiality, I determined that the only way I could approach this
case was to ask myself, ``If I were the deciding vote, could I
remove this President under these circumstances?'' The answer, I
conclude, is ``no,'' and therefore, I will vote against both
articles of impeachment.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I will cast two votes as your Senator to convict and remove the
President of the United States. Reaching this verdict has been, for
me, a very difficult ordeal. ...
</P>
<P>
   It is the magnitude of his talents that makes the magnitude of
his misdeeds that much more deplorable. There can be no doubt that
President Clinton's conduct has made a mockery of most of his
words, or that his example has been corrosive beyond calculation to
our culture and to our children. ...
</P>
<P>
   When the Chief Justice calls my name, ``Senator, how say ye?'',
I will say &QC; guilty. ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I harbor no illusions that two-thirds of the Senate will vote as
I will. Therefore, I hope the President will use the remainder of
his time in office to repair the damage he has inflicted upon his
family, our democratic institutions and our country. I will
continue to support his proposals when I believe they are right for
America and for Oregon, and I will continue to oppose them when I
believe they are wrong.

<P>
   After reviewing the evidence, listening carefully to the
presentations of both the House Managers and President Clinton's
legal defense team, I have sadly come to the conclusion that
President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice. In my
mind, these offenses do rise to the level of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' and as result merit a vote for conviction. ...
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton chose not to ``tell the truth the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth,'' he put himself above the law.
He violated his oath, and undermined _ rule of law which he had
sworn to uphold.

<P>
   As a former prosecutor, one of the questions I have asked myself
is whether these criminal charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice would have been brought against any person other than the
President of the United States. If William Jefferson Clinton were
Billy Blythe or Bill Jones, would any prosecutor in the country
have successfully brought such charges? Experienced prosecutors,
Republican and Democrat, testified before the House Judiciary
Committee that no prosecutor would have proceeded based on the
record compiled by Mr. Starr. I agree and note that during the
course of these Senate proceedings the case has only gotten weaker.
...
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have warned that should the President be
acquitted we will damage the ``rule of law.'' I strongly disagree.
Instead, we must follow the supreme law of the land, our
Constitution. By doing so we well establish an important
constitutional precedent and provide a lesson for the future:
partisan impeachment drives are doomed to fail. It is up to the
Senate to restore sanity to this impeachment process, exercise
judgment, do justice and act in the interests of the nation.

<P>
   It is impossible for anyone who has lived through this time in
our history not to feel sadness for the shadow cast on our country
both at home and abroad. President Clinton's behavior is
inexcusable and he has dishonored his office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the manner in which this case was brought before us was an
equal disgrace. We had to endure a flawed prosecutor's unending
pursuit of a duly elected President. We had to watch as the House
managers presented a case that did not withstand the scrutiny of
fact or law.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the Senate will rise above the partisan rancor that
has characterized this case. Tomorrow's vote against impeachment is
a vote not for the President, but for the Constitution.

<P>
   My decision will not come as a surprise. I will be voting to
acquit the President on both counts. I had to make my decision in
September as a member of the Judiciary Committee in the House, and
while I was in the middle of the campaign. ...
</P>
<P>
   The events of the last six months have profoundly troubled me in
a way that I have never felt before. Because for the first time,
I've had doubts about whether our Governmental institutions can
withstand the rancorous currents of the present political climate.
</P>
<P>
   It has shaken me that we stood at the brink of removing the
President not because of a popular groundswell to remove him and
not because of the magnitude of the wrongs he's committed but
because conditions in late 20th century America has made it
possible for a small group of people who hate Bill Clinton and hate
his policies to very cleverly and very doggedly exploit the
institutions of freedom that we hold dear and almost succeed in
undoing him.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling are the conditions that allowed this to happen,
than the small group who precipitated them.
</P>
<P>
   The small group is not the House Managers or particular
officeholders of the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   It is the small group of lawyers and zealots in organizations
like the Rutherford Institute who decided that they would invest
time and money to exploit a personal weakness that people knew the
President had, find a case to air it publicly, investigate the
President's private life to the point of obsession, and use it to
bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   So they found Paula Jones. And whether she was truly wronged or
not, we all knew it was a politically motivated case. ...
</P>
<P>
   What is so profoundly disturbing is not that this small group of
Clinton-haters hatched this plan. It's that this group _ or any
group equally dogmatic and cunning _ came so close to succeeding.
...
</P>
<P>
   Let us shake hands and say we are now going to forgo bringing
down people for political gain. Let us understand that our leaders
have foibles, and though we must be held to a higher standard, let
us not make it a sport to expose those weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have saved us from ourselves. Let's not ask
them to do it too many more times.

</P>
<P>
   No matter how deeply disappointed I am that our President, who
has worked so successfully to lift up the lives of so many people,
so lowered himself and his office, I conclude that his wrongdoing
in this sordid saga does not justify making him the first President
to be ousted from office in our history. I will therefore vote
against both Articles of Impeachment. ...
</P>
<P>
   Although the House managers have left me thoroughly unconvinced
of some of their allegations, the evidence presented on others does
lead me to believe that it is likely that there were occasions on
which the President made false or misleading statements and took
actions which could have had the effect of impeding the discovery
of evidence in judicial proceedings. Whether any of his conduct
constitutes a criminal offense such as perjury or obstruction of
justice is not for me to decide. That, appropriately, should and
must be left to the criminal justice system, which will uphold the
rule of law in President Clinton's case as it would for any other
American. What I must do is uphold the Constitution and decide
whether the House Managers have presented clear and convincing
evidence that the President has committed a high crime or
misdemeanor, which is to say whether they have demonstrated that
his misconduct has so compromised his capacity to govern in the
national interest that he must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   I conclude that the House Managers have not met that high
burden.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives, an institution which I was proud
to serve &QL; 
in for 14 years, was so hellbent on impeachment that it bent the
rules, denied the regular order of business and refused the House a
vote to censure this President so the majority would have a better
chance to visit the disgrace of impeachment on his record. ...
</P>
<P>
   But it would be too facile to dismiss this case simply because
the process, which brought us to this point, is so suspect _ too
easy to discard the fruit of this poisoned tree. ...
</P>
<P>
   Time and again the House managers failed to prove its case _
failed to produce testimony or evidence and at best played to a
draw. I don't need to remind my colleagues in the Senate that
playing to a draw on this field comes down in favor of the
President. ...
</P>
<P>
   I will vote to acquit William Jefferson Clinton on both articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Feinstein
</P>
<P>
   California &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I will vote against conviction and removal of President William
Jefferson Clinton on both articles of impeachment. I do not believe
the House managers established beyond a reasonable doubt that this
President is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to
this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present
danger to the functioning of our Government, and therefore this
President, who has been a good President for the people of the
United States, should not be convicted and removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   But let me be perfectly clear: I do not condone the behavior of
President Clinton. I do not defend it, and I do not accept it. The
conduct at the heart of the charges is deplorable. The President
acted immorally, he acted recklessly, he acted disgracefully. He
willfully misled the American people, the members of his Cabinet,
his staff and the judicial system. In doing this, he has brought
shame and dishonor upon the Office of the President, and,
especially, upon himself.

   We risk opening the floodgates to more party-line impeachments
if we oust a President from office for behavior that _ while truly
deplorable _ isn't truly removable. Lowering the standard would do
as great a disservice to the Constitution as the President's
behavior has done to the Oval Office. So I am voting to acquit on
both articles.
</P>
<P>
   I state these conclusions with a certainty I do not feel. We
have heard many say these votes are the most difficult they will
ever cast, and I agree. ... The evidence does not prove high
crimes, but it does prove low character in our highest office _ and
that matters, it is relevant, it is material. ... If ``reasonable
people can disagree,'' as the House prosecutors concede, have we
really met the high threshold established for removal?
</P>
<P>
   To ask that question is to answer it. ...

   If I might paraphrase a legal doctrine, this impeachment has
become the fruit of the poisonous tree. This impeachment is a
deadly plant that has flowered in the toxic soil of partisanship.

</P>
<P>
   The House managers did not prove their case beyond a reasonable
doubt. In my opinion, they didn't even come close.
</P>
<P>
   But I want to speak candidly here. As I indicated earlier, I
doubt I will ever know for a fact what the President was up to when
he lied to Ms. Currie about the nature of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. I find this particular episode quite disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have a hunch that his intent was criminal. To
borrow from House Manager Graham, they think it's likely that he
was up to no good. But hunches are not impeachable, nor should they
be. ...
</P>
<P>
   Today I will vote to acquit on both counts. But I don't want
that to be my final contribution. I want to be able to tell my
grandchildren that this was the point in American history where we
drew a line in the sand and said ``no more'' to this excessive
partisanship; a time when we said ``no more'' to a brand of
politics that we know is bringing out the worst in good people.

   Removal of this President on the grounds established by the
House managers would upset the delicate balance of powers so
meticulously established 212 years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chief Justice, the framers set high standards for removal
because they understood that the office of the Presidency would be
held by imperfect human beings. They assembled a government that
could withstand personal failings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We should be outraged that William Jefferson Clinton's personal
failings debased himself and his office. But they did not cause
permanent injury to the proper functioning of our Government. He
did not upset the constitutional balance of powers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hope that the Chief Justice, my colleagues, and the American
people will not misinterpret my comments. While it has not been
proven that President William Jefferson Clinton committed the high
crimes and misdemeanors required for removal from office, he is not
above the law. His acquittal in this impeachment trial is not
exoneration. ... &QL;

JURORS CLEAR MAN IN THE SLAYING OF A TEACHER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan jury acquitted a 27-year-old Brooklyn man
Thursday of all charges in the May 1997 killing of a popular Bronx
high school English teacher. The jurors criticized the aggressive
police tactics used in the case, saying they could not trust a
confession made by the defendant, Montoun T. Hart, because
detectives insisted on questioning him when he was drunk and high
on marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who said he was threatened with a death sentence and
pressured into falsely confessing, jumped up and down and hugged
his lawyer as the jury forewoman pronounced him not guilty of
second-degree murder and robbery charges in the shooting death of
the teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Levin, the victim's mother, sat stunned in the courtroom
as the verdict was read. Hart apologized to her before leaving the
courthouse a free man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, ma'am, for your son, but I did not do this crime,''
Hart said. ``I swear to God. I swear to God. God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, an ashen Ms. Levin, who attended every day of
Hart's four-week trial, told reporters that she did not know what
to believe. ``I hope for the sake of Jonathan and for the sake of
society that he was telling the truth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's verdict, both young men accused of brutally
torturing and killing Levin for his bank card access code escaped
the punishment prosecutors sought.
</P>
<P>
   The police investigation of the slaying of Levin, the son of
Gerald Levin, the chairman of Time-Warner, was one of the most
intense in New York in recent years, involving 60 detectives. In
November, a Manhattan jury acquitted Corey Arthur, a former student
of Levin's at William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx, of
first-degree murder, saying the evidence failed to prove that
Arthur fired the fatal shot in Levin's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, 20, who faced life in prison without parole for a
first-degree conviction, was convicted of second-degree murder and
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   With no fingerprints or DNA from Hart found in the teacher's
apartment, jurors said the key piece of evidence against him was a
confession detectives obtained during a 3:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
interrogation a week after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who took the witness stand in his own defense Tuesday,
testified that the detectives, Anthony Vasquez and John Taglioni,
threatened him with the death penalty if he did not confess to
being present at Levin's slaying. At a news conference at his
lawyer's office after his acquittal, Hart and his weeping mother
assailed the detectives' conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``A total injustice is the word for the way they treated me,''
said Hart, who spent nearly two years in jail awaiting trial.
``There's so much anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Five jurors, who spoke to a reporter after the verdict on the
condition of anonymity, said they were unsure whether Hart played a
role in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us thought he might have been there,'' one juror
said. ``Some thought Corey Arthur might have done it himself. But
we all agreed they didn't prove their case.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other evidence linking Hart to the slaying was a
witness who said he saw Hart at a nearby bank machine that
afternoon. But the jurors said they could not rely on that because
the police waited until eight months after the killing to have the
witness view Hart in a lineup. Throughout the trial, Hart's defense
lawyer, David Stern, attacked the police for failing to do basic
police work in the case.

<P>
   Danny Dayton, an actor and director, died on Saturday at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 75 and lived in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, his publicist said.
</P>
<P>
   As an actor on television, Dayton played the character known as
Hank Pivnik on ``All in the Family'' and also appeared on ``It's
Garry Shandling's Show'' and ``Sergeant Bilko.'' His television
credits also included appearances on ``The Nanny,'' ``Cagney and
Lacey,'' ``Dallas'' and ``MASH.'' He also directed television
shows, including ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Masquerade Party.'' His
deft directorial hand with television commercials won him three
Clio awards.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, who was born in Jersey City, N.J., was a graduate of New
York University's School of Journalism but turned instead to the
theater. He replaced Zero Mostel in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum'' and also directed and appeared in the show's
national touring company. He also had roles in ``High Button
Shoes,'' ``Detective Story'' and ``At War With the Army.'' His film
appearances included ``Flicks,'' ``Requiem for a Heavyweight,''
``The Turning Point'' and ``Ed Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Arlene; a son, Charles, and a
daughter, Robin Allison Smalley, both of Los Angeles, and two
grandchildren. &QL;

IOC MAKES ITS CASE ON REFORMS TO ANXIOUS SPONSORS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: See Also OLY-SALTLAKE)   (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee officials Thursday tried to
assure anxious Olympic sponsors of their zeal to rapidly contain
the scandal over improper payments to its members and to reform how
it does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had concerns about the reform process, about how far the
IOC intends to go,'' said Michael Payne, the organization's
marketing director. ``We briefed them on our commitment to root out
unethical behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said no sponsors threatened to pull out of the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia, or the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City or demanded rebates on their fees. ``It was all about the
steps the IOC is taking to put this behind us,'' he said. ``They're
concerned that we get this resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the 11 sponsors and NBC, which is paying $3.5
billion for the domestic television rights to the next five
Olympics, attended the meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   One executive who attended the IOC meeting and asked not to be
identified said the atmosphere in the meeting was ``polite but at
times chilly.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding message from the sponsors was that the IOC has
not been accountable on this issue.'' He added, ``The message went
back to the IOC loud and clear that the people managing the
sponsorships have no good story to tell the top of the corporate
houses and that had to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors' concerns are acute because the IOC charges them
fees that average $40 million, and any failure to contain the
corruption will depress the value of their sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   The executive also said the sponsors did not ask for the
resignation of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, but said,
``Where is the accountability? Who is going to be held
accountable?''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said, ``We're not talking about a total re-creation of the
IOC but a total housecleaning of however many members it requires
us to expel.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC ousted six members for receiving improper gifts from
Salt Lake City organizers. Richard Pound, who headed the IOC
commission that investigated the Salt Lake City scandal, told
sponsors he would expand his investigation in light of a report
released Tuesday by an independent ethics panel working for the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee that tied 14 international committee
members to the scandal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During a conference call Thursday, Pound said the ethics panel's
report ``will become part of our ongoing investigation. The new
information will be pursued diligently and may lead to new
recommendations by our commission to the executive board.'' And
although he described the ethics panel's report as ``not very
agreeable reading,'' he said he could not assess how serious the
new charges are until he reads the report's voluminous appendices.
</P>
<P>
   And, he played down stinging criticism of the international
committee by one of its sponsors, the John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co., whose president, David D'Alessandro, has ordered the
Olympic rings taken off a company billboard at Fenway Park and
halted talks with NBC to buy $20 million in Olympic advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he hopes that by doing this he increases the pressure
on us to do the right thing,'' Pound said. ``Even without that kind
of pressure, we'd still do what we're doing because it's the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, one proposed reform _ to limit the host city selection
process to 15 IOC delegates, not the full committee _ may be
scrapped. Francois Carrard, the IOC's executive director, said the
proposal was being reconsidered because members felt they should
not be penalized for the wrongdoing of others. &QL;

GROUP OF INVESTORS BUYING CONTROL OF TOP DRIVING SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Skip Barber Racing School, the largest school in the country
for high-performance and competition driving, has agreed to become
the first acquisition of a new buyout fund formed by Chase Capital
Partners and the International Management Group, a sports marketing
company.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held fund, called Sports Capital Partners,
announced this week that it had agreed to acquire an 80 percent
stake in the school for an amount between $25 million and $35
million, depending upon ``certain performance incentives.'' The
deal is expected to close next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Barber school, based in Lakeville, Conn., has trained many
professional and amateur race drivers. It also runs courses to help
highway drivers avoid accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, the sole owner, started the school in 1975 with two
borrowed racing cars. It now has a fleet of 225 vehicles and more
than 400 employees who conduct courses at 30 American racing
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The school's graduates number 270,000, among them Michael
Andretti, Jeff Gordon and Paul Newman. Jerry Seinfeld, who attended
the school twice _ and never asked for or received a discount,
Barber said _ gave the school one of the most desirable product
placements in sitcom history: He placed its logo on the door of his
often-raided refrigerator in ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the buyout are the Formula Dodge Racing Series, an
amateur championship, and the Barber Dodge Pro Series, a
steppingstone to pro racing's top circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The deal does not include Lime Rock Park, the 1.53-mile racing
circuit in northwestern Connecticut that is the school's home
track. Barber will continue as majority owner of Lime Rock Park.
</P>
<P>
   The general partners of Sports Capital Partners are Chase
Capital, the private equity investing arm of the Chase Manhattan
Corp.; IMG, the sports marketing and management group, and David S.
Moross, the managing partner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moross said Sports Capital Partners had raised $102 million for
the sports fund and was aiming for $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Barber said he intended to use money from the sale to expand the
school overseas and to buy training companies that work with
automakers in such areas as teaching engineers about desirable
handling characteristics and showing dealers how new models perform
in comparison with competing products.
</P>
<P>
   IMG already has motor sports interests, which will remain
separate from the fund. It is the promoter of Indy-car races in
Cleveland, Detroit and Surfers Paradise, Australia, and it
represents Indy-car drivers Jimmy Vasser and Bryan Herta and
Formula One drivers David Coulthard of Scotland and Ralf Schumacher
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Stanner, a leader of IMG's motor sports branch, said IMG
would use its racing activities to increase the exposure and
corporate sponsorships for the Barber school and its racing series.
Although the fund has no plans to buy race tracks, Stanner said,
``I would certainly not rule that out in the future.'' &QL;

SANDY BEACHES ARE LEAST SENSITIVE TO SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 and SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOS BAY _ The growing oil spill here threatens priceless
natural resources, but this may be one of the best places on the
Oregon Coast to clean it up and limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to burn-off the fuel aboard the beached freighter New
Carissa were inspired by fear of a nightmarish alternative: beaches
and inlets smeared with up to 400,000 gallons of oil products.
</P>
<P>
   At risk are rocky tidepools, oyster-choked mudflats and pristine
estuaries, those prime wildlife nurseries where salt and fresh
water merge. Also in danger of contamination are seal and sea lion
haul-out areas, Oregon's best nesting area for the threatened
Western snowy plover and a host of other seabirds and shorebirds.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the New Carissa wrecked at the southern
end of Oregon's longest stretch of sandy beaches. Though sand looks
messy with oil on it, it is the least ecologically sensitive and
easiest coastal surface to clean.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, rocky tidepools and mudflats can be so hard to
clean that treatment may be worse than the oil, said Sharon
Christopherson, a scientist from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Hazmat Team.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents here have already gained experience on beach
cleanup. For the past week, as strings and tar globs of oil washed
up on beaches, cleanup crews have pushed the black goo into piles
and shoveled it into bags. All-terrain-vehicles lugged the filled
bags to staging areas.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of oil released so far has been relatively small, by
the official consensus here, and little has been reported beyond
two miles from the ship. As of late Thursday, only three birds have
been treated here by the International Bird Rescue Research Center,
according to its director, Jay Holcomb. Five birds have been
reported dead. One seal was found dead, though officials said they
had not concluded whether oil caused its death.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the spill is growing more hazardous with each day.
Migrations of birds will build in the coming weeks, and plover
nesting season will start about March 15.
</P>
<P>
   While ready to accelerate beach cleanup, officials say they have
prepared to protect other, more sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hoffmeister, of the Bureau of Land Management's Coos Bay
District, said his greatest fear was that an oil slick would drift
a few miles south of the wreck and get sucked with the tide into
Coos Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The mouth of Coos Bay harbor is only a few hundred yards wide,
but it is so turbulent, with waves meeting tidal flows, that
oil-recovery booms cannot work there. Christopherson said hydraulic
pressure would push oil under or over the boom.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, red and yellow floating booms _ designed to prevent
oil from passing _ were strung across the mouth of Coos Bay's South
Slough, a near-pristine estuary that flows into the bay from
marshes and muddy tideflats further south. It holds commercial
oyster beds, and is untainted enough to be one of only 23 National
Estuarine Reserves where teams of biologists conduct research.
</P>
<P>
   Some oil boom has been stored inside Coos Bay. Oyster farmers in
North Coos Bay have begged officials to deploy them across the
harbor to protect their shellfish. But despite some oil sightings
in the bay, no boom has yet been deployed beyond the mouth of South
Slough.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern of biologists is that oil might drift south of
the bay's mouth to the rocky Cape Arago area. It is used by
hundreds of seals and sea lions that are vulnerable to oil
contamination. It also holds tidepools that host a rich variety of
anemones, crabs, starfish, chitons and other marine wildlife.
Christopherson said if they are oiled, treatment with hot water,
steam, or manual scrubbing may be considered. But in the most
biologically rich areas, treatment may be light to avoid doing more
harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday they had also deployed an oil boom
across Ten Mile Creek, the first watercourse entering the Pacific
north of the wrecked freighter, to protect its tidal wetlands. They
have built stockpiles of boom as far north up the coast as the
Umpqua River, which has a sensitive estuary.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, a wind from the south was carrying the oil
northward, offshore somewhat. Scientists said it may weather
somewhat at sea, then wash ashore. And they expressed the hope that
flames will consume most of the oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burning the oil is not what we would prefer to do,'' said
Christopherson. ``But it's less of a threat than what might
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts with leading environmental organizations expressed
regret that crews in Oregon were left with a choice of air
pollution from burning oil or water pollution from spilled oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of questions here,'' said Peter Lehner, a
senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``What
are the human health impacts?
</P>
<P>
   ``The air plume is going to get pretty widely dispersed. Is this
the correct tradeoff? I don't know,'' Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Fujita, a marine ecologist with the Environmental Defense
Fund, called the decision to blow the freighter's tanks, then
ignite them ``triage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what I know, I would rather see the stuff burn off. It
will dissipate in time,'' Fujita said. ``But if the oil gets into
sediments (of estuaries), it could be problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst fear, Fujita said, is that oil seeps into wetlands,
creating environmental problems that could last for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coos Bay is one of these enclosed estuaries with wetlands, and
it is very sensitive,'' he said.

 &HT;    Bradley promotes diversity, unity during speech
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Americans are more interested in
protecting their ethnic turf than in finding common ground that
will bring people together, presidential candidate Bill Bradley
said Thursday during a speech to the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. senator from New Jersey, who is hoping to win
the Democratic nomination, told the crowd of more than 400 at The
Breakers that ``race for me remains our unresolved dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I become president of the United States there will be one
message that will be very clear,'' Bradley said. ``If you want to
please the boss, you will figure out ways to promote tolerance and
racial unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that for too long the nation's political leaders
have ignored America's growing diversity and that the result has
been too much divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation is not built on the will of the majority but on
respect for the minority,'' he said, adding that this belief would
be a core part of his campaign. ``We need to listen to each other
much more. We need tolerance and we need an ability to learn from
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is the only challenger so far to Vice President Al Gore
for the Democratic nomination. Bradley, a former forward for the
New York Knicks, considered running for president throughout the
'80s but backed away each time for either personal or political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 55, says that he now has the experience needed to
challenge for the Democratic Party nomination. In recent speeches,
Bradley has warned that the party has drifted too far from its core
beliefs in economic and social justice.

NOWITZKI CANDIDATE FOR `NEXT MIKE?' WHY NOT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In the NBA's desperate search for the ``Next Michael,''
many candidates have been mentioned, none of them worth the time it
takes to say, ``Allen Iverson.''
</P>
<P>
   If looking for only the ``Next Mike,'' as in doing-hard-time
Tyson, then Iverson can be the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the fact his name comes up speaks to the absurdity of
the search. And continuing on that same theme, allow me to nominate
my own fantasy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Nowitzki.
</P>
<P>
   Why not this German kid as the ``Next Michael?'' Order another
round and use some imagination here. Also grade heavily on the
curve, particularly if you've seen Nowitzki's attempt at defense.
Overall, he's about 10 miles over his head at the moment. But if
nothing else, Dirk makes as much sense as Shaq, Grant, Kobe, Tim or
any other nonqualified candidate. Give up the chase. There is not
going to be any ``Next Michael.'' There can be no replacement for a
one-and-only, in person or performance.
</P>
<P>
   The league's star system, however, is strong and in place, and
it's also no disgrace that none measure up to Michael. During the
Houston Rockets' invasion last night of Reunion Arena, that front
line of Olajuwon-Barkley-Pippen is worthy of a reluctant ticket
buyer making the hip-pocket reach.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, so was the game as the Mavericks hung tough
once again, only to fade late, and lose, 105-95, to one of the
NBA's best clubs _ at least best in this non-Michael era.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA pecking order ranges from aging headline acts such
as Houston's trio, to the Shaq class, to the dire necessity for a
transfusion of new blood.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely put Nowitzki as a possibility for that last category,
even though his game is as green as a Heineken bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But with very limited exposure to the NBA thus far, the
20-year-old Nowitzki has already shown enough to rank as the most
intriguing talent the Mavericks have ever had, save Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   The difference from Kidd, however, is here's a 7-footer who not
only runs the floor well, but also moves the ball upcourt like an
overgrown point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Typical European big man, you say? Wants to homestead the
3-point line, you say? Most surprising, even to Don Nelson, who has
his reputation and job on the line with Nowitzki, has been the
willingness to plunge inside, take the pounding and come away with
rebounds and loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   The kid had the quick offensive start last night, ringing up
eight first-quarter points, including a single-up move to the hole
on Pippen, drawing a foul on the bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, Nowitzki was lost on several defensive
switches, was burned on 3-point bombs by Rockets' rookie Michael
Dickerson, and had no impact the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth-quarter crunch time, Nelson kept him on the bench.
With eight points on 3-for-9 shooting and five boards, the learning
process continues _ slowly _ but the potential remains huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirk had the good start, and I was expecting a strong night,''
said Nelson. ``but he didn't get some calls and became a little
tentative after that. It's all about being patient with him, and
trying to get him matched up right. But I'd say he's been a little
better at this point than I thought he would be. You do see the
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, however, they also see the Paul Pierce skills. Around
here, Nowitzki will forever be compared to the former Kansas
player, whom Nelson passed over in June's draft for the German.
Pierce has had a great start with the Celtics, but it was Boston
coach Rick Pitino who spent most of the summer plotting ways to
acquire Nowitzki, only to have Nelson get there first.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Nowitzki is far behind a Pierce, and everyone else, in
basketball foundation. His background comes from a German league
that wouldn't measure up to junior-college caliber. And then there
was only the brief NBA training camp, and two exhibition games,
before Nowitzki was tossed to Scottie, Charles, Karl, etc.
</P>
<P>
   All of this gives Nowitzki an ample upside for the future, but
fair or not, snap judgments on this player are being made ``now.''
Seventeen years later, there still have been way too many Bill
Garnetts come and go among Mavericks' draft picks. Particularly in
big-man size.
</P>
<P>
   This is a franchise trying to regain the trust of the fans, who
have grown immune over the years to one monumental screwup after
another when it comes to talent evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki, who quickly caught the attention of the local public,
can change that perception, pronto. It only takes one home-run ball
in the draft. Extremely early returns are extremely promising. From
raw talent comes rare talent.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki won't be the ``Next Michael,'' but if he becomes a very
good player, then the Mavericks will have gained much more than
usual.

FROGS HAVE FUN, TURN TO DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU's Derale Wilson has this theory. He says
a wink and a smile solve any and all problems.
</P>
<P>
   So Wilson had his smile on, his wink going, and added a little
defense for good measure, as he helped spark TCU to a 102-85
thumping of Wyoming last night at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Problem solved. Four-game losing streak snapped. Fun restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been too serious because we've been losing,'' Wilson
said. ``We just needed to have a little fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, TCU (16-7, 4-5 Western Athletic Conference) had a
lot of fun. Six Horned Frogs players scored in double figures,
including a team-high 23 by Marquise Gainous.
</P>
<P>
   TCU guard Prince Fowler missed a triple-double by two rebounds.
He had a school-record 16 assists, 14 points and a team-high eight
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wilson provided TCU with energy.
</P>
<P>
   His consecutive uncontested layups began the Frogs' 13-4 run to
close out the first half, and essentially the game. Wilson finished
with 12 points and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a spark,'' Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said. ``Remember,
too, he's a little rusty to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had played sparingly since returning after a six-week
hiatus with a broken bone in his foot.
</P>
<P>
   From his spot on TCU's bench, Wilson had noticed a few problems
while TCU was losing four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all anxious,'' he said. ``We were playing like we were
trying to avoid losing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Fowler and center Lee Nailon called a players-only
gathering Monday. The air was cleared. The problems were addressed.
The evidence was there from the beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said ``before the game, in the dressing room, it was
real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't feel real before,'' Fowler said. ``It wasn't as loud
or as deep. Tonight, it was like a blaze. It was like everyone was
erupting.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU showed a defensive effort that had been missing.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a loose ball went sailing from sideline to
sideline, and three Frogs players were diving on the court after
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it shows is hustle,'' Tubbs said. ``Obviously, our guys
were ready to play, and play as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Nailon, who didn't start because of a sprained left ankle
suffered in Saturday's loss to SMU, contributed. He came into the
game with 14:21 remaining in the first half, and finished with 21
points despite missing a good portion of the second half because of
foul trouble. He fouled out with 3:27 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (14-7, 5-5 WAC) were led by Ugo Udezue who had a
game-high 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs were buoyed by strong shooting, 58 percent in the
first half and 70 percent in the second half, and a 38-28 edge in
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this all along,'' Cowboys coach Steve McClain said.
``You don't go from a Top 25 team to a team who can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost like watching the Horned Frogs of old last night,
only the smiles were a little bigger than maybe the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you taste losing,'' Wilson said. ``You are able
to enjoy winning even more.''

SHAQ'S NEW PAIN ISN'T OLD PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Shaquille O'Neal cringed Wednesday night when he
felt a pull in his groin area. On Thursday, the rest of the team
cringed at the mere words contained in the diagnosis: ``abdominal
strain.''
</P>
<P>
   It should sound familiar _ it's what knocked the Los Angeles
Lakers center out of 22 games last season. The similarity alone
could be cause for some alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent injury is not a recurrence of last year's
ailment, which was on his left side. This ailment is on the right
side of his abdominal/groin area, and is believed to be less
severe.
</P>
<P>
   And though it knocked him out of Thursday's loss to Minnesota,
O'Neal vows to return for Sunday's home game against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of painful,'' O'Neal said. ``Coach was gracious
enough to let me sit out this game, so I'm gonna rehab these next
couple days and come back Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's abdominal strain last year also began as a relatively
minor problem but was aggravated by a series of premature comeback
attempts and became a nagging problem throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because I didn't treat it,'' O'Neal said. ``I just took
days off, and I didn't treat it. I'm gonna treat it, and my guy's
coming down from Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian would be Vancouver-based abdominal specialist Alex
McKechnie, who has become a semipermanent member of O'Neal's
entourage. McKechnie will examine him today in Los Angeles and
determine whether he can play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' O'Neal said. ``This one is just kind of
sore, and I really don't want to push it.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are concerned, though, knowing how tough it is to
lose their leading scorer and rebounder for extended periods. He
missed 53 games his first two seasons as a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it's not anything that is long-term,'' Derek Fisher
said. ``If that's an injury that's gonna linger on, that really
could affect us (in the short season) because every game is of
major importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Joked Kobe Bryant, ``This better be the only game he sits out.
I'll kick his butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Stranded: About four inches of snow blanketed the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area Thursday, and Fisher felt every inch of
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers point guard almost didn't make it to the arena when
the harsh storm clogged up the roads, leaving him stranded at a
massage therapy center several miles from the Target Center. After
waiting an hour, a receptionist _ obviously not a Timberwolves fan
_ volunteered to drive Fisher to the arena.
</P>
<P>
   But he dropped him off two blocks away, and Fisher, dressed in
sweats and wearing only socks and sandals, trudged through the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked over, and I'm trying to play it cool, you know, like
I'm not cold, and like I don't have flip-flops on,'' he said. ``I
had some socks on, but the snow was over the top of the shoes.''

FORMER LPGA BOSS HEARS PARTING SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Everything is on the upswing for the LPGA.
Players are competing for more money, more tournaments are being
televised and the talent level is deeper than ever.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons to believe the LPGA's best days are
ahead, but there also are rumblings of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Most players are thankful for the accomplishments of outgoing
commissioner Jim Ritts, who abruptly resigned a week ago to take a
job as CEO of Santa Monica-based Digital Entertainment Network,
which delivers television-quality programming to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But others say _ and not so privately _ that Ritts ``sugarcoated
everything'' and was prone to exaggeration. There also are
complaints about too many events, easy courses and purses that
aren't big enough.
</P>
<P>
   La Canada's Helen Alfredsson, in a column published in the Feb.
12 issue of Golf World, said she was happy to see the LPGA's vice
president of business affairs, Ty Votaw, succeed Ritts as
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing you can count on from Ty Votaw, it's an
honest answer,'' Alfredsson wrote. ``That definitely wasn't the
case with Ritts. Jim Ritts sugarcoated everything, and it made me
very leery.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is difficult to ignore the tour's steady progress
heading into the Valley of the Stars Championship beginning today
at Oakmont Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   This year's purses are worth $36.2 million, a 50-percent
increase from a year ago. Thirty-four of last year's events were
televised; that number grew to 42 tournaments and 238 hours this
year, the most hours of coverage for any women's professional
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Among Ritts' noteworthy achievements were the establishment of
the Mercury LPGA Series, which will include 10 events on ESPN; the
creation of a bonus pool for LPGA players 40 years of age and
older; and a new partnership with the Futures Tour, which will be
modeled along the lines of the PGA's Nike Tour. He also helped
introduce new criteria for the Hall of Fame, which resulted in this
week's additions of Amy Alcott and Beth Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   When Ritts succeeded the popular Charlie Mechem as LPGA
commissioner early in 1995, he said he was given a clear mandate _
fill out the schedule, increase purses and secure more hours of
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable that I helped put the tour on the right
track,'' Ritts said from Orlando, Fla., on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't surprised at criticism of his job performance
because it comes with the territory. He said he had not read
Alfredsson's column and ``heard only parts of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the reality,'' he said. ``When you are the
commissioner, the CEO or the chairman of something, when you are a
public figure, you can't keep everybody happy, no matter what you
do. I'm disappointed in some of the things that have been said. As
a human being, you can't help (it).
</P>
<P>
   ``But the vast majority of the players have been very
supportive. And the reality is you can't be commissioner without
their support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to be able to please 144 women week-in and
week-out, I'm sorry,'' said Penny Hammel, who has been on tour
since 1985. ``I personally think he has done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a great leader for our tour and achieved a lot of
wonderful things,'' said Alcott, who will be enshrined March 22,
the same day Votaw officially takes over. ``He's helped take the
tour to new levels with television and purses. He's also been a
tremendous spokesperson for women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He truly loves it. He's been great at the helm, and he'll be
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritts may have had his detractors, but his resignation _ his
contract was renewed in December _ took everyone by surprise.
Players didn't even know about it until he sent them overnight
mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy that came in and said he was going to spend a lot
of time with us,'' Beth Daniel said. ``And after three years, to do
that last week ... I was totally shocked. I still can't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Votaw, the LPGA has someone with perhaps an even stronger
passion for the women's game than Ritts. Tour officials were so
confident they found their man an outside search was not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Votaw, who turns 37 today and was hired as the tour's general
counsel in 1991, said he realized almost two years ago he was ready
for the job if the opportunity ever came his way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working behind the scenes _ ``Flying under the radar
screen,'' he said _ he suddenly finds himself in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting used to that role I'm now having to play,'' he
said. ``I'm very excited about the opportunity, and I have a huge
and deep passion for the organization. I know how great a product
the LPGA players and the association is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned to the players a couple of nights ago, when I
addressed them for the first time, that while we've experienced a
lot of growth in the last eight years, and certainly the last three
under Jim Ritts' leadership, I know we can do better.''

 (Subs penultimate graf to correct states' settlement figure)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $51.5 million judgment against Philip Morris Cos. by a
California jury could well trigger a slew of individual lawsuits by
people who have gotten sick or died from smoking. The $1.5 million
in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages awarded
to a 53-year-old smoker who has inoperable lung cancer may still be
overturned on appeal, as have verdicts in the past that have
favored smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But many potential plaintiffs, and those who already have filed
lawsuits elsewhere in the country, will be encouraged by this case
and other recent developments. President Clinton's decision to sue
the tobacco industry for billions of dollars spent treating
tobacco-related illnesses under Medicare and other federal medical
programs will compound the industry's problems.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence that has been unearthed in state lawsuits shows
that the industry tried to conceal the health hazards of smoking
and the addictive nature of nicotine. Juries that are faced with
such information may be less apt than earlier juries to blame
smokers for assuming the risks of smoking, and more eager to punish
cigarette makers for fraud and deception. Even if big verdicts are
reduced or overturned, simply defending hundreds of cases could be
financially debilitating for the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of fighting endless private and federal lawsuits
could cause the industry to seek a deal with Congress. Such a deal
could settle the potentially enormous federal claims, but it must
not give the industry immunity from other lawsuits, which remain a
useful hammer to compel responsible behavior. The industry already
has agreed to pay 46 states $206 billion over the next 25 years to
recover their Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's tobacco bill would have granted the Food and Drug
Administration authority to regulate tobacco and nicotine, greatly
restricted marketing practices that attract teen-age smokers and
required the industry to pay penalties if youth smoking rates do
not go down in the next decade. Those elements ought to be part of
any new legislative proposal.

NETS `LET GO OF THE ROPE' AS BUCKS PREVAIL  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, _ Moving swiftly and rising high on what had been a
bruised right knee, Kerry Kittles made his season debut Thursday
night at the Bradley Center. But as valuable as his return will be
in the future, the presence of the third-year shooting guard was of
no immediate benefit to the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing their pattern of disheveled offensive execution and
slight defensive resistance, the Nets were beaten by the Milwaukee
Bucks, 95-75.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets trailed the entire game and shot a frigid 26 percent in
the decisive second and third quarters. They trailed by as many as
26 points and never seriously challenged after Milwaukee built a
double-digit lead in the final minute of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   At the end the Bucks (3-0) were tossing behind-the-back passes,
leaping over the Nets for resounding dunks and drilling 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the last time this happened to us,'' coach
John Calipari said after watching the Nets drop to 1-3 without
making a real second-half run. ``We wanted to make a run, but
instead we let go of the rope. It's been about two years since a
team in New Jersey let go of the rope.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kittles' return, the only good news for the Nets
was that Rony Seikaly, who was in uniform but did not play, and Sam
Cassell should return to action Monday in Miami. Seikaly has yet to
play because of injury, and Cassell has missed the past three games
with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles, who played both guard spots, did not start but played
43 minutes, finishing with 15 points on 6 of 13 shooting. Matched
against Ray Allen, Kittles was outplayed as Allen led the Bucks
with 19 points. Glenn Robinson added 18 points for Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Though Calipari was impressed with Kittles' performance, the
guard was expecting much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt out of sync a little bit,'' he said. ``They played
great defense and took me out of my normal game. But I haven't
played in about three weeks, so I'm still trying to get into my
groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burrell led the Nets with 17 points, while Keith Van Horn
added 13 points and 11 rebounds. Jayson Williams broke his string
of two straight games without a field goal by making 3 of 6 shots
in scoring eight points to go with nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had a scare when Van Horn tripped over a fallen
teammate, Kendall Gill, with 22 seconds left in the third quarter
and limped off the court, favoring his right knee. But Van Horn
returned a minute into the fourth quarter. Calipari did not waste
time in going to Kittles. When starter Lucious Harris strained his
lower back 58 seconds after the opening tip, Calipari summoned his
third-year shooting guard from the bench. Kittles missed his first
jumper and made a false cut to the basket that caused a Williams
pass to fly out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, after his club missed six of its first eight
shots, Calipari called a timeout, and Cassell met Kittles on the
floor. ``Kerry, you're playing too tentative,'' Cassell said.
``Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism sparked Kittles momentarily, as he blocked a shot
by Allen, then sank a running 8-footer while being fouled for a
three-point play just before the end of the first quarter. That was
his only highlight of the half, though, as he finished with five
points and two assists in 20 minutes. Perhaps the most encouraging
aspect of his season debut was that his knee looked fine.
</P>
<P>
   That was small consolation to Calipari, who altered his starting
lineup by replacing Chris Gatling with Burrell. Disgusted by his
club's lethargic, 25-turnover performance in Wednesday's 89-81 loss
to Orlando, Calipari was hoping to insert some life into his team.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he did not get the desired result, but Burrell
responded to the upgrade. Complementing the outside shooting touch
he displayed in averaging 16.5 points in the last two games with
aggressive drives to the basket, the 6-foot-7-inch small forward
scored 12 first-half points to lead the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   But his teammates were not as effective. The offense looked
helter-skelter, with players running frantically to different spots
as Calipari yelled instructions from the sideline. For the most
part, it looked hauntingly similar to street ball, as one-on-one
moves dominated. The end result was 13 turnovers before the half.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was not much better, as the Bucks sliced through the
lane for nifty layups, outran the Nets to score eight fast-break
points, and beat the Nets' sluggish rotations to get open jumpers
for Robinson and Allen. The duo responded with 12 and 11 points,
respectively, to lift Milwaukee to its 12-point halftime lead. &QL;

EARNHART, LABONTE WIN TWIN 125 QUALIFYING HEATS FOR DAYTONA 500 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The 1999 Winston Cup season began to pick
up speed Thursday as 59 drivers attempted to squeeze into the
43-car field for stock car racing's premier event, the Daytona 500
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, the three-time Winston Cup champion, and Tony
Stewart, the former Indy Racing League champion turned Nascar
rookie, qualified 1-2 last Saturday, but position Nos. 3 to 43 were
up for grabs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a qualifying system unique to this race at Daytona
International Speedway, those competing for positions behind Gordon
and Stewart battled bumper to bumper in Thursday's Twin 125
qualifying heats.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, last year's Daytona 500 winner and a seven-time
Winston Cup champion, won his 10th straight Twin 125. In the other
heat, Bobby Labonte took his first checkered flag in a Twin 125. He
and Earnhardt will start from the second row on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton and Jeremy Mayfield occupy the third row, while Dale
Jarrett and Mark Martin were disappointing, qualifying eight and
ninth, respectively, in Fords.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished second and Stewart, driving in his first Winston
Cup race, was sixth in what amounted to practice runs for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was perfect,'' said Earnhardt, who piloted a Chevrolet
Monte Carlo. ``It drove perfect on every lap. Not a bit loose; not
any push.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gordon led the first 38 laps of his heat, he got a hard
look at the rear bumper of his main competition for Sunday's race.
Gordon finished 1.63 seconds behind Labonte, whose Pontiac Grand
Prix once again figures to be dominant on the series'
superspeedways at Daytona and Talladega. With 12 laps left,
Labonte, who is Stewart's teammate, made an aggressive pass to
overtake Gordon, who was slowed by lapped traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've got a great race car,'' said Gordon, who finished
16th in the Daytona 500 last year. ``It's handling awesome. We
might be able to get a little more speed out of it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
Earnhardt Versus Earnhardt
</P>
<P>
   Several family rivalries will heat up on the track this weekend,
but none will burn hotter than Dale Earnhardt versus Dale Earnhardt
Jr. They will race head to head for the first time in real
competition on Friday in the International Race of Champions
series.
</P>
<P>
   The father and son swapped paint in Nascar's exhibition race in
Japan last season, but this time both will be racing hard.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken Earnhardt, 47, is a two-time IROC champion;
Earnhardt Jr., 23, is just as brash as his dad.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Earnhardt, who burst onto the Nascar scene last
season by winning his first Busch series championship, begins his
title defense on Saturday in the Napa 300.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they will be competing against 12 drivers from
different racing circuits, all in identically prepared Pontiacs.
</P>
<P>
   The CART drivers Adrian Fernandez and Greg Moore; last year's
Indianapolis 500 winner, Eddie Cheever, and the 1998 Indy Racing
League champion, Kenny Brack, are among the challengers. Mark
Martin will look to repeat as IROC champion.  &QL; 
New Deal for Wallace
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace, who qualified 10th for the Daytona 500, announced
that his contract with Miller Lite had been extended through 2003.
Wallace, 42, said this could be his last contract before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is one of the few Winston Cup champions without a
victory in the Daytona 500. But that could change this weekend as
his Ford Taurus is among the fastest cars, finishing a close fourth
in his Twin 125 heat Thursday.  &QL; 
Monte Carlo Delayed
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which makes its first public
appearance at the Chicago automobile show this weekend, was
originally scheduled to make its Nascar debut at Charlotte, N.C.,
in May. But that date has been pushed back because Nascar officials
have not approved the body shape. In fact, the car may not be ready
this season, Mike Helton of Nascar said. That would give Ford the
upper hand again in the manufacturers' championship.  &QL; 
Another Petty Revs It Up
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-year-old Adam Petty will become the first
fourth-generation Nascar driver on Saturday when he starts the
Busch Napa 300. He is the great-grandson of the Nascar pioneer Lee
Petty, the grandson of the seven-time Winston Cup champion Richard
Petty and the son of the current Winston Cup driver Kyle Petty. ...
Cody Michelle Unser, the 12-year-old daughter of race car driver Al
Unser Jr., was hospitalized Thursday in Albuquerque, N.M., with a
rare condition called transverse myelitis, which causes swelling of
the spinal cord. The condition has left her paralyzed from the
waist down.  &QL;

QUEST FOR A KING: ASU TEAM SEEKS ROYAL TOMB IN MEXICAN PYRAMID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS KAHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico _ A trinket salesman drops his
bundle on the brick steps of the Pyramid of the Moon. Waiting for
tourists, he pulls out a ceramic pipe and fills the ancient plaza
with a haunting trill _ unaware of the digging beneath his feet.
</P>
<P>
   For months, an international team of archaeologists has been
deep inside the pyramid, carving a tunnel toward its center,
searching for answers to Teotihuacan's biggest mysteries. And in
October, they found something incredible.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Arizona State University archaeologist Saburo
Sugiyama, found a skeleton of a man who died about 1,800 years ago.
He was buried among rich offerings of greenstone figurines,
obsidian knives, eagles and jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   According to Aztec legend, the leaders of Teotihuacan were
buried underneath the pyramids. And since his burial was the
richest ever discovered in Teotihuacan, experts were betting that
he was indeed a ruler _ the first ever found.
</P>
<P>
   But was he? The man beneath the pyramid is proving to be as
elusive as the city itself, defying labels the public is so eager
to give him and leaving scientists like Sugiyama with more
questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama pulled a greenstone figurine from the earthy grave and
held it in his arms like a newborn. Although it had been buried for
1,800 years, its little teeth still glimmered. Its chalky eyes
still stared out from a protective scowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see stuff like this all the time,'' he said
with a weary smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama's team had been tunneling since June in a joint project
between ASU and Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e
Hisotia (INAH). But they had been going slower than expected and
were working 12- to 16-hour days for months to reach the center
before their funding ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, maybe I'll retire after this,'' he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama, 46, first came to Mexico from Japan in 1979. He was
fascinated with the region and wanted to learn firsthand about its
history and culture _ especially the ancient civilization of
Teotihuacan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still so many questions about this place that
haven't been answered, so many things we don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For 2,000 years, the massive stepped pyramids have towered above
the treetops as ancient mysteries from Mexico's pre-Columbian past.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs, inheritors of the pyramids, called the place
Teotihuacan (pronounced tay-oh-TEE-wa-con), or ``The City of the
Gods.'' They wrapped their mythology around the monuments and gave
them cryptic names like ``Pyramid of the Moon'' and ``Street of the
Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actual identity of the people who built the pyramids has
puzzled scientists for years. Unlike the Aztecs and Mayans, the
people from Teotihuacan had no written language. They left no
descriptions of who their rulers were or why they made such
magnificent structures.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists do know that the ancient city grew into a
metropolis during the first century A.D. At its peak in the sixth
century, the city was larger than Imperial Rome, covering eight
square miles. And its population had expanded to 150,000 people,
more populous than President Lincoln's Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In its day, Teotihuacan was a superpower. Its dominance over the
region was so complete that its cultural influence is found in
prehistoric sites as far as Guatemala, 1,100 miles south.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the action was. Crowded markets were scattered
across the city where people would haggle over squash and rabbit
meat, ceramic pots and knives made from chipped obsidian.
Teotihuacano artists combined images of humans, animals and
architecture in complex red, blue and green murals. Architects
created one of the first city plans, aligning the gridlike streets
just east of true north.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of it all, the Street of the Dead cut through
the city, forming its major artery. This was no ordinary boulevard:
at about 160 feet wide and more than 2{ miles long, it probably was
used for public gatherings, or ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 groups of dwellings were clustered in the center
of town. There were homes for the elite, which were lined with
paintings of gods and separated from each other by lavish
courtyards. In other parts of the city, slums were scattered about
with small, thin-walled rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For about 700 years, the city thrived. But in its last 100
years, things began to change. Scientists aren't exactly sure, but
the government could have become more repressive. The people could
have gotten tired of living in such a rigid society.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever tensions existed, they reached a breaking point in the
eighth century. In an explosion of activity, people attacked
government buildings. They burned the palaces and slaughtered the
people inside. This was no ordinary war. The attackers moved across
the Street of the Dead, dismantling and burning monument after
monument. The fury of the destruction culminated in a holocaust so
fierce, it melted stone.
</P>
<P>
   Why Teotihuacan tumbled may never be known. No records exist
except for the black chunks of charcoal left from the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although the culture of Teotihuacan was one of the most
dominant in the Western Hemisphere, little has been found to
document the feats of its military or the courage of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There has been so little evidence of a king or a queen that some
believe Teotihuacan never had an individual ruler, but instead was
one of the world's first republics.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, in the summer of 1988, Sugiyama came to
Teotihuacan with ASU archaeology Professor George Cowgill and
INAH's Ruben Cabrera, hoping the question of who ruled the city
could be answered within the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent, a
smaller structure two kilometers south of the Pyramid of the Moon
in a town square called the Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the downtown, high-rent part of the city,'' Cowgill
said. As many as 100,000 people could fit within its walls, and
archaeologists believe that this was Teotihuacan's cultural and
political center.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the rulers of Teotihuacan were, they were most likely
buried here. Inside, they found the sacrificed remains of an
estimated 200 people. Most were buried with their hands behind
their backs, as if bound. They could have been killed with poison
or by having their hearts torn out. They could have been buried
alive.
</P>
<P>
   But it was while tunneling toward the center that they came
across the biggest surprise of all: People, possibly the
Teotihuacanos themselves, had cut their own tunnel through the
pyramid in search of valuables buried with the dead.
</P>
<P>
   To their disappointment, the looters' tunnel crossed close to
the center, where three large pits were almost completely dug out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of like, where's the body?'' Cowgill said. ``There
might have been one or two tombs of rulers, but now we don't know.
I can suspect that that's what it was, but we don't have the hard
evidence.'' &QL; 
Looking for a ruler &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Sugiyama once again is looking for a ruler of
Teotihuacan.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete archway 2 feet thick supports the entrance to the
tunnel Sugiyama's research team has cut inside the Pyramid of the
Moon.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most logical place for Sugiyama to continue the
search. Unlike the pyramids of the Sun and Feathered Serpent, the
Pyramid of the Moon had never been formally excavated. The loose
interior soil has kept other researchers away, fearing cave-ins.
</P>
<P>
   And Sugiyama hoped it kept grave robbers away as well.
</P>
<P>
   Loose dirt crumbles off the walls a few inches from the elbows
of a Mexican worker as he pushes a wheelbarrow through the
corridor, dimly lit by bulbs cupped in aluminum foil. At the end of
the tunnel, a few men crowd behind another, who pounds a
6-foot-long metal rod into the wall, loosening chunks of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the outside is faced with coarse, volcanic stones, the
inside is filled with a mixture of boulders, rocks and soil. Some
days they dig through large sections of packed soil and are able to
push forward a yard or so. But other times they encounter walls of
basketball-size boulders and have to move slowly, prying them out
one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama's team started the tunnel in June. Within just a few
meters, they uncovered what appears to be a wall that formed the
outer portion of an earlier pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Like an onion, the Pyramid of the Moon is layered with previous
structures that at one time formed the outer face of the pyramid.
Each of these layers could have been built as a monument to a
different ruler, Cowgill said. As each ruler tried to top his
predecessor, the pyramids were rebuilt over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   In August, they came across the corner of a substructure, which
could date to before the first century A.D. _ making it the oldest
structure in Teotihuacan.
</P>
<P>
   By October, the team had burrowed 27 meters inside the pyramid
and reached the central axis where they turned north. They didn't
get far before they came across what appeared to be an animal
skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   Denise To, an ASU graduate student specializing in the study of
bones, was called in to identify the remains. Brushing around the
skeleton, she uncovered the pointed orange beak of a large bird,
possibly an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Birds don't get buried naturally underneath pyramids _ people
put them there, and this meant the team had gotten close to
something important. They stopped digging with large tools.
</P>
<P>
   Workers now huddled together, squinting in the dim light as they
poked around with dental picks. They pulled out jewelry made from
shells, ceramic potsherds, obsidian figurines and more bird
skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, To entered the tunnel at sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Told by the night crew that a bright patch of white could be
seen through the soil, she dug deeper and uncovered bones, the
bones of a man. She dug further, around the patch to the tunnel
floor, and found his lower legs. The rest of his body was crouched
in a seated position inside the tunnel wall, his head between his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   In front of him they discovered 15 knives made from flaked
obsidian.
</P>
<P>
   They were placed in two starlike shapes, each with three knives
pointing north, three to the south and three east-to-west. One of
the knives was elongated, carved into the form of a feathered
serpent. &QL; 
Caged jaguars &QL; 
In the corner of the tunnel was a wooden cage containing the
skeletons of two jaguars. They left droppings in the cage, so they
were probably buried alive.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, INAH called a press conference to announce the
discovery. Sugiyama's team escorted more than 100 politicians,
scientists and press in groups of four through the tunnel to see
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the find spread quickly in newspapers and broadcasts
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to know if this person was once a ruler. It
might be, Sugiyama thought, daring to consider the search might be
over but knowing he did not yet have proof.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he could only see part of the body _ most of it was
still entombed in the tunnel wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama's caution proved prophetic when the team removed the
rest of the skeleton in November. His hands were found behind his
back as if they had been tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now think that the burial was not a ruler but a sacrificed
person,'' Sugiyama said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why this person was sacrificed. Was it a
dedication to the pyramid? To one of Teotihuacan's earliest kings?
Or was he a captured enemy?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it doesn't matter whether they find a ruler,''
Cowgill said. ``We're really just looking for answers to questions,
and this burial could provide those answers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sugiyama hasn't given up yet.
</P>
<P>
   His team is still about 60 meters from the center.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along their path in the next few months, maybe,
they'll find another person buried underneath the moon.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps this one will be a king. &QL;

RELEASING MOON SETS TONE FOR HOLMGREN'S SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ When he announced Warren Moon's release from
the Seahawks on Thursday, Mike Holmgren did us a favor. He revealed
as much about the new Holmgren Era as he did about the status of
the 42-year-old quarterback whose pastures may or may not be
greener elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the best time to do this,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a teacher. I think I'm a good teacher. And if we
can get good young people, I can teach them to play their
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, with a twinkle in his eye, said he wanted to use his
old team as an example of the upside potential of moving on,
swiftly, decisively.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, we had Brett Favre in his second year, which was our
first year in Green Bay,'' Holmgren said. ``Our three quarterbacks
were Favre, Ty Detmer, who was a rookie, and Mark Brunell, who was
a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Three quarterbacks. Two years of playing experience. All on a
Packers team that very quickly went to two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that gets a little scary (going with three young
quarterbacks) but if you get the right guys and they're good young
players that just need some experience, you just make it work
somehow,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play good defense. You don't throw them into the frying
pan. You kick the ball well. You cover kicks well. You play smart.
You run the ball well and you give them a chance to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   The man has been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   When you carry the title, as Holmgren does, of executive vice
president of football operations/general manager and head coach,
you don't have to couch anything you say. You don't have to mince
words. You just lay down the law, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every position on this football team will have to be won on
the football field, in front of me,'' Holmgren said, making you
realize why so many Seahawk veterans have made a point to meet with
Holmgren, to meet with the new strength coaches and trainers, just
to get a head start on The Holmgren Era.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a state of high anxiety at the Seahawks' training
facility, but it is a new and improved state of high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In his month on the job as Savior No. 2 of the Seahawks _ the
first being owner Paul Allen, who rescued the Hawks from Ken
Behring and the wild ride to Los Angeles _ Holmgren has brought in
a bevy of assistant coaches, keeping only one holdover from the
Dennis Erickson regime.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren also has been busy hiring a player personnel guy and a
salary cap-ologist. This week, Holmgren released quarterback John
Friesz, running back Steve Broussard and lineman Dan Saleamua, one
day before the announcement about Moon.
</P>
<P>
   While Moon will call this a money move, and while Holmgren will
vouch for Moon's ability to still be effective, the reason Moon is
not a Seahawk is because his ego would not allow it. Holmgren
understood that, which is why he said he wasn't sure Moon could
accept anything less than starter money.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Moon refused to accept a one-year deal when he held
out of training camp. Moon demanded a multi-year deal _ one that
looked good on paper _ which everyone, including Moon, knew would
probably get him cut. That is the beauty of non-guaranteed
contracts _ something baseball and the NBA might want to try.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, maybe the reason Moon was as bold as he was during
his holdout was because he knew Erickson had leaned on him.
Erickson, needing to win, desperate to win, gave Moon carte blanche
and room to operate _ a move that led to Moon setting all kinds of
Seahawk passing records during the 1997 season. Moon made the Hawks
the NFL's best passing offense and the third-rated offense overall.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson had always danced around the quarterback situation
anyway. Jon Kitna was the young up-and-comer. Friesz was the
starter, despite a tendency for broken bones and incomplete
seasons. Moon was the backup, until he became the starter, even
though Moon was better during training camp in the summer of '97.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly why Holmgren decided to assert control over the
quarterback situation. He vowed there would be no quarterback
controversies here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you hold out, it's going to hurt you,'' Holmgren
said. ``And Warren wound up getting injured last year. He is older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to create a situation _ particularly when
I'm starting out new here _ that would be the least bit awkward or
not real positive. ... I think this is the cleanest way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren has more than enough confidence that he does not need
Moon as an insurance policy. The new guy has the clear authority
and vision to do exactly what he wants.

SALARY CAP, AGE FORCE SEAHAWKS TO RELEASE MOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Warren Moon was heading out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Not as a hero who had finally led the Seahawks to the playoffs.
But as an over-aged, over-priced former player who had failed just
as so many before him had.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't how I wanted it to end. This isn't how I expected
it to end,'' Moon said Thursday on his car phone as he was driving
to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to catch a flight to his
offseason home in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's two-year stay with the Seahawks officially ended later in
the day when he was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make a change at some point and now is the time
to make it,'' general manager and coach Mike Holmgren said. ``My
decision was made a little bit easier because of the financial set
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was expecting to make the announcement after a
scheduled meeting with Moon Thursday morning. But an impromptu
meeting actually took place Wednesday afternoon when Holmgren ran
into Moon in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren asked me if there was any chance I'd change my mind,''
Holmgren said. ``I told him, `No.' I'd given it a lot of thought.
That was one of my primary focuses since I've been here was to look
hard at the quarterback position.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren still thinks Moon can play and if this was a one-year
deal, Moon probably would his choice to be the guy. But Holmgren is
looking at the long run. Moon will be 43 in November and would have
to learn a new offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go younger at the position had to be made sooner
or later, and Moon's contract situation forced it to be sooner.
Moon would have counted almost $5 million against the salary cap if
not released.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Seahawks fail to land a backup, Holmgren told Moon he
would remain an option. Moon said he plans to talk with the
Seahawks' new coach each week during the free agency period that
began at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the door open a crack,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   It seems more likely that Holmgren will sign a young veteran in
free agency to compete with Jon Kitna for the starting job or be
the backup; select a No. 3 quarterback in April's NFL draft; and
add a No. 4 after the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Pederson would be a good fit in free agency. He is 31,
spent the past 3{ seasons in Holmgren's system in Green Bay and is
from Ferndale. Pederson has thrown only 32 passes in six NFL
seasons, but he could help Kitna learn the offense and step in if
Kitna was injured or ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   To say Moon has a few options is like saying Bill Gates has a
little money.
</P>
<P>
   Moon said he already had been contacted by 10 teams and that he
expected the number to grow once word of his release became
official. There were the obvious teams _ the San Diego Chargers,
who are looking for someone to mentor and motivate Ryan Leaf; and
Pittsburgh Steelers, who would like Moon to help mold Kordell
Stewart. There also were a few surprising teams _ the Detroit
Lions, New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be wanted,'' Moon said. ``I have to see how they
want me and how I'll be involved. Is is as a mentor? Or is it a
starter?''
</P>
<P>
   If this is to be the end of Moon's professional football career
that started in 1978 in the Canadian Football League, he said he
could become a broadcaster and even get involved in an ownership
group for the next NFL expansion franchise in either Los Angeles or
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing's out there that I really like, I'm just going to
retire,'' Moon said. ``I'm not going to take a long time waiting.
Either something is really going to happen, boom, or I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moon wants to play, and he would like it to be with the
Seahawks. He needs only 903 yards to join Dan Marino and John Elway
as the only players in NFL history to pass for 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, more to what motivates Moon than compiling
more numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's winning,'' he said. ``I want to be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his teammates anticipated the move, but it is still
surprising when a player with Moon's reputation and resume is
released. He was voted the offensive captain this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I can say about Warren, and what's real, is at
least I got a chance to play with him,'' said running back Ricky
Watters, who admits Moon's presence was a big reason he signed with
the Seahawks in free agency last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaves a legacy even being here for such a short time,''
Watters said. ``I think everybody's going to be down there (in the
locker room) trying to get No. 1 jerseys and grab up whatever is
left of his because he's a great, great player and a great
person.''

CAN'T BUY A BASKET  
 MALONE, JAZZ ICE COLD SUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We waited three months for this?
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' 82-74 loss Thursday night to the Utah Jazz was ugly
enough to prompt a heckler behind the Suns bench to yell, ``Welcome
to the CBA'' during one stretch of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrible thing to say about the Continental Basketball
Association, where the Phoenix-Utah final is more typical of a
halftime score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we play Utah it's that way,'' Suns Coach Danny
Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   And the outcome is usually similar as well. The Jazz won for the
11th time in their last 14 meetings with the Suns, including four
of the past five at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the Suns improved their defense, which was abysmal
in a home loss to Sacramento. That was the good news. That bad news
was that their offense went into the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it?
</P>
<P>
   The 74 points tied for the fourth lowest output in franchise
history, and was just six points off the team's worst offensive
performance, a 68-point output against Kansas City in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Suns made just three of 19 shots _
15.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, they shot 36.6 percent overall and 9-percent from
three-point range.
</P>
<P>
   And the Phoenix starting backcourt of Rex Chapman and Jason Kidd
was a combined 7 of 25 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at the positive,'' said Kidd, who struggled
through a tough night with only five assists against six turnovers,
no steals and 11 points. ``We played good enough defense to win the
ballgame, but our shots just didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, who continues to try and find his offensive rhythm
after missing training camp and both preseason games with a
hamstring strain, missed all four of his three-point attempts and
shot 3 of 11 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' he said. ``I'm really having my
training camp right now. I don't have a lot of practice time, and
I've just got to go through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I let the team down not being able to do the
things I know I'm capable of doing. Our effort was great. Guys were
trying to do the right things. When we made mistakes, guys were
trying to do 100-percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rough edges, the Suns made it interesting against
the unbeaten Jazz, who are off to a 4-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   But after overcoming a 13-point first quarter deficit to pull
within one with 6:53 to play in the third quarter, the Suns went
through a 3{-minute stretch in which Luc Longley missed a
point-blank layup, Kidd missed on a pair of drives and Tom
Gugliotta was stripped on another drive to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz took advantage, reeling off a 10-2 spurt to push their
lead to 59-50. The Suns got to within four points using a big
lineup that included Gugliotta, Clifford Robinson and Danny Manning
on the front line with 6-foot-9 Chris Morris in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Suns were trying to get back into it, Utah's two
key components, Karl Malone and John Stockton, were resting.
</P>
<P>
   They returned for the stretch run, and the Jazz dissected the
Suns in the fourth quarter. Malone's 22 points and nine rebounds
led the Jazz, and Stockton finished with six points and seven
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played terrible, probably the worst game of the season,''
said Malone. ``But it's good to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta led the Suns with 18 points and 12 rebounds, and
former Jazz forward Morris gave them a lift off the bench against
his old teammates, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We competed on defense,'' Ainge said. ``I thought defensively
we played a good game. Our perimeter shooting and free throws hurt
us. Offensively, we're still a little out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want anyone to think for one second that we're
satisfied in any way, shape or form with any kind of loss to anyone
in this league. But it's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were trouble early when Kidd picked up two fouls in the
opening minutes, forcing him to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   With rookie Gerald Brown running the offense, the Suns were
understandably shaky. The Jazz pushed a two-point lead to 13 with a
nine-point spurt capped by Jeff Horancek's three-point shot with
2:22 to go in the first quarter and the Suns were in a hole they
never escaped.

NAVY DEMOLITION TEAM SETS FIRE TO LEAKING SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   COOS BAY, Ore. _ Powerful steel-piercing charges backed with
napalm unleashed a fireball that lit up the twilight sky Thursday
night in an effort to stave off a massive oil spill from the
freighter New Carissa.
</P>
<P>
   The inner carcass of the beleaguered ship belched orange flames
that boiled skyward for nearly 10 seconds as hundreds of residents
cheered from a steep hillside overlooking Coos Bay.
</P>
<P>
   As the fire gained in intensity, it erupted in a series of
thunderous explosions and the steel hull glowed bright red. A plume
of acrid black smoke poured from open cargo holds and drifted
lazily up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall grinned broadly,
brandished an orange life ring from the freighter and declared the
operation a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are that the fire has been successful,''
agreed Bill Milwee, representative of the freighter's owners and
insurers. ``I'm looking at a real big fire out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With an approaching storm threatening to tear the ship apart,
federal and state authorities decided to burn the vessel and its
fuel _ something never before attempted in the Lower 48 states _
rather than risk trying to tug the New Carissa out to sea, intact.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected Thursday's denotation to burn all of the oil
aboard _ more like 50 percent was a realistic assessment, said
Langdon Marsh, director of Oregon's Department of Environmental
Quality. All of which means that the probability of a serious spill
still lingers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Locals watched last night's explosion from nearby Radar Hill,
which offered a bird's-eye view of the extraordinary spectacle.
Flames fueled by nearly 400 pounds of explosive _ enough to flatten
four houses _ danced from the ship hundreds of feet into the night
sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's got the marshmallows?'' a spectator cried out as the
explosives inside the cargo holds of the vanquished New Carissa
detonated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, look at that,'' others muttered in amazement as an
enormous black plume rose from the beached freighter and slowly
veered northward.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how much of the 400,000 gallons of molasses-like
bunker fuel oil and diesel fuel will be consumed in the fire. The
first attempt to set the fuel ablaze Wednesday fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   The 639-foot New Carissa, a Japanese-owned freighter, ran
aground Feb. 4 about 150 yards offshore and began leaking early
Monday as the pounding waves widened the cracks in its hull.
</P>
<P>
   At a command post , the explosion was greeted with ``oohs'' and
``aahs'' and broad grins. As flames and smoke continued to pour
from the freighter, one spokesman for the group said the blast
appeared a likely success.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard infrared cameras were due to shoot pictures of the
ship over night in an attempt to monitor the fire. Predictions were
that it would burn for days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were anxious to set off the fire soon because of
rising fears that the ship's deteriorating hull might soon
accelerate its leakage.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce Pacific Ocean storm was already 24-hours overdue last
night. Officials feared the wreck would break open if hit by a new
round of heavy seas. Rain and winds up to 45 mph were forecast with
20-foot swells that would batter the freighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, the ship will fall apart. No one expects it
to survive that,'' Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came after a tense day in which explosives experts
from the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station ferried ordnance to the
stricken freighter and laid the charges in place. Helicopters
worked through the day, ferrying in barrels of explosives and
lowering them into the ship's cavernous, waterlogged holds.
</P>
<P>
   The explosives team placed conical shaped charges on the decks
of two of the cargo holds near the bow. Their purpose was to pierce
the floors of the holds as well as the skin of fuel tanks beneath.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition team then placed in the holds C-4 plastic
explosives with barrels of gelled gasoline, also known as napalm,
and Bangalore torpedoes, another high-temperature explosive. They
were supposed to ignite after a delay, once oil from the fractured
tanks had flooded the cargo holds.
</P>
<P>
   But as twilight fell, demolition experts decided to set it all
off in one blast, and apparently, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   The weather cooperated, too The expected storm delayed offshore,
giving officials a full day to set up and try the second ignition.
And as darkness fell over the smoking freighter, winds from the
south were carrying the oil northward to dissipate off the Oregon
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke was considered a potential irritant to residents of
Coos Bay and nearby areas. Doctors warned those with respiratory
problems living near the fire to stay indoors should winds shift
the smoke inland. The plume was being blown ``northerly but
offshore,'' said Ted Buehner, warning coordination meteorologist
with the National Weather Service in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Air quality monitors tested the air in several places near Coos
Bay, while a mobile unit was poised to take samples up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration experts have
said an oil spill could, in a worst-case scenario, coat 50 to 100
miles of the coast.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA scientist Sharon Kristopherson said an environmental
disaster could be minimized if oil spills on a sandy beach, which
is the easiest to clean.
</P>
<P>
   Winter winds usually blow to the north, which would push the oil
in the direction of a 70-mile stretch of unbroken beach, the
longest in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 workers have been mobilized to scrape up the oil and
watch for fouled wildlife. Five dead birds have been found, three
soiled birds were captured, and some threatened Western snowy
plovers were seen with spots of oil. Clam and mussel harvesting has
been banned.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, a festive atmosphere prevailed on Radar
Hill, the best spot to view the ship. Families arrived hours early,
many with picnic baskets, binoculars and video cameras. T-shirt
vendors hawked shirts depicting a ship on fire.
</P>
<P>
   They read: ``I Got Burned in Coos Bay.''

CARDINALS `FRANCHISE' MOORE  
 MILLER IS UNRESTRICTED, CAN TEST OPEN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once the Cardinals were unable to sign wide receiver Rob Moore
on Thursday, they were left with a decision they didn't want to
make.
</P>
<P>
   They had to choose between placing the franchise tag on Moore or
outside linebacker Jamir Miller, protecting their rights to the
player.
</P>
<P>
   They picked Moore, much to his agent's dismay, and let Miller,
who was ecstatic, become an unrestricted free agent when the NFL
free-agency period begins today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what we were going to do until (Wednesday)
morning,'' said Bob Ferguson, the Cardinals vice president for
player personnel. ``I don't like losing players. This whole thing
(ticks) me off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials wouldn't say why they decided to keep the
30-year-old Moore over the 25-year-old Miller, other than that they
thought Miller's contract demands were excessive.
</P>
<P>
   What demands? The Cardinals and Miller's agent, Steve Baker,
never exchanged offers. But Miller had said he thought he should
make at least as much as the $6.5 million a year that the Baltimore
Ravens paid middle linebacker Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where Jamir wanted to go (financially). . . . We don't
believe we can fit that type of money under our (salary) cap
defensively without sacrificing others,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cards' off-season has had a strange and ominous
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   They could lose one of the best young linebackers in the league,
yet might keep him because they didn't restrict his movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamir is very happy he will be able to explore the free-agent
market,'' said Baker, the agent. ``He'll be much more interested in
re-signing with the Cardinals given that he's free rather than
franchised. No way does he see it as a slap in the face. He sees it
as respect. He sincerely wants to come back to the Cardinals. In
fact, he feels a sense of loyalty to them for letting him test the
open market. In fact, he has been looking at houses in Phoenix this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller will begin testing the market immediately. Expect
Carolina, Indianapolis and Minnesota to make big pushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to have Jamir done within a week,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will keep Moore unless a team is willing to give
up two first-round draft picks to sign him to an offer sheet the
Cardinals can match.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. Players who are franchised rarely get offers.
</P>
<P>
   The team that has targeted Moore from the beginning, the Miami
Dolphins, said they won't go after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not giving up draft picks,'' Dolphins Coach Jimmy
Johnson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's agent, Gary Wichard, had heard rumors that the Dolphins
were willing to give Moore a five-year deal at $6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   He won't get anything close to that from the Cardinals, who
reportedly offered him a three-year contract worth $5 million a
year. Sources close to Moore say the offer was worth $4.5 million a
year and included a $2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Moore reportedly wanted a four-year deal worth an average of
$5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a franchise player, Moore is guaranteed to earn at least
$3.531 million a year, the average of the top five players at his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is disappointed and upset a contract did not get done,''
Wichard said. ``He's disappointed the way everything was handled.
We certainly believe (the Cardinals) could have gotten Rob done and
then moved on to Jamir.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who are about $15.8 million under the 1999 salary
cap of $57.288 million, hoped to sign Moore and then place the
franchise tag on Miller, allowing them to keep both players.
</P>
<P>
   Wichard said Moore still wants to play for the Cardinals but
won't accept just any offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is going to play when he has a deal he's happy with and
one that fits with his standing in the league,'' Wichard said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said he is confident the team can reach a long-term
agreement with Moore, a Pro Bowl receiver in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He also isn't giving up hope that the team can re-sign Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd still love to have Jamir and feel he wants to be here,''
Ferguson said. ``I think he and Rob both want to be here and are
sincere in their desire to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle every team has had is the cap didn't go up as
much as agents predicted. . . . We have cap problems we have to
address. We feel we have a fine young football team, but we have
some tough decisions to make. Unfortunately, some players we want
to be here won't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are continuing to negotiate with two of their
other top unrestricted free agents, offensive tackle Lomas Brown
and free safety Kwamie Lassiter, but don't expect wide
receiver/return specialist Eric Metcalf to be back.
</P>
<P>
   The team made qualifying offers to seven of their eight
restricted free agents. They didn't make an offer to injured kicker
Joe Nedney (knee) because they are uncertain when he will return. &QL;

KNICKS SURVIVE LETDOWN, SLIDE PAST BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The New York Knicks wandered through the haunted
hallways of the United Center Thursday night like graduates at the
wrong class reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Where were the peers they had always measured themselves
against? Somehow the Knicks had to work up an appetite for the
saccharin equivalent of a Chicago Bulls' team that had been dragged
through a chop shop and stripped to its rims upon the retirement of
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill was gone, and so was the Knicks' motivation, as well
as their legs and lung capacity in the first time they've played on
successive nights this season.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Knick, young Marcus Camby, had enough spring to help
separate the Knicks from the Bulls in a tight fourth quarter. With
two of his eight blocks, a critical rebound in the last minute and
an emphatic dunk, Camby helped the Knicks beat the Bulls, 73-68.
</P>
<P>
   Poor shooting and turnovers pock-marked the game. Until Allan
Houston, who scored nine of his 15 points in the fourth quarter,
willed his rubbery legs to a jumper with 10 minutes to play, the
Knicks had trailed for much of this calamity.
</P>
<P>
   With Camby making momentum-stopping plays, the Knicks weathered
the Bulls' effort. They were missing shots, but the Bulls were
scrambling for rebounds and diving for loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were dying. They were outrebounded 49-42, and shot
just 35 percent. Houston (7 of 18, 15 points), Larry Johnson (0 for
3) and an exasperated Patrick Ewing (6 of 14, 18 points) _ who
picked up a technical foul for swinging his elbow at Bill
Wennington with just over 2 minutes left _ had little left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were fresher, but not as talented. Although the Bulls'
still had a Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper, the Knicks were facing
players like Brent Barry and Mark Bryant, both of whom still need
crib sheets to run the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had a 58-55 lead entering the fourth quarter, and were
giving the Knicks much more than expected. Other than Camby, who
had four first-half blocks on Kukoc, the Knicks appeared to have
lost the energy that propelled them by the Washington Wizards a
night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls went on a 13-0 run in the second quarter by chasing
down loose balls and running down rebounds, and a crowd conditioned
to applaud Jordan showed its gratitude as the Bulls took a 45-40
lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had trouble unearthing the right emotion for this
game without their usual foils. Jordan was last seen soaking up
Chicago suburbia on a car-pool route. Scottie Pippen has become the
straight man for Charles Barkley in Houston. Dennis Rodman is ...
somewhere. All that is left of the Bulls are the championship
trophies and banners from a dynasty that seems long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart is not pounding out of your chest knowing that No.
23 could get 50 on you,'' Chris Childs said before the game.
``You'd see Michael Jordan get introduced and doing his thing. The
whole scene. It was a part of basketball etched in history. But you
have to get beyond that mentally and not fall into the trap. It's
easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy when the feel to this rivalry has dropped off the
hype meter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it's not different, it is,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
``There was always that heightened anticipation and awareness for
the last decade. They always had the same basic core with Jordan
and Pippen.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo devastated the Knicks, particularly Ewing. There was a
reminder before the game when a montage flashed across the big
screen, and an image of Pippen dunking over Ewing lighted the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Knicks' chase of the Bulls was as futile as
trying to catch up with the horizon. The Bulls' presence fueled the
Knicks' roster moves and free-agent signings. And the Bulls also
brought out the Knicks' best, right down to the coaches. Through
seasons and playoff series, Van Gundy and Phil Jackson went back
and forth, stooping to name calling at times. There is probably a
part of Van Gundy that misses the gamesmanship that came with the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil was good for the coaching fraternity because he's very
good at what he does,'' Van Gundy said before the game. ``He kept
that group together, which is hard to do in a winning situation.
It's never good to see a great coach out. But I don't think he'll
be out very long. I think Tim Floyd is going to do a great job here
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at their starting five. Brent Barry has a lot to
prove. Ron Harper is playing like he used to. Toni Kukoc is proving
himself. Mark Bryant has always given us trouble. We'd better not
have a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a letdown. But without Jordan &AMP; Company to cope with,
they survived.

LABONTE CAPTURES DAYTONA QUALIFIER  
 EARNHARDT BEATS STEWART IN 2ND RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Make room for a new king of the road. For
now.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte passed the seemingly unpassable Jeff Gordon with
11 laps remaining in the first of two Twin 125 qualifying races
Thursday at Daytona International Speedway, winning an opportunity
to start on the inside of the second row in Sunday's $8 million
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte will start alongside Dale Earnhardt, perhaps the true
monarch sitting on the Daytona throne.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt pestered rookie pole sitter Tony Stewart for seven
laps, then whizzed by on Lap 8 and proceeded to capture a 10th
consecutive Twin 125 qualifying race.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt now has won a 50-lap qualifying race every year since
1990. Toss in last season's Daytona 500 victory, and no wonder
Earnhardt was wearing the grin of a Cheshire cat in victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brand-new race car,'' said Earnhardt, who won by
0.251 second over runner-up Jeremy Mayfield. ``I could go anywhere
I wanted to go. No push, no loose (condition). I'm ready to go 500
miles.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Labonte. Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Gibbs Racing gave me a great power plant,'' said Labonte,
who with teammate Stewart gives Pontiac Grand Prix two of the top
four starting positions. ``(But) our car was a little tight in
spots, a little loose in spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can find (what's wrong) or not. I don't
know if we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite leading the first 38 laps and a runner-up finish by a
narrow 0.163-second margin, Gordon also wasn't entirely pleased.
Although happy with the car's handling, he lacked one or two
horsepower in his Hendrick Motorsports Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with restrictor-plate racing, the most powerful
machine on pit road doesn't mean squat without the aid of drafting
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Get out of the draft, and a driver might as well wave bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   It happened early, often and late during both races.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Gordon on Lap 39 after he led the first 38 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like a lame duck when (Labonte) went by,'' said
Gordon, who initially dropped two positions. ``Your RPMs drop, and
it seems like everyone is going 30 miles per hour faster than you,
but in reality, they're only going a couple (mph).
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in with a good-handling race car to see what kind of
speed we had. I think we need a little bit more speed on the front
straightaway. Hopefully, we'll be able to marriage those two
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The same happened to Stewart on Lap 8 in the second race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gordon and Stewart can't be entirely displeased. Although
they lost, they also won.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won because he still will start on the pole, thanks to a
monster 195.067 mph qualifying run last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart (194.599 mph), who finished sixth behind Earnhardt,
Jeremy Mayfield, Dale Jarrett, Rusty Wallace and Mike Skinner, will
start next to Gordon because he was faster than anyone else during
last week's qualifying runs.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's victory was precipitated by a nine-car crash on the
opening lap. Except for some bruised egos and some nasty commentary
directed at Wally Dallenbach, who apparently instigated the
accident by trying to find a lane in no man's land, the flat part
of the track in Turn 2, no one was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 25 (Dallenbach), I think he thought he was gonna win on
the first lap,'' said Jeff Green, who limped to pit lane in a
heavily damaged Bud Moore Ford Taurus and was unable to return to
the racing surface. ``When an experienced guy like (Dallenbach)
pulls a move like that, that's pretty upsetting. He ought to have
his head screwed on a little bit harder than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the restart, it was all Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Then Labonte, with plenty of drafting help and with the aid of
lapped traffic, made like an old-fashioned Daytona slingshot and
drove by a startled Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``With five laps to go, I'm not usually in that position (the
lead),'' Labonte said. ``Gordon usually is. I don't know if there's
a correct way to hold them off. But I did.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   But no one made a charge until the final lap, and by then, it
was too little and way too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale has a strong car,'' said Jarrett, a two-time Daytona 500
champion. ``And he knows how to use the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt also still knows how to deliver a one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Ask to comment on Stewart, Earnhardt delivered this body blow:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a mirror-driving son of a gun,'' Earnhardt said. ``He's
learning. If it had been the last lap of the (Daytona) 500, he
would have probably been spinning around in circles on the
backstretch. But it was the seventh lap of the qualifying race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good little racer. He's got a good race car. He'll
learn.'' &QL;

SOMETIMES IT'S NOT BAD TO NOT WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have been good enough, post-Barkley, to win a lot of games.
And not good enough to win anything significant.
</P>
<P>
   They had a five-year plan aimed at an NBA championship, a noble
quest killed by the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the terrible conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's OK for the Suns to lose. Maybe it's the best thing
possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a surprise spanking from the Sacramento Kings
came a slow tease. The Utah Jazz, a team that now dresses in
gangster black and hails from the home of Olympic scandal, bolted
to a huge lead before boredom set in. The Suns made a game of an
ugly night that reflected the new NBA and resembled the old ABA.
But the ending was just what you expected, even if the two-game
losing streak at America West Arena is a little tough on the
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Four games in is no time for assumptions, but it's clear the
Suns are a long way from the brass ring. Scrappy, but not overly
athletic. Courageous, but short on elite talent. A long way from
peaking, but a long way from proficient on the defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA Finals are ever to come into the cross-hairs again,
they'll need an infusion somewhere in the near future. And the
options are grim.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA salary cap increases to $34 million next season and the
Suns are already guaranteed to be over the limit. No money for
premium free agents. Only four windows to make some kind of splash:
</P>
<P>
   Two draft picks, the $2 million exception and the $1 million
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have a pick in the top 10 and a pick from 15-25,''
Suns' General Manager Bryan Colangelo said. ``We could package
those two for a higher pick, or we could move into position to make
a trade with those two picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the draft picks are the key to any hope of instant
renewal. And as much as it sounds like sacrilege to the athletic
ego of Jerry Colangelo and the hyper-competitive nature of Danny
Ainge, maybe it's OK to lose. For one season, a shortened schedule
bound for asterisks and injuries. A season that will be an
aberration under the microscope of history.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Suns are the benefactors of much local empathy, the
team that suffered most from David Stern's crusade. Might as well
use it to their benefit.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a trade for Steve Nash, one that is looking better
all the time, the Suns own the Mavericks' first-round pick. Dallas
is 1-3 and going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns owe the Bulls a first-round pick in the deal for Luc
Longley. Either this year's or next year's, and the Suns have the
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of those draft picks create a lot of
opportunities,'' the younger Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   And they could hold the key to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's unfair to draw any conclusions about the destiny of
this year's team. Rex Chapman is coming off an injury, Danny
Manning miraculously recovering from another knee surgery. The
rookies have had precious little time to experience NBA. Luc
Longley is still looking to set picks for Michael Jordan, still
hearing Phil Jackson screaming in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns fought hard against the Jazz, and no one doubts the
brilliance of Jason Kidd, the heart of Chapman, the intensity of
Cliff Robinson. And in the second half, Longley showed signs of
making an impact.
</P>
<P>
   But they have lost ground in the supremely competent Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   To anybody wishing for a quick fix in Dennis Rodman: Forget it.
If he's not on a championship contender, if there aren't at least
two veteran superstars in the locker room, he'll burn down the
house. He has a $3 million deal with Converse that only goes into
effect if he plays in a major market. And he'll never play in a
city where the bars close at 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the best route might be the path rarely traveled in
these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Grin and bear it. In the long run, losing might be the best
thing possible. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
 FIGURE SKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In a year to rebuild, a year to look more to
the future than the present, all hopes for US figure skating rest
on the shoulders of Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss. They are the
stars, they are expected to win, and they have little competition.
</P>
<P>
   The two came through Thursday night in the US Figure Skating
Championships at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, the defending US champion and Olympic silver medalist,
skated a virtually flawless short program in the ladies
competition. Weiss skated nearly as well on the men's side, and
both he and Kwan are in commanding position for gold medals heading
into Saturday's long programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kwan and Weiss were unanimously acclaimed by the judges,
picking up first-place votes from all nine.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, displaying a new pixie hairdo and renewed athleticism,
landed a triple lutz-double toe combination jump at the start of
her program and followed with a crisp double axel. One judge
awarded her a perfect 6.0 score, and the other eight gave out 5.9s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really solid,'' said Kwan. ``I went into the short
program very strong and I felt ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So relaxed was she, Kwan went on, ``that it felt just like a
normal practice to me. I'm very satisfied, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Carroll, Kwan's coach, also was pleased. ``I would call it
a good, consistent performance,'' he said. ``You have to remember
that we are our own worst critics, so I'd say it wasn't the
greatest performance of her life, but it was solid.''
</P>
<P>
   In second was a budding US star, 13-year-old Sarah Hughes of
Great Neck, N.Y., while 20-year-old Amber Corwin of Hermosa Beach,
Calif., finished third despite a superlative performance. Corwin
was the only female skater to attempt and land a triple-triple
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, despite her youth, is eligible for seniors competition
at the world championships in Helsinki next month because she
placed second in the world juniors last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Weiss has been an afterthought to Todd
Eldredge, watching and waiting, waiting and watching for his chance
to become America's top male skater. Twice at the nationals,
Eldredge won and Weiss finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different role for me,'' said the 22-year-old from
Fairfax, Va. ``But it's comfortable. I've been sitting behind Todd
for the last couple of years, kind of watching and learning.
Hopefully, I'm ready to step in and fill his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, skating to a medley of Van Halen hits, Weiss
responded to the heavy _ and new for him _ pressure of being the
favorite here. Eldredge is not competing this time, and the title
is Weiss's to win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different kind of pressure,'' said Weiss. ``I'm used to
being the underdog, but I went out (Thursday night) and skated the
way I wanted to be skating.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Goebel, an 18-year-old up-and-comer who is the first
American to land a quadruple jump in competition, was second.
Goebel, who earned six second-place marks, said, ``I plan to land a
quadrpule-double combination (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   In third place was veteran second-flighter Trifun Zivanov, 23,
of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss is an anomaly in men's figure skating because he is
married _ to his choreographer, Lisa _ and has an infant daughter.
It was his wife who suggested the medley, even though few, if any,
of the middle-aged judges might have any Van Halen CDs in their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll get some now,'' said Weiss. ``But I like to do
different things. I've gone from Beethoven to Van Halen to Santana.
I like to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   After opening his program with a spin, Weiss went into a triple
axel jump, followed by a triple flip-triple toe combination, an
arduous start ``that went well,'' he said. ``I had to fight a
couple of landings, but it went well.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss's long program Saturday will be from the soundtrack of the
film ``Mulan,'' and ``that's a fun program as well,'' he said. ``I
like to skate to a different kind of music in my short and my long
programs. I like to do things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   With Eldredge gone, this competition is truly different. ``This
type of pressure isn't thrown at you all at once,'' Weiss said of
his top dog role. ``Sitting at No. 2 kind of prepares you for this.
Hopefully, watching and seeing how things are done better prepares
me to take over the position and live up to those expectations.''

EDWARDS LIKELY TO MISS '99 SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Robert Edwards probably will be back in a
Patriots uniform _ but not this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie running back, who suffered a severe knee injury
during a touch football game on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii last
Friday, was released from Honolulu's Straub Hospital and Clinic
Thursday and headed immediately for Boston, where he will undergo a
battery of tests Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Patriots source, the prognosis for Edwards is
more encouraging than when he was initially injured and underwent
emergency surgery to repair an artery in his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   The team no longer thinks Edwards's career is in jeopardy, but
according to the source, ``he will definitely miss the '99
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards apparently suffered major damage to the ligaments in his
knee, which will likely require reconstructive surgery and extended
rehabilitation. That was the opinion expressed to the Patriots'
medical staff by the doctors who performed the surgery on Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the Rookie Beach Bowl, Edwards, who gained 1,115
yards in 1998, apparently blew out his knee when he crashed to the
sand after going up with AFC teammate Charles Woodson to defend a
pass intended for the NFC's R.W. McQuarters.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the injury will be assessed during weekend testing
at Massachusetts General Hospital, where Edwards will be examined
by team physician Bert Zarins.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is definitely more severe than his agents have
indicated. Agent Alan Wade had said that based on what Honolulu
doctors told Edwards, he would be on the road to recovery after two
months of rehabilitation. But Wade also cautioned, ``We'll know the
full extent after he's examined in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be more severe than the knee injury suffered by running
back Terry Allen, who returned from reconstructive surgery to have
an All-Pro season for the Redskins three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would need to have a hell of a rehab to make it back, but
it's possible,'' said the source.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have already begun making plans for life after
Edwards. They pulled running back Sedrick Shaw off the expansion
list after guard Scott Rehberg was taken by the Cleveland Browns
Tuesday. Shaw appears to be insurance. Look for the team to give
second-year man Harold Shaw a chance to show what he can do while
also pursuing a running back either in the draft or through free
agency.

TIRED LAKERS FALL TO TIMBERWOLVES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ And on the seventh day, the Los Angeles Lakers
rested. A day and a game too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As much as they wanted not to say it, not to pull out the
closest available excuse, there it was: We've played four games in
five nights, and darn it, we're tired.
</P>
<P>
   So Thursday night, fatigued and down one genie, the Lakers
wandered aimlessly around the Target Center, and while the
Minnesota Timberwolves played basketball, the visitors stumbled
around looking for a hammock to swing on.
</P>
<P>
   Final score: Wolves 86, Tired Guys From L.A. 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to make excuses,'' coach Del Harris said, ``but you have
to give the players some slack, in that I think we're probably the
only team called upon to open the season with five games in the
first seven nights. And we've had four guys out of the lineup some
of those games. So our rhythm wasn't what it could. Our guys showed
fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   And much of what they showed isn't worth detailing. But here are
the lowlights: fewest points in a game since Dec. 17, 1997; one
point shy of the lowest point total in franchise history; and a
field-goal percentage (33.3) that was the worst since that same
Dec. 17, 1997 game, and at least then they could blame the
opponent, the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they could only lament the absence of Shaquille
O'Neal _ out with another strained abdominal muscle _ and try to
keep some semblance of dignity while Sam Mitchell dropped 20 points
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper, the Lakers' designated voice of experience,
admitted fatigue but almost angrily dismissed it as a valid reason
for the horrid outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always holler that you're tired,'' he said. ``I'm sure
people are tired after five games in seven nights. But I just think
that a team that has their eye on the prize will gut out a win
under the circumstances. You have to find a way not to give in to
the fatigue story. ... I hate to use that as an excuse,
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   As a stand-by, the Lakers could always use O'Neal's absence as
the reason instead, but typically they've thrived even without him.
The Lakers were 33-20 (.622) in games O'Neal had missed since
joining the team in 1996-97, including a victory here last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Elden Campbell, O'Neal's usually reliable stand-in,
struggled to play the role of Kazaam this time, hitting just 2 of
10 shots. Even Kobe Bryant's fifth consecutive double-double, 24
points and 10 rebounds, couldn't save the Lakers from losing to the
Wolves for the first time since Dec. 21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Minus Bryant's 8-for-21, the Lakers made 17 field goals as a
team _ six from the other four starters. And they were victimized
repeatedly by the Wolves' forwards, Kevin Garnett scoring 21 points
and Joe Smith adding 17.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers ended their first road trip with two wins and a
loss and a 3-2 overall record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' O'Neal said. ``My guys have to step up.
There was only two or three guys that looked like they played
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Without naming names, O'Neal indicted the Lakers' shooters for
poor shot selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about being a shooter, but I know that when
I'm going to my fadeaway and my fadeaway ain't going, then just mix
it up,'' he said. ``We continue to shoot jumpers, and our best
shooter got a standing ovation when he came into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be rookie Sam Jacobson, a local hero here, and the
only Laker who provided the 19,000 in attendance (Gov. Jesse
Ventura included) with much of a thrill. The ``We want Sam'' chants
began late in the fourth quarter, and Harris obliged with 2:49
left, evoking the loudest roar of the night, and yes, a standing
``O.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the standing around was done by the Lakers,
displaying poor ball movement and little body movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're gonna have no movement on the court, we're not gonna
win a lot of games,'' Eddie Jones said. ``We were standing around
so long, we could have seen a whole episode of Tele-Tubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Just be thankful Tinky-Winky didn't go for 20 on them.

PATRIOTS MAY LOSE WOHLABAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots, strapped by salary cap
restrictions, felt they had no choice but to risk the potentially
costly loss of center Dave Wohlabaugh by allowing him to become an
unrestricted free agent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to reduce payroll to the $57.2888 million NFL salary cap
for 1999 while also reaching long-term agreements with All-Pro
defensive backs Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy, the Patriots took a step
toward freeing up some money by terminating the contract of veteran
defensive end Ferric Collons Thursday, the eve of the free agency
period.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater concern is Wohlabaugh, who is seeking a more
lucrative deal than the one signed by the Jets' Kevin Mawae _ five
years, $16.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh's agent, Alan Herman, said, ``Dave's a free agent and
is very excited by that. It was Dave's decision not to negotiate
with the Patriots. He'd rather see what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said that Wohlabuagh was contacted by Patriots owner Bob
Kraft, vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier, and coach
Pete Carroll, who asked him to wait until the team can clear some
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``David likes it in New England,'' said Herman. ``He has his
home there and he's certainly not ruling out returning. But it will
be interesting to see the attention he gets when he hits the open
market,'' the first day free agents can negotiate with any team.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did not use the ``franchise'' label on Wohlabaugh
because at present, they can't afford to pay him the average of the
top five centers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centers are classified as offensive linemen, and offensive
linemen are very expensive,'' said vice president of business
operations Andy Wasynczuk.
</P>
<P>
   Collons was scheduled to earn a raise from $535,000 to $2.1
million in 1999. But his agent, Angelo Wright, plans to file an
injury grievance against the team, claiming Patriot doctors
recently diagnosed a shoulder injury as well as an existing finger
injury. Wright contends that is in violation of the collective
bargaining agreement because a player cannot be cut until he is
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Collons was due a $725,000 lump sum payment March 1, and Wright
will argue that he will not be healed by that date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ferric is extremely disappointed,'' said Wright. ``He really
enjoyed playing in New England for the Patriots. I don't think this
is over, however.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wasynczuk was reconfiguring deals for both defensive
end Willie McGinest and wide receiver Vincent Brisby and expected
them to be done by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, who signed a five-year, $25 million deal with an $8
million signing bonus last February, agreed to have money shifted
to make his contract more cap-friendly for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby, scheduled to earn $1.8 million this season, was in the
process of having his contract renegotiated. His salary will be
reduced, but a year will be added to his contract, which will make
him a Patriot through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots elected to hold off on renegotiating Drew Bledsoe's
pact, feeling that if they need to free up extra money down the
road, the quarterback and his agent, Leigh Steinberg, will be
willing to talk. Bledsoe's cap number for 1999 is $7.28 million,
down a few hundred thousand from last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also want to retain defensive tackle Henry Thomas,
linebacker Todd Collins, punter Tom Tupa, and strong safety Larry
Whigham. Tupa is likely earmarked for Cleveland, his hometown,
while the Cincinnati Bengals have expressed great interest in
Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   The team decided to tender offers to five restricted free agents
_ kicker Adam Vinatieri, linebacker Tedy Bruschi, tight end Lovett
Purnell, defensive end Chris Sullivan, and guard Heath Irwin. The
only restricted free agent not tendered was defensive tackle Devin
Wyman.

STANFORD BEATS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ It had a completely different feel than UCLA's two
previous visits to Maples Pavilion because the Bruins actually had
a chance to win. But in the end it was the same frustrating result
for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford solved its free-throw problems, solved UCLA's pressure
defense and effectively ended the Bruins' Pacific-10 title hopes
with a 77-73 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA trailed 71-66 with 14 seconds left when Baron Davis hit a
3-pointer from the right wing. UCLA called timeout, then fouled
Stanford guard Kris Weems, who made both free throws to preserve
the win.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after it made 12 of 24 free throws in a loss to
Connecticut, the Cardinal hit 12 of 12 in the final 90 seconds to
repel the Bruins, who trail Stanford by three games in the loss
column with three weeks remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA used its 16th starting lineup of the season, with freshmen
Ray Young and Matt Barnes starting at forward for Rush and Jerome
Moiso, who has developed tendinitis in his right foot and is not
the same player he was three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rush responded with his best game of the season and scored a
career-high 20 points, including a 3-pointer with 3:45 left that
trimmed Stanford's lead to 61-59.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's archrival, Arizona, provided the tactical model for
containing the Cardinal. Using a combination of quickness,
structure and discipline that disrupts Stanford's precision, the
Wildcats have beaten Stanford three times in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to make it difficult for them to run a
half-court offense, and that's a result of our quickness,''
Wildcats coach Lute Olson said. ``If you get into a half-court
game, you've got your hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins had plenty to worry about, from the health of
Moiso and center Dan Gadzuric (knees) to Rush's psyche to myriad
on-court deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-game stretch in which they made significant
progress (Stanford, USC, Louisville), the Bruins seemingly had
regressed in recent weeks. Perhaps it's mental fatigue, perhaps
physical exhaustion, or perhaps teams have adjusted to UCLA's
approach. Whatever the cause, the effect was three consecutive
opponents shooting at least 50 percent from the field against the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more deficiencies than I can count,'' coach Steve
Lavin said. ``We're tough and unselfish, but we've got to continue
to get smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play (like that) against a team like Stanford, they'll
blow all our deficiencies wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. The usual Cardinal confidence was absent when
the game began. Tentative and out of sync, Stanford missed 12 of
its first 14 shots _ some open jumpers, some layups _ and the
Bruins ground to a 14-4 lead. It was the sixth consecutive game
Stanford has trailed by at least nine points in the first half. If
not for several ill-advised shots by Moiso, the Bruins' lead would
have been 15.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve forward David Moseley gave Stanford a spark with eight
quick points, and it appeared UCLA had missed its opportunity.
Moseley's 3-pointer from the right wing with seven minutes left in
the half narrowed the Bruins' lead to 17-16, and it was taut for
the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery spent much of the game working the referees and
begging for fouls. His point: UCLA reaches and grabs on every
possession, so call it. For the most part, they did, whistling the
Bruins for 15 fouls in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Bruins' lead was 35-30 early in the second half
when Stanford found its rhythm. The Cardinal scored seven straight
points, taking a two-point lead with 15 minutes left. Young gave
UCLA a brief respite with a 22-footer from the left wing _ a poor
shot, actually, that happened to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford did not flinch. Pete Sauer ran off a baseline screen
and buried a jumper from the left corner _ a play Stanford has run
successfully for years against the Bruins. Cardinal center Tim
Young hit a short jumper, then drew the fourth foul on his
counterpart, Gadzuric, with 13 minutes left. Moiso, hobbling and
hesitant, replaced Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   Weems hit a 3-pointer from the right corner, and Jarron Collins
scored from the low post for a 46-41 Stanford lead.
</P>
<P>
   With 9:45 remaining, Lavin inserted Gadzuric. Thirty-seven
seconds later, Gadzuric lunged for a long rebound and committed his
fifth, leaving the Bruins with one big man, Moiso, and a half-speed
one at that.

PHOENIX-AREA FIRMS FLOCK TO WILD, WILD WEB IN E-GOLD RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phil Broadbent quit his partnership in a Phoenix law
firm to start a company that helps businesses make sales over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough decision. It was early 1994 and e-commerce was
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But Broadbent started Evergreen Internet Inc. in Chandler,
believing the World Wide Web would change business in a way ``only
to be rivaled by the Industrial Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Phoenix area, ambitious entrepreneurs like Broadbent
are creating e-commerce companies, hoping to stake their claim on
what's being called the last of the Wild West days of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the gold rush of the early 2000s,'' said Ed
Dennison, director of Arizona Software Association. ``There's this
pot of gold out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when online bookseller Amazon.com of Seattle can pull
in millions with its initial public offering, it's little surprise
to see Arizonans making their own grab.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be an absolute explosion of e-commerce companies
here in 1999,'' predicted Bill Swartz, president of Swartz and
Associates Inc., a Scottsdale recruitment firm that specializes in
software and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what will drive this growth, Swartz says, is that the
Phoenix area seems to naturally attract entrepreneurs across a
broad spectrum of industries.
</P>
<P>
   The Web offers an opportunity to start a tech business even if
the entrepreneur's knowledge lies in another area. And it can be
done without paying for bricks and mortar.
</P>
<P>
   While companies like Yahoo! established themselves as the mighty
oaks in the Internet forest years ago, experts say there's still
plenty of room for emerging companies to put down roots.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is spawning a cottage industry of businesses like
Evergreen, which help companies make sales online. Of the 12
businesses looking for cash at the Arizona Software Association's
venture capital conference this spring, half involve e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that will join Evergreen in presenting at the
conference include Mygeek.com of Phoenix, an online comparison
shopping service, and Essential Wisdom Inc. of Scottsdale, which
makes Internet design software for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 years of auctioning property during marathon sales in
hotel rooms, the Latham Group of Phoenix created Homebid.com to
hawk deals over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold 137 properties during its first three-day
auction last month, pulling in about $7.5 million. Homebid.com had
146 properties up for grabs, mostly HUD homes in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were more than just a little excited because these
statistics line up almost identically with our live-call
auctions,'' said Abbott Ezrilov, chief of property acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects all of its auctions will be held online by
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based Edible Eats Inc. was formed after a colleague of
the company's president, Ron Friedman, savored a bite of New York
cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than competing in the crowded retail market, it made
sense to create the company online, where it could reach a
worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells cheesecake and other items through its site at
www.giftpak.com. In April, the company will launch www.dollar &QL; 
days.com, a sort of online discount department store.
</P>
<P>
   Companies head to the Internet with hopes of reaching millions
without paying for real estate. Yet the challenge remains to draw
in customers, something that keeps many e-commerce companies
operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses rely on costly advertising, word of mouth, contests
and other gimmicks to attract potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based Sandbox Entertainment Inc. is taking another
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the company began offering fantasy sports games and
stock market simulations on the Internet. Now, it has expanded to
offer online shopping geared toward the 1 million people who have
played its games.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company may send an e-mail advertising an
autographed baseball to people who like to play fantasy baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide them merchandise that's relative to them,''
said Jim Layne, Sandbox vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   While it might seem any company can make more money by becoming
www.anycompany.com, it's not certain they all will hit pay dirt.
Only a handful are likely to go public. And many of the big
e-commerce companies have yet to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But many will be very viable targets for acquisition as we
start to see consolidations in e-commerce,'' said Steve Todd, who
heads Silicon Valley Bank's southwest region. &QL;

CAL DEFEATS USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Down by three points, 30 seconds to go. Sounds like a
perfect opportunity for USC to turn to 3-point specialist Adam
Spanich.
</P>
<P>
   That was the situation against California on Thursday night.
Only one problem. Spanich was in Los Angeles, suspended by USC
coach Henry Bibby for an unspecified team rules violation.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, guard Elias Ayuso took a trio of 3-point shots in
the final seconds and missed all three, as the Trojans fell to the
Golden Bears 58-55 before 9,983 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we missed him a lot,'' USC center Brian Scalabrine
said. ``I really think (Ayuso) missed him because we would have had
two shooters instead of one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayuso tried to put his best face on the predicament and
hesitated to admit that Spanich's absence hurt the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed him, but we have to move on as a team,'' Ayuso said.
``That's his business. That's his problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanich was left home in Los Angeles because of the violation,
which is not believed to be academic-related. Spanich is expected
to fly up to San Francisco this morning and play in Saturday's game
at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He violated the team policy. Minor or major, it wasn't allowed
in my framework of thinking,'' Bibby said. ``The whole thing is to
do what's best for the team and the student athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanich's absence marred an otherwise inspired effort by the
Trojans (11-10, 3-9). They held a 52-50 lead with 5:26 left but
scored just one more field goal the rest of the game. Jeff
Trepagnier's driving layup cut Cal's lead to 56-55 with 1:06
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Cal's Carl Boyd made two free throws with 29.4 seconds
left, the Trojans had three different possessions to tie the game.
Ayuso was long on a 3-pointer with 13 seconds left. Scalabrine
intercepted a pass, however, and Ayuso lobbed another errant three
with six seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went off a Cal player, and the Trojans had one final
attempt with 4.1 seconds. Ayuso took the inbounds pass but was
double-teamed and missed an off-balance shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good looks, we just didn't make it,'' Bibby said.
``We have to find a way to win some games, that's something we
haven't done. It was a game we had a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby felt the game's turning point occurred earlier. With USC
ahead 49-47, Bears point guard Raymond King launched a 3-pointer
from the top of the key. It banked off the backboard and went into
the basket, giving Cal (13-8, 4-7) the lead with 6:03 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the play,'' Bibby said. ``It's a big play for them
and that gets the morale of our team down a little.''
</P>
<P>
   USC shot just 34 percent from the field and 28 percent in the
second half. Only Trepagnier (14 points) was able to reach double
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have lost eight of their past nine games and remain
in the cellar of the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this is new to us, losing a close game, but
getting over the hump is tough for us,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Former USC forward Jaha Wilson, who is from nearby Daly
City, attended the game. ``I wish you could suit up tonight,''
Bibby told him before tipoff.... Even with USC shorthanded, junior
forward Jarvis Turner did not play.... Quincy Wilder had five
points and seven rebounds, his best game since he scored a a
career-high 18 against Cal on Jan. 16.

   SCI-TURTLES (Undated) _ Nothing seems quite so grandfatherly as
the turtle. So it was fitting that biologists long ago accepted the

appearing in the journal Science suggests a radical rewriting of
evolutionary history. The new molecular research declares turtles
to be the unexpectedly close relatives of crocodiles. But most

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the five-week-long impeachment trial drew to its
close, the Senate on Thursday debated President Clinton's fate
behind closed doors, certain to acquit him but passionate in
condemning the behavior that one Democrat said had led to a
``sordid saga''
</P>
<P>
   With the final verdict set for Friday and senators sure that
they would not muster the 67 votes that would be required to
convict Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice,
the only question remaining is whether even one of the two articles
of impeachment _ obstruction of justice _ would draw a simple
majority.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the perjury charge against Clinton appeared
virtually guaranteed to draw less than a majority and it was
possible that the obstruction article, too, could receive fewer
than 51 votes. ``My guess is that it will be at least 50-50,'' said
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. He added that at least five Republicans
would vote to acquit the president of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, of Maine, on Thursday became the fourth
Republican moderate to announce that she would vote to acquit
Clinton on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it, I find the president's behavior
deplorable and indefensible,'' Snowe said in a statement. But, she
said, ``I determined that the only way I could approach this case
was to ask myself `if I were the deciding vote could I remove this
president under these circumstances?' The answer, I conclude, is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several senators said that Sen. Susan Collins,
R-Maine, also indicated in the Senate chamber that she would vote
to acquit the president on both counts. And Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., told colleagues he would vote against the perjury count. If
none of these Republicans waver before the final votes, at least
eight Republicans would vote against the perjury charge and five
against obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who number 45 to the Republicans' 55 senators,
held their ranks in support of the president on Thursday. Only the
judgment of Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., remained unknown. He plans
to speak in the closed deliberations on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be outraged that William Jefferson Clinton's
personal failings debased himself and his office,'' said Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., whose final position had been considered uncertain.
``But they did not cause permanent injury to the proper functioning
of our government,'' he said, coming out for acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   With senators determined to explain their thinking on a vote
many considered one of the most significant of their careers, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said he expected
the final roll call on guilty or not-guilty to come at noon or
earlier on Friday. Only a handful of speakers were left for final
debate, including Lott and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our duty,'' Lott said during an afternoon break.
``We've done it the constitutionally required way.'' Once the
Senate ends the trial, a certified record of its final judgment is
to be submitted to the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, as
required under the Senate's impeachment rules.
</P>
<P>
   With a move to censure the president now appearing all but dead,
its proponents were working toward a test vote Friday that would at
least demonstrate some bipartisan support for such a rebuke. A
two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, would be required to change
Senate rules and bring the censure motion to the floor. Opponents,
mostly Republicans, said the votes were not there. ``Censure's
dead,'' declared Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the
Senate to convict a president, Clinton will be acquitted Friday
whether or not a mere majority votes against him on either article.
But the numbers are politically significant for how the impeachment
effort is likely to be ultimately judged. Opponents of conviction
from both parties said that if House prosecutors failed to win 51
votes on either charge against Clinton, it would signal that they
had been too zealous in pursuing a case that had not won bipartisan
backing or public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sends a very loud message to the House of
Representatives,'' said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. ``Don't ever, ever
send to the Senate again articles of impeachment that are this weak
and partisan.'' Jeffords said he wished the House had recognized
that a proposal floated by former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy
 &UR;  &LR; Carter to censure Clinton had been ``a pretty good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., however, scoffed at the vote
counting. ``If Republicans think they can celebrate because it's 50
and Democrats can celebrate at 49, then I've missed something,'' he
said. ``This does not have great value.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Senate chamber, the day's solemn mood was somewhat
tarnished by reports that Clinton planned an all out drive to help
Democrats win back the House in 2000, and topple the Republicans
who had impeached him in December largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of
this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge,'' Lott
said in a statement. But the political wrangling did not appear to
be affecting the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate deliberated on its verdict for a third day,
senators circumvented the secrecy rules by sending out a flood of
printed statements or by holding news conferences. They divided
largely along party lines on Clinton's guilt or innocence, but all
condemned Clinton in stinging language.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., had said he was
leaning toward voting for acquittal on perjury. But on Thursday, he
said he would vote to convict Clinton on both articles. ``I refuse
to say that high political polls and soaring Wall Street indexes
give license to those in high places who act in low and illegal
ways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he had initially leaned toward
acquitting Clinton of perjury but voting to convict him for
obstuction of justice. But he decided to vote to convict Clinton on
both counts because a president with ``a capacity to lie about
anything'' threatens the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the trial proceeded, however, something was gnawing at
me,'' he said in a statement. ``The perjury charge kept creeping
back into my mind. That something, as I confronted it, was my
experience with the Clinton apparatus and its modus operandi. At
the heart of everything that apparatus and its operatives do,
whatever the situation, is the process of lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they said they would vote to acquit Clinton, Democrats
were no less harsh. ``The president acted immorally,'' Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement. ``He acted recklessly. He
acted disgracefully. He willfully misled the American people, the
members of his Cabinet, his staff and his judicial system. In doing
so, he brought shame and dishonor upon the office of the president
and especially upon himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein, one of the main proponents of censure, said that
she did not believe the House prosecutors charges were ``proven
beyond a reasonable doubt or by clear and convincing evidence or by
a preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., also called for censure. ``No
matter how deeply disappointed I am that our president, who has
worked so successfully to lift up the lives of so many people, so
lowered himself and his office, I conclude that his wrongdoing in
this sordid saga does not justify making him the first president to
be ousted from office in our history.''

MURRAY MAY RETURN MONDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With good news at a premium for the Los
Angeles Kings, they may be about to get just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said Thursday morning that right wing Glen
Murray, sidelined since Jan. 2 with a torn medial collateral
ligament in his right knee, may return to the lineup as soon as
Monday, when the Kings play host to the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who began skating Monday, was more cautious in his
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally my decision, how my leg feels and if I feel good
enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said a return Monday against the Ducks hardly is carved
in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (returning) next week, I've kind of carved in stone,''
said Murray, who plays on the power play, kills penalties and is
second in scoring on the Kings with 28 points despite missing the
last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor denies deal: Robinson scratched defenseman Garry Galley
and played Philippe Boucher, prompting speculation that the Kings
might be showcasing the seldom-used Boucher, who played for just
the second time in the last 22 games and has expressed a desire to
be traded. Robinson also scratched center Yanic Perreault, who has
scored just six goals in his last 45 games.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Dave Taylor denied any deals were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a coach's decision, who was in and who was out,''
Taylor said. ``We're trying to find a way to win a hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings need more from Blake: It's not that Rob Blake is playing
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Robinson feels the Kings' best player and the
NHL's best defenseman last season could be playing better, and
Blake doesn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played to my potential,'' Blake said. ``It's not
that I'm doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to press too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``I spoke to him a week ago and I told him how
much this team needs him. Maybe something is bothering him or he's
tired. We need him at the top of his game. We need everyone at the
top of their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to specify the areas he'd like to see Blake improve in,
Robinson said, ``His game is moving the puck and his shot and
playing physically. He is playing physically and he's doing a
pretty good job defensively. ...But I think he's capable of making
much better plays (on the power play). He's definitely not playing
the way he's capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday night's game at the Forum against
Philadelphia, Blake had 18 points on four goals and 14 assists. He
has missed 18 games this season due to a broken foot and a
suspension. Last season, Blake led NHL defensemen with 23 goals. In
the 13 games before Thursday, Blake had just one goal and three
points.
</P>
<P>
   But then, few of the Kings are playing as well as they must if
the team is to make a late-season run for a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Craig Johnson) has got to get going, Yanic (Perreault) has
got to get going, Donald (Audette) has got to get going,'' Robinson
said. ``We've got to start getting goals from other people (besides
Luc Robitaille). We've got to get goals from our defense. Blakey's
got to score and (Steve) Duchesne has got to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall's reward: Last week, after appearing in his 1,000th
NHL game, Galley's wife decorated their house with 1,000 roses.
Winger Russ Courtnall's wife, Paris, had one of her husband's
sticks bronzed to commemorate his 1,000th game, Wednesday night in
Phoenix.

NORTHRIDGE FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From an upset to being upset _ within the span of
five days.
</P>
<P>
   In the topsy-turvy world of Cal State Northridge men's
basketball, this pattern seems too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors' 74-68 loss to Montana on Thursday night at home
was the antithesis of a victory over Big Sky Conference leader
Northern Arizona last Saturday: CSUN didn't shoot well, lacked
intensity for too many long stretches and didn't make the right
decisions down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Montana) just simply beat us,'' said junior guard Greg Minor,
who scored a team-high 17 points off the bench. ``I don't think
(our intensity) was there the whole game. It was there in spurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The spurts weren't enough for CSUN, which had a five-game
winning streak snapped and dropped to 6-5 in the Big Sky, 14-10
overall. The Matadors didn't attack the Grizzlies' zone defense
like they had in a 92-88 win in January.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN did a lot of standing around on offense and when the
Matadors did shoot they shot poorly: 33 percent (21 of 63) for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we're a finesse team and sometimes we're a power
team,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said. ``When we're a finesse
team, we're not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors tried fancy passes and didn't go strong to the
basket. They missed many shots from inside 12 feet, including a few
airballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a lot of shots that hurt us,'' Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Braswell's frustration was the news that Northern
Arizona was itself upset by Montana State on Thursday. With a win,
CSUN could have pulled within one game of the Lumberjacks in the
loss column.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come with it tonight,'' Braswell said. ``We came in
here tonight and felt a little too much of ourselves, like we did
early in the conference (schedule).''
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 66 with 1 minute, 52 seconds left. Montana
(11-12, 4-8) took the lead for good with 1:11 left on Mike
Warhank's two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   With 48 seconds left, 6-foot-9 center Brian Heinle missed a
3-point attempt that could have given CSUN a lead. Thirty seconds
later, Jeff Parris missed another 3-point shot with the Matadors
trailing 70-66.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Parris' 12th attempt from beyond the arc this
season. Parris scored nine of his 11 points in the first half, then
sat out most of the second half with four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we were high after that (Northern Arizona) win and we
could just sit back and let the game come to us,'' Parris said.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said: ``(The Grizzles) out-physicaled us, outmuscled us
and outworked us.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN lost its bid for a 15th victory that would have given the
Matadors their most wins in a season in Division I. They also were
trying for their longest winning streak since the 1982-83 season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, CSUN finishes its home schedule against Montana State on
Saturday looking to stay with the conference leaders, especially
with a four-game road swing to end the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to win these home games,'' Minor said.

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ There were just over three minutes left in the fourth
quarter, and the Rockets were clinging to a five-point lead when
the defense rotated down to double-team Charles Barkley and he
kicked the pass back outside to Michael Dickerson, who was open.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fact, the only way Dickerson could have been more alone at
the 3-point line was if the bomb squad had come into Reunion Arena
and cleared the building.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rookie did what rookies will often do. He looked, he
hesitated, and he passed up the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Which was time enough for the Dallas defense to recover and for
several of Dickerson's co-workers to experience near-meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of reaction you would expect if Tinky Winky of
the Teletubbies strolled through Jerry Falwell's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich exploded. Scottie Pippen barked, then
threw up his hands in disgust. And Barkley, of course, had his
words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Michael Dickerson I would choke his scrawny neck if he
ever passed up a shot like that again,'' he said. ``I said, `I'll
kill you right here in front of all these people if you don't have
the (guts) to take that shot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to play that kind of a role on this team with these
young guys. I have to be a mentor, an instructor. You know, I have
to help them grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's right, a teacher. For the three rookies on the
Rockets' roster _ Dickerson, Cuttino Mobley and Bryce Drew _ it has
been an education. The kind you would expect if you walked into the
classroom and discovered that the professor was a cross between
Capt. Bligh and the Tasmanian Devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely an experience,'' Dickerson said. ``Charles
gets on all of us. But we know that what he's saying is usually the
right thing. And we know enough to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson demonstrated that barely a minute later when Barkley
set up shop in the low post again, drew the defense again and found
Dickerson spotting up beyond the top of the key again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the rookie caught the pass and let it fly, and his
3-pointer all but put the lock on the Rockets' 105-95 win over the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   As we are quickly finding out in the season-on-the-run, the
successful teams will be the ones that find more flavors of
victories than Ben &AMP; Jerry have ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, Rudy T tries a little of this and a little of that
and hopes to settle on a combination that gets the job done. On
Thursday night, Barkley (16 points, 15 rebounds) and Pippen (16
points, nine rebounds) eventually wound up with their usual kinds
of numbers. Stanley Roberts made his debut with a solid 11 minutes.
But it was the contributions from Dickerson and Mobley that put
them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, who had struggled to shoot just 29 percent in the
Rockets' first four games, went 8-for-13 from the field for 21
points, and Mobley added eight points and what is rapidly becoming
his customary second-half defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids were big for us tonight,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Michael is a real good shooter who is going to make a lot of big
shots for us down the line, and Mobley, well, he's just a gutsy
young guy.''
</P>
<P>
   By many, it might be considered a risky proposition for a
contending team to rely so heavily on a trio of rookies. But the
Rockets don't have much choice.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson came out with his guns blazing in the first quarter,
going 5-for-7 from the field and getting the Rockets into the
rhythm of an up-tempo game.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley came off the bench and kicked in seven of his eight
points in the second quarter, including a
two-steps-beyond-half-court shot that swished through the net as
the intermission buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant) coach Jim Boylen and I have been working on a lot
of those shots at practice lately,'' Mobley said. ``I didn't know
for sure, but I thought it had a pretty good chance to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley is loud, and he's cocky, constantly yapping like a
Chihuahua and then backing it up like a big dog. In attitude, he
reminds you of Sam Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them are like kids turned loose in a toy store on
the same team with Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon. They are
not just rookies trying to find their place in the league. They are
being escorted _ even if a little gruffly at times _ by Hall of
Famers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the Dream Team, but we're the ones getting to live
out all of our fantasies,'' Dickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   If they had gone to other NBA teams, they might be getting the
playing time but not the wisdom. Or the flak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take all the abuse Charles wants to give me,'' Mobley
said. ``I was taught to respect my elders.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson learned his lesson as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot the ball,'' said the student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or I'll kill you,'' said the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Class dismissed.

have hit on a formula Thursday night that could serve them well.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the night, they let their bench carry the load, got
Michael Dickerson's best shooting game and rested the Dream Team
portion of the roster as much as possible. Down the stretch, they
let Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon take over,
driving the Rockets to a 105-95 win over the Dallas Mavericks at
Reunion Arena that ended with Pippen swishing a half-court,
what-the-heck hook shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt real good (down the stretch),'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``Anything can happen, but I felt we were in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   As game as the Mavs might have been for 40 minutes, the
combination of the Rockets' veteran front line and a strong
defensive performance was something Dallas' assorted Robert Pack,
Cedric Ceballos and Michael Finley scorers could not match. Down by
one, the legends forced a 14-4 run to push the Rockets' winning
streak to four games. In the last nine minutes, after the Mavericks
had held their last lead, Dallas made just five of 18 shots with
three turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had half his 16 points and seven of his 15 rebounds in
the late push. Pippen, who finished with 16 points and nine
rebounds, ran the offense for the second consecutive night when the
Rockets pulled away. And despite the back-to-back, the Rockets'
defense got stronger as the night went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get overboard,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We have a
lot of work to do. But the foundation of a winning team is defense,
and I can't tell you how good I feel about us. Sometimes you're
struggling and you miss a shot and it looks like two points (for
the opposition), and we've got guys busting their butts going back.
Those are plays the scorekeepers are getting ready to write down,
and we get a guy making a great play to break it up. That gives me
goose bumps. I love that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the veterans might not have found that extra gear, and the
defense might not have stepped up, if Dickerson and the bench had
not carried the load much of the night. Dickerson had a career-high
21 points, making eight of 13 field-goal tries, including four of
five 3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles, Hakeem and Scottie have been doing a good job scoring
and rebounding,'' Dickerson said. ``But they're old. They get
tired. We needed for some of us to come in and step up. That's what
a shooting guard is supposed to do, to step up when he's open and
put up some numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Roberts, in his first action as a Rocket, had 10 points
in 11 minutes. And Othella Harrington made six of seven shots for
13 points in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pack had 31 points off the bench, but in 37 minutes running the
offense he had just three assists.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Mavs finally had regained a lead for the first time
since early in the second quarter with a 7-2 start to the fourth
period, the Rockets seemed the more rested and poised team. The
Mavericks, playing after a night off at home, panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in off a back-to-back, and they seemed like they had
more energy at the end than we did,'' Finley said. ``They took
advantage of every mistake we made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs led 84-83 with 9:08 left, but that seemed no more than
a cue for the Dream Teamers to take over. Barkley scored the
Rockets' next six points and controlled the boards. Pippen scored
on a driving jumper, came up with a pair of steals and ran the
offense. And Olajuwon hit a jumper in the lane and blocked a shot.
</P>
<P>
   And when Dickerson passed up a 3 with three minutes left, he got
all the legend coaching he could ever ask for, with Barkley in his
face with all of his style, and Pippen adding his critique in his
been-there, done-that way.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Dickerson touched the basketball, he fired a
quick-release 3 with 2:05 left, swishing it for a 97-88 lead and
giving himself 21 points to lead the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left was to keep possession for enough of the final
two minutes, and the Mavs twisted their presses to make sure the
rookies would handle the ball. Mobley and Dickerson each had one
turnover. But with a minute left, the Rockets found Barkley inside
and he made two free throws to push the lead back to seven. Mobley
added a free throw with 42.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's strong finish further put to rest concerns about his
damaged left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is amazing,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Rockets finished their fifth game with their
fourth combination, Pippen again seemed most comfortable directing
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that it falls into place like that,'' he said. ``I
enjoy controlling the ball. It allows me the opportunity to control
the tempo of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After five games, they still are defining their style. But
Thursday might have been a step in that direction.

KINGS EDGE FLYERS

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Twenty-four hours after a disheartening loss
at Phoenix, the Los Angeles Kings picked themselves up, dusted
themselves off, turned in their most inspiring performance of the
season and in the process picked up two points in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   And the inspirational effort came against the powerful
Philadelphia Flyers, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Down two with 3:08 to play Thursday night, the Kings got goals
from Sandy Moger, Donald Audette and Jozef Stumpel _ the last with
three-tenths of a second on the clock on a shot from the blueline _
and defeated the Flyers 4-3 before a Forum crowd of 13,878.
</P>
<P>
   With the final seconds winding down, Stumpel reached the Flyers'
blue line, wound up and fired a 60-footer that beat Philadelphia
goalie Ron Hextall between the pads and lifted the Kings to an
entirely unforeseeable triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Kings (20-29-4) to within four points of
Edmonton in the race for the final playoff berth in the Western
Conference. The Flyers (28-12-12) lost for the second night in a
row after putting together a 16-1-7 streak. Philadelphia lost
Wednesday night to the Mighty Ducks at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final minutes, it looked like business as usual for
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Therien and Keith Jones had scored first-period goals for
the Flyers, with Pavel Rosa scoring for the Kings in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros scored for the Flyers 7:53 into the third period,
and defeat appeared inevitable for the Kings. With the goal,
Lindros extended his point-scoring streak to 15 games (13 goals, 18
assists).
</P>
<P>
   But with 3:08 to play, Luc Robitaille fired the puck from the
blue line, and after Hextall made the save, Moger banged in the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 1:48 to play, Stumpel passed the puck from behind the
Philadelphia net to Audette in the left circle. Audette shot off
the pass and beat Hextall between the pads.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime appeared unavoidable, but Stumpel took care of that
with his ninth _ and most important _ goal this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson scratched defenseman Garry Galley and
played Philippe Boucher, prompting speculation that the Kings might
be showcasing the seldom-used Boucher, who played for just the
second time in the last 22 games and has expressed a desire to be
traded. Robinson also scratched center Yanic Perreault, who has
scored just six goals in his past 45 games.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor denied any deals were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a coach's decision, who was in and who was out,''
Taylor said. ``We're trying to find a way to win a hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had some early chances, in particular a power-play
blast by Rob Blake and a shorthanded rush by Russ Courtnall, but
Hextall made the saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings weren't so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first period, Therien beat Kings goalie
Stephane Fiset from the top of the left faceoff circle. Fiset got a
piece of the puck, but not enough to keep it out of the net.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a good omen, considering that on the previous 26
occasions this season when the Kings had allowed the first goal,
they'd rallied to win just three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' plight worsened less than three minutes later. Fiset
stopped a shot from the right circle by Eric Desjardins, but Keith
Jones bunted the rebound into the net, giving the Flyers a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got a break that contributed to Rosa's goal. Late in
the second period, a shot by Ray Ferraro beat Hextall but hit the
post. The horn sounded, however, as if the puck had entered the
net. In the confusion, Rosa banged the puck past Hextall from in
front of the crease.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THREE French friends of mine recently traveled to Madagascar, the
impoverished island nation off the east coast of Africa. Their
mission was to explore the possibilities of doing a real-estate
development there, one that would have provided jobs and given the
economy of the typically destitute town they visited a modest
boost.
</P>
<P>
   They would be taking a substantial financial risk with the
expectations of making a reasonable profit. You know, Capitalism
101. They even had an ``in'' with a prominent local family, one of
royal lineage. Nonetheless, the huge bribes they were asked to pay
to go forth with construction squelched the deal before the fact.
</P>
<P>
   My friends returned to France sadder and wiser _ but with an
eyes-wide-open understanding of why most of the world, particularly
the Third, is in such a mess. Thus, there's nothing about the
scandal engulfing the Olympic movement that could now surprise
them.
</P>
<P>
   But most of us Americans tend to believe hard work and straight
shooting are the secrets of success. We're a naive lot, aren't we?
We seem shocked that an organization with such a lofty stature and
presumed purity of purpose as the International Olympic Committee
could be caught with its pants down _ or, I should say, hands out _
too.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City high rollers who raised the payola to land
the 2002 Winter Olympics might be a scummy bunch, but they were
only playing by the ``rules'' of the IOC's hopelessly corrupt
system, a system that had beaten them out of the 1998 Games.
</P>
<P>
   A system in which the bucks all stop with the erect old chap at
the top, Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch, himself a man of wretched
personal extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sports functionary in Franco's fascist government,
Samaranch actually expects people to address him as ``Your
Excellency.'' The IOC spends a half-million dollars per year simply
to house Samaranch in a sprawling compound atop the Palace Hotel
when he deigns to visit Lausanne on Olympic business.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he travels, he demands to be treated as a head of
state, if not a monarch. Only the presidential suite provides
sufficient comfort for him. And, no, he never has obtained a Hertz
No. 1 Club number. Need we say more about the mindset of the IOC
under His Excellency? He leads by example; the delegates follow
giddily.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Olympics have prospered financially during
Samaranch's aristocratic rule _ as if any global sporting event
hasn't in the age of TV megadollars _ but the costs should be
apparent with the almost humorous stream of revelations of late.
And we strongly suspect the depth and breadth of the IOC's
money-grubbing has barely been noted. The rest of the iceberg lurks
in the murky depths.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, after all, how the IOC regulations don't contain a
single restriction on conflicts of interest. That's how Alex
Gilady, a member from Israel, also can sit on the IOC's television
committee while being a vice president of NBC Sports. Lovely.
</P>
<P>
   That Samaranch would deny knowledge of the site shakedowns,
which totaled more than $1 million in Salt Lake alone, is
contemptible. That he would piously insist he is above reproach and
scoff at notions he should step down is insulting. The advent of
soliciting bag money for IOC delegates as they trotted around the
globe playing one city off another happened to coincide with his
ascension to the throne _ uh, position _ in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Were he a truly honorable man sitting atop such a dishonorable
organization, he would recognize his duty to fall on that priceless
samurai sword the Nagano delegation gave him prior to its defeat of
Salt Lake City. Far more is needed here than a minor housecleaning
or policy reshaping. The entire Olympic home office should be
dismantled and rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it won't be. Samaranch will serve out the last two
years of an already suspiciously extended term, and someone much
like him figures to take over. But the good news for cities such as
Houston bidding for future Games is the IOC's nasty little secret
is one no longer. And the multinational corporations that foot the
Olympics' bills via TV ads appear to have put these IOC grifters on
notice. They have the power to depose His Excellency, if they'll
just use it.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the thievery is going to have to become considerably
more sophisticated to go undetected, and it is assumed local
chamber-of-commerce types will blow their whistles like mad the
moment an extortionist Olympic delegate steps out of line.
</P>
<P>
   If the Games wind up in Houston on Houston's own merit,
terrific. Otherwise, let them go elsewhere. Sometimes you have to
trade profits for principle, even if such a notion sounds terribly
quaint today.
</P>

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ If you go by what happened in the two races
Thursday, history just might repeat itself in the 1999 Daytona 500.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two drivers who finished in the top two spots last year _
Dale Earnhardt and Bobby Labonte _ were the two winners in the
Gatorade 125 qualifying races Thursday in front of 120,000
spectators at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a perfect decade for Earnhardt in the qualifying
races: Thursday was his 10th consecutive victory in the twin
events. Now, he hopes he can become the fourth driver to win the
Daytona 500 in back-to-back years after waiting 20 years to win it
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about this brand-new race car,'' Earnhardt said
of the Goodwrench Chevrolet. ``She's perfect and ready to go 500
miles. I could do anything I wanted to on the track _ not a bit
loose and not any push. We were afraid to change anything this week
because the car drove so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has won seven Winston Cup championships, but he said
his 10 consecutive victories in the 125s also are an accomplishment
he cherishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win all of these (qualifying races) in the '90s makes you
proud,'' Earnhardt said. ``It's pretty awesome. I don't know why,
but it has just worked out. I don't know how to explain it. It's a
great streak to have because I ain't seen anybody else do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who was the pole-sitter for the 1998 Daytona 500 and
the runner-up to Earnhardt in the race, never had won a Daytona
qualifying race in six previous attempts. He also became the first
Pontiac driver to win a qualifying race since Bobby Allison did it
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole crew did great job,'' Labonte said. ``They put a
new motor in last night, and this one is pretty strong. The car
handled great, and we were able to run flat-out all day. It's the
same race car we had last year. Luckily, we missed the wreck at the
beginning today.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who started on the outside of row 5 in the Interstate
Batteries Grand Prix, narrowly escaped a five-car accident between
the first and second turns of the first lap. Jeff Gordon led most
of the first 125-mile race, but Labonte took the lead on lap 39 and
stayed in front for the last 11 laps. Gordon finished second, and
Jeff Burton was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got by Terry (Labonte) and got a run on Gordon in turn 3,''
Bobby Labonte said. ``He sort of got pinched off behind some lapped
cars. I thought the pack would freight-train by me at the end, but
we were able to hold them off. It reassured me we have a great race
car and great restrictor-plate program.''
</P>
<P>
   That program includes new teammate Tony Stewart, who started on
the pole for the qualifying race that Earnhardt won. Stewart, a
former Indy Racing League champion, led the first eight laps in the
Home Depot Pontiac, but he got a lesson in restrictor-plate racing
when Earnhardt led a train of cars by him and shuffled Stewart back
to ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who ended up sixth, knew his starting position was
assured after earning a front-row spot last weekend in qualifying.
He will start on the outside of row 1 Sunday next to pole-sitter
Gordon. But Stewart was no match for Earnhardt on Thursday. Jeremy
Mayfield finished second, and Dale Jarrett was third.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's victory was his first win under crew chief Kevin
Hamlin, who took over for Larry McReynolds midway through last
season while McReynolds switched to teammate Mike Skinner's car.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's last championship was 1994 when he was 43, but he
still believes he has a shot at becoming the first eight-time
Winston Cup champion, and he has no doubt about which driver he
needs to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24 car (Gordon) is the team to beat for the
championship,'' Earnhardt said. ``They keep doing everything right,
and they have momentum and confidence going for them. What we have
to do is be consistent and finish in the top five every week.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Gordon on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boy don't bother me down here,'' Earnhardt said. ``But
he'll be tough, just like a lot of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he believes the DuPont Monte Carlo did what he
wanted it to do in the qualifying race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned we have a great-handling race car that can win
here,'' Gordon said. ``I'm real pleased with it, but we would like
to get a little more speed out of it in the straightaways, and I
think we will before Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 15 finishers in the two races earned a spot in Sunday's
race. Positions 31-36 are filled off of qualifying speeds from last
weekend, and spots 37-43 are filled by provisionals based on points
from last season and past champions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Owner Richard Burke keeps hearing rumors that his franchise is
for sale _ rumors he denied for the first time publicly late
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Burke pointed to the timing of the rumors, which are
flying as discussions over a proposed hockey arena in south
Scottsdale heat up.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said it's at least the third time in recent weeks that he
has had to squelch such suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's total BS,'' said Burke, who bought the Winnipeg Jets and
moved the franchise to Phoenix three years ago. ``I am not selling
this team, period. But every time we approach a key date with our
situation in Scottsdale, it seems I have to spend an entire day, or
more than that, reassuring people that we're not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard enough of the rumors. They're just not true. We're
committed to staying in Arizona. . . . I'm not looking to sell or
move the team. We are totally focused on the arena project in
Scottsdale and nothing is going to change that. I just find it
mysterious that every time we have something major to announce with
that project, something or somebody seems to want to mess with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke also said, for the first time, that the Coyotes possibly
may have to look for a new home out of state if the Scottsdale
project fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Plan B. So far, we don't have a Plan B,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke and the Coyotes are hoping to land a new, 20,000-seat
hockey arena at Scottsdale and McDowell roads as part of the
massive new Los Arcos Mall renovation, which goes to a public
referendum in another month, and then in all likelihood, to a
public vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure for some reason doesn't pass, Burke said the
Coyotes will finish out the remaining two years of their lease
agreement at America West Arena after this season and look
elsewhere for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said Thursday night that it will be impossible to remain
at America West Arena beyond that time, citing the 4,500
obstructed-view seats in the building, along with the lack of broad
revenue and suite sales. &QL;

SALT LAKE CITY _ By last year's standards, it was a little slow, a
little tentative at times. She was so far off form, in fact, that a
few judges even docked her a tenth of a point on artistic merit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chasing perfection can be tough business, as Michelle Kwan knows
all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a pretty good night was more than enough to leave the
defending national and world champion in first place in the United
States Figure Skating Association Championships after Thursday
night's short program at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember we are probably our own worst critics,''
her coach, Frank Carroll, said. ``It probably wasn't the greatest
performance of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   It would do, however, leaving the 18-year-old Kwan ahead of
13-year-old Sara Hughes and 20-year-old Amber Corwin going into
Saturday night's free skate.
</P>
<P>
   Another 13-year-old, Naomi Nari Nam, is fourth, followed by
16-year-old Erin Pearl.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Andrea Gardiner, who finished eighth in this
competition a year ago, had a difficult evening. After suffering a
nasty fall in warm-ups, the 18-year-old missed a scheduled triple
lutz, double toe combination early in her program, two-footed a
pair of subsequent jumps and came in 17th in the field of 20
skaters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men, 1998 runner-up Michael Weiss was the leader after
the first night.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and sixth at last
year's worlds, Weiss is the class of a largely untested men's
field. In the absence of defending champion Todd Eldredge (who is
here but not competing), the Virginia native is expected to win
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a different role for me, but it's fun,'' Weiss
said. ``I'm used to being the underdog, but this is where you want
to be right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different for me, but it was fun. There was a lot more
pressure on me, and I just wanted to go out and skate a nice, solid
program, get into the rhythm of the program, and I felt like I did
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fight for a couple of landings on things, but that's
what made it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding hopefuls for 2002 is important across the board here but
particularly so among the men. After the short program, Weiss _ who
placed first with all nine judges _ was followed by Timothy Goebel,
an 18-year-old from Rolling Meadows, Ill., whose previous best
finish at nationals was a sixth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Trifun Zivanovic, a 24-year-old from Los Angeles who was seventh
last year, is third, barely edging 18-year-old Matt Savoie of
Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Goebel, who withdrew after the short program last year because
of a lingering hip injury, was solid, but he still lacks the flair
he needs to win. Skating to Zorba, he at times seemed to be going
through the motions instead of having a rousing time at a Greek
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning here is in the back of my mind, but I don't think it's
going to happen,'' Goebel said. ``Second or third, I'd be happy
with a trip to worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, it was Kwan the estimated crowd of 5,000
came to see, and while she was not in top form, she was by no means
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Skating to Fate of Carmen by Rodion Shchedrin, she opened with a
triple lutz, double toe followed by a double axel and later landed
a triple toe without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done some things better, I believe,'' she said.
``The lutz was a little shaky, but overall I feel good about (the
program).''
</P>
<P>
   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski gone to the ``ineligible''
ranks, Kwan is without peer at this competition. The stage will be
hers again Saturday night, as it may be all the way up the 2002
Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I try not to think about,'' she said of the
favorite's role. ``As long as you're in the top three after the
short, you're all right, and that's where I am.''

THE WARM FEELINGS AFTER CLINTON'S CHINA VISIT HAVE TURNED CHILLY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs lede graf to make it read: ``American security interests,``
steady of Asian interests.)  (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven months after President Clinton's return from
a picture-perfect trip to China, the promise of a new era in
Chinese-U.S. relations has faded, leaving the administration
grappling with an unexpected round of repression of human rights in
China and a mounting perception in Congress that Beijing is
threatening American security interests.
</P>
<P>
   The high expectations set by Clinton in China have run up
against a pessimistic tone set by political forces in both
countries that administration officials say are more intent on
confrontation than cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of showing signs of progress in its policy of
``constructive engagement'' with China, the administration is
facing a squall of China-bashing in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. business, a constituency that the administration's
China policy has particularly tried to assist and the loudest
advocate of closer ties, is complaining about Beijing's new
restrictions on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by a bipartisan congressional inquiry's findings that
China stole sensitive U.S. military technology, administration
officials say they are warily waiting for even more explosive
details expected to be announced in March in a declassified report
by the congressmen who headed the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   And later this month, the Pentagon is expected to send to
Congress its long-delayed classified report on security questions
in the Taiwan Strait, which will describe a sharp increase in the
number of missiles on the Chinese coast.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and experts who have had sections of the report read
to them said the Pentagon would report that in the early 1990s
China had 60 missiles pointed at Taiwan but that since 1995 that
number has more than doubled. In three years the Chinese are
expected to have 800 missiles deployed on their side of the strait.
</P>
<P>
   That report, another administration official said, is sure to
create ``a new wave of calls about the China threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these obstacles, the administration says its
policy of ``constructive engagement'' still holds.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two months, in advance of a visit to Washington by
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on April 8, the administration will be
working hard to find some issue on which the two countries can find
common ground, most likely the possibility of China's admission to
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Even that common ground may be elusive. As the Chinese economy
suffers from slower growth, rising unemployment and stalled
economic reforms, the incentive for the Chinese to make trade
concessions so they can join the trade organization has diminished,
economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration thought after the Clinton trip that it had
come to some tolerable modus vivendi with China,'' said Jonathan B.
Pollack, a defense strategist at Rand Corp., who recently visited
China. ``But it doesn't run very deep. There's a clear sense that
the underpinnings are very fragile, and there's a very clear
potential for a real reversal in the relationship.''

HUSKIES DELIVER STATEMENT, BEAT OREGON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ This team was unbeaten at home? The Beavers?
The ones who missed their first six shots with a player named Lake
who couldn't hit the ocean?
</P>
<P>
   Washington confronted a supposedly rejuvenated squad, but Oregon
State turned out to be just another victim Thursday night, falling
to the Huskies 82-69.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies remained the Pac-10's hottest team, improving to 8-4
in the conference after winning for the eighth time in their past
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Beavers were 10-0 on this floor this year, they were
considered to be a difficult test for Washington. But Oregon State
came out as flat as its mascot's tail.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies jumped in front on a pair of 3-pointers by Donald
Watts and Deon Luton in the first minute. They were threatened once
after that until Todd MacCulloch unveiled his superiority complex
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The senior center never figured to be the leading scorer after
being limited to one point in the first 15 minutes. But he finished
with 24 points, contributing 17 during a decisive 35-7 run that
busted a 24-24 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they get in trouble, they can get the ball to Todd,''
said Oregon State coach Eddie Payne, who Thursday voted for
MacCulloch on the coach's All-America team. ``You know he's going
to make 60 to 70 percent of his shots. I don't care who's guarding
him or what the situation is. Every game he does it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get the recognition because he's in the Pac-10,
plays in the Northwest and he's not a pretty-looking player. But
he's so productive. I'm glad to see him leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were so effective and thorough that Oregon State
could do nothing afterward but compare them favorably to the
Pac-10's other powers _ Stanford, Arizona and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're right in that area,'' said Beavers guard Josh
Steinthal, the Sumner High graduate who scored 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Washington improved to 15-7 overall and 8-4 in the conference,
moving into a third-place tie with UCLA and just one game behind
9-3 Arizona. This year's Husky team is looking more and more like
last year's team that went to the sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers want an NIT bid but better hope no one from New York
was watching. For the longest time Oregon State could not get
anything to drop.
</P>
<P>
   The futility reached 1-for-13 when Josiah Lake clanked a
fast-break layin. The problem was that Washington rarely registered
with much more in the way of counterpunches, allowing Oregon State
to loiter in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   When the Beavers began to zero in, they couldn't miss for awhile
and even caught the Huskies at 24-24 when Steinthal drilled a
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Rocked, Washington retaliated with a 13-0 spurt that ballooned
to 35-7 in a 13-minute stretch spanning the first and second
halves, giving the Huskies a 59-31 lead. It muffled everyone here,
particularly the Luton hecklers, of which there were many early on.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Washington guard blew an uncontested jam when
he tried to apply the mustard while forgetting the substance.
Michael Johnson created the fast break with a steal and a nice
behind-the-back pass to Luton ahead of the pack. Luton rolled in
and tried a reverse slam, only to have it ricochet violently off
the back rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an isolated catastrophe that could have been
devastating,'' said Husky coach Bob Bender. ``But we recovered from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Luton's miss prompted chants of ``you can't dunk, you can't
dunk'' from the students. But those in the bright orange T-shirts
discovered that their team can't win all of their home games, not
this season, not with MacCulloch in town.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, MacCulloch played in a phone booth, crowded by
Clifton Jones and Jason Heide, the Issaquah High product who
matches Cougar Mountain in size these days. In one sequence, Jones
stuffed MacCulloch followed by another rejection by Heide. Even the
little 6-1 Lake sneaked up on the big Canadian and blocked one of
his shots.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leading field-goal shooter at 70 percent entering
the game, MacCulloch nonetheless made 11 of 18, supplying the
biggest baskets at the most significant junctures. His banker, for
instance, broke the 24-24 tie, and Washington never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give up,'' MacCulloch said. ``I missed shots,
but I was staying in the game. I'm going to get opportunities. The
harder you work for them, the easier it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans were like the team they supported _ unresponsive, but
then what could they say? In previous games here against Arizona
and UCLA, they were said to be unruly and classless. No one rushed
the floor or engaged in an idiotic act. Everyone was humbled by the
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game they were talking to us and we were talking to
them,'' said Watts, who scored 18 points. ``They were saying: `How
many points do you think you're going to lose by?' It's all fun and
games. But when you get on the court, you've got to play for 40
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington had lapses, but they were momentary and the final one
occurred too late to matter. It did, however, to Bender, who turned
Gill into a sub shop before summoning his starters to finish the
game when the Beavers cut the deficit to 10.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The Huskies play at Oregon on Saturday in another
non-televised game. ... Point guard Senque Carey continued his
splendid play with 18 points, 10 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 steals,
more than negating his five turnovers. ... Marlon Shelton came off
the Husky bench for one minute of action, returning to the same
floor where his father, Lonnie, used to dominate in the 1970s.

 WASHINGTON: relationship.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most immediate thorn for the administration is how to deal
with the regression in China's human rights policies in the last
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials argue that they never expected
continued improvement in human rights after Clinton left China in
July and that there is ``no quick fix,'' as Harold Koh, the
assistant secretary of state for human rights, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the long prison sentences of 11 to 13 years imposed on three
democracy campaigners in December took officials here by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we were are unhappy about the arrests and have said
so publicly and from the president on down privately,'' said Sandy
Berger, the president's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the clearest path for the administration to
register its objection to such a crackdown is to sponsor a
resolution condemning China at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   That is an annual opportunity for countries to record their
disquiet at China's human rights policy in a forum that the Chinese
authorities take seriously despite its relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the face of a seemingly improved human rights
climate in China and to the gratification of the Chinese
government, the administration decided for the first time since
1990 not to offer such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in what an official described as almost
``insurmountable'' pressure from Congress, the administration is in
the midst of a heated debate about whether to reverse last year's
course and condemn the Chinese for the crackdown. Such a reversal
could be embarrassing for Clinton, who at the end of his China trip
said, ``China has the right leadership at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was opposed to moving against the Chinese in
Geneva, administration officials said, but became alarmed when a
moderate Republican, Rep. Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, chairman of
the International Relations Subcommittee on Asia, said there would
be an ``explosion'' in Congress if the administration remained
quiet at Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the White House was now considering what
recommendation to make to Clinton about the Geneva conference,
which starts on March 22 and runs until April 30. Inconveniently
for the administration, Zhu's visit to Washington is scheduled for
the middle of the Geneva gathering.
</P>
<P>
   On national security, the administration faces a confluence of
issues that may serve only to intensify the problems in the
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is the administration's proposal, which
the Chinese have vehemently criticized, to push forward plans for
developing a theater missile defense system with Japan, South Korea
and possibly Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which is still in the design stage, has been
promoted with renewed urgency by the administration since the
surprise firing by North Korea of a missile that flew over Japan
and into the Pacific in August.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the system would protect Japan and South
Korea from North Korean missiles, but Taiwan's government has shown
interest in being part of the system, an interest the
administration has not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have interpreted the recent push on the theater
missile defense system as hostile to their interests. A Pentagon
official suggested this was hardly surprising, since the defense
system hits them at the ``heart of their military posture.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming release of a Pentagon report on the system, requested
last year by Congress, is likely to intensify the debate. The
Chinese have already raised the issue in a way that does not please
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Washington last month, a senior Chinese arms
control official, Sha Zukang, warned the administration that
pushing ahead with the missile defense system would sink any
chances of China's joining a major international mechanism for
controlling the spread of missile technology, the Missile
Technology Control Regime. Nations that belong to the regime are
bound not to export missile parts.
</P>
<P>
   Sha made the warning at a conference at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, where Berger announced that Washington
would like China to join the control regime this year.
</P>
<P>
   From the administration's point of view, the brightest picture
for achieving some progress with the Chinese in time for the prime
minister's visit, appears to be paving the way for China's entry to
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Urging China to make concessions so it can join the world's
premier trade body has been the focus of Clinton's efforts in the
last three years to open China economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   But Western economists assert that this is one of the most
inopportune times to be moving China toward the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. corporations complain that China, instead of easing market
access, has been tightening the rules for Western investors in the
last few months, particularly in telecommunications. And to belong
to the trade organization, China would have to make such
fundamental changes as freeing up the distribution system of roads
and warehouses, which are now almost entirely in the hands of the
Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that the administration wanted to persevere and that
another delegation of the U.S. trade representative's office would
go to China soon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even though China was going through economic
dislocations, the Chinese would like to be part of the World Trade
Organization before the Taiwanese, who are close to membership.
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that the Chinese had to face the
reality that the only way they could win membership in the trade
group was if they made enough concessions to allow U.S. market
access to China and to adhere to the rules of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said we would be flexible, but it must be an
agreement that is justifiable on market grounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Berger said, there is little chance that Chinese
membership will be approved by Congress.

STANFORD BEATS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ It looked different and felt different than
their two previous visits here _ in other words, the Bruins
actually had a chance to win _ but in the end it was the same
frustrating result for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford solved its free-throw problems, solved UCLA's pressure
defense and seemingly ended the Bruins' Pacific-10 title hopes with
a 77-73 victory Thursday night, before 7,391 at Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stanford's fourth consecutive victory over UCLA, which
trails the league-leading Cardinal by 2{ games with three weeks
remaining. But if progress is measured in margins, the Bruins
(17-6, 8-4) have closed the gap.
</P>
<P>
   After losing by 13 points here last year and 48 points two
seasons ago, UCLA comported itself as an equal _ not an outmanned,
undersized child trying to compete with the big boys. The Bruins
were within a basket several times in the final minute, but
Stanford's free-throw shooting was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very much under control,'' Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. ``They moved the ball well. They made good
decisions. They've made progress to the point that they're a very
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stanford forward David Moseley: ``UCLA played smarter than
they usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Bruins made one questionable decision. With 9:45
left and UCLA trailing 48-46, coach Steve Lavin inserted center Dan
Gadzuric despite his four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven seconds later, Gadzuric made a wild lunge for a
long rebound, committed his fifth, and UCLA played the rest of the
game without its best rebounder _ always a fatal mistake in Maples.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a game like this, each possession is critical,'' Lavin
said. ``We tried Sean Farnham, Matt Barnes and Travis Reed. That
was the area we were struggling in most. (Gadzuric) is the only
answer we have for rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the Bruins were helpless underneath. Forward Jerome
Moiso, his confidence and timing shattered by tendinitis in his
right foot, made 1 of 12 shots and grabbed just three rebounds. His
subpar performance magnified Gadzuric's absence, as Stanford turned
its 21 offensive rebounds into countless trips to the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after it was 12 of 24 from the line in a loss to
Connecticut, the Cardinal beat UCLA by making 22 of 24 free throws
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good free-throw-shooting coach,'' Lavin said.
``I'm going to have to hire him away.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA used its 16th starting lineup of the season, with freshmen
Ray Young and Matt Barnes starting at forward for Moiso and JaRon
Rush, who was benched Sunday after being kicked out of practice for
a poor attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Rush scored a career-high 20 points, including a 3-pointer with
3:45 left that trimmed Stanford's lead to 61-59. He also grabbed 11
rebounds _ six more than Moiso and Gadzuric combined.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis led UCLA with 23 points and played one of the best
games of his career, making 9 of 14 shots and 4 of 6 3-pointers.
But Davis and Rush alone were not enough, even though Stanford,
which had lost two of its previous three, was tentative when the
game began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they were vulnerable,'' Rush said. ``They had lost
to Arizona and Connecticut, and we thought we had a pretty good
chance to upset them. Then they put it together in the second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford missed 12 of its first 14 shots and allowed the Bruins
to build a 14-4 advantage, but it was a misleading lead; the way
Stanford was playing, UCLA's margin should have been 15 or 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving too quick,'' Montgomery said. ``It was either
their pressure or our anxiety. In the second half, we settled
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve forward David Moseley gave Stanford a spark with eight
quick points, and UCLA had fatally missed its opportunity.
Moseley's 3-pointer from the right wing with seven minutes left in
the half narrowed the Bruins' lead to 17-16, and it was taut the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal scored seven straight points early in the second
half to take a two-point lead and pushed the margin to 46-41 on
Jarron Collins' basket from the low post with 12 minutes left. Then
Gadzuric came in and fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offensive rebounding was the difference,'' UCLA guard
Earl Watson said. ``A win would have been a big step in the right
direction, but this was a step. Last year, we didn't make it a
game. Here, we had a great chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have a big test to see how we react when we play
Cal.''

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Jozef Stumpel wasn't sure how much time
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe five seconds. Maybe more. Maybe less.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by such uncertainty, the Los Angeles Kings center
reached the blue line, wound up, and fired a 60-foot slap shot at
the Philadelphia Flyers' net. Halfway to Ron Hextall, who was
waiting to make a routine save that would send the game into
overtime, the puck struck the leg of defenseman Eric Desjardins,
changed speed and zipped between the pads of the Flyers' goalie.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, with 0:00.3 on the clock, the Kings had
their most dramatic, memorable and significant win of the season, a
4-3 victory Thursday night before a Forum crowd of 13,878 in which
Stumpel's goal capped a three-goal rally in the final 3:08. The
Kings trailed, 3-1, before getting late goals from Sandy Moger and
Donald Audette that set the stage for Stumpel's starring role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm surprised,'' Stumpel said when asked if he'd
expected his shot to go in when he unleashed it. ``But you see it
in lots of games. Things happen when you shoot the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson said, ``This is something we've
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (20-29-4) also needed the two points they picked up in
the standings, points that moved them to within four points of
Edmonton in the race for the eighth and final playoff spot in the
Western Conference. It was the first victory for the Kings when
trailing after the second period since a victory over Calgary 13
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And it was an especially inspiring victory coming as it did 24
hours after a disheartening loss at Phoenix, and coming against the
Flyers (28-12-12), who were 16-1-7 in a 24-game stretch before
losing Wednesday night to the Mighty Ducks and then to the Kings on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange in a way, but it was our own fault in another
way,'' Hextall said. ``We weren't doing a lot of the things that we
have done in the past to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked for most of the night like another setback for the
Kings, who are running out of time in their bid to get back into
the playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Therien and Keith Jones gave the Flyers a 2-0 first-period
lead, ominous for the Kings considering that before Thursday,
they'd won only three of 26 games in which they'd allowed the first
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Rosa brought the Kings to within a goal in the second
period, but Eric Lindros restored the Flyers' two-goal lead eight
minutes into the third, extending his point-scoring streak to 15
games (13 goals, 18 assists).
</P>
<P>
   With 3:08 to play, Moger scored from the front of the Flyers'
net off the rebound of a shot from the blue line by Luc Robitaille,
who had three assists. And with 1:48 to play, Audette scored from
the left circle off a pass from behind the net by Stumpel, tying
the score, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   On the winning goal, Hextall had little chance once the puck hit
Desjardins' leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't change speed, it just changed direction,'' Hextall
said. ``It was a matter of if it hit me or not, and it didn't hit
me. We let them back in the game. We gave them a chance. They are a
pretty down team, and we handed them two points.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel said, ``First of all, I didn't know how much time was
left, but as soon as I saw it was in the net, I was really excited.
I knew it was late in the game so I just tried to shoot it on the
net. It hit the defenseman on the shin pads and that redirected the
shot. Hopefully, it gives us some confidence for the next games.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``I was hoping to get a win like this and that
the guys start getting a little more confidence. I see it as a
tremendous lift for our guys.''

PERILOUS CROSSING MEANS FREEDOM OR DEATH FOR THIRD
WORLD  IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  VLORE, Albania _ Joseph M.'s first glimpse of Western Europe
is a thin white blur on the horizon, the lights of Italy shimmering
across the Adriatic Sea, as contraband launches warm their engines
for the crossing and bursts of gunfire echo in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   He has come here from his native Sri Lanka, on a meandering
5,000-mile odyssey through countries whose names he never learns.
``We traveled by night, in minibuses and freighters and strangers'
cars,'' he tells a reporter. ``We seldom had any idea where we
were.''
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year civil war, which has taken the lives of Joseph's two
brothers and 52,000 other Sri Lankans, sent him on his desperate
10-week journey.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's descent into crime and chaos _ a lawless void less
than 50 miles away from the European Union's southern flank _ has
made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Around Joseph on the Vlore beach, peering silently westward as
they await the journey's final voyage, are Kurds from Turkey and
Iraq, entire families from Kosovo, Africans from Sierra Leone and
Liberia. Like the Sir Lankans, they are today's version of the
huddled masses memorialized on the Statue of Liberty's base, the
tempest-tossed of a Third World awash in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead, if they reach the lights in one of the motorboats that
idle in Vlore's harbor, lies the uncertain future of clandestine
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each week, thousands gather in this port in southern
Albania, carried westward from homelands as distant as China. Some
will scramble ashore in Italy before dawn. Some will be captured by
Italian police and sent back.
</P>
<P>
   Some _ no one will ever know how many _ may die in the next two
hours, an adult fallen overboard in high seas or a child cast
deliberately into the Adriatic to slow down a pursuing coast guard
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Vlore is as much a sinister metaphor as a city. Plain,
straightforward language cannot adequately describe the scene that
unfolds here, day-in, day-out.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of rich, liberal Western Europe, Vlore is a
blunt dagger aimed at its heart, an endless explosion rumbling just
42 miles from the Italian coast.
</P>
<P>
   It is a barometer of mayhem, a finely tuned instrument that
measures each rise and fall in Third World tensions in its daily
arrivals and departures. When U.S. jets strike at targets in
northern Iraq, or Serbian artillery levels a Kosovo village, the
shock waves are felt in Vlore almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Vlore is an armory, a community of 90,000 citizens who are said
to possess more than 100,000 Kalashnikov assault weapons, which
were stolen from government warehouses when Albania's national army
fell apart in 1997. They use them in gangland battles that begin
like clockwork at 8 p.m. and often continue to dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Vlore is a whorehouse, where young women from West Africa and
Eastern Europe _ many of them forced into prostitution in their
homelands and ``sold'' to Albanian middlemen at a secret market in
the city center _ are collected for transshipment to Milan and
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Vlore is what hell might look like. Vlore is a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   The gold is hauled in by a fleet of roughly 200 high-speed motor
launches known as ``gommones,'' a term derived from the Italian
word for rubber. With thick rubber tubes inflated over the gunwales
of fiberglass hulls, the boats are extraordinarily buoyant, an
important consideration in the stormy Otranto Strait that separates
Albania from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   They are also among the fastest vessels afloat, equipped with up
to three 75-horsepower outboard motors that give them a top speed
of 60 mph on a flat sea, enough to reach Italy in 90 minutes and
outrun any vessel in the NATO armada that has patrolled the strait
since the Kosovo crisis deepened.
</P>
<P>
   Quality matters to the gommone captains. The hulls of their
boats are constructed at the best shipyards in Italy, their engines
in Britain and the United States. ``A decent gommone,'' says Miko,
one of the boatmen, ``starts at $50,000 cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest and most modern commercial enterprise in the city is
a Mercury outboard motor dealership, located one block from the
harbor customs offices.
</P>
<P>
   Miko and two colleagues say that each gommone transports from 30
to 40 passengers, about a third of whom lie prone in the hull while
the rest are strapped in, seated against the rubber tubing.
</P>
<P>
   A single voyage _ if human beings are the sole cargo _ nets the
boat's owners approximately $10,000. If shipments of the marijuana,
cocaine or heroin for which Vlore has become a critical way station
are included, the profits can exceed the total value of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to acquire detailed information from gommone
captains in Vlore. They're proud of their accomplishments. ``The
economy of this city is us,'' says Miko, fingering a braided gold
chain that drapes his neck.
</P>
<P>
   On the average, 20 Vlore families share in the ownership of a
contraband boat, ``and there isn't a shop, cafe or food store that
could remain open if it wasn't for the money we bring in,'' says
Miko.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate economy in Vlore crumbled in 1997, when the
city's three banks failed in a nationwide financial crash and
southern Albania's foreign investors pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the circulation of currency _ almost exclusively U.S.
dollars, German marks or Italian lire _ is essentially a smugglers'
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers themselves claim that ``90 percent of our business
now is ferrying refugees,'' as one said, describing his activity as
``humanitarian work.''
</P>
<P>
   But a substantial amount of the foreign currency spent locally
is tied directly to narcotics shipments that the gommones move
across the Adriatic. ``In the poorest country in Europe, just one
thing matters: The transport price of a product,'' says journalist
Fatos Baxhaku, one of the few Albanians brave or foolhardy enough
to discuss the trade in print. ``Hundreds of people live on this
new market, while a scant few try to survive in the most difficult
profession in Albania _ they're the obscure members of the police
narcotics brigade.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian gangs, which are often spinoffs of tribal clans in the
mountains east of Vlore, have special advantages in the contraband
trade, says Colonel Arben Ujka, chief of the brigade. ``They
respect a tradition of total secrecy, which forbids anyone to
repeat the words of the band's chieftain outside of the inner
group.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany alone, according to European Union figures, more than
800 Albanians are currently imprisoned on heroin trafficking
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The radical criminalization of Albania's economy and power
structure have been catastrophic for the impoverished majority of
the nation's 3.3 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In densely populated central Vlore, urban services have
completely broken down. ``We have no electricity at all, and our
only water comes from a broken pipe half a kilometer down the
hill,'' said Zeqo, a father of six. ``There's no help for us from
anybody, and no honest work that would allow us to help
ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within sight of the broken pipe, where Zeqo and his neighbors
jostle for position with plastic buckets held under a stream of
brown water, Mercedes Benz and BMW sedans cruise the city's rutted
dirt streets.
</P>
<P>
   They park in front of sprawling villas and flashy restaurants
that have cropped up along the Vlore waterfront since Third World
wars, human desperation and drugs began raining wealth on the 4,000
gommone families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every car you see here is busy at night, driving back and
forth to the Kosovo and Macedonia borders,'' said one of Miko's
colleagues, who himself drives a pea-green Mercedes. ``That's how
the clandestines get across Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cars have German or Italian license plates. The
European Union estimates that at least two-thirds of the luxury
vehicles in Albania have been stolen abroad and smuggled into the
country.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Vlore, an Italian-registered 1998 Mercedes
that retails for $35,000 across the Adriatic can be purchased for
$7,000 cash.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law in Vlore except the boatmen's clan alliances and
rivalries, just as there is no economy without the drug or human
shipments that cross the Otranto Strait in their boats.
</P>
<P>
   Along the beach, where the gommones prepare for their voyages
and crowds of emigrants gather, policemen and soldiers lounge
against the harbor breakwall, chatting and smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The gommones have no conceivable function but contraband
traffic. Indeed, they are unambiguously illegal. An anti-smuggling
bill, passed in 1998 by the Albanian parliament, limits small craft
to no more than one 70-horsepower engine and a top speed of 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in a uniform appears to care.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of antigovernment riots in 1997, Albania's
army, national police force and border guard units effectively
collapsed. They are now being reconstructed with the help of 630
Italian military and law enforcement advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the country is still under the control of
racketeering gangs such as those that govern Vlore, and the
ostensible representatives of order are often deeply corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle reporter is not permitted to leave Albania until he
paid a ``fine'' of 100,000 lire cash ($62) to a customs official,
who said there was ``no proof'' that he had ``legally entered the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   When the reporter pointed to the Albanian entry stamp in his
passport, the official laughed and said, ``Agare o restare.'' ``Pay
or stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian military advisers show little faith in the outcome of
their efforts to stabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could redouble the size of our contingent, even quadruple
it, but the results wouldn't change anything,'' said Colonel
Fabrizio Lisi, who commands the advisory detachment here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Albania's. There's nothing we in the Italian
military can do about it if the Albanian government itself can't
control its own frontiers, which have been reduced to a sieve, or
decide once and for all to confront the smugglers of Vlore.''
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from the European Union to do something
about the traffic, which is now landing an estimated 800 to 1,000
clandestines per day on the western shore of the strait, Vlore
Police Chief Sokol Kociu persuaded his reluctant men to impound six
gommones on January 22.
</P>
<P>
   Kociu turned them over to a squad of the Italian advisers at a
surveillance base on the Albanian island of Sazan, just a few miles
offshore from Vlore. He invoked the new small-craft law, which was
also passed under pressure from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The next day at 8 a.m., 300 of the boatmen showed up at the
police station, rattling the morning air with Kalashnikov volleys.
Their leader pointed his gun at Kociu's head and said, ``Set the
boats free, or we kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Kociu's officers made an effort to prevent the boatmen
from seizing the police station, or to protect their commander.
</P>
<P>
   Kociu was then ferried to Sazan island in a gommone. Citing his
authority as an official of the Albanian government, he ordered the
Italians to release the seized boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no choice but to respect Albanian sovereignty,'' said
Italian Minister of Defense Carlo Scognamiglio.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO VISIT MEXICO, A COUNTRY WHOSE ANTI-DRUG RECORD IS
UNDER SCRUTINY
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of locator map, the Mexican state of Quintano
Roo is on the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula; and the city of
Merida is in the Yucatan state in the north-central region of the
peninsula.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Feb. 14 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On St. Valentine's Day, President Clinton leaves
the chill of impeachment behind and heads for Mexico's sultry
Yucatan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's visit won't mark the beginning of a
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over meetings Sunday and Monday between Clinton and
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the cloud of narcotics
trafficking, a vast criminal enterprise that feeds Mexican
corruption and America's hearty appetite for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Yucatan Peninsula -- particularly the Caribbean
state of Quintana Roo -- has become one of the hottest transit
spots in Mexico for trafficking Colombian cocaine up to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great concern that not enough progress is being
made (in Mexico) in the fight to keep drugs out of our country,''
said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has taken a strong
interest in U.S.-Mexico cooperation to stem drug smuggling along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not doubt for one minute the sincerity of President
Zedillo,'' Hutchison added. ``But he has not been able to get the
changes needed at the lower levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Zedillo, who are on friendly terms, will also talk
about trade and migration when they meet in the Yucatan state
capital city of Merida. But their talks on bilateral attempts to
curb drug trafficking are especially timely.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Clinton must decide whether to ``certify''
Mexico once again as a reliable drug-fighting partner of the United
States. Twenty-seven other countries where illicit drugs are
produced or shipped through also face certification, which was
initiated in 1987 to judge whether a country should receive
economic aid from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional insiders have no doubts that Clinton will certify
Mexico, the United States' second biggest trading partner. But
because Mexico's efforts over the past year are being questioned,
this year Clinton could face a Congress primed to fight and ready
to muster bipartisan support to overrule approval for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the debate, the Government Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative agency, is expected to release a report on
Feb. 23 on U.S.-Mexico cooperation in narcotics interdiction. Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Caucus on
International Narcotics Control will hold a hearing on the topic
the same day.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexico were to be de-certified for the first time, it could
suffer trade sanctions and lose U.S. votes for loans from
international lending agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A national security waiver could prevent these sanctions from
being imposed, but some observers say Mexico would still react
angrily and future cooperation with the United States could be
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have long and loudly stated their opposition
to the certification process, which they think is presumptuous and
a violation of their bilateral agreements with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexicans believe, quite appropriately, that the drug
problem is at least half our fault,'' said Richard Feinberg, a
former adviser to Clinton on Latin American security affairs who is
now at the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mexico cares about getting the U.S. stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Although they did not link it to certification, Mexican
officials last week announced a new $500 million drug interdiction
plan that includes sophisticated radar, satellite and X-ray
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida called
``the most ambitious ever,'' includes new airplanes and speed boats
to intercept drug loads being delivered off Mexico's Pacific and
Caribbean coasts as well as the Sea of Cortez and the Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida and other Mexican officials were in Washington last
week(CQ) to promote the plan. At a Latin American conference in
Miami, Clinton anti-drug czar Barry McCaffrey praised the Mexicans
for being ``deadly serious'' about improving their record of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico boosters note that last year Mexican authorities arrested
Jose de Jesus Amezcua and his brother, Luis, masterminds of the
world's biggest methamphetamine-smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of drug trafficking and money-laundering were
subsequently dropped because of a lack of evidence. However,
Mexican authorities have agreed to extradite Jose de Jesus
Amezcua(CQ) to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His extradition will be the first time Mexico hands over a top
Mexican trafficker to its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico critics point out that Mexico still hasn't nabbed any
of the country's current top cocaine traffickers, including the
Tijuana-based Arrellano Felix brothers, one of whom is on the FBI's
most wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 percent of the cocaine that enters the United
States from South America is smuggled through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Mexico's own figures show, Mexican seizures
of cocaine, marijuana, heroin and ephedrine, a chemical used to
manufacture methamphetamine, have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, U.S. Customs Service agents investigating drug-money
transfers from Mexico wrapped up the biggest money-laundering
investigation ever.
</P>
<P>
   The United States arrested 167 people -- including 26 Mexican
bankers -- and indicted three top Mexican banks for laundering drug
funds for Colombian and Mexican cartels.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government was stunned by the undercover operation,
whose details where kept from Mexican officials because U.S. agents
feared leaks. For months, Mexico threatened to request the
extradition of U.S. Customs Service agents who had carried out
investigations in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government dropped the threat on Feb. 7. But at the
same time it refused to extradite to the United States five
suspects in the Casablanca case, announcing that it would try them
instead in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has also been struggling to shape new corruption-free
police units to catch traffickers. But its effort to look cleaner
are often foiled by embarrassing revelations.
</P>
<P>
   In Quintana Roo, home of Cancun, Mexico's premier resort city,
an investigation last year implicated a security company at the
Cancun airport in trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of the state, Mario Villanueva, is under
investigation by the Mexican Attorney General's office for ties to
traffickers. He has angrily denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities have given Washington ``strong indication
that the governor of Quintana Roo and much of the state police are
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the traffickers,'' said a
Congressional source familiar with intelligence on drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   A willingness to admit alleged high-level corruption, the same
source said, works in Mexico's favor when it comes to
certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant change in Mexico now is a willingness to air
dirty laundry,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't make Mexico a partner,'' Reyes added, ``then we
run the real risk of the possibility of a rogue nation on our
border.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes is sending out ``dear colleague'' letters urging support
for Mexico, although, he -- like Hutchison -- believes the current
certification ritual does more injury than good.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol, Reyes added that
``corruption isn't an exclusive problem of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nogales, Ariz., on Feb. 2 three current and one former
inspectors for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service were
indicted for helping to smuggle 20 tons of cocaine across the
border. The suspects were said to be on the payroll of Mexico's
Juarez-based cartel and Sonora-based traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have served on the frontlines along the border have a
more jaundiced view than Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jordan, a former director of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's intelligence center in El Paso, Texas, said
refusing certification might send a strong message to Mexico, where
he believes ``government-sponsored'' trafficking thrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the strongest country in the world can do both. It
can trade with its neighbors, and it can hold them accountable,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   DEA agent Allen Tittle, who is assigned to a sheriff's drug task
force in McAllen, Texas -- prime smuggling ground -- said he isn't
impressed by Mexico's efforts over the last year either.
</P>

LIGHT SIGNALS FROM SPACE MAY TELL US WE'RE NOT ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time in recent years I have written about
humanity's quixotic search for life elsewhere in the cosmos. And
when I say elsewhere I have in mind locations beyond such dead
venues as Fort Wayne, Ind., and Newark, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far nothing has turned up. But the failure to stumble across,
say, radio signals from the Rush Limbaugh of Tralfamadore has not
discouraged the scientists who have leaped into this effort with
the brainless ecstasy of a volunteer fireman, a phrase I've
plagiarized from Kurt Vonnegut, the author who also dreamed up the
name Tralfamadore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I attended a Vonnegut lecture a few months ago and, though I
found him wise and witty and deliciously curmudgeonly, I was
disappointed not to hear him talk about Tralfamadore or discuss the
origin of the pregnant phrase about volunteer firemen, who nowadays
are known by the more gender-inclusive word firefighters, as well
they should be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite my disenchantment, I didn't ask for my Vonnegut lecture
money back, and you shouldn't ask for your newspaper money back
either just because some of the words in this column of
enlightening beauty are borrowed and not entirely my own. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Columns, after all, are not like extra-virgin olive oil. Rather,
they are constructed of used spare parts that the disquieting
forces of entropy irregularly scatter about the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (I don't know what that previous sentence means, either, but it
has about it the lovely ring of authenticity and I am, thus, loathe
to kill it off. If you yourself kill it off, I simply ask that you
give it a decent burial.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alien life. That's where I was going before I so rudely
interrupted myself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, as I say, for a long time scientists have been trying to
answer the central cosmological question of our age _ whether we're
alone in the universe. In the past I have pointed out the goofiness
of such a question by noting that few of us are alone even in the
bathroom. And I haven't changed my mind about that, even though the
house I live in now has three bathrooms, compared with the larger
house in which I grew up that had but one _ and was home to more
people, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scientists' search efforts have been directed at
listening for radio signals that might inadvertently pass our way
from other civilizations. Despite a false alarm or two and at least
one recent hoax, that effort really has turned up nothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a California outfit, the Planetary Society of
Pasadena, has decided to try scanning the skies for possible light
signals from other inhabited worlds, if any. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That society has been engaged in so-called SETI projects (Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) for a long time, listening for
these tell-tale radio signals that might be coming from other life
somewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we started to watch for signs as well,'' says Louis
Friedman, the society's executive director. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the society, along with the SETI Institute, is sponsoring
three new SETI optical projects, two at the University of
California at Berkeley and one at Harvard University and
Smithsonian Observatory in Massachusetts. The idea is to try to
pick up a narrow band of steady, very short light pulses that
aren't found in nature and that, therefore, might be coming from a
living source. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I guess the question is what to do if, doing that, we really
find life elsewhere. My idea: Get it to move to places like Fort
Wayne and Newark. &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    Family will get photos of soldier's honors
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fifteen years after his remains were placed in the
Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, and almost a
year after those remains were positively identified, the family of
Michael J. Blassie will receive photographs of the honors their son
and brother received during the time he was a faceless, nameless
representative of all other U.S. casualties of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing, a technology not available in 1984 when his remains
were buried in the tomb, was used last year to obtain a positive
identification. Blassie was a 24-year-old Air Force lieutenant
piloting an A-37 attack jet when he was shot down over South
Vietnam in May 1972. His remains were deemed too badly decomposed
to permit identification at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's sister, Pat Blassie, a Cobb County government employee
and a major in the Air Force reserve, was instrumental in the
effort to persuade the U.S. government to attempt the
identification using new technology.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1984, before such an attempt was possible, the
unidentified remains were accorded honors in ceremonies that were
photographed. The pictures show the flag-draped coffin lying in
state under the Capitol Rotunda, being carried to Arlington aboard
a horse-drawn caisson, and being lowered into the Tomb of the
Unknowns as then-President Reagan watches with his hand over his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, these photos have been on display in the
offices of the North Shore Veterans Counseling Service in Beverly,
Mass., a gift of the Smithsonian Institution, where the only other
known set of photos is in storage, said Michael King, executive
director of the counseling service. But after hearing that the
remains had been identified, the office contacted Pat Blassie to
see if the family would like to have the photos, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Blassie said they would be honored to receive the collection,
and King's office arranged to fly her to Boston. A presentation
ceremony will be held in the Massachusetts Statehouse's Hall of
Flags on Feb. 18.

 &HT;    Bills aim to bar adoption by gaysBy Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Roberto's two mothers pack up for a family
outing, one of them lets the 3-year-old hold her purse to reassure
him that he won't be left behind. Two fathers take 8-year-old
Frank, who as a toddler witnessed and may have experienced physical
and sexual abuse, to visit his biological brother.
</P>
<P>
   Child Protective Services, the state agency that takes custody
of abused or neglected children, took both Roberto and Frank from
dangerous homes and gave them their new, nontraditional families:
Roberto's foster mother is a lesbian and is raising the boy (whose
name has been changed for this story) and his 15-month-old brother
with her partner. Frank's gay adoptive father also shares parenting
duties with a companion.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas lawmakers have proposed an end to such arrangements.
Rep. Warren Chisum (R-Pampa) and Rep. Robert Talton (R-Pasadena)
have filed separate bills that would bar CPS from designating gays
or lesbians as foster parents. Chisum's legislation also would ban
gays or lesbians from adopting children in CPS custody.
</P>
<P>
   Talton and Chisum say that children are harmed by living in
homes with gays or lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make 18, they can make a choice on whether they want
to approve of that type of lifestyle or not,'' Talton said. ``I
don't think we ought to be teaching them that it's OK at that young
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand today why they're allowing people to be
foster parents when they're openly breaking the law,'' he added,
referring to the state's anti-sodomy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under both bills, CPS would have to remove a child from a foster
home if it uncovered homosexual activity. Roberto's foster mother,
who didn't want her name used because her adoption case is still
pending, said she is horrified at that prospect. She noted that the
boy has already lived in two foster homes and two shelters since he
was taken from his biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always tell him, 'You're going to be here for Christmas,
you're going to be here for your birthday,''' she said. ``He used
to say to us, 'Don't lose me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bills note that children in CPS custody _ many
of whom have physical, mental or emotional problems _ wait an
average of more than three years to be placed in homes and that
excluding gays and lesbians would only exacerbate a shortage of
foster families. They point out that CPS already favors
conventional mother-father families when it chooses foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to CPS, they told us right up front that we'd get
the children that nobody else wanted,'' said Frank's adoptive
father, Scott, who didn't want his last name used, fearing for his
child's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has no rule prohibiting placements with gays and
lesbians. Nor does it keep statistics on how many homosexual foster
and adoptive parents there are in Texas, though caseworkers may
have that knowledge when they place children. A 1998 survey showed
that CPS had placed 70 percent of children in homes headed by
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a CPS worker in Dallas was demoted after removing a
baby boy from the home of a lesbian couple. The worker, Rebecca
Bledsoe, said she felt compelled to remove the child because
homosexual conduct is a misdemeanor in Texas, and she's filed suit
against the agency. CPS officials said they demoted her because she
violated agency rules in abruptly removing the child from the home.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who said he hasn't seen the proposed
legislation, stated this week that ``our agencies ought to work
hard to make sure that adoptions and foster children are placed in
traditional homes _ man and wife.'' He declined to comment on
whether gays and lesbians should be banned from adopting children
or being foster parents, or whether children should be removed from
households headed by homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian activists are planning to send homosexual
parents to visit legislators _ including Chisum and Talton _ to put
a human face on the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to see the faces of the people they're hurting,''
said Dianne Hardy-Garcia of the Austin-based Lesbian and Gay Rights
Lobby of Texas, which is organizing statewide opposition.
</P>
<P>
   There are subtle, but significant, differences between the
Chisum and Talton bills.
</P>
<P>
   Chisum wants CPS to investigate whether ``homosexual conduct is
occurring or is likely to occur'' in a potential foster or adoptive
home. The wording suggests that even if the foster or adoptive
parents aren't homosexual, they could be disqualified by the
presence of a gay or lesbian person in the household.
</P>
<P>
   Under Talton's bill, CPS would try to find out whether potential
or current foster parents are homosexual or bisexual. Homosexuals
and bisexuals applying to be foster parents would be disqualified,
and the agency would take children away from homosexuals and
bisexuals currently serving as foster parents for CPS kids.
</P>
<P>
   Chisum and Talton say their bills wouldn't apply when deceased
biological parents have specified in their wills that a child
should be turned over to a gay relative. But opponents _ and some
legal experts _ contend that vague legislative language might
prompt some judges to block such adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   CPS contracts with some private adoption agencies to find homes
for children in state custody, and the bills would bar private
agencies from placing those kids with gays or lesbians. Otherwise,
the legislation wouldn't affect private adoption agencies, which
have their own policies on placing children in homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chisum denies that there is a shortage of foster and adoptive
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the record is there are a lot of people out there
looking for children,'' he said. ``People in my area go to Bosnia
and Russia to adopt children at great expense to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisum argues that his bill, which is similar to laws passed in
Utah and New Hampshire, is designed to protect children. He points
to a report in the May 1996 issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association which found that gays and lesbians are more
likely to be drug abusers than heterosexuals are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more incidences of sexually transmitted diseases,
more instances of having multiple partners. It's just a more
violent atmosphere we're placing these children in _ predictably
more violent than a regular heterosexual family situation,'' he
said of gay and lesbian homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some research suggests otherwise. Studies are relatively scarce,
according to a 1995 American Psychological Association survey, but
they have found that children raised by gays and lesbians aren't
more likely to be homosexual or ``to be disadvantaged in any
significant respect relative to the children of heterosexual
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it's true that there is no shortage of people wanting
to adopt healthy Anglo babies, few of the roughly 2,000 CPS
children awaiting adoption fit that description.
</P>
<P>
   CPS couldn't provide statistics on the children awaiting
adoption, but less than 30 percent of the children that CPS placed
in adoptive homes in 1997 were Anglo. About 11 percent had
physical, mental or emotional problems, and roughly 42 percent were
older than 5. More than 11 percent of CPS children reach the age of
18 without being adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a problem with this, then you become a foster
parent and you take these kids home,'' said Roberto's foster
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals are the same as any other family: to raise healthy,
happy children with good moral values and who are good people,''
she said.

 &HT;    Sorry, neighbors, but it's time to build the outhouse
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Well, there goes the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, friends, but according to all of my Y2K checklists, I
am falling well behind schedule in preparing for the awful moment
of truth, The Day The Earth Stood Still.
</P>
<P>
   Or, according to some of those on the Internet, it will be the
Year the Earth Stood Still.
</P>
<P>
   So, I have to get a move on. It is vital that I take the first
step toward making sure I will be absolutely prepared and happy
when the Year 2000 dawns.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. It's time to build the outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It is what all of the best Y2K guides absolutely recommend. You
can do without a great many things, but the world will absolutely
go to pot without enough potties to go around.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ben and Margaret, if you don't mind too, too much, I'm going
to build the outhouse in the corner of my yard that faces your
house.
</P>
<P>
   We need to get to know each other better, anyway. All of the Y2K
checklists I have seen tell you to get to know your neighbors
better and to distribute walkie-talkies to the closest neighbors
before the dreaded day.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there is something about the Y2K bug that will make
it impossible for me to walk outside my door and say, ``Hey, Ben.''
Whatever horrible thing it is, walkie-talkies are apparently not
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I have an idea that I'm going to get to know all of my
neighbors a great deal better once the outhouse gets in full
operation. I'll bet that not only Ben and Margaret will show up,
but everyone along the street,
</P>
<P>
   especially those who happen to live on the downhill slope.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the joys of living at the top of the hill. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we'll have a great time when the outhouse gets built.
Don't worry, I won't be a bit stingy. According to the checklist,
up to 12 people can use one outhouse. I've only got six. Heck,
that's six more neighbors who we can get to know even better.
</P>
<P>
   I know you had probably rather I build the outhouse in a
different place, Ben, but just think of it as convenience. I can't
put it over by Jerry, because that is where I'm planning on
installing the 50,000-gallon water tank, or however much water it
takes to last my family for an entire year.
</P>
<P>
   The water has to be near the house, because Y2K, the checklists
say, will naturally bring out the thieving nature in everyone.
People might steal water, but they won't steal an outhouse. See,
you have to think ahead when it comes to survival.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hydroponic garden, which has to grow enough food to
last us for a year will have to cover most of the rest of the front
yard.
</P>
<P>
   And the back yard is where I am going to have to put the
generator to make sure the television set keeps going during the
dark days of Y2K. Not that it will make much difference. Because of
Y2K, no one is going to be able to broadcast. Mind you, an electric
generator is a small thing, but I have to store enough gasoline to
put into the generator to last me for a year.
</P>
<P>
   If it is any consolation, Ben, I'm going to keep the horses in
the corner of the yard closest to Mark's house. Yes, the checklists
say you need horses because it is entirely probable that all cars
will not work on Jan. 1, 2000. Don't worry, I'll never have more
than six of them at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pigs will likely cause a bigger stink, not that
you'll really smell them over the outhouse. I chose pigs because
they are smaller than cows and I want some bacon during the year
that the Earth stands still.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you understand that all of this cannot be done at the
last minute and that we have to get cracking, lest we get bit by
the bug.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens if, well, nothing happens? Hmmm, I dunno, but
it would be a terrible thing for an outhouse to go to waste.

 &HT;    Teletubbies into sex? I doubt it
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Why had I not seen it before? How could I have
ignored the signs?
</P>
<P>
   It all started so innocently. Veronica loved all the
Teletubbies, but seemed drawn to the purple one. Tinky Winky was
the only thing on her Christmas list.
</P>
<P>
   This inspired contempt from her brother, naturally, whose tastes
run to the sophisticated:
</P>
<P>
   ``Veronica loves Stinky Winky! She loves the Smelly-tubbies!''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Tinky Winky _ how he must yearn for the days when the
disrespect of 7-year-olds was the worst he (she? it?) had to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lord have mercy, Jerry Falwell is on his case, ``outing''
Tinky Winky in an article titled Parents Alert: Tinky Winky Comes
Out of the Closet in the February edition of Falwell's National
Liberty Journal.
</P>
<P>
   It's so obvious, now that Falwell has pointed it out. The boy's
voice. The red purse (whom do those producers think they're
fooling, calling it a ``magic bag?''). And then, as the magazine
argues so forcefully, ``Tinky Winky is purple _ the gay pride
color; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle _ the gay pride
symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to face facts: At the age of 3, my daughter is in danger
of becoming a moral degenerate.
</P>
<P>
   Hadn't she played dress-up in my Doc Martens? Hadn't she been
coveting the Swiss Army knife her brother won selling popcorn for
the Cub Scouts? And hadn't I caught her drawing chalk rainbows on
the sidewalk?
</P>
<P>
   What's a mother to do? Joan Garry, executive director of the Gay
&AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, is taking a maternal
interest in Tinky Winky: ``We think it's awfully presumptuous of
Jerry Falwell to attempt to out anyone. Tinky Winky should speak
for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A gay newspaper chain is giving Tinky Winky a chance to ``save''
himself, offering him the opportunity to become an ``ex-gay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the recent ex-gay ads by the extreme right are too
focused on humans, and have left out Teletubbies, cartoon
characters, and action figures in offering salvation,'' opined
William Waybourne, co-founder of Window Media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put Down That Purse,'' the newspaper parody ads _ which
feature a fictional conservative organization _ exhort Tinky Winky.
They're also planning to reach out to other characters, including
Bert and Ernie, Batman and Robin, Peppermint Patty, and Elmer Fudd.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very well for them to make light of this. It's not
their daughter's immortal soul that's in peril.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Falwell said, ``As a Christian I feel
that role modeling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives
of children.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't question Falwell's sincerity, or wonder if, missing the
spotlight, he's pulling a Madonna _ hitting on something so
outrageous it's guaranteed to land him on the front page of every
newspaper in America. (Just a month ago he announced the Antichrist
is a Jewish man who is probably alive today.)
</P>
<P>
   We won't lecture Falwell about what kind of Christian role model
he provides by picking on a defenseless imaginary creature, or by
teaching toddlers to look for ways people are different _ and to
judge them accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, let's challenge Falwell to actually watch the show (a
cruel sentence for any adult, but the stakes here are high). The
Teletubbies spend their time oohing over Tubby toast and babbling
``Eh-oh'' and ``noo-noo'' after they walk through puddles.
</P>
<P>
   They're definitely not into sex. We can only pray that some day
they'll be into complete sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The Teletubbies are, in short, about as erotic as Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Who is, come to think of it, purple.

   Cash-choo health care's catch 22 is contagious
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Minter
</P>
<P>
   c.1999 cox news service
</P>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Twelve years ago when she went to her
doctor for an annual physical, which included a mammogram, test
results indicated cancer of the breast. Although additional tests
ruled out cancer, her doctor told told her to be extra cautious.
She was instructed to make self-examinations daily, and to return
for a mammogram each year.
</P>
<P>
   She has done that for 11 years, driving to visit the same doctor
for an annual physical that always included a mammogram. This year,
her routine physical did not include a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   Although mammograms are performed in the same building, she was
told that hers would have to be scheduled at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, when her calendar cleared, she telephoned to
make the appointment, as her doctor had instructed her to do. She
got his voice mail. She waited more than 10 minutes before getting
through to his appointment secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is your insurance with?'' asked the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   She identified her two insurance carriers, primary and
secondary. Both are large, reputable, nationally known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't accept insurance from those companies,'' the
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that she would be happy to pay cash and file her
own insurance claim.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary told her she couldn't pay cash.
</P>
<P>
   When she insisted on talking to someone else, the secretary put
her through to the radiology department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is your insurance with?'' the radiology person asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not calling about insurance,'' she replied. ``I'm calling
to make an appointment to get a mammogram. I'm perfectly willing to
pay cash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't accept cash,'' the radiology person replied. ``And we
don't accept your insurance. All we can do is refer you to some
other clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked if she could be referred to the Emory Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go anywhere you wish as long as we refer you,'' the
radiology person replied.
</P>
<P>
   She called the Emory Clinic. She explained that her doctor's
clinic no longer accepted her insurance, and would not accept
payment in cash, but had agreed to refer her to Emory. The Emory
person asked three familiar questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is your insurance with?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your Social Security number?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is referring you?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, she answered the first two questions satisfactorily.
Then she gave the Emory person the name of the clinic which had
refused to do her mammogram, and the name of her doctor at the
clinic, who has been her doctor for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not on our list,'' was the reply. ``You can't be referred
by a doctor who is not on our list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on what list?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that has doctor's numbers on it,'' answered the Emory
person. ``You'll have to call your doctor's office and get them to
fax his identification number and a referral to us.''
</P>
<P>
   She called her doctor's office. She got the same person in the
radiology department who had told her to call the Emory Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who told you to call me?'' asked the radiology person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emory Clinic. They have to get my doctor's number and a
referral from him,'' she replied. ``They said I can't just call up
and make an appointment on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   The radiology person said they'd have to see if they could
locate a doctor number.
</P>
<P>
   The last I heard, the lady shopping for a mammogram was still
working the telephone, trying to find somebody to perform a fairly
simple, possibly life-saving test women in her age group are
continuously cautioned to have done, especially if previous tests
identify danger signals.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you have just read is true. Documented. Here we have
a medical clinic that won't accept your insurance, won't accept
your cash, won't accept you. Yet, if you try to go to some other
doctor's office or clinic, you can't get in the door unless your
previous doctor gives written permission and a number that appears
on a list that you don't have, or have access to. It's tempting to
just go ahead and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great technology and wonderful drugs,'' a small-town
doctor friend told me recently. ``Too much emphasis on money is the
culprit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had written a routine prescription that morning for a
common ailment. When his elderly patient went to a drugstore to get
it filled, the bottle of pills cost over $150. The patient didn't
have $150.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me and I got her up some samples,'' my doctor
friend said. ``But I keep running out of samples.''
</P>
<P>
   Our Old Dr. Chambers, who drove his buggy into the night to
treat the sick and comfort the dying, and maybe got paid with a
dozen eggs or a sack of potatoes, would turn over in his grave.

 &HT;    Experts say if you want to heat up your sex life, warm up your
relationship
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you want to have sex with your wife, don't worry so
much about nibbling on her ear.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, take out the trash.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of women and 30 percent of men have little
interest in sex, can't have an orgasm or suffer from physical
problems related to intercourse, according to a new study out this
week.
</P>
<P>
   And many of those problems are not linked to physical causes,
but the result of resentment, disappointment and a lack of
communication and trust among couples, sex experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the saying goes, the most important sex organ is your
mind,'' said Dr. Sujatha Reddy, an obstetrician and gynecologist
with the Emory Clinic. ``And I think, in most cases, bad sex is an
indication of other things being wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex therapists William and Lynda Dykes Talmadge, an Atlanta
couple married for 30 years, say for many patients, the first issue
that has to be fixed is not the sex, but the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not realize how much their relationship outside the
bedroom is connected to their relationship in the bedroom,'' said
William Talmadge, a psychologist. ``If you're not feeling close,
sex by itself is not going to help that and you're going to run
into problems.'' There are four primary ways that people foster
closeness, he said: the ability to talk to one another; sharing
projects and good times; affection, including hand-holding and
touching; and sex.
</P>
<P>
   If those elements are out of balance, things are likely to be
rocky, especially if one partner is feeling ignored. As the
resentment builds, the spouse will tend to back away from the
sexual realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to realize they need to be attentive to the
relationship, to guide it and be as watchful of it as they would
with raising a child,'' said Talmadge. ``This isn't a situation
where you can say, when you have a family, `Well, I'll get back to
it when the kids are out of the house.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true for men, Talmadge said. ``If there was
one thing I would say men do wrong, it's that they don't get that
intimacy leads to sex. That being an involved husband and father is
going to lead to a happier sex life.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing women do wrong is fail to take any responsibility for
the couple's sex life, not initiating sex or even expressing her
desires to her spouse, said Dykes Talmadge, also a psychologist.
Too often, women are ``merely reacting to the sexuality of their
partner,'' she said. ``They don't have a sense of ownership about
their own body.''
</P>
<P>
   And that can lead them to be ``overwhelmed by the sexuality of
the male _ and pushing it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, that reaction is because of the way women are raised.
Many families and religions foster deep prohibitions against sexual
exploration until marriage, she said. But after marriage, some
women are not psychologically ready to make a leap from a
guilt-ridden, forbidden act to an accepted and encouraged part of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Chores also aggravate the situation, with women often taking on
too much and feeling too stretched by other people's demands, Dykes
Talmadge said. ``Everyone has to have enough personal space and I
find women typically don't take enough. You have to take time for
yourself in order to let a sexual life emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Women also tend to be more affected by body image, Dykes
Talmadge said _ a problem that starts in adolescence and ``never
seems to really go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if you love your partner, but really don't know if
you're both good in the sack? ``I've got women in their 20s coming
in all the time, saying they don't even know whether they've had an
orgasm or not,'' Reddy said. ``There's a lot of performance anxiety
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Men also struggle with problems related to the mechanics of sex,
including impotence, erectile dysfunction and premature
ejaculation. Many can be helped either through counseling _ as in
the case of premature ejaculation _ or through impotence
medications such as Viagra, which increases blood flow to the
penis, allowing men to sustain erections.
</P>
<P>
   But Talmadge said he sees several men _ starting at about
midlife _ just slowly give up as their performance wanes. Usually
starting in the 50s, men go through gradual physiological changes
that affect their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes longer for them to get an erection and they may not
feel the need to ejaculate or have an orgasm in every sexual
encounter. But what we see in some cases is men beginning to back
off because they no longer feel they're in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   David Woodsfellow, an Atlanta psychologist specializing in
marital therapy, said many studies have shown that men in their 20s
and 30s tend to report a higher desire for sex than women; but by
the time they reach their 40s and 50s, the tables turn _ with women
wanting sex more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   The dysfunction study, released this week in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, found similar results _ with men over
40 and women in their 20s and 30s reporting the most anxiety and
sexual problems. ``I think it gives us a base for explaining why we
had this enormous response to Viagra,'' said Edward Laumann, the
study's lead author. (Laumann has since disclosed he was a paid
consultant for Pfizer, the maker of Viagra.)
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a problem, partners need to rule out first any
possible physiological causes. If a woman persistently has pain
during intercourse or experiences bleeding, she's going to reach a
point that she's ``dreading sex,'' Reddy said. ``Obviously, that's
not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the signs could indicate a woman has an
underlying illness _ such as endometriosis, fibroids or ovarian
cysts _ that need medical attention. At the very least, problems
like dryness _ common after childbirth or during menopause _ can be
alleviated.
</P>
<P>
   However, libido is often not tied to merely sexual or physical
performance. ``I hear women say all the time, `I have no libido _
my hormones must be out of whack,''' said Reddy. ``But libido is
multifactorial, and hormones are just one part of that. And
probably a minor part, at that.''

 &HT;    Seeing a sex therapist: What to expect
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What should a patient expect from a visit to a sex
therapist? William Talmadge, an Atlanta sex therapist for more than
two decades, said couples should know several things before
entering the waiting room:
</P>
<P>
   _ The therapist should be certified or a member of the American
Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists. He or she
could also be a member of the Society for Sex Therapists and
Researchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The therapist should be interested in doing both individual
and couple interviews. This is important to determine individual
issues and to screen for concerns that may relate to sexual
problems such as depression or a history of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ The therapist should be willing to make a prognosis for the
couple. After about four sessions, Talmadge will hold a
``feedback'' session to tell couples what he thinks are the
problems and what is needed to fix their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   _ The couple should be willing to do ``homework'' assignments
that involve everything from learning how to talk together to how
to touch their own genitals.
</P>
<P>
   _ The couple should expect sessions to cost $110 to $150 apiece
in Atlanta; some insurers pick up at least part of that cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ The therapist should not tell a couple on the first visit
they'll be ``cured'' within 10 to 12 sessions. It might take that
many, but a good therapist would never predict the outcome that
early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's not unusual to feel uncomfortable and nervous about going
to the therapist for the first time.

 &HT;    Obsession for the Lost Ark
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ He wears a hat like Indiana Jones and
he's searching for the Lost Ark.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks secret messages buried in the Bible will lead him to
the Ark of the Covenant and might help save the world.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of faith and fantasy, scientific method and millennial
madness drives Barry Roffman.
</P>
<P>
   He is a science teacher at Santaluces High School in Lantana, an
Orthodox Jew from Hypoluxo and a dreamer from that place in us all
where hope is nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   Roffman, 51, thinks the Bible holds encoded secrets that record
the past and foretell the future. Skeptics abound, but none
distract him. He has found clues, he says, that the end of the age
is near. Be it dedication or obsession, he is driven to find the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   He uses an elaborate computer program to search for God's secret
messages hidden among the words of the Torah, the first five books
of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a precise blueprint for how it is going to
turn out,'' Roffman said. ``And it is as precise as the DNA
encoding is in the blueprint of how a human being is going to turn
out.''
</P>
<P>
   A 105-page report, filled with statistical data he has
generated, supports his claim. And he's looking for money from the
U.S. government or from private sources to test his theory.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Torah knew about the rare annulment of his son's
baptism by the Roman Catholic Church in 1984, Roffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempted by that discovery, he set out to prove his thesis.
</P>
<P>
   He searched the Torah for directions to find the Ark of the
Covenant, lost more than 2,500 years ago. According to the Bible,
the Ark once held Israel's most sacred objects: the two stone
tablets on which God wrote the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in the books of Numbers and Deuteronomy, Roffman found a
latitude and longitude he claims marks the site of the Ark. It is
about three miles off the coast of Egypt, buried in the
Mediterranean Sea. Now he wants to mount an expedition to lay his
hands on the relic.
</P>
<P>
   If he's right, finding the Ark will prove the code's accuracy,
Roffman claims. That could help prevent an atomic holocaust and the
end of the world, which the code suggests may happen near the close
of the Second Millennium in A.D. 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If he's wrong, he's ready to write off 18 months of hard work
and bizarre speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he will continue to use the complex computer program
developed by mathematicians at Hebrew University in Israel to
decipher the secrets of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The method is described in ``The Bible Code'' by Michael
Drosnin, published in 1997. Roffman read the book, bought the
program and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best 80 bucks I ever spent in my life,''
Roffman said. ``I've had a lot of fun with it. If you like
crossword puzzles, this is the ultimate puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   The program searches the 304,805 letters that make up the words
of the Torah. Secret messages are uncovered by joining letters
separated by a uniform number of letters. The spacing between
letters is called the skip.
</P>
<P>
   A word is found, for instance, by combining each eighth or 157th
or 2,004th letter in the Torah, depending on the skip chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Roffman will search for a word, such as ark, within a range of
skips from, say, 3 to 1,500. At times, the word will show up with
several other words in close proximity.
</P>
<P>
   One search brought up the words: Ark, Israel, atomic holocaust,
code will rescue, and Roffman's first and last name.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that if he can find the Ark using the code,
Roffman might help save the world from an atomic blast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The code says it will rescue or save from the atomic
holocaust,'' he said. ``I'm attempting to fulfill that prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Roffman is careful not to teach about the codes in his high
school classes. But he fascinates the youngsters he teaches in a
sixth-grade religious school at Temple Judea in West Palm Beach. He
keeps their attention with tales of the Ark, the code and his
dream, said Rabbi Joel Levine, who gives him the benefit of the
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep an open mind,'' Levine said. ``You have to
give people a chance to prove their theories.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are countless Doubting Thomases who dismiss the idea
that God would write a secret history of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Shaul Magid admits anything is possible but doubts the
code is a valid device to uncover hidden truth in the Bible. And he
denies that the future is written in any book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the codes are valid on any basis,'' said Magid,
who is an associate professor of Jewish philosophy at the
conservative Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. ``My
understanding of the covenant with God is that as human beings we
are free. We create our own future. The notion that there is a code
of the future seems to disempower rather then empower us as a
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A scholar on the international committee working with the texts
of the Dead Sea Scrolls is also wary of the code's validity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you accept that the Bible is a divine work, God could have
placed secret messages in there,'' said Eric Larson, professor of
religious studies at Florida International University in Miami.
``Personally, I don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roffman has mountains of data and wants to test it. His
research began after he discovered what he considered a hidden
awareness in the Torah of his son's baptism.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, who was Roman Catholic, had their child, Robert,
baptized against the father's will. She had promised to raise the
child as a Jew after the parents were divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Roffman appealed to the church, which declared the baptism
invalid, he said, referring to newspaper reports of the unusual
decision. Today, Robert, 21, is studying to become an Orthodox
rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Barry Roffman bought the computer program, he
searched for the baptism and found, ``Catholic annul baptism,
Robert Roffman and the year, 1984,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed, and perhaps obsessed, Roffman began working as much
as eight hours each day after school to plumb the mystery of the
code and find the Ark's location.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be a little crazy and you have to be a little
obsessive to do something like this,'' Roffman said. ``But I think
the word is dedicated. Sometime there is a fine line between
obsession and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the Middle East with sophisticated searching gear
would resolve the question. But Roffman can't fly. The codes hint
he might be killed in an airplane crash. He must sail.
</P>
<P>
   A friend from his days in the Coast Guard is passing his report
around intelligence agencies in Washington in hopes of generating
interest.
</P>
<P>
   But he has run into a catch-22. There is not much chance of
getting government money until there is more evidence the codes are
accurate, said the friend, Nevin Fidler from Citrus Heights, Calif.
But Roffman needs the money to test the accuracy of his work.
</P>
<P>
   He is scientist enough to insist on physical proof, driven
enough to work countless hours on research and wise enough to have
a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Ark is where this says it should be, it proves the
code,'' Roffman said. ``If not, we put it in the category of
fortune cookies and horoscopes.''

 &HT;    Prognosis is good for Clooney and 'ER' after actor's departure
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The romantic glue that holds ``ER'' together is
leaving, but fans of troubled idealist Dr. Doug Ross need not
worry. Pine for him, perhaps, but don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Chicago hospital's door remains open for the
kid-loving doc to pop in for a visit from time to time, and the
actor who plays him has made it clear to the show's producers that
he welcomes that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney is leaving TV to concentrate on his movie career.
Friday's ``ER'' episode (at 9 on NBC) set up next week's swan song,
which finds Doug saving lives after a school bus crash and
wrestling with problems brought on by his decision to administer
medication to a dying boy.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney's departure will be substantial loss to ``ER.'' Doug
Ross started out as a handsome lothario who drove his girlfriend,
nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies), to a failed suicide. He
swaggered through numerous romantic relationships until he realized
his true love for Carol. His rebel doctoring and constant
rule-breaking have kept him in turmoil at work. He has avoided
career crashes, but his ouster next week is practically a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The producers have no plans to replace Clooney, 37, with another
anguished hunk. Instead, the show will focus on existing
characters: put-upon good guy Mark Green (Anthony Edwards),
brilliant but cold-hearted Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle) and
formerly soft-hearted but increasingly steely John Carter (Noah
Wyle).
</P>
<P>
   They're a talented trio of actors and an engaging cast of
characters. Nobody expects ``ER,'' the most popular drama on
television, to collapse after Clooney's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other series actors, Clooney wisely chose to leave
on amicable terms, and that should serve him well in his pursuit of
a bigger film career. He'll need producers willing to take a chance
on him, and fans willing to buys.
</P>
<P>
   So far in his young film career, a breakthrough role has eluded
Clooney. His romantic trifle with Michelle Pfeiffer in ``One Fine
Day'' (1996) got so-so reviews and terrible box office. The taut
crime caper ``Out of Sight'' (1998) was an improvement quality-wise
but only a slight improvement financially. Three movies in '97 were
outright busts: ``The Peacemaker,'' ``From Dusk Till Dawn'' and
``Batman &AMP; Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney has the talent and the leading-man looks to make it in
Hollywood, and he's well-liked in the industry. He's a nice guy who
has paid his dues. He landed a two-minute cameo in ``The Thin Red
Line'' simply because Terrence Malick likes him.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``ER,'' Clooney was in numerous stage productions and
slogged through supporting roles on TV series such as ``The Facts
of Life,'' ``Sunset Beat,'' ``Baby Talk,'' ``Roseanne'' and
``Sisters.'' He received moral support (but not much else) from his
show biz relatives _ aunt Rosemary Clooney, uncle Jose Ferrer and
cousin Miguel Ferrer. His father, Nick Clooney, is a former TV news
anchor who now hosts movie showcases on cable's AMC.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Clooney is a smart businessman. While working on a
new film, ``Three Kings,'' about three Gulf War veterans on an
adventure, he's also developing TV projects. He has two drama
series for CBS that he'll executive produce but not star in, and
one for HBO that he probably will star in. The latter, ``Kilroy,''
is described as a laughtrack-free comedy about an aspiring actor
who lands spots on actual TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' fans will miss their hero, but they should be grateful he
did not choose a lingering, five-hanky death, a la Jimmy Smits, or
an angry march off the set, a la David Caruso (remember him?), both
of whom departed ``NYPD Blue.'' Doug Ross' fans just need some time
to mourn.

 &HT;    Pastor's strong stands meet with controversy
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For 30 years, a bushy-haired former altar boy
has challenged Austin's liberal establishment, lobbing Scripture
like firecrackers on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Harold O'Chester believes the Bible is a factual,
inerrant book from God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a liberal town, he stands for right,'' said his wife,
Barbara. ``There are many people _ even in Austin _ who believe
God's word as it is written.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them gravitate to our church at one time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Hills Baptist Church, formerly Allandale Baptist, is known
for its successes and its struggles. It grew thanks to a vigorous
television ministry, fell into bankruptcy, emerged and now occupies
a huge campus in Northwest Austin that includes a main sanctuary, a
private elementary and high school, and other facilities. Last
weekend, the more than 3,000 members celebrated their pastor's
three decades of service. He preached his first sermon at the
church on Valentine's Day 1969.
</P>
<P>
   How O'Chester got here might come as a surprise to those who
know him as the crusader of conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   As a young Navy man from a devout Roman Catholic family, he
eloped to marry a 16-year-old Southern Baptist. His parents
disowned him over the marriage, and later, an auto wreck killed his
pregnant wife, daughter and only son. In Mississippi, Klansmen
wanted to kill him for crusading to rebuild burned-out black
churches. He came to Austin on the heels of his Klan trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a sense of feeling in my heart that God wanted me
here,'' O'Chester said, adding he turned down offers from larger
churches in big cities. ``I was mad with God, but I thought that I
was doing what was right, and if he wanted me in a two-bit podunk
church, I wasn't going to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   INTO THE THICK OF THINGS
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester wasted no time getting involved in community issues _
fighting against parimutuel betting, late-night drinking hours and
massage parlors. He drew the ire of liberals when he brought singer
Anita Bryant to preach at his church in 1978, the heyday of her
crusade against homosexuality. O'Chester holds firmly that
homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is not near as liberal as it was 30 years ago,''
O'Chester said. ``We had folks trying to bring the Vietnam flag
into our church.''
</P>
<P>
   As liberals attacked and poked fun at O'Chester, his gospel was
bringing in a steady stream of new congregants. O'Chester never
seemed to think twice about throwing a few darts of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, he went after the liberal political satire band
Uranium Savages. In 1978, the band released its first album,
``Trust Us,'' and someone painted the ``Us'' on a building named
Trust at Allandale Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   David Arnsberger, the group's guitar player, was watching
O'Chester on TV one morning when the minister began to blame the
band for the graffiti. ``He starts going on about blasphemers and
acidheads and starts calling us all these names.''
</P>
<P>
   The band demanded an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Arnsberger recounts what happened next: ``So, the very next
Sunday he starts off the show with `You might remember that last
Sunday I said one or more of the Uranium Savages desecrated the
Trust building. I'm glad to say the Uranium Savages have contacted
me to say they didn't do it. However, some savage did.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester's congregants and other area ministers say the
preacher is a fighter, never shying away from controversy and
always standing his ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his own admission, he is not only fiery from the pulpit but
has a strong personality and strong opinions,'' said Kyle Miller,
who last year headed the church's board of deacons. ``He sometimes
gets too intense about things and has to apologize when he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Larry Bethune, pastor of University Baptist Church,
said he respects O'Chester, even though they are on opposite ends
of the theological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Christian person of integrity who tries to live out his
beliefs,'' said Bethune, whose church openly welcomes homosexuals.
``He certainly has been an example of how to endure controversy and
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gerald Mann, pastor of Riverbend Church, said he is
often singled out by O'Chester for teaching ``erroneous theology.''
Mann says O'Chester considers Riverbend ``the church of the big
easy.'' Mann, a moderate Southern Baptist, prefers to call his
approach ``realist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been quite critical of me on television and with the news
media for years, and I've always tried as best I could to ignore
that,'' said Mann, whose church has more than 4,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said it's good for a community to have a wide variety of
ministers from different theological perspectives to meet people's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Chester has reached some people I could never reach, and I
think God's used him to reach a certain kind of people,'' Mann
said. ``I congratulate him on 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   EARLY CHALLENGES
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester said to understand him, open the Bible to Isaiah
40:31. ``But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
strength: they shall mount up the wings as eagles; they shall run
and not be weary; and they shall walk and not be faint,'' the verse
reads. His office is adorned with more than 160 eagle figurines,
paintings and other depictions. O'Chester, 71, was born in
Brooklyn, N.Y., but spent most of his childhood on Long Island.
When he was a teen-ager, his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla. He
entered the Navy at the end of World War II, becoming that military
branch's equivalent of a medic, and was stationed near
Jacksonville. ``I was a typical Navy guy,'' O'Chester said. ``I
smoked and I drank.''
</P>
<P>
   A pretty teen-ager named June Irwin encouraged O'Chester to
worship with her family at their Southern Baptist Church. At first,
he hesitated. This was the late 1940s, when the Roman Catholic
Church considered itself the only church that offered salvation.
Fraternizing with Protestants was discouraged. Going to church with
them was practically a sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When June invited me to church, my first reaction was, `I'm
not allowed to,''' O'Chester recalled. ``But when you're 19 and
your hormones are raging, you break the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, they eloped, and O'Chester's mother was so upset
she tried to commit suicide, swallowing 96 aspirins. When O'Chester
found her, she said: ``I would rather be dead than have you
disgrace the family this way. We have nuns in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   On a doctor's advice, O'Chester gave his mother powdered mustard
to induce vomiting and walked her, slapping her to keep her awake.
By the time his father saw her, her face was swollen and bruised
from the slapping and her mouth was raw and bleeding from the
powdered mustard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy came in with a gun and said, `Mr. Baptist, I'm going
to kill you for beating your mother.''' Instead of pulling the
trigger, his father hit him with the butt of the gun, and O'Chester
fled.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to check on his parents a couple weeks later, their
rental house was empty. There was no forwarding address.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING HIS CALLING
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester credits June's mother, Pauline, a conservative
Southern Baptist, for leading him to Jesus. ``That lady was more
responsible for me trusting Christ than anyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He became a faithful Southern Baptist, attending church and
Bible study. God seemed to be gnawing at him, urging him to preach,
O'Chester said.
</P>
<P>
   He received his undergraduate degree from Mississippi College in
1954 and went on for his master's of divinity at New Orleans
Baptist Theological Seminary. During his first year at the
seminary, he and June, along with 6-year-old daughter Joy and
4-year-old son Harold Jr., were driving to a Baptist church to
participate in a Thanksgiving eve service. June was six months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The church was 100 miles away, and the kids were fighting.
O'Chester moved Harold Jr. to the front seat. The toddler laid his
head in his dad's lap. Joy lay down in the back seat, her head
against the passenger-side door.
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester turned the steering wheel as he entered a large curve.
Suddenly, the steering wheel spun in a complete circle. The car
went out of control, crossing the median and moving into the path
of a semitrailer hauling 42,000 pounds of produce. The truck
broadsided the car's passenger side. June screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all killed instantly,'' O'Chester said. He was on
the side of the road with a skull fracture, broken ribs, a split
sternum and internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, O'Chester was taken by ambulance to the
funeral. When he got there, his parents were waiting. It was the
beginning of their reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The police told O'Chester the new car he was driving was known
to have a steering defect. The steering pin, which police found,
had popped out before the curve.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning to lawyers, O'Chester found solace in his
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``God either allows it or he orders it,'' O'Chester said. ``If
he orders it, he has a purpose. I had a choice to either rebel
against God or rest in his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   RECOVERY
</P>
<P>
   Four months after the accident, O'Chester remained bent over
from his injuries. While passing an outdoor basketball court at the
seminary, he was taken by a young woman shooting hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just letting off a little steam out there that day,''
recalled Barbara Hostetter O'Chester, who was studying music at the
seminary.
</P>
<P>
   They went for coffee. Two years later, O'Chester, 28, and
Barbara, 21, were married, and they would go on to raise three
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years, O'Chester pastored at churches in Mississippi. In
the 1960s, he did something that bucked the convictions of other
preachers in his own denomination: He took a stand for blacks and
Jews, preaching that it was not Christian to violently attack
anyone on account of race or religion.
</P>
<P>
   Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers of the White Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan ruled in Mississippi. Blacks and Jews were killed, black
churches were burned, and synagogues were blown up.
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester appealed to his congregation at Poplar Springs Baptist
Church in Meridian. ``In effect, I simply told them I couldn't live
in a community where this kind of injustice occurred.'' Much to his
surprise, the congregation gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   From there, O'Chester organized an ecumenical committee
dedicated to rebuilding the burned black churches.
</P>
<P>
   The attention put the O'Chester family on the Klan's hit list.
After a bullet whizzed through their home's picture window, the
family was forced to sleep together in the den, in the back of the
house, for nearly three months. In 1968, an FBI informant told
authorities that the Klan was planning to kill O'Chester, a local
black pastor or the president of a local synagogue. Only weeks
earlier, the synagogue had been bombed.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI staked out the homes of all three targets, and opened
fire on Klan members as they approached the synagogue president's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, O'Chester pulls out a letter of thanks from
the Meridian Chamber of Commerce. As he begins to read it aloud _
``You made us stand tall and very few men have that talent'' _ he
is overcome with emotion. ``I can't read this,'' he says, tears
welling up in his eyes and his voice cracking. ``You preach all
your life and you wonder if you ever reach somebody and make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   TO AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Allandale Baptist Church was looking for a new
preacher. Felix Dailey was chairman of the pulpit committee to
select a new pastor and recalls that a former church member
recommended O'Chester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold had taken a real tough stand in Mississippi during the
burning of the churches ... we were impressed with his stand, and
his preaching of the gospel and not wavering on certain moral
issues,'' Dailey said. The committee called O'Chester to be pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, church membership grew like Texas
wildflowers in spring. To attract new members, the church paid to
televise its Sunday morning service on KVUE, the local ABC-TV
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   That brought more members. To accommodate the growth, Allandale
began to plan a massive expansion _ nine new buildings. Neighbors
were furious.
</P>
<P>
   From the pulpit, O'Chester called Allandale neighbors opposing
the expansion ``anti-God, anti-church,'' and vowed to spend
millions to fight the neighborhood ``because you can't mess with
God.'' He later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Allandale resident Allan McMurtry said he met O'Chester during
that two-year battle, which ultimately resulted in some neighbors
suing the church over deed restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to be on a TV program together, and he walked
in and saw me and walked out, and that's the only time I ever met
him,'' McMurtry said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was settled out of court, and the church decided to buy
land on Jollyville Road. The building of a 3,600-seat sanctuary
would lead O'Chester to the lowest point of his career. ``I was
dumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A risky financing deal backfired when Austin went bust in the
late 1980s. The church lost more than 400 members. The steel
girders of its magnificent sanctuary stood as the skeleton of a
dream while church members crammed into a smaller atrium for
services.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1992, the church filed for bankruptcy protection.
Under a reorganization plan, it emerged from bankruptcy in August
1996.
</P>
<P>
   It finished the sanctuary and an educational building. Today, it
is on solid financial ground, O'Chester said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was going so right until eight months ago, when one
of the church's youth ministers was accused of sexual misconduct
with a minor boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth ministry dropped 30 percent,'' O'Chester said. ``We
had people pulling their children out of our day care. He never had
anything to do with the day care center.''
</P>
<P>
   The youth minister is on leave with pay pending the outcome of
the case. ``It was the only thing a Christian church could do,''
O'Chester said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, O'Chester is contemplating retirement as pastor. He
doesn't know when, but it won't be long. But one thing O'Chester
never wants to retire from, he said, is preaching.

 &HT;    Shelve the shelf idea without better plans
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of the time inexperienced woodworkers can get
good advice through rec.woodworking on the Internet; occasionally,
however, they might be led astray.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a man in New Orleans posted a whole series of
questions about a bookcase he was building. His original query, the
responses, and a follow-up query would take more space than I've
got for three columns, so I'll just paraphrase most of it.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it was evident from his query that he had
virtually no experience. He was also seriously undertooled; as he
put it, ``circular saw, drill, sander, etc.'' With this he was
building a bookshelf of pine eight feet high, four feet wide and a
foot deep. He was attaching moulding of some other wood _ he didn't
say what _ to the edges.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a sheet of pine plywood for a back, and reported he
was ``discouraged'' by its rough surface. He wanted to stain the
whole thing, not paint it, and couldn't figure out how to bring all
the different wood to more or less the same color.
</P>
<P>
   He got a lot of replies. He was told by some folks that he
didn't need a back at all; others suggested all kinds of things,
such as a back made up of tongue-and-grooved boards. He liked that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of half a dozen replies recognized, at least partially,
that this poor fellow is going down that lonesome road that
discourages so many woodworkers who launch into a project without
knowing what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest problem is that his bookshelf is too big. Standard
1x12 stock cannot span four feet without sagging even under light
loads. With pine of those dimensions, two feet is pretty much the
maximum. On top of that, if he goes ahead and builds this thing the
way he plans, he won't be able to lift it.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the back, none of his advisors seemed to notice that
he didn't say how he intended to join the shelves to the uprights.
With the tools he describes _ not even a router _ one shudders to
think. The only way I would join backless solid wood bookshelves
would be with sliding dovetails. The problem with dado joints is
that they do not have proper glue surfaces; they are secure only in
plywood construction.
</P>
<P>
   Now this poor fellow wants to discard his plywood back and make
a back of separate boards, grooved at the joints to resemble
paneling. He hasn't the tools to do this properly, and he hasn't
stopped to think how much this walrus he's building is going to
weigh.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, I suspect, has he stopped to think just what it's going to
look like.
</P>
<P>
   Picture it: Pine shelves, some kind of fancy moulding on all the
edges and a paneled back. I didn't check to see what advice he got
on finishing the thing. My best advice would be to paint it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it isn't going to be around long. If he doesn't put a
back on it, it will probably fall apart. If he does put the back he
intends on it, it will take him and all the guys from the fire
station to put it in place. If he does get it in place and puts
books on it, the shelves will be described as a graceful arc in
short order.
</P>
<P>
   I know just how he's going to feel. Been there, done that,
several times.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Texans know how Boston schools
officials felt when a federal appeals court ruled that a race-based
admissions policy at America's oldest public secondary school was
unconstitutional. A lot of people in Louisiana, Mississippi and
California also understand the bind many Boston citizens found
themselves in after the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 19
against Boston Latin School's affirmative action program. Boston
school officials should have appealed the federal appeals court
ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. They nearly did. Unfortunately,
they were talked out of it. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Well, there goes the

It's time to build the outhouse. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger)

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Here we have a medical
clinic that won't accept your insurance, won't accept your cash,
won't accept you. Yet, if you try to go to some other doctor's
office or clinic, you can't get in the door unless your previous
doctor gives written permission and a number that appears on a list
that you don't have, or have access to. It's tempting to just go
ahead and die. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ At the age of 3, my daughter is

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Grade-schoolers who memorize
``trapezoid'' and ``parallelogram'' will around and treat ``there''

Assessment of Academic Skills. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED

   GUNS _ The Atlanta mayor is suing gun manufacturers. A major gun
show is in town. And Atlantans continue to shoot each other. We
look at the gun as a value issue. Last year the Presbyterian Church
(USA) took the lead among churches by calling on members of the
denomination to rid their homes of hand guns and assault weapons.
The result was a ton of mail from angry _ and armed _
Presbyterians. We attempt to talk to people who are religious but
who oppose any kind of gun control or registration, to religious
people who own guns, and to people whose lives have been shattered
by guns. We also look at the gun as an American symbol. (GWhite,
Atlanta Journall-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Well, now, wasn't that fun! We got to talk dirty
in public for more than a year. We learned the names of lots of

more dangerous to be a friend of Bill or a friend of Linda. And it
all ended just about where it began. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ I was out of my mind to even think we ever

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Four days a week, Joel Klein, the
Justice Department's antitrust chief, walks over to the federal
courtroom where the Microsoft trial has unfolded for the past 16
weeks. There Klein sits on a wooden bench, watching David Boies,
his top gun, pick Microsoft's defenses apart. Microsoft has made
Boies' task easier by concocting a legal strategy that has
occasionally left the judge shaking his head in disbelief at what
he has heard. (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in

   SEX-PROBLEMS _ If you want to have sex with your wife, don't
worry so much about nibbling her ear. Instead, take out the trash.
Therapists say they are not surprised by a study that found 40
percent of women and 30 percent of men have sexual problems. We
talk to husband and wife sex therapists Bill and Lynda Talmadge and
other therapists about ways to avoid the widespread unhappiness and

sex problems start far from the bedroom, with the seeds of
resentment, disappointment and a lack of communication. (Lore,

multi-billion dollar industries _ TV, movies, sports, the Internet,
Hollywood, video games, theme parks, casinos _ built on amusing us

   WWII-MERCHANTMARINE _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ It was the middle of the
night of April 8, 1942 when a gigantic explosion shook this port
town and lit up the black Atlantic sky like the Fourth of July.
John Henderson, then 11 and now a physician, remembers it well. A
German submarine had just torpedoed the USS Oklahoma, killing 22
men. All of the bodies were identified, except four that were
burned beyond recognition. Now, a Brunswick group made up of former
Merchant Marine sailors has finally identified the four, and is
raising money for a bigger monument to mark their common grave.
Rep. Jack Kingston is trying to have the four awarded the
Distinguished Service Medal, and helping the Brunswick group track
down relatives of the long-dead sailors. It's a little known fact
about World War II that the Merchant Marine suffered more
casualties, per capita, than any other branch of service. It's
little known for a reason - Washington didn't want the public to
know that 10 times the number of ships sunk at Pearl Harbor went
down within sight of East Coast cities - several near Brunswick.
We'll tell the story of these men, what happened to them, talk to
people who remember hearing the explosion, and others, to Merchant
Marine vets who are now demanding their due. Illustrate with photo
of a small marker, headlines from the Brunswick papers, photos of
the site where this ship went down, etc. Hopefully we will have
mugs of the four men, now that they have been identified. And we'll
try to talk to members of their families who were simply told their
loved ones had been lost at sea. (Hendrick, Atlanta

last long. Within two years, he was the joke of Music Row as radio
programmers and label execs turned their back on him. As he watched
his records (and his manager) die, Cyrus also soared into
depression, retreated into his teepee on his farm, and did some
soul searching. This year, he emerged from the isolation with a
comeback hit (``Busy Man''), a new haircut, and newfound respect
within the industry. (MLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

took a job in Mississippi and had his house in a hailstorm of

world in 1991 when he broke out of Eastern Kentucky obscurity with
the monster novelty hit, ``Achy Breaky Heart.'' But the ride didn't
last long. Within two years, he was the joke of Music Row as radio
programmers and label execs turned their back on him. As he watched
his records (and his manager) die, Cyrus also soared into
depression, retreated into his teepee on his farm, and did some
soul searching. This year, he emerged from the isolation with a
comeback hit (``Busy Man''), a new haircut, and newfound respect
within the industry. (MLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

   OCHESTER-PREACHER _ For 30 years, the Rev. Harold O'Chester has
been a conservative preacher in a liberal town. His church, Great
Hills Baptist Church, formerly Allendale Baptist, is well known in
the city for its enormous expansion, bankruptcy, and television
ministry. But few people know O'Chester's life story - the young
navy man from a devout
</P>
<P>
   Catholic family who eloped with a 16-year-old Southern Baptist.
His mother tried to commit suicide and his father wanted to shoot
him. His wife, six months pregnant with their third child, and his
two children were killed in an auto wreck. O'Chester married again
took a job in Mississippi and had his house in a hailstorm of
gunfire when the Klan targeted him for death after he started to
raise money for burned ``Negro'' churches. He came to Austin on the
heels of his Klan trouble. Now, at 71, the church is hosting a
blow-out celebration for his 30th anniversary with a huge banquet
Friday at Palmer auditorium, golf tournament Saturday and special
Sunday celebration. (Perkes, Austin American-Statesman). MOVED FOR

   HARRINGTON _ The folksy presence of the Rev. Frank Harrington
furnished a comforting presence to the members of Peachtree
Presbyterian Church for years. But Harrington, the church's pastor,
is now critically ill, leaving a void in the leadership of
Georgia's largest presbyterian church. Members are concerned for
their spiritual leader, but say his illness is pulling them
together. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY

shaped like Walt Disney characters _ ones 10 feet tall and stuff
with thousands of dyed carnations and moss. Seventeen of them to be
exact. The guys, in a rare appearance from Epcot, are expected to
be the hottest attraction at this year's Southeastern Flower Show,
which opens Wednesday. We'll take readers behind the scenes as well

cancer and heart disease. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Texans know how Boston schools
officials felt when a federal appeals court ruled that a race-based
admissions policy at America's oldest public secondary school was
unconstitutional. A lot of people in Louisiana, Mississippi and
California also understand the bind many Boston citizens found
themselves in after the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 19
against Boston Latin School's affirmative action program. Boston
school officials should have appealed the federal appeals court
ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. They nearly did. Unfortunately,
they were talked out of it. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Well, there goes the

It's time to build the outhouse. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger)

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Here we have a medical
clinic that won't accept your insurance, won't accept your cash,
won't accept you. Yet, if you try to go to some other doctor's
office or clinic, you can't get in the door unless your previous
doctor gives written permission and a number that appears on a list
that you don't have, or have access to. It's tempting to just go

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ At the age of 3, my daughter is
in danger of becoming a moral degenerate. Why had I not seen it
before? How could I have ignored the signs? Veronica loved all the
Teletubbies, but seemed drawn to the purple one, Tinky Winky. Now,
Jerry Falwell is on his case, ``outing'' Tinky Winky. (McCarty,

<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Grade-schoolers who memorize
``trapezoid'' and ``parallelogram'' will around and treat ``there''
and ``their'' as the same words, ``are'' and ``our'' as
interchangeable. And guess what? A contributing factor is the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
THURSDAY FOR SATURDAY

<P>
   GUNS _ The Atlanta mayor is suing gun manufacturers. A major gun
show is in town. And Atlantans continue to shoot each other. We
look at the gun as a value issue. Last year the Presbyterian Church
(USA) took the lead among churches by calling on members of the
denomination to rid their homes of hand guns and assault weapons.
The result was a ton of mail from angry _ and armed _
Presbyterians. We attempt to talk to people who are religious but
who oppose any kind of gun control or registration, to religious
people who own guns, and to people whose lives have been shattered
by guns. We also look at the gun as an American symbol. (GWhite,

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Well, now, wasn't that fun! We got to talk dirty

his top gun, pick Microsoft's defenses apart. Microsoft has made

   PUBLIC-HOUSING (Dallas) _ The homeowners foresaw ruin. They
feared cultural clashes and crime, juvenile gangs and graffiti,
drugs and litter, and above all they imagined collapsing property
values in one of the state's hottest real estate markets _ north
Dallas. A controversial public housing project was born in
litigation but has grown in an atmosphere of community cooperation
that has surprised even its most optimistic advocates. By JIM
HENDERSON.

   CALIF-IMPEACH (Sacremanto, Calif.) _ The U.S. Senate may be
finishing with President Clinton, but it ain't over. California
voters can expect the year-long scandal to play through the 2000
election, with Democrats here already betting that voter disgust
with Congress could again revitalize their party and send the state
GOP into an even deeper coma. By ROBERT SALLDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GAY-MARRIAGE (San Francisco) _ The Rev. Don Fado is surprised to

By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.

<P>
   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Houston) _ Sometimes, even the most
experienced computer users get themselves into a seemingly
inescapable jam. Something happens that's near-catastrophic, and
all the tricks you know don't seem to work. If you're lucky, this
happens on your own computer. If you're not, it happens on a

Department of Agriculture, it was the second-largest harvest on
record, thanks in part to the fact that more acres were being

</P>

   SF-VALENTINE (San Francisco) _ Think little cable cars climbing
halfway to the stars. Think morning fog that fills the air. Now

   GAY-BARNEY (San Francisco) _ Beneath that ``I love you, you love

little slap and tickle and watches Lou Dobbs on ``Moneyline.'' And
now this: Because he's purple, he's gay. Like Tinky Winky from the
``Teletubbies.'' It has to be because Jerry Falwell said so. By TIM
GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BLAST (Undated) _ Brendan Fraser has that
fish-out-of-water bit nailed. So it's no surprise that in ``Blast
from the Past,'' from director Hugh Wilson, Fraser again plays a
guy who's lovably unaware _ this time as a young dude who's been
holed up in a fallout shelter since 1962 _ in ``Blast from the
Past.'' By AMY BIANCOLLI.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Mr. President, now you can

   MOSCOW _ The math is not difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In economically battered Russia, American companies are selling
to a market that has much less money to spend after the ruble fell
75 percent in value in the past six months and inflation soared to
near 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Here's are some snapshots of the Russian economy:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The economy shrank about 5 percent in 1998 and a forecast by
the International Monetary Fund says it could contract another 8
percent or more this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Only 50 percent of non-military Russian adults are employed,
and only one in four of those who are employed are being paid on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Before the crisis, the average Russian was about one-tenth as
prosperous as the average American, when salaries, prices and
economic conditions in the two countries were calculated and
compared. The average Russian income has fallen about 40 percent
over the past six months and at the current exchange rate hovers at
about US$50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nearly three out of every four Russians now grow some or all
of their own food in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One in every three Russians lives in poverty, according to the
government statistics office. The parliament contends that the
figure may be closer to half of all Russians below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most Russians say they are unwilling to leave their current
jobs even if they are not being paid on a regular basis because
most believe that it would be difficult if not impossible to find
an equivalent position quickly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A vast majority of Russians acknowledge that if unemployed
they would not receive assistance from the government. Two out of
three unemployed Russians today have never received any benefits.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the six months since Russia's economy crashed,
McDonald's has opened seven new restaurants, British American
Tobacco has launched an aggressive bid for a bigger share of the
cigarette market and the founder of America's Lenscrafters has
announced a $50 million plan to open 60 optical retail stores in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic crisis -- what crisis?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Russians are suffering under the woeful economy.
American businesses here are wary.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow is not a commercial ghost town many predicted it
would become when the crisis hit last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Most firms have greatly scaled back their expectations for
profits in a country whose prognosis is uncertain at best. But
relatively few American and multinational companies have bailed out
since the financial collapse last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still at it, we're just not making as much money as we
were,'' said Preston Haskell, a Jacksonville, Fla., native who
heads HIB, a property-management company based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Many brokerage and financial-services firms disappeared almost
overnight after the Moscow stock market crashed. The world's best
performing market in 1997 became the world's worst performing in
1998, losing more than 95 percent of its value in U.S. dollar
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, retail sales also were hard hit. The economic
breakdown put hundreds of thousands of Russians out of work. The
ruble fell in value as prices soared, making imported brands less
affordable for the majority of Russia's 146 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers began turning to cheaper Russian brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies that were here looking to make a quick killing
by moving their goods from the West into Russia basically are now
gone. There is no quick killing to be made here anymore,'' said
Colin Mills, managing director of the Moscow office of BBDO, the
worldwide advertising giant.
</P>
<P>
   But most companies have attempted to salvage some sort of
presence in Russia. In the retail products and services sectors,
they pared their workforce and cut salaries, slashing expenses to
compensate for sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   In November and December, there was a steady exodus of
expatriates as many multinational companies sent home their
American and European executives, replacing them with Russian
managers whose salaries and benefits cost less.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 companies surveyed for the American Chamber of
Commerce in Russia said they have significantly reduced their
advertising budgets. More than one-third have reduced the brand
names they offer on Russian shelves and nearly all have shifted
their emphasis to less expensive product lines to compete with
Russian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the hundreds of millions of dollars that multinational
companies have invested in this market, it would take a lot for it
to all go wrong and force them to completely walk away from
Russia,'' said Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's sales have declined by one-third since the August
devaluation. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal said
Coca-Cola's network of bottling plants in Russia -- 12 built since
1994 at a cost of $750 million -- expects to operate at only 50
percent capacity this year. A spokesman in the company's Moscow
office declined to confirm the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's will open its 46th restaurant in Russia on Feb. 18
(one of 13 to open this year, though the expansion has reportedly
been scaled back from previous plans for 20 new restaurants).
</P>
<P>
   Russia's crisis took a harder toll on smaller companies and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee-native Nicholas Pilugin almost lost it all. In 1994
the former journalist with his wife Kathy started offering
document-translation and desktop publishing services.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their clients were international corporations who simply
stopped calling when the economy began its tumble last May, as they
began to pare spending. Adding insult to near-bankruptcy, the
crisis peaked with the devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17,
Pilugin's 43rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The assets of his business, Wordsmiths Communications, were
frozen in Russian banks. Pilugin could not pay his bills or be paid
by many of his clients. Atop it all, he split with his Russian
partner, who left with clients and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty gloomy time,'' recalled Pilugin. ``At the end
of September I sat down to do the numbers and actually thought
about just liquidating the business and going back to the States.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pilugin stuck around and rebounded. He snagged a year-long
World Bank contract in late October, followed by a U.S.
government-sponsored project this year. His staff of six has
swollen to 30 and, for the time being, the business is insulated
from another slide in the Russian economy while still digging its
way out of the red.
</P>
<P>
   Economic conditions are better in Moscow and St. Petersburg than
the rest of Russia, where people were generally poorer before the
crisis hit.
</P>
<P>
   For multinational businesses, surviving in Russia has depended
greatly on maintaining shaky lines of distribution and producing
locally. Companies that had established local factories, rather
than importing their goods, have tended to fare better.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss-based Nestle announced plans to pump $30 million into its

   MOSCOW _ The math is not difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In economically battered Russia, American companies are selling
to a market that has much less money to spend after the ruble fell
75 percent in value in the past six months and inflation soared to
near 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Here's are some snapshots of the Russian economy:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The economy shrank about 5 percent in 1998 and a forecast by
the International Monetary Fund says it could contract another 8
percent or more this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Only 50 percent of non-military Russian adults are employed,
and only one in four of those who are employed are being paid on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Before the crisis, the average Russian was about one-tenth as
prosperous as the average American, when salaries, prices and
economic conditions in the two countries were calculated and
compared. The average Russian income has fallen about 40 percent
over the past six months and at the current exchange rate hovers at
about US$50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nearly three out of every four Russians now grow some or all
of their own food in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One in every three Russians lives in poverty, according to the
government statistics office. The parliament contends that the
figure may be closer to half of all Russians below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most Russians say they are unwilling to leave their current
jobs even if they are not being paid on a regular basis because
most believe that it would be difficult if not impossible to find
an equivalent position quickly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A vast majority of Russians acknowledge that if unemployed
they would not receive assistance from the government. Two out of
three unemployed Russians today have never received any benefits.
</P>

   MOSCOW _ In the six months since Russia's economy crashed,
McDonald's has opened seven new restaurants, British American
Tobacco has launched an aggressive bid for a bigger share of the
cigarette market and the founder of America's Lenscrafters has
announced a $50 million plan to open 60 optical retail stores in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic crisis -- what crisis?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Russians are suffering under the woeful economy.
American businesses here are wary.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow is not a commercial ghost town many predicted it
would become when the crisis hit last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Most firms have greatly scaled back their expectations for
profits in a country whose prognosis is uncertain at best. But
relatively few American and multinational companies have bailed out
since the financial collapse last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still at it, we're just not making as much money as we
were,'' said Preston Haskell, a Jacksonville, Fla., native who
heads HIB, a property-management company based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Many brokerage and financial-services firms disappeared almost
overnight after the Moscow stock market crashed. The world's best
performing market in 1997 became the world's worst performing in
1998, losing more than 95 percent of its value in U.S. dollar
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, retail sales also were hard hit. The economic
breakdown put hundreds of thousands of Russians out of work. The
ruble fell in value as prices soared, making imported brands less
affordable for the majority of Russia's 146 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers began turning to cheaper Russian brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies that were here looking to make a quick killing
by moving their goods from the West into Russia basically are now
gone. There is no quick killing to be made here anymore,'' said
Colin Mills, managing director of the Moscow office of BBDO, the
worldwide advertising giant.
</P>
<P>
   But most companies have attempted to salvage some sort of
presence in Russia. In the retail products and services sectors,
they pared their workforce and cut salaries, slashing expenses to
compensate for sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   In November and December, there was a steady exodus of
expatriates as many multinational companies sent home their
American and European executives, replacing them with Russian
managers whose salaries and benefits cost less.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 companies surveyed for the American Chamber of
Commerce in Russia said they have significantly reduced their
advertising budgets. More than one-third have reduced the brand
names they offer on Russian shelves and nearly all have shifted
their emphasis to less expensive product lines to compete with
Russian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the hundreds of millions of dollars that multinational
companies have invested in this market, it would take a lot for it
to all go wrong and force them to completely walk away from
Russia,'' said Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's sales have declined by one-third since the August
devaluation. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal said
Coca-Cola's network of bottling plants in Russia -- 12 built since
1994 at a cost of $750 million -- expects to operate at only 50
percent capacity this year. A spokesman in the company's Moscow
office declined to confirm the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's will open its 46th restaurant in Russia on Feb. 18
(one of 13 to open this year, though the expansion has reportedly
been scaled back from previous plans for 20 new restaurants).
</P>
<P>
   Russia's crisis took a harder toll on smaller companies and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee-native Nicholas Pilugin almost lost it all. In 1994
the former journalist with his wife Kathy started offering
document-translation and desktop publishing services.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their clients were international corporations who simply
stopped calling when the economy began its tumble last May, as they
began to pare spending. Adding insult to near-bankruptcy, the
crisis peaked with the devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17,
Pilugin's 43rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The assets of his business, Wordsmiths Communications, were
frozen in Russian banks. Pilugin could not pay his bills or be paid
by many of his clients. Atop it all, he split with his Russian
partner, who left with clients and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty gloomy time,'' recalled Pilugin. ``At the end
of September I sat down to do the numbers and actually thought
about just liquidating the business and going back to the States.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pilugin stuck around and rebounded. He snagged a year-long
World Bank contract in late October, followed by a U.S.
government-sponsored project this year. His staff of six has
swollen to 30 and, for the time being, the business is insulated
from another slide in the Russian economy while still digging its
way out of the red.
</P>
<P>
   Economic conditions are better in Moscow and St. Petersburg than
the rest of Russia, where people were generally poorer before the
crisis hit.
</P>
<P>
   For multinational businesses, surviving in Russia has depended
greatly on maintaining shaky lines of distribution and producing
locally. Companies that had established local factories, rather
than importing their goods, have tended to fare better.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss-based Nestle announced plans to pump $30 million into its
six Russian factories this year, taking advantage of the depressed
ruble to upgrade its production facilities and secure its market
share.
</P>
<P>
   But the multinational food producer Del Monte is reportedly
leaving, unable to compete with a lower-priced Russian brands.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO, the advertising company, has lost few clients. But the
amount of money they are willing to spend on advertising has fallen
dramatically, setting back the company's Russia operations to
pre-boom times of mid-1996 and forcing it to pare its staff by

anyone thinks that is going to happen soon,'' Mills said.

LIFE DOWN UNDER IS A REAL BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser has that fish-out-of-water bit nailed.
</P>
<P>
   No one's better at being out of touch: from the innocent hominid
of ``Encino Man'' to the feral muffin of ``George of the Jungle,''
Fraser's forte is the guilelessly adorable man-child.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that in ``Blast from the Past,'' a very
funny odd duck from director Hugh Wilson (``The First Wives
Club''), Fraser again plays a guy who's lovably unaware. This time
around he's Adam Webber, a young dude who's been holed up in a
fallout shelter since 1962 _ when his parents (Christopher Walken
and Sissy Spacek) decided that the Cuban missile crisis was about
to plunge creation into a nuclear holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, creation did not plunge into a nuclear
holocaust, but the Webbers did not have the benefit of C-SPAN. So
young Adam (played, early on, by a triumvirate of child actors)
gallivanted about the spacious confines of his subterranean burrow,
boxing with dad, dancing with mom, learning French and Latin and
perfect table manners, until lo and behold, sometime after his
first few decades, he grew up into Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward: the present. Adam's getting a leetle beet antsy.
``I wish that I could meet a girl,'' he says to his dad, who sadly
replies: ``One that doesn't glow in the dark, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad Webber, played by Walken with an outlandish, loping wit, is
a rabid apocalyptic whose hesitant foray above ground _ where he
meets a cross-dressing hooker and other assorted riffraff _ only
confirms his belief that radiation has all but obliterated Life as
They Know It. (``People throw up in the streets! People point
guns!'')
</P>
<P>
   But when Dad falls ill, the stout-hearted Adam must leave his
hole to purchase supplies (frozen beef, pipe tobacco, yacht
batteries) for another 30-odd years of tunnel living. He ventures
forth into the world.
</P>
<P>
   The world, he quickly learns, consists of bumpy bus rides and
scruffy young men with spiked hair. (``Do you have a gun?'' he asks
one such young man, who nods assent. ``Well, thank you for not
waving it around _ and for not vomiting.'') It also consists of
Alicia Silverstone, which is nice for Adam, since she just happens
to be playing a young woman named Eve.
</P>
<P>
   You can guess what happens next: Eve teaches Adams the ways of
modern society, or tries to. Adam, all bug-eyed enthusiasm, falls
for Eve. Eve resists. Eve's riposte-equipped gay friend (a
beautifully tart Dave Foley) encourages her otherwise. Eve might
cooperate, if only Adam weren't such a freak. Eve is torn. Eve
waffles. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The lovely part in all of this is that Adam never loses his
innocence; he never stops blurting out postwar gee-whizisms like
``Hot diggity dog!'' and ``Cross my heart to hope to die!'' The
screenplay (by Wilson and Bill Kelly, with his first produced
script) doesn't push the woes of humanity on us, although there is
a glaringly forced plot twist near the end that smells like
rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast from the Past'' is funniest when it's hanging in the
Webbers' underground lair, where Mom sucks down the champagne
martinis while Dad heats Dr Pepper on the stove. The film is
triumphant in its eccentricity, tossing around crazy touches with
exquisite humanity and flair _ one of the craziest is a running gag
with a religious cult that has bearded slackers worshiping at the
Webbers' service elevator. Like Walken, Spacek invests her
character with amazing dork verve, giving Mom Webber an
off-balance, claustrophobic shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   And Fraser makes a marvelous comic puppy _ if his wide-eyed glee
weren't so perfectly timed, it'd be unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only disappointment in the cast is Silverstone,
whose usually peppy persona sags under the Weltschmerz of the
bitter Eve. One can't help wishing that someone grittier had taken
the role, or that Silverstone had played her as less of a grouch. A
man who's spent 35 years in a molehill deserves better.

SEEING GAY IN THE COLOR PURPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Beneath that ``I love you, you love me'' facade,
he's a macho guy who eats meat, smokes cigars, likes a little slap
and tickle and watches Lou Dobbs on ``Moneyline.''
</P>
<P>
   And now this: Because he's purple, he's gay. Like Tinky Winky
from the ``Teletubbies.'' It has to be because Jerry Falwell said
so.
</P>
<P>
   Barney must be blowing a synapse. ``I don't even carry a purse!
They never went after Gumby like this! I should have been green.
The gays think green is icky.''
</P>
<P>
   What Falwell has done with his outing of Tinky Winky _ a
character on a television show designed for 1-year-olds _ is open
the door for a McCarthy-style upheaval in the cartoon ranks,
because the majority of children's shows on television are
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time. Who isn't surprised that ``Scooby
Doo'' wasn't outed a long time ago? In fact, with a little tweaking
of the gaydar, it's not hard to see that the entire cast on
``Scooby-Doo'' was gay. No question about it. It's amazing they've
been able to live in peace this long.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's folly isn't going to stop at the ``Teletubbies.'' When
the religious right gets a bone it can gnaw on, forget about it.
And this newest of crusades surely will draw the attention of our
senators, giving them something to get exercised about after the
anti-climactic Clinton vote. How many days before Rep. Henry Hyde,
the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is all over ``Josie
and the Pussycats''?
</P>
<P>
   The only one who can stem this tide is Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., who has threatened to out a lot of colleagues in the past.
Now he can come to the rescue of Bugs Bunny (not to mention
Sylvester, Tweety Bird, Donald Duck, though the latter is still in
major denial), and maybe stop this madness before it gets out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be we could overlook some of these outlandish
accusations. How many years have we had to listen to the whispers
about Racer X from ``Speed Racer''? But once this kind of thing
gets a head of steam, there's no stopping it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Falwell's definition of what makes Tinky Winky gay
isn't exactly cutting-edge science. He's purple. He carries a
purse. (A ``Teletubbies'' spokesman said the ``purse'' is actually
a magic bag.) And he has a triangle on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Other than sending a lot of weird signals out to people who are
paying way too much attention, all a child sees is a puffy doll.
Maybe those three Falwellian things are proof enough. But if you
add a couple of more ``brains'' to the process, less obvious
characters could go under the microscope of righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pat Robertson will see Yosemite Sam as gay. He could be in
angry denial. Or how about Elmer Fudd? Picture the headline:
``Aging queen's second life exposed!''
</P>
<P>
   Once we get more people involved in worrying about the moral
fiber of America's children, we could turn what is now one
ignorant, bloated man's personal hootenanny into a spirited witch
hunt for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   If children are to be saved from gay characters, both dolls and
cartoons, there's really only one thing to do: Stop everything. End
all programs aimed at children. Shut down Nickelodeon. Give Mr.
Rogers his walking papers. Pull the curtain on ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, things are going to get messy and complicated.
Imagine a police lineup of Felix the Cat (talk about a big purse),
Cookie Monster, Mr. Peabody (and we'd have to say Sherman at this
point), Lambchop, Astro Boy and three-quarters of the characters
from ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the time is right for a gay hero to stand up to Falwell.
And we already know who's perfect for the job. He has worked for
someone just as evil (Montgomery Burns) and has withstood the
pressure to make us all laugh another day: Smithers, from ``The
Simpsons.''

RELIGIOUS FANATICS NOW GO FOR CARTOONS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The right-wing sex police must be really
desperate. They failed to nail tubby Bubba, so they're gay-bashing
Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell claimed that Tinky Winky of the
``Teletubbies'' toddler television show is gay.
</P>
<P>
   What set off Falwell's gaydar? Tinky Winky is purple, which is
close to the gay pride color of lavender. He sometimes carries a
bag that looks an awful lot like a purse. And on his head is a
triangular antenna, which is the same shape as the gay-liberation
triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, all these are subliminal messages to America's toddlers
to come out of the bassinet and crawl to gay bars.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when we were scared of Jerry Falwell?
</P>
<P>
   He railed against Bill Clinton and gays, and once took on a real
gay TV character, cleverly calling Ellen DeGeneres ``Ellen
Degenerate.''
</P>
<P>
   But recently Falwell has fallen from gracelessness into
desperation. A couple of weeks ago, he said the anti-Christ is a
Jewish male and that Christ will return to Earth within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, is Falwell in trouble if Christ does.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus was a Jewish male, too, and not likely to be pleased to
have a publicity hound like Falwell pretending to speak for Him.
</P>
<P>
   How low can Falwell fall? Now the televangelist is clubbing
chubby Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   A gay friend could barely contain himself when he called to make
a ``confession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had inappropriate relations with Tinky Winky,'' said my
friend, who shall remain nameless because of Tinky Winky's age
(unknown) and Tinky Winky's species (also unknown).
</P>
<P>
   This still is not proof that Tinky Winky is gay.
</P>
<P>
   As our president might say, it all depends what you mean by
``inappropriate relations.''
</P>
<P>
   By my definition, Jerry Falwell has had inappropriate relations
with Tinky Winky, too.
</P>
<P>
   For an adult, inappropriate relations with the Teletubbies is
watching them. It's way over the line to discuss what they do in
their private lives.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if they eat red meat, drive gas-guzzling sports
utility vehicles or if their fuzzy suits once belonged to mink.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one excuse for anyone older than two to watch the
Teletubbies, and that's if you regularly drop acid on Saturday
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we have reason to believe that Falwell has been dropping
acid, and it's not the good stuff. Either that, or he's been
watching himself on TV too much, which is an IQ-lowering experience
for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tinky Winky has a TV in his tummy. He talks baby talk. He lives
in a dome with rabbits, a sun with a baby's face and a periscope
that pops out of the ground. I only watched once and I didn't
inhale.
</P>
<P>
   If the first thing you do when you watch the Teletubbies is spot
a gay one, you definitely have gay on the mind.
</P>
<P>
   You probably don't see the forest very much because of all the
gay trees in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Falwell is just a little jealous, because the Teletubbies
do a better job of capturing the audience he wants _ the drooler
demographic.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's all very funny. Falwell has gone Looney Tunes, and
maybe he'll out Bert and Ernie of ``Sesame Street.'' After all,
they live together and have each other's pictures on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If right-wingers stuck to bashing cartoon characters, American
life would be much improved.
</P>
<P>
   However, they are also targeting real, live gays and lesbians
with human feelings _ including California Assemblywomen Carole
Migden of San Francisco and Sheila Kuehl of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While Falwell was listening for Barbra Streisand references in
Teletubbies' babble, a conservative religious group was holding an
outrageous prayer service in the state Capitol, while the Assembly
was not in session.
</P>
<P>
   In an ominous ceremony, a woman elaborately placed prayer cloths
on Migden's and Kuehl's desks and then prayed for the souls of the
two lesbian legislators, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   What is this? If Jerry Falwell can tell us the meaning of the
color purple in a Teletubby's suit, maybe he can tell us the
meaning of the color red on a prayer cloth spread on lesbian
legislators' desks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I don't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   It's frightening to have some kind of cultish ceremony performed
on your desk when you're not there. It's rude and insulting to have
a stranger pray for your soul when there's nothing wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   Things have come to a weird pass in America as we approach the
millennium. It's time for the sex police, gay bashers and
Teletubbophobics to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a purse doesn't make you gay, but being an idiot makes
you an idiot. Quit picking on Teletubbies, Falwell. You big baby.

A PLEASANT OUTING IN CARTOONLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The story left me in shock. I can't believe I missed
the signs _ me, a real sophisticated man. And it's all there, sure
enough: The penchant for wearing purple, the antenna in the shape
of a gay-pride triangle. And, oh, that ``magic bag''!
</P>
<P>
   Be real. A giant puppet who knows how to accessorize?
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell has it pegged: Tinky Winky, the purple
Teletubby, absolutely must be gay!
</P>
<P>
   I was attempting to recalibrate my ``gaydar'' when the phone
rang.
</P>
<P>
   It was Underdog, the cartoon hero of my youth. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cartoon confessions &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He _ that ``champion of champions,'' the heroic alter-ego of
Shoeshine Boy, the canine vanquisher of the nefarious Simon
Barsinister _ had a confession to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this thing I have to say, and that, my friend, is that
I am gay.''
</P>
<P>
   No way! Wow. Not that there's anything wrong with that! Hey,
that explains the cape, and all those years of speaking in rhyme.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second. What about Sweet Polly PureBread,
Underdog? I thought she was your gal?
</P>
<P>
   ``David, even now this may sound weird, but Sweet Polly, the TV
reporter, was merely a beard.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course _ like Doris Day and Rock Hudson! It makes perfect
sense!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I mention it only so you'll know how I scooped Falwell
on a national exclusive: ``Underdog Comes Out Of Phone Booth,
Declares He's Gay!''
</P>
<P>
   I was putting the finishing touches on that Pulitzer Prize opus
when the following story moved over the newswire:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) MEGALOPOLIS ZOO _ It was a love that dare not speak
its name. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   After years of silence, wise-cracking penguin Tennessee Tuxedo
and his bumbling walrus pal Chumley have decided to speak openly
about their interspecies relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here,'' said Tuxedo, ``and we're queer. Get used to it.
This isn't the '60s anymore. There's no reason for us to live in
the closet, beside our friend Phineas J. Whoopie's
three-dimensional blackboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding his partner's hand, Chumley acknowledged a debt _ to
Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made this all possible by outing Tinky Winky,'' said the
tie-wearing walrus. ``We never knew America was ready for gay
cartoon characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Zookeeper Stanley Livingston _ vacationing in San Francisco with
longtime assistant Flunky _ could not be reached for comment. (end
ital) &QL; 
Breakdown of family &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd barely finished reading when my editor yelled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big story breaking in Family Court!'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   There it was, atop the docket: Flintstone vs. Flintstone.
</P>
<P>
   Fred was on a bench in the hallway, reading a biography of Judy
Garland. That orange suit, the blue tie! The bizarre episode where
he befriends ``Spartacus'' co-star Stony Curtis! Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years Barney and I denied it,'' said Fred. ``But now I'm
divorcing Wilma. We're giving it a go.''
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, you heard it here first. Along with revelations
about Superman _ those tights! that commitment problem with Lois
Lane! _ Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street _ you doubted it? _ and
1970s animated superhero Hong Kong Phooey _ who, you will recall,
had ``style and a groovy smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Need I say more?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes, I should. See, I was watching the Teletubbies
yesterday afternoon when I got a call from Jughead from the Archie
comics.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't another problem with Reggie Mantle, his archenemy.
Jug was worried about his continued lack of interest in girls, his
cholesterol from all those burgers at Pops', and about still
attending Riverdale High School while wearing a crown at the ripe
old age of 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't seem like I have a life,'' said Jughead.
``Sometimes, David, I swear, I feel exactly like a character in a
comic book.''
</P>
<P>
   I told him not to worry. Having no life doesn't stop Jerry
Falwell, does it? &QL;

CLINTON'S BEST CAREER MOVE: QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mr. President, now you can resign. Finally, you
can inhale. We can exhale if you resign because we won't have to
hear about bimbo eruptions anymore.
</P>
<P>
   You can move to Los Angeles and hang out with Barbra and the
gang. You can get divorced. You can be the paunchy guy in shades by
the pool who everybody whispers about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most popular president in history, but some weird
stuff happened, and he just decided to quit. He has a hell of a
book deal, though.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll be a junkyard-strength babe magnet.
</P>
<P>
   While Hillary becomes a senator from New York, you can run for
senator from California. Andrew Johnson, the other impeached
president, went on to be a senator and so can you.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the possibilities. You and Hillary _ still on good
terms, of course _ might end up voting in the impeachment trial of
Dan Quayle. Is being a dim bulb an impeachable offense?
</P>
<P>
   But I wouldn't count on the impeachment fad catching on after
the events of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is up for re-election in 2000.
You may want to get back at her for publicly lambasting you because
you lied to her and the nation. At the end of the Senate trial, she
still fought to reprimand you.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Feinstein has a conscience and you don't. Therefore,
you might want to run against her. If you check the polls you love
so much, you may find you're more popular in California than she
is.
</P>
<P>
   Resign now, and you can do anything, because your place in
history will be assured, and it won't be next to Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it'll be close. Lord knows how they'll place the wax
figures at Madame Tussaud's.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Clinton will listen, but if he wants to find a
non-X-rated place in the history books, quitting now will do it.
</P>
<P>
   He should quit trying to elbow out Ronald Reagan for a place on
Mount Rushmore. In fact, the best news of the week is that there's
no more room on Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   The sure-fire way to ensure a permanent place in history is by
mystifying historians.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton quits now, there will be annual conferences by the
American Historical Association on why the most popular president
in history suddenly packed up after his greatest victory and split
for the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won't be known for Monica, but for his sudden move to
Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton probably won't take my advice and quit while he's ahead.
He loves himself too much. He gets too high on himself in victory,
banging on drums, playing with cigars, rolling over Martha's
Vineyard in golf carts and thinking great thoughts about how he can
get the enemies who tried to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is already plotting to do what he does best _ raise
money _ to defeat Republicans in the House in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he thinks one of his legacies can be returning the
House to the Democrats. That's hardly up there with saving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge is best served cold. What colder revenge could there be
but to quit after your enemies fail to fire you, and when you're
wildly popular?
</P>
<P>
   It's the perfect way out. He can still raise money to defeat
Republicans. He just won't be able to rent out the Lincoln bedroom
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can learn from Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan quit as the best athlete of his time at the top of his
form. Clinton can quit at the top of his form. He has to act fast,
though. He may be popular, but nobody is going to ask him to be on
a Wheaties box.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was a man playing a boy's game. Clinton has been playing
a man's game and acting like a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity could tank at any time, just as his
standing with Democratic colleagues has.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jordan, Clinton is disliked and distrusted by his own
team. Unlike Jordan, Clinton can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can leave with real accomplishments. He has exposed the
Republican Congress as a pack of rabid dogs. He has left
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in a puddle of frustration and
under possible investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Clinton, neo-conservative elitists are now condemning
the American public for immorality because all they care about is
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalists are reduced to gay-bashing Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been a great target for right-wingers, and all their
arrows have missed or bounced off. He's taken the shots that would
otherwise hit gays, feminists, tree-huggers, abortion doctors,
liberals and everyone else who conservatives demonize, along with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, we are thankful. Future historians will write book
after book about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to give Al Gore a head start before the Republicans
figure out they have no presidential candidates, no agenda, nothing
but crumpled bills of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has done a fine job of being Bill Clinton and
driving Republicans crazy. All he needs is one good career move. If
he can't get elected to the Senate, maybe he can get a movie deal.

VEHICROSS TREADS NEW GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isuzu VehiCross is something different. If you enjoy seeing
people's jaws drop as you drive by, then this is the vehicle for
you. And people do love it. That is, unless they hate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that's funny looking,'' the parking-lot guard snorted.
``You're darn right, that's funny looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! That's bad!'' a young slacker bellowed as he pulled up
alongside us on Seventh Street in a roaring old pickup. ``What is
it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a VehiCross,'' I tried to yell back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vee . . . heh . . . cross.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not the greatest name on the books. Every time you
say VehiCross, you can count on the next word being ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Something like Moon Unit or Dweezle would have been more
appropriate for this refugee from the outer limits. Some other
names heard during VehiCross' visit: futuristic, strange, totally
cool, really weird.
</P>
<P>
   Once I got used to VehiCross, I was solidly on the ``love it''
side of the fence. Not only do I love the unique styling and wacky
image, I love the current automotive climate that permits auto-show
concept cars to spring to life as actual vehicles that one can buy
and own.
</P>
<P>
   The VehiCross was a sport-utility concept, maybe more of a trial
balloon, that Isuzu trotted out for the auto-show circuit a few
years back. People loved it (at least those who didn't hate it),
which encouraged Isuzu to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   The VehiCross I drove was a hand-built prototype, not yet ready
for prime time. Finished units are expected to beam down to Isuzu
dealers this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But much as I enjoyed its stay, I would be hard-pressed to
recommend VehiCross to the average driver. The very things that
make it fun to look at and fun to drive also make it impractical to
own and hard to live with.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting into the thing is a chore. The ride height is way
up there, requiring agility and good hang time for entry to the
front seats. As for the back seats, well, it's hard enough entering
the rear of any two-door vehicle, but this one compounds the
problem by leaving only a narrow passage with the front seat pushed
all the way forward.
</P>
<P>
   Even my skinny 14-year-old struggled to get back there, to the
sound of groaning and hysterical laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But once inside, the interior is surprisingly roomy. Legroom and
headroom, front and rear, are right up there. The standard leather
seating, provided by race-seat designer Recaro, no less, is
comfortable and accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   So all is well until you attempt to look outside. The driver
will find his rearward view solidly blocked by that jazzy-looking
spare-tire setup in the rear door. Or blocked by the really thick
pillars amidships.
</P>
<P>
   Backing up is an act of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Those pillars also block the view of back-seat passengers, so
they don't get to see everybody's jaws drop as you drive by.
</P>
<P>
   But if you dig the style, you should be willing to live with the
compromises. But the style has its practical side, too. That
bulbous gray lower section is made of heavy, damage-resistant
polypropylene held on by Torx screws, making it readily
replaceable. The upper body is galvanized steel.
</P>
<P>
   The VehiCross really is as much fun to drive as it is to look
at. The beefy 3.5-liter V-6 is strong and able, though a bit noisy,
hooked up to an automatic transmission that does its job well,
whether in the regular or ``power'' setting. (Guess where I kept
it?)
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem here, too: abysmal gas mileage. Not that
mileage concerns many people in these days of cheap fuel, but a
spike in gas prices will have VehiCross busting your budget.
</P>
<P>
   A neat touch is the aircraft-style fuel filler. Because you'll
see it so often, at least it's fun to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the two-door Trooper that is popular in Japan _ and
where VehiCross already is roaming the streets _ handling and
driveability are quite good for this class of tippy vehicle.
Because of the engine power, be careful not to get too playful or
you risk losing control.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to get my tester off the
pavement. But I've recently driven a V-6-powered Amigo (a slightly
smaller engine in a slightly smaller truck) and thought it handled
the boondocks pretty well. I have no doubt that the VehiCross would
be a total hoot on a rocky desert trail.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel-drive system has the requisite high/low range
settings for serious off-roaders, but also includes an automatic
setting that takes care of transient traction problems all by
itself. The real wheels are engaged in two-wheel drive until the
system senses wheel slippage, and then it transfers torque to the
front wheels.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the ride is very stiff, especially the rear
suspension. A good-size speed bump will rattle your fillings.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at VehiCross logically, it doesn't make much sense. But
this little space critter isn't meant to appeal to your sense of
logic. It's meant to tap into your emotions, your sense of
adventure, and maybe your sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or hate it, the VehiCross is a pretty trick truck, and
everybody should feel good that something so creative is able to
exist. &QL;

LET THE `MESSAGE' FLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on in the new movie ``Message in a Bottle,'' an impossibly
fit-looking Robin Wright Penn is jogging along a misty beach when
she happens upon a message in a bottle washed up on shore. She
bends to pick it up, and starts to read.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing what comes after, the concerned viewer wants to
beseech her: Don't read that! You're going to fall in love with the
writer, a dolorous dullard who's barely breathing. The result will
be a movie that barely lives.
</P>
<P>
   But movies aren't interactive, so we can say nothing. We just
watch and wait through two-plus hours of this heartstring-tugging
feature. We are thankful for the fine marine cinematography, Penn's
sturdy performance and a nicely honed appearance by Paul Newman,
wishing all the while there was more to recommend this Valentine's
Day confection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle,'' co-produced by Kevin Costner and
directed by Luis (``When a Man Loves a Woman'') Mandoki, is based
on ``The Notebook,'' a best-selling novella by Nicholas Sparks. But
much has changed from page to screen.
</P>
<P>
   In Sparks' slender, 135-page book, an older man visits an older
woman in a nursing home and reads to her from a notebook detailing
a young couple's courtship. By the end, the reader realizes the
woman is his wife, who has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Penn's character, Theresa, is a journalist with
the Chicago Tribune, a single mom who's trying to put her life back
together after a divorce. Costner's character, Garret, is a widower
devoted to his late wife, Catherine. He repairs boats in the Outer
Banks of North Carolina and dreams of designing and building a
seaworthy craft of his own. He writes love notes to Catherine and
casts them adrift in bottles, pining for the past. Newman plays
Garret's dad, trying, with precious little success, to get his
phlegmatic son interested in living again.
</P>
<P>
   Wright Penn brings welcome whimsicality, sensuality and
flirtiness in her early scenes with Costner, when Theresa succeeds
in tracking the mysterious messages to the secretive Garret. Alas,
she gets little help from Costner, whose idea of a man in deep pain
is to drain him of all expressiveness _ and none at all from
director Mandoki, who gives this movie the same achingly deliberate
pacing that sunk Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan in ``When a Man Loves a
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   This movie asks the question, Can Garret Open His Heart and
Learn to Love Again?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will surprise no one who has seen formula weepers
before, but the sentimental and over-long wrap-up will test even
devoted fans. As for the gratuitous subplot with Catherine's
family, the less said of it, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, who is maturing admirably as an actress, does what she can
with the soggy story but can't save the movie. Newman, who is
getting awfully good at playing crusty codgers, gives some edge to
a character that could have been terminally and stereotypically
``feisty.'' Good character actors, like Robbie Coltrane, who
portrays Theresa's colleague at the newspaper, are lost in small
parts.

NOLTE'S PERFORMANCE STANDS OUT IN `AFFLICTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Schrader has written two extraordinary movies about male
anger _ ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull'' _ so it's no surprise
that his latest film, about a man undone by uncontrollable fury, is
harrowing and heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' is a wintry tragedy told with compassion and
unblinking directness. We're offered no refuge or consolation, just
the fearful spectacle of a man unable to keep his many demons at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nearly miraculous conjunction of director, material
and actor. Russell Banks' 1989 novel about the tormented adult son
of an abusive, alcoholic father could not have had a better
interpreter than Schrader, who has never been more unaffected or
less obscure. (Banks is on a roll; his ``The Sweet Hereafter'' also
produced a fine recent film.)
</P>
<P>
   And Nick Nolte, as the central figure, a suffering small-town
cop, performs with an intensity he hasn't achieved before _ this
role earned him an Oscar nomination and the New York Film Critics'
best actor award. His character's existence is as bleak and harsh
as the snowy New England landscape he inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   The opening sequence shows concisely the pit that Nolte's Wade
Whitehouse has dug for himself. The divorced Wade is taking his
daughter to a Halloween costume pageant in his depressed New
Hampshire town. The girl is clearly uncomfortable, despite his
clumsy efforts to entertain her _ she senses his destructive
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The evening ends badly for Wade, who must phone his unforgiving
ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt), now remarried to a wealthy man, to come
and take the girl back. He'll eventually make noise about suing for
custody, but the evening takes its toll; it's another in a long
string of Wade's failures.
</P>
<P>
   He's intelligent, but his low-level police work, including
crossing-guard duty, is as humiliating as his other job: go-fer for
the town's chief businessman. But Wade's misery also has deeper
roots. Sapping his life like a chronic illness is his father,
played with ferocity by James Coburn (also Oscar nominated, for
supporting actor).
</P>
<P>
   A vicious drunk who beat and goaded his two sons, Glen
Whitehouse is a large, fearsome man who sank his teeth into his
older boy and never let go. (The other son, played as an adult by
Willem Dafoe, eventually fared better, escaping the town to become
a professor. Besides having a modest on-camera role, he is also the
narrator _ and sadly disengaged from the unfolding disaster.) Wade
isn't the brute his old man was, but the wound he suffered as a
child infects his adult relationships. He acts with a damaging
impulsiveness that's the legacy of his father's alcohol-fueled
cruelty and bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Two plot threads intersect to push Wade to the breaking point.
An out-of-town union official dies of gunshot wounds on a hunting
trip set up by Wade's employer, who is deeply involved in buying
land for a major development. The hunter who led the outing insists
the death was an accident, but Wade gets suspicious and feverishly
begins to investigate. Was there really a crime, or is Wade
deluding himself in a desperate attempt to be a hero?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out of genuine affection but also to boost his
chances of seeing his daughter, he has proposed marriage to his
sweet-tempered girlfriend, Margie (Sissy Spacek). After Wade's
mother dies _ at least partly because of his father's neglect _
Wade and Margie move into the Whitehouse farm, and it's clear they
are making a dire mistake. Glen is fading, but still dangerous, and
his needling further crushes Wade and poisons his relationship with
this patient, loving woman.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte's done his share of conventional Hollywood pictures
(``48HRS''), but has also consistently sought roles that play
against his type _ big, blond, irascible, highly physical. He was
the Nietzsche-quoting drug-runner in ``Who'll Stop the Rain'' and
the Southern lawyer whose family is stalked by a lunatic in the
``Cape Fear'' remake.
</P>
<P>
   He's been good in some of these parts, terrific in a few, but in
``Affliction'' he's working on a whole new level. His character
here is the genuine thing, a deeply flawed man who would like to do
good but is so much at the mercy of his past that he can do little
but bide his time until the inevitable catastrophe. His every
attempt to act or speak is slightly off; nothing comes out like he
wants. There's a helplessness about him that's wrenching to see.

SAN FRANCISCO CONSIDERS REGULATING ATM CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Amid threats of a legal challenge by business
groups, the city Board of Supervisors will consider a proposal next
week to forbid banks from double-charging ATM customers in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which won a key endorsement from the board's
Finance and Labor Committee on Wednesday, is vehemently opposed by
the banking industry. Bankers fear that if San Francisco passes the
law, other cities will follow, regulating an area that the industry
says should be dictated by the free market.
</P>
<P>
   But several consumer groups, as well as organized labor and
advocates for senior citizens, have been stumping for more than a
year to rope in extra bank fees, which they say put an unfair
financial pinch on a banking public that has been wooed over the
years into relying on automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation takes aim at banks that charge noncustomers a
surcharge (usually about $1.50) when they use their money machines.
In addition, some banks charge to their own account holders when
they use another bank's ATM. That fee ranges from $1 to $2.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the board's legislative analyst found that about 95
percent of the ATMs in the city assessed surcharges on
noncustomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are extremely frustrated by ATM fees and surcharges
at a very visceral level,'' said Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano, chief sponsor of the plan. ``The banking industry has
taken these surcharge fees to an extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On a common-sense level, people are very angry that they have
to pay twice to withdraw their money once. Let's bring some common
sense and consumer protection back to this equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to clamp down on ATM surcharges in Congress have
failed, although new efforts are under way. Two states, Iowa and
Nebraska, prohibit ATM double-dipping; Connecticut's double-dipping
law is being challenged in court. Three other states, Arkansas,
Mississippi and Wyoming, have enacted surcharge caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large, federally regulated financial institutions will
either choose to fight this in court _ and I assure you they will
win _ or they will take these machines out of service for everyone
but their own customers, and the result will be less access,''
Gregory Wilhelm of the California Bankers Association told the San
Francisco board's Finance and Labor Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in state or federal law to stop the city from
going ahead with the legislation, according to the San Francisco
city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have hired a veteran lobbyist to try to sway the
supervisors and the mayor to their side.
</P>
<P>
   But the Consumers Union, the San Francisco Labor Council and the
National Council on Aging are urging passage of the city ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Six votes are needed for passage, and at this point, both
supporters and opponents say, it will be close. Mayor Willie Brown
hasn't revealed whether he would sign the legislation, should it
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers argue that the access fees give them the money they need
to install and maintain machines in more remote areas, providing
greater convenience to consumers. In addition, they said, if people
don't like paying extra for using another bank's ATM, they can just
stick with their own bank's machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to argue against consumers paying for the
convenience of using an ATM where it is convenient. That is fair,''
said Jon Golinger, consumer program director for California Public
Interest Research Group, the consumer rights group spearheading the
campaign against the surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when consumers are paying one fee to cover that cost,'' he
said, ``they should not be gouged and stuck with a second fee
simply because the banks have an opportunity to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Golinger said that in the end, smaller financial institutions
with few machines are hurt by the surcharges. The winners, he said,
are the biggest banks with the most ATMs.

'98 A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR CALIFORNIA WINERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last year's wine harvest was the second-largest
harvest on record, according to the California Department of
Agriculture. And growers and vintners said the painfully long
growing season cultivated some high quality grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Wine grape production in 1998 did slide 13 percent from the
previous year. But 1997 was an abnormal year, producing a
record-high crush of 2.9 million tons of grapes. California
winegrowers in 1998 crushed 2.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole year was full of angst,'' said Gladys Horiuchi,
spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Wine Institute. ``The bud
break started a bit late and the harvest started a bit late. People
were joking they'd be harvesting around Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rains delayed the bud break about a month and hampered
pollination. The cool summer caused grapes to ripen slowly, but a
warm October helped kick the harvest into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi said the 1998 season produced lower yields per acre,
but more acres were being harvested as more vineyards came into
maturity. ``Because there was a smaller yield per acre and the
grapes were on the vine a long time, it really concentrated the
flavors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers were enthusiastic about the quality, if not the
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the late, slow-paced vintage, the reds are deeply
colored with softer tannins and lots of fruit,'' said Michael
Martini, winemaker at Napa Valley's Louis M. Martini Winery in St.
Helena. ``This is a very good year, except the crop level for
Northern California was slightly below normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stutz, winemaker at Mirassou Vineyards in San Jose, said the
winery's chardonnay, pinot blanc and pinot noir will be exceptional
this year. ``The '98 vintage may prove to be one of the best of the
decade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 1.32 million tons, down 10 percent from 1997, red varieties
accounted for the largest share of all wine grapes crushed. White
varieties dropped 17 percent from 1997 to 1.19 tons.
</P>
<P>
   California winegrowers received an average price of $581.83 per
ton of grapes in 1998, 3 percent less than the previous year.
However, in Napa Valley the average price per ton for cabernet
sauvignon was $2,252, up from $2,005 in 1997, a 12 percent
increase. The priciest white variety was Napa Valley chardonnay,
which cost an average of $1,841 per ton in 1998, a 6 percent
increase over '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is the virtue in our game, and the grapes really
tried our patience this year,'' said Bob Steinhauer, vineyard
manager for Beringer Vineyards in St. Helena. ``But the wait was
well worth it.''

THE LAST MOGUL 
Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the Hidden History of Hollywood 
By Dennis McDougal 
Crown, 560 pp., illustrated, $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lew Wasserman was indeed the last mogul, and Dennis McDougal's
``The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the Hidden History of
Hollywood'' is a well-researched, tough-minded, superbly composed
behind-the-scenes story of Hollywood's most powerful invisible man.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, 1998, Wasserman resigned from his post on the board
of directors and assumed the title of honorary chairman emeritus of
Universal Studios. He cleaned out his office on the fifth floor of
the Lew Wasserman Building on the Universal lot and went home. The
studio he helped establish was now part of Seagram Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years, Wasserman, as head of the talent agency
MCA, wielded the kind of power people like agent Michael Ovitz, in
his prime, and Disney chairman Michael Eisner could only dream
about. Studio heads, producers, directors, and stars all were
manipulated by a man who hid his eyes behind dark glasses, refused
to have his photograph taken, and insisted that his staff mimic his
wardrobe _ a black suit, black tie, and white shirt. In fact, many
industry insiders claim that the movie ``Men in Black'' was a
not-so-subtle parody of Wasserman's machine-gun style.
</P>
<P>
   From Alfred Hitchcock to Steven Spielberg, Wasserman ran careers
the way Mayor Richard Daley ran Chicago _ autocratically and
profitably.
</P>
<P>
   In one of McDougal's most revealing stories, in 1958 director
Edward Dmytryk was a day or two away from starting production on
the film version of Irwin Shaw's novel ``The Young Lions,'' with
Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and a hot new actor fresh from the
Broadway stage, Tony Randall. Even though Randall knew his part and
had been fitted for his soldier's costume, he was dumped. Why?
Because he wasn't an MCA client. Wasserman used his clients _
Brando and Clift _ to blackmail Dmytryk into replacing Randall with
another MCA client whose career was in the doldrums. It worked. The
movie did well, and the actor whose career was resuscitated went on
to become a major star who filled both his pockets and MCA's _ Dean
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   There is story after story in McDougal's book that dispel the
myth of producers, directors, or stars being in charge of the
movies. If you worked for MCA, you worked for MCA. And, if
Wasserman made an offer, it was hard to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman cared about two things: profit and power. If that
meant that his wife, Edie, found a few escorts or that he spent
more time in his office than at home, so be it. Though he was a
Democrat, he sometimes supported Republicans. After all, they went
to the movies, too. He revived Ronald Reagan's career after Warner
Bros. canceled the actor's contract. Wasserman arranged for Reagan,
the former president of the Screen Actors Guild, to become a
spokesman for General Electric. The visibility that went with that
assignment eventually led Reagan to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his championing Disco-Vision, a home video disc, over
VHS in the early 1980s, it's hard to find a bad business decision
in Wasserman's resume. Whether fighting off the antitrust thrusts
of Attorney General Robert Kennedy or demanding that Jack Warner
take better care of Bette Davis, Wasserman was always the company
man. No matter how close he got to the top, he always had both eyes
on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've read hundreds of books on Hollywood and the
movie business, and this one is right at the top. Besides having
persuaded the major players to talk, McDougal is adept at mixing
scandal and gossip with art and business. He writes authoritatively
on the relationship between President John F. Kennedy and Marilyn
Monroe, for example, and places it in a remarkable political
context.
</P>
<P>
   In show business, the word ``mogul'' suggests a merger of
indispensable qualities _ ruthlessness, diplomacy, intelligence,
strength, and anonymity. While Lew Wasserman seldom revealed what
was going on behind those shady glasses, Dennis McDougal does. With
the last mogul gone, Hollywood will never be the same.

BU'S PARKER IS TRYING TO SOLVE A MYSTERY _ HIS TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, yeah, Boston University has won another Beanpot,
a.k.a. the ``BU Invitational.'' BU always wins the Beanpot. It
doesn't matter if BU is undefeated and ranked No. 1 or, as was the
case this year, 8-14-2 coming in and stuck in a brutal 0-5-1 skid.
</P>
<P>
   To BU, the Beanpot is Lourdes.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's a surprise: Jack Parker never gets tired of winning
those Beanpots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows how important it is except for the people who are
trying to win it,'' he points out. ``The Beanpot is something so
absolutely bizarre and special. It's either a great win or a
horrible loss. It's such an end in itself. There's a guy who's been
cutting my hair for a long time and he says, `So the Beanpot's
over. How are you going to be next year?' He thinks the season's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. What the man with the clippers doesn't understand
is that Parker hopes the season is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that until the Beanpot, Parker wasn't having a
whole lot of fun. He's had teams that have, to be polite,
``struggled'' before (e.g., 14-21-1 in '88-89). But the few down
years during his magnificent 26-year career as head hockey coach at
Boston University have been the result of either poor talent or
attitudes. And of course, there is always injury.
</P>
<P>
   There have been damaging injuries this year, especially to his
defense corps. But it wasn't the injuries that bugged him as much
as something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team was always better than its record,'' he explains.
``But I have never before had a team that has consistently played
with so little emotion or with so little poise.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 Terriers have earned the distinction of being
Parker's most baffling group of personalities. This bunch has
forced the greatest college hockey coach in Boston history to reach
deeper into his bag of tricks than he's ever gone before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in November, (assistant coach) Brian Durocher said,
`We've tried this, we've tried that, we've tried being nice, we've
tried getting in their faces, we've tried easier practices, we've
tried tougher practices, so what's next?' '' laughs Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Though he says the team actually may have bottomed out earlier,
it may be that a loss to UMass-Lowell the Friday night before Round
1 of the Beanpot was the turning point in the season. An
exasperated Parker told Russ Bartlett, then the team's leading
scorer; Chris Heron, the team's top goal scorer; and defensemen
Juha Vuori and Colin Sheen that their services would not be
required for the evening. This quartet did not draw sweaters as the
Terriers lost their fourth straight, and sixth in seven games, by a
4-1 score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to send a clear-cut message to everyone,'' Parker
explains. `` `That's enough, boys. If you don't want to play, and
play hard, go sit in the stands.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Three nights later, Bartlett took a feed from Heron for the
winning goal in overtime against Boston College. Now you're
beginning to understand how this man has won 588 hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the Beanpot is that we were very lucky to be
playing BC in that first game,'' Parker says. ``At least then I
knew we'd be playing with emotion. But how that would affect our
other problem _ playing with poise _ I didn't know. It turned out
we played with emotion and with poise before by far the biggest
crowd we had seen all year.''
</P>
<P>
   So BU was in the Beanpot final again. First on the agenda,
however, was a game against Merrimack. ``This game in between is
the game all Beanpot coaches hate,'' Parker says, ``but we played
another very good game.'' BU 6, Merrimack 3.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the final. With tourney MVP Michel Larocque
playing like the All-America goalkeeper he is, the Terriers beat
Northeastern, 4-2, winning the Beanpot for the fifth straight year,
eighth time in the decade, and 22d time overall.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious problem here is that Boston University has become a
victim of its own success. Playing for Parker and BU has become a
responsibility, and this particular group has felt the weight of
history on its shoulders. ``I heard kids say, `What are the Amontes
and Tkachuks going to think of us?' '' Parker marvels. ``I said,
`Believe me, Tony Amonte has got other things to think about now
other than Boston University.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Larocque, whom Parker calls ``the best goalie in the country,''
got off to a horrible start, and that didn't help. Once teams
sensed that mighty BU was vulnerable, their confidence level
soared. The defense problems started immediately as touted freshman
Pat Auferio broke a hand and missed the first half of the season.
But none of these things prepared Parker for a team that simply
lacked life.
</P>
<P>
   So what we have here is an acclaimed coach getting an education
in his 26th year on the job. ``I could be part of the problem,'' he
muses. ``We've had success for a long time, and maybe we all got
too comfortable with the way we've been doing things. I'm already
thinking about what we're going to do this summer to shake up our
program. We're going to reevaluate everything we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question this is not only good for us but for our
fans,'' he maintains, ``because the next time we win something big,
they will appreciate it more. Around here, it's `What? You're not
undefeated? What? You're not No. 2 in the nation?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal is to get as healthy as possible in
preparation for the postseason. Jack Parker is not naive enough to
think that a three-game winning streak means all the ills are
cured, especially with a remaining regular-season schedule that
includes a home game with New Hampshire and road games with
Providence, Maine (2), and Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will now find out if the Beanpot victory will be a
launching pad or just an oasis in a desert of bad games,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The honest-to-God truth is that he simply does not know. How
could he? There's never been such a mysterious Jack Parker BU team.

DOES SARA KNAPP KNOW WHO KILLED HER SISTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Five-year-old Sara Knapp crawled under her
sister's bed the night the man with the scraggly hair crept into
her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Above her, the coils of the mattress squeaked as the man raped
and sodomized her older sister, Elizabeth, ripping her body,
causing her to bleed.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, paramedics carried away 6-year-old Elizabeth's
lifeless body.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, when she was finally able to talk about that July
night in 1997, little Sara told a counselor that she saw the
killer: her mother's live-in boyfriend, Richard Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Police originally charged Buchanan, but the case unraveled after
DNA evidence excluded him as the source of semen found on
Elizabeth's body. Police later charged an upstairs neighbor, James
Dale, who is now on trial for murdering Elizabeth, after DNA tests
linked him as ``partial match.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara, who is now 6, could help free Dale, the only man in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   The Knapp murder case, and its six-year-old witness for the
defense, has spurred anew the debate over how young is too young to
testify. In the voices of children, juries hear innocent truths.
Their testimony can be crucial, but specialists caution that the
youngest of witnesses can also be highly susceptible to suggestion
or give a version of events that blends child-like perceptions with
reality.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where the murder case of Elizabeth Knapp has
taken bizarre twists and turns, Sara Knapp and her mother, Ruth
Knapp, have been subpoened by the defense. They say they saw Ruth
Knapp's ex-boyfriend, Buchanan, in the room the night Elizabeth
died.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, who is described by her attorney as being mildly retarded,
told investigators she awoke at 1 a.m. July 3, 1997 when she heard
noises in the bedroom where her two girls slept. She found Buchanan
naked laying on top of Elizabeth with his buttocks moving up and
down and holding a pillow over Elizabeth's face.
</P>
<P>
   She told police she screamed, ``Stop!'' But Buchanan told her,
``get away.'' Ruth Knapp said she then rushed to the kitchen,
grabbed a knife and waved it at Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Knapp said he threatened to kill her if she told anyone,
and ordered her back to bed. The mother went back to bed.
</P>
<P>
   She told police she awoke at 8:30 a.m. and found Elizabeth dead.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that information, and that there was no sign of forced
entry, police that day charged Buchanan, 44, with second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks later, DNA tests excluded Buchanan as the source
of the semen found on Elizabeth's clothing and body.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, police become suspicious of an upstairs
neighbor, James Dale, 41, who abruptly moved out of his apartment
and quit his job. Dale's DNA turned out to be a ``partial match''
to samples collected at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Buchanan were dropped. Now, Dale is on trial
for the murder, rape and sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been some reports that both Ruth Knapp and
Sara have changed their story, Dale's lawyer, Jim Moir said this
week they ``maintain that it was Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   Police continue to believe that Buchanan was involved in the
murder. Dale and Buchanan, who quickly became drinking buddies,
were known to police for their lewd, alcohol-induced behavior.
Neighbors said the two and a third neighbor would stay up for hours
drinking in the apartment Buchanan shared with Knapp and her two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many times I'd pound on the door, telling
them, `Calm down, my kids are trying to sleep,' '' said a former
neighbor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Buchanan) would say, `What's your point?' Every night, he was
blasted. I don't know how she (Ruth Knapp) put up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's attorney declined to answer specific questions about
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ruth Knapp and her daughter, Sara, are reluctantly
preparing to testify. While some are upset Knapp has to testify _
she spent two weeks in a psychiatric ward following her daughter's
death _ many people fear that having Sara testify will be even more
emotionally taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a horrible and tragic loss that she's gone
through,'' Knapp's attorney, David Balison, said of Sara. ``Having
a little girl come into the court room and have to relive this
painful, horrible memory is something we hope does not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In making her decision to allow Sara to testify, Justice
Kathleen McGuire asked Sara a series of questions about her life,
her former apartment, her former friends, and her pet cat Amos.
</P>
<P>
   While McGuire declines to discuss her decision to allow Sara to
testify, plenty of people have weighed in on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of memory it's a matter of perception,''
said Boston criminal defense attorney Harvey Silverglate, arguing
that child witnesses should not be relied on by courts. ``They
don't always perceive and process things in accordance with
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   When their testimony is central to a case _ as it was, for
example, in the the controversial Fells Acres case _ the stakes are
high: People could be sent to prison on a child's word.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate, who has handled cases involving alleged child
abuse, said children five and younger should never testify and that
in Sara's case, although she is now 6, it happened when she was 5,
too young to process accurately what happened. Even with older
children, he said, there is the danger of being highly susceptible
to suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   But Wendy Murphy, a former Middlesex County prosecutor and now a
lawyer representing victims of violence, said that other studies
counter Silverglate's view, saying children are not any more
susceptible to suggestion than adults. She cites a 1987 study
``Suggestibility and the Child Witness'' that concluded that
children out perform adults in resisting misleading questions.
</P>
<P>
   While children have cognitive limitations, such as not
understanding abstract concepts like time, they can speak to what
they saw and it's up the attorney who is doing cross examination to
get at the child's reliability, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perpetrators, insisted Murphy, often go free because judges are
reluctant to expose children to the rigors of testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be talking about the best interest of the child
_ the predominant interest should be the effective prosecution of
the trial,'' Murphy said. ``If we don't have an effective justice
system, we are not protecting children.''
</P>
<P>
   On quiet Kearsarge Avenue in Hopkinton, Sara and her family
lived for years in a white Victorian-style estate that was carved
into small apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The jury walked through the apartment on Monday, to the room
where Sara slept with her sister, Elizabeth. The walls were
repainted baby blue and bunk beds replaced the two small beds where
Sara and Elizabeth slept, side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Hopkinton talks about the house and wonders who
killed Elizabeth, the bright-eyed girl with shimmering auburn hair.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're wondering about something else: What's going to
happen when little Sara takes the stand?

QUARTEY OUT TO BE ON THE TAKING END

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Ike Quartey learned to fight in the accepted way. He
fought to keep what was his.
</P>
<P>
   That was long before he had a $250 pair of sunglasses, as he now
does. Back then, in Ghana where it all began, Quartey fought over
lesser things. Things like a scuffed soccer ball, which was one of
the few possessions of a street kid from Bukom, the toughest
section in the tough city of Accra.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey was 6 or 7 the day Alfred Kotay tried to take his ball
from him in the way it is done in places like Bukom, but he already
knew what was expected. He fought, because that is what you do in
such a circumstance unless you want everything taken from you. And
he's been fighting ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have something someone wants, they take it,'' the
undefeated former World Boxing Association welterweight champion
recalled of life in Bukom as he sat in a coffee shop two days
before his scheduled fight with Oscar De La Hoya on pay-per-view
over far more than a soccer ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back there, you fight in the streets every day. You fight for
everything. That is life there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult life made harder by the fact Quartey was the
youngest of Robert Mustafa Quartey's 27 children. The father was
nearly 70 when his last child was born, the son of his fifth wife.
It was the last of a long line of mouths to feed. Too many mouths
for almost anyone to feed well.
</P>
<P>
   So the last son did not hang around the house for long, leaving
instead to do what it has turned out he does best. Leaving to fight
for his supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left my house at 7 or 8,'' Quartey claimed. ``My mother did
not want me to be a boxer, so I went to live with my trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   One can never be sure of the truth of such stories, for who is
here from Accra to verify them? But one thing is sure. Ike Quartey
learned to fight somewhere and he has been fighting ever since for
money and to live up to the reputation of a brother he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   The real Ike Quartey won a silver medal as a light welterweight
at the 1960 Olympics in Rome when he was 26, nearly nine years
before his youngest brother was born. By the time Issifu Quartey
was fighting in the streets, his big brother had gone off to make a
life in Mexico, where he still lives.
</P>
<P>
   Having no shortage of siblings, the older man didn't need much
of a relationship with the young boy, so he became more legend than
reality to him, a legend he decided to carry on by taking on his
name and his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the latest ``Ike'' Quartey will try to enhance
the name's reputation in boxing by taking something away from the
sport's Golden Boy _ the World Boxing Council welterweight title.
If he can, it will be the end of an 18-month trial in a sport that
had for so long fed Quartey's stomach and his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a long night spent trying to survive the ravages of a
malaria attack and the savagery of Jose Luis Lopez's attacks, Ike
Quartey found himself in a most unfamiliar spot on Oct. 17, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself on his back.
</P>
<P>
   He went there twice that night, the last night he has been in
the ring. He went there despite having been cautioned to avoid this
fight by his trainer, by his friends, by even his spiritual
adviser, Dr. Oko Kwate Kwei. They had seen Quartey unable to train
for weeks, his weight dropping from the virus. They had seen his
stamina and the strength he had always relied on disappear. They
had seen it and they had seen Lopez, a fearsome puncher who even De
La Hoya conceded was the most dangerous welterweight in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing all that, they tried to tell the man who had been
fighting all his life to walk away this time. But he could no more
do that than a man can walk away from his fate, and now there he
was, exhausted and flat on his back late in a fight he had once
been winning.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey got up, though, got up twice and fought on just well
enough to be given a draw. It is the one blemish on a record of
34-0-1 that had up to that point been seen as a reason for De La
Hoya not to fight him.
</P>
<P>
   As is the way in boxing, that draw seemed to open more doors for
Quartey than any victory had. Certainly, it opened more than his 29
knockouts did, because those convinced many men not to fight him,
even after he won the WBA title in 1984 from Crisanto Espana in
Levallois, France.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey would defend that title six times before the Lopez
fight, stopping everyone but Oba Carr, who took him the distance
and made him look bad along the way. None of those fights generated
the kind of groundswell he needed to push De La Hoya into a
unification fight, but after the draw, there was suddenly no
shortage of big-name opponents waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Quartey, he's still waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   First he was set to fight former welterweight champion Pernell
Whitaker last April. But Whitaker was suspended for testing
positive for drugs. Then feared International Boxing Federation
champion Felix Trinidad was ready in August but was unable to
extricate himself from a promotional contract with Don King and
join forces with Quartey's promoter, Dino Duva, so that fight went
away.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a scheduled match with De La Hoya in November that
fell apart when De La Hoya claimed to have cut his left eyelid
while sparring, a cut Quartey has yet to see evidence of but one he
has not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   To Quartey, De La Hoya tried to take something away from him
with what he sees as a phony injury claim, and when you try to take
something away from a kid from Bukum, only one thing can follow. A
fight. At last a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What got Ike mad was a week after the so-called cut, he
couldn't see a nick on De La Hoya,'' Duva said. ``He felt they were
full of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought De La Hoya would be ready after the (second
Julio Cesar) Chavez fight in September. I might have done the same
thing if I had Oscar, but it was disingenuous to commit to Nov. 21
for the toughest fight of his life and then pull out because he
wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya denies that scenario, but Quartey does not believe
him. He has remained angry, an anger that has been building through
16 months of inactivity, probably the longest amount of time he
hasn't been in a fight in his life.
</P>
<P>
   It is an anger like Quartey used to feel on the streets, the
anger of a boy with something to defend from someone trying to take
it all away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hurt him,'' Quartey said. ``I am very angry. I had
no work while he was buying time. I have been waiting all my life
for this. Saturday night I will prove who is the best in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ike Quartey will have to fight to do that. It's something he's
used to.

PAINTING CASSATT IN A FEMINIST LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Cassatt's handling of paint is as sophisticated as her
subjects are sentimental. At least they seem sentimental to fin de
siecle eyes _ all those mothers cuddling children.
</P>
<P>
   Each generation recasts great artists of the past _ and Cassatt
was great, as the current show of her work at the Museum of Fine
Arts attests. The last major examination of Cassatt came in 1941,
when her paintings could have been used as propaganda for a
woman's-place-is-in-the-home campaign. Now, she's a feminist, a
woman who painted other people's children but never had her own,
possibly because she saw them as a threat to her career. The annals
of art history are filled with tales of gifted women artists who
gave up after marriage. So, instead of succumbing to domesticity,
Pittsburgh-born Mary Cassatt went to France and joined the
male-dominated Impressionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA presentation of the Cassatt show _ which was organized
by the Art Institute of Chicago and ends its tour at the National
Gallery in Washington, D.C. _ is the first solo by a woman in the
museum's most prestigious space, the Gund Gallery. It's a timid
toe-in-the-water, but it's a start. (How about Kiki Smith next?)
It's also a shame that the works chosen for the show's publicity
are of the genteel, tea-drinking category; there's far bolder, more
experimental work in the show itself.
</P>
<P>
   The excellent wall texts, by MFA curator Erica Hirshler, bring
up subjects that will resonate with contemporary audiences,
pointing out, for instance, Cassatt's having to care for aging
parents _ a baby-boomer issue. If the tenderness of her portraits
of her elderly mother are any indication, she didn't resent this
filial duty.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of the sociology. The paintings are lovely,
beautifully installed, and accompanied by a first-rate resource
room with interactive computers. The show progresses in a
chronological order that tells the story of Cassatt's career from
the early 1870s to the late 1890s. The first and last rooms are the
weakest. It took her a while to outgrow the traditional training
she received at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, one of
the first American art schools to accept women, and then in Paris,
from Gerome and Couture, academicians par excellence. At the other
end of her career some paintings calcified; the babies became cute
and contrived. In between, the works often dazzle. No artist has
ever captured the physical rapport between mother and child more
convincingly; looking at Cassatt's paintings, you can almost feel a
baby squirming in your lap.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest works, those she made during an 1872 sojourn in
Spain, are academic with a liberal dash of Manet, full of fans,
mantillas, smiling senoritas, and toreadors. There are no
backgrounds to speak of. Figures, half-length or busts, are her
focus _ and would remain so. Later on, her trees, gardens, and
ponds were backdrops for the people _ exquisitely constructed, but
secondary nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a stagy look to the figures in the first room, as if
they were characters in a production of ``Carmen.'' Theatricality
of a different sort comes in the next. After settling in Paris in
1874, Cassatt saw a Degas pastel of dancers in a dealer's window.
``I saw art as I wanted to see it,'' she later wrote. ``I began to
live.'' Degas became her closest friend among the Impressionists,
and his influence is obvious in the theater interiors she began to
paint. But while he zeroed in on the performers' half, she was
interested in the audience's. In Parisian theaters where the house
lights sometimes stayed on so audience members could see one
another as well as the stage, she painted pictures of people
peering through opera glasses at the occupants of the opposite
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreground of ``At the Francais, a Sketch'' is a woman
clad in black: Cassatt shared Degas's and Manet's love of that most
dramatic of colors. The woman leans forward, her posture suggesting
self-assurance. Behind her are delightfully sketchy figures,
defined by only a few swift strokes. Theaters also afforded
opportunities to paint exaggerated lighting, and Cassatt reveled in
the further complication of mirrors, part of the furnishings of the
boxes. The mirrors, like the opera glasses, are also clues that the
true subject of these paintings is the act of seeing.
</P>
<P>
   She's as good with whites as with blacks. In the 1878 ``Portrait
of a Lady,'' she uses whites from creamy to gray, the restricted
palette reminiscent of Sargent's.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1878 ``Portrait of a Little Girl,'' Cassatt signals her
unwillingness to go gooey over kids. (Unlike Sargent, a fellow
expat, Cassatt didn't do many commissioned portraits and so was
freed from the need to flatter.) This child is overprivileged and
insouciant, sunk into an upholstered chair whose zingy turquoise
repeats through the room. The child's face is tightly painted; her
chic tartan accessories are more loosely brushed, and by the
painting's bottom, the floral upholstery fabric has turned into a
jungle of strokes that daringly disperse to reveal bare canvas. The
virtual abstraction and sheer wildness of Cassatt's backgrounds are
more in tune with late-20th-century sensibilities than the actual
faces are.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western painting had spent centuries figuring out how to
articulate anatomy under clothing; Cassatt's generation, under the
influence of Japanese prints, deliberately made bodies flat and
featureless again. A stunning example is the mid-1880s ``Portrait
of Alexander J. Cassatt and His Son Robert Kelso Cassatt,'' whose
flat black suits merge, as if the son were growing out of the
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn'' is a poignant portrait of Cassatt's sister, Lydia,
who was dying of Bright's disease. Cassatt makes her look as if
she's dissolving under clothes painted in loose hatchmarks the
colors of autumn leaves. Nearby hangs a selection of the MFA's
Japanese prints, of the sort Cassatt collected, the one nearest
``Autumn'' in a strikingly similar palette. A good number of
Cassatt's own spectacular and innovative prints are also in the
show _ truthful records of women's daily lives, calm expanses of
color contained by lyrical line. They're obviously hers, yet how
different their serenity is from the exuberant, spontaneous
brushwork of the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Cassatt died the same year Monet did _ 1926. But, unlike
Impressionism's founding father, she didn't keep painting to the
end, didn't achieve the sort of glorious breakthrough into the 20th
century that he did. Monet's failing eyesight was saved by surgery;
Cassatt's couldn't be. Ultimately, she went blind. In her later
years, this strong-minded woman devoted herself to building
American collections. She was a notable holdout in the public
subscription to keep Manet's great ``Olympia'' in France. A
one-woman predecessor of the Getty Museum, she was determined to
see as many great European paintings as possible cross the
Atlantic. Happily, for American museums including the MFA, many of
those paintings are hers.

BLAST DOESN'T GENERATE MUCH COMIC HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BLAST FROM THE PAST 
Directed by: Hugh Wilson 
Screenplay by: Wilson, Bill Kelly 
Starring: Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken, Sissy Spacek, Alicia
Silverstone, Dave Foley, Joey Slotnick, Rex Linn 
Running time: 106 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (brief language, sex and drug references) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Blast from the Past'' isn't enough of a blast. It's a one-joke
comedy about a Los Angeles family that descended into a bomb
shelter in 1962 and doesn't emerge until 35 years later. The
trouble is that they aren't given much to come out to. What could
have been a funny fish-out-of-water comedy makes you wish they had
stayed behind in the shelter, where life, consisting mostly of
monomania amid '60s kitsch and survivalist trappings, is a lot
wackier than anything above ground. There life has gone downhill,
from postwar crackerbox suburbia to a world of porn shops and biker
bars. You'd think the latter would generate some excitement. But
no.
</P>
<P>
   That means Brendan Fraser, as the cocooned man-child named,
unfortunately, Adam, is mostly left spinning his wheels. He goes
into his Encino Man and George of the Jungle mode when he isn't
focusing on Alicia Silverstone's streetwise woman named _ you
guessed it _ Eve. He thinks he's found the very model of the girl
from Pasadena his mother suggested he marry. She's anything but
that, yet she's at one with the film's overall sweetness. Adam's
innocence and guile are catnip to Eve, who has learned to expect
ignoble behavior from the men she can't seem to shake. She'd like
to get something going with the hunky Adam, if she can feel it's OK
to stop babysitting him in present-day LA.
</P>
<P>
   As depicted here, present-day LA is more dispirited than
dangerous. The bright artificial environment of the bomb shelter
exerts a cartoony pull, alongside which the X-rated stuff above it
seems one big dead battery. Also, Adam's parents, played by
Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek, are funnier than Adam and Eve.
They're eccentric, yet convincingly sweet and loving, and come much
closer to three-dimensionality than the others. Walken persuades us
he's a straight-shooter, a bright enough engineer to have designed
and built the shelter and everything in it. Yet he's just
convincingly myopic enough to enable us to believe he's gone around
the bend on the subject of the Commies he's sure are lurking
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But what they thought was the Big Atomic Bang that drove them
into their shelter in a hurry was in fact a pilotless fighter plane
nose-diving into their house. In her blind, unquestioning belief
that her husband knows everything, Sissy Spacek is both the
funniest and most endearing character in the film. She should play
comedy more often, to judge by the colors she brings to her
character's manic cheerfulness and rage for domesticity here. Of
course, the writers of ``Blast from the Past'' should have written
more comedy. The actors are likable enough. They just don't have
enough comic fallout to work with.

A MASTER OF CHIASTIC CLASSICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when I don't have something to write about, I have to write
about something. So why not celebrate the forthcoming publication
of ``Never Let a Fool Kiss You or a Kiss Fool You,'' a collection
of 8,000 examples of chiasmus, edited by Bedford psychologist and
management consultant Mardell Grothe.
</P>
<P>
   Derived from the Greek word for cross, chiasmus is a rhetorical
``contrast by reverse parallelism,'' according to my Funk &AMP;
Wagnalls. The Roman orator Cicero scored one of the earliest
examples of chiasmus: ``One should eat to live, not live to eat.''
John F. Kennedy scored one of most famous: ``Ask not what your
country, etc., etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Grothe is a man on a mission. ``This book is my attempt to bring
chiasmus out of obscurity and move it into the world of popular
parlance,'' he e-motes. ``Just think about the history of the word
`oxymoron.' Fifty years ago, it was obscure, known only by a
handful of scholars and word freaks. Today, all literate people
know what it means. I believe the same thing can happen with
chiasmus'' _ OK, OK, I get the message.
</P>
<P>
   When I last wrote about Grothe three years ago, he had assembled
only 5,000 chiastic expressions, and he didn't have a book contract
with Viking/Penguin, which plans to release ``Fool'' as a hardcover
illustrated book at summer's end. He overlooks few chiastic
classics, including this exchange in which a longtime female
resident of Alaska explains the chances of finding a man to a
newcomer: ``The odds are good, but the goods are odd.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Onward and upward
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was that a glossy art magazine I saw peeping out from the rack
at Star Market? Yes, it's a relative newcomer called Arts Around
Boston, which has been selling a few hundred copies on Hub
newsstands for about a year. It's pretty good. It's different from
the more established, better-edited and -written Art New England;
AAB reports on literature, drama, music, and all of the applied
arts.
</P>
<P>
   Arts Around Boston, with a print run of 50,000 and a mostly
controlled circulation _ meaning that most copies are either given
away at galleries or mailed free to subscribers in the art world _
has a long way to go to catch up with Art New England, which is
celebrating its 20th anniversary. On the other hand, AAB has come a
long way in a very short time. Just four years ago former art
teacher Barbara Rizza Mellin started a quarterly magazine called
Pleiades on the North Shore. She quickly changed the name _ ``We
realized that no one had any idea what the name meant'' _ to Arts
North for three years. ``People started asking, `Why aren't you
Arts South? Why aren't you Arts Boston?' So we decided to expand
our circulation and coverage area.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellin says AAB is operating in the black, and starting this
summer will convert from quarterly to bimonthly publication.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rx for writers?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone noticed that more talented, successful, and readable
writers have come out of the Harvard Medical School than from the
famed University of Iowa Writers Workshop? Here's a list of writers
who've either studied or taught at HMS: Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Michael Crichton, Robin Cook, Samuel Shem, Ethan Canin, Robert
Coles, Perri Klass, Atul Gawande, Jerome Groopman, and the late
Lewis Thomas. They can write, and they can stitch.
</P>
<P>
   I ran this idea by the Iowans, who did not exactly take to it.
The program secretary rattled off an impressive, if occasionally
obscure, list of names: John Irving, Philip Levine (?), William
Stafford (``I believe he's a fiction writer''), John Gardner,
Raymond Carver, Alan Gurganus, Jane Smiley, T. C. Boyle, Bharati
Mukherjee (``She's written a lot of books''), James Tate (?), Rita
Dove, Denis Johnson (``He's hugely famous''), Jorie Graham (?),
John Edgar Wideman, W. P. Kinsella, Donald Justice (?), Galway
Kinnell (the flutist?), Tracy Kidder, Wallace Stegner, and Oakley
Hull (``a man and a fiction writer'').
</P>
<P>
   My testy interlocutor ended with: ``Flannery O'Connor _ do you
know who she was?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
That beautiful, romantic David Lean film I swooned over in an
earlier column was ``Brief Encounter,'' not ``Brief Interlude,'' as
I had it. &QL;

PLOT, COMEDY GET LOST IN `MARTIAN'

MY FAVORITE MARTIAN 
Directed by: Donald Petrie 
Screenplay by: Sherri Stoner &AMP; Deanna Oliver 
Starring: Jeff Daniels, Christopher Lloyd, Elizabeth Hurley, Daryl
Hannah, Wallace Shawn, Christine Ebersole, Michael Lerner, Ray
Walston, Shelley Malid 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: PG (some crude humor, action-violence, sensuality, partial
nudity and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can at least be said that the arrival on the big screen of
``My Favorite Martian'' reduces by one the number of overextended
film versions of old TV sitcoms that remain for us to sit through.
It's not that this recycling is devoid of talent. Christopher Lloyd
is a farceur who can bulge his eyes with the best of them, and
does, as the Martian stranded on Earth, trying to repair his
disabled spaceship and get home before being discovered. The
problem is that he's only got so much to bulge them about. As is so
often the case with this sub-genre, ``My Favorite Martian'' plays
like a half-hour show stretched into 90 minutes _ and straining at
every seam.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the charm of the original, which ran on TV from 1963 to
1966 and starred Ray Walston as the stranded Martian, was its
kitchen sink quality. It looked thrown together on a
nickel-and-dime budget, which was OK because most of TV looked the
same and it was one of the accepted conventions. The new film,
lacking incident, fills the time with a lot of state-of-the-art
computer wizardry. But it's no morphing glory. As Lloyd's Martian
and the others step up the shape-changing and size-changing to fill
the ever more gaping absence of story, the computer effects nullify
themselves and the film resignedly hands itself over to overdone
farcical knockabout.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the newspaper reporter who discovers the Martian
(played by the late Bill Bixby on TV) has perhaps inevitably been
turned into a TV reporter, this time played by Jeff Daniels. While
Daniels has few peers when it comes to negotiating dumb and dumber
stuff, he's pretty much stuck with comic consternation here, as the
film lamely goes through the motions of having Daniels's reporter
think he loves Elizabeth Hurley's spoiled and talentless on-air
diva. Thanks to a push from Lloyd's Martian, he finally comes
around to realizing that he really loves Daryl Hannah's
down-to-earth good-sport camerawoman.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no getting around the fact Lloyd and the others find
material no easier to come by here than water on arid Mars. That
the motions grow increasingly frantic can't hide the fact that ``My
Favorite Martian'' is only going through the motions and is
eventually upstaged by the pretty environs of Santa Barbara, which
isn't even trying. Even the presence of Walston himself, as the
government heavy in charge of tracking Lloyd's zany Martian, does
little to alter the inescapable conclusion that this ``My Favorite
Martian'' reincarnation is more likely to find favor with the
undemanding than the nostalgia-minded.

HARD TO GET CONGRESS TO DENOUNCE RACIST GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a barely tempered incredulity, Robert Wexler cracked that
he now had ``bipartisan'' support. This was Wednesday, when Mike
Forbes of New York became just the first and so far the only
Republican in the US House of Representatives to co-sponsor a
resolution condemning the Council of Conservative Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate Mr. Forbes for his courage in being the
first Republican, but this should not be a partisan issue,'' said
Wexler, a Florida Democrat. ``Here we have a clear example of
racism and a white supremacist dogma. Apparently, in some quarters,
this is not worthy of attention. That is bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes joined 52 Democrats who so far support the resolution,
which was sent to members last week by Wexler and James Clyburn of
South Carolina. The resolution reminded Congress that the group is
descended from the White Citizens Councils of the 1950s and '60s,
the suit and tie side of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   It said the council ``promotes racism, divisiveness, and
intolerance through its newsletter, World Wide Web site, and public
discourse,'' and ``promulgates dogma that supports white supremacy
and anti-Semitism'' and ``provides access to, and opportunities for
the promotion of, extremist neo-Nazi ideology and propaganda that
incites hate crimes and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Conservative Citizens was little known until it
was reported that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott spoke to the
group several times in the 1990s and hosted council officials in
his office in 1997. Other powerful politicians who have spoken
before the council include House Judiciary Committee member Bob
Barr, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms and
Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler's staff contacted Lott's office 10 days ago to ask Lott
to introduce a similar resolution in the Senate. Wexler has not
heard back from Lott. ``In fairness, we know he's tied up with
impeachment, but it is important that he address the issue,''
Wexler said. ``It is fair for Americans to question the association
of members of Congress with a group that stands for bigotry and
racism. We're way past the point in 1999 where we can push it under
the rug. I'm not looking for anybody's scalp or to embarrass
anybody in Congress. We're looking to embarrass the council for
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress found it easy to embarrass black hate in 1994, voting
97-0 in the Senate and 361-34 in the House to condemn the vicious
anti-Jewish, antiwhite, antigay idiocies of Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
National media pressure rained down on prominent African-Americans
to denounce Muhammad and forced Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan to demote his top aide.
</P>
<P>
   But that same year, white senators refused to reprimand Senator
Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Hollings, who has referred to
black people as ``darkies'' and Latinos as ``wetbacks,'' said
African heads of state are cannibals who come to international
conferences to ``get a square meal'' instead of ``eating each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   It took no courage for Congress to stomp on Muhammad, who runs
little except his mouth. Wexler's resolution gives Congress another
chance to attack bigotry within its own house, a bigotry at its
most dangerous because no one knows how much of it informs the
running of this country by men like Lott.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question of the re-segregationist agenda of the
Council of Conservative Citizens when four of the seven hotlinks
listed on the home page for former Klan leader David Duke link back
to the Council of Conservative Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question when the council's Web page hotlinks to
Southern Independence, a page featuring a Confederate flag and a
portrait and quotation of Nathan Bedford Forrest. Forrest traded
slaves. He was a Confederate general. He founded the KKK.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no question of the council's links to anti-Semitism
as several sites that praise the council in hotlinks to it bait
Jews in a way that would spur Muhammad to a Nazi salute.
</P>
<P>
   Many links deny the Holocaust and sell T-shirts with swastikas
and Nazi stormtrooper symbols. Many sites claim, like Muhammad,
that Jews ``suck the blood'' of everyone else, wrapping their
``parasitical tentacles'' so tightly around Wall Street, the media,
and the entertainment industry that we should be called the
``Jewnited Snakes of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for their hatred of equal rights for women, gay
men, and lesbian women, immigrants of color, rights for anyone who
is not a white, Christian male. That is why Wexler finds it hard to
believe that the same Republicans who moved so quickly to condemn
Muhammad are so uniformly silent about a white organization
associated with the same kind of hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that everyone would join in this resolution,''
Wexler said. ``In fairness, it may not be the first thing on
everyone's agenda, but in one week, apparently 48 (now 52)
Democrats had the time to sign it. Why is it appropriate for this
body to condemn racism by black people but not in this case? There
is not one positive thing about the council. It represents the
worst in America.''

prominent and sometimes confrontational role could hamper his

be allowed to adopt children under bills filed by Rep. Warren
Chisum, R-Pampa, and Rep. Robert Talton R-Pasadena. Chisum and
Talton say that children are better off in traditional family
situations. Opponents note that gays and lesbians often adopt
children with ``special needs'' who might not be adopted otherwise,

LINCOLN, DARWIN AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE KINDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ History is full of triumph, blunder and
opportunity. It is also full of coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 12, 1809, under very different circumstances and in very
different nations, two monumental figures in history first drew
breath.
</P>
<P>
   One baby was born in Shrewsbury, England. Grandson of a poet, he
grew up in middle-class comfort, taking an early interest in
beetles and tidepools. Later, he turned his attention to turtles.
When he was 50, he wrote a book, ``On the Origin of Species by
Means of Natural Selection,'' that shook the world. His name was
Charles Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   The other baby was born in Kentucky, in a one-room log cabin
with a dirt floor. Elected president a year after Darwin's
sensational treatise, he took office one month before the start of
the Civil War and died one week after it ended. His name, of
course, was Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin and Lincoln share more than a joint birthday and mutual
immortality. Together, their ideas form a vision of the human
condition so wide in its scope we can still feel its impact today.
For Darwin, through his scientific work, showed us where we come
from; Lincoln, through word and deed, showed us where we can go.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's great contribution was the ``theory'' of evolution _
theory being a misnomer because, with rare exceptions, the reality
of evolution is now accepted by all scientists. Using evolution,
Darwin was the first person to explain what had been, without
recourse to God, utterly inexplicable: the diversity and
adaptability of nature and all its creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is driven, Darwin successfully proved, by natural
selection. It rewards the strong, axes the weak and operates
coldly, continuously _ without conscience or moral focus. Since
mankind is just another species, this applies to us too.
</P>
<P>
   While Darwin's portrait of nature and our place in the natural
world is undeniably brilliant, it's also extremely bleak. Honor,
kindness, compassion _ all the virtues of being human _ none of
this matters to nature. Even being human doesn't matter. Life is a
harsh, cold process; ripeness is all.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the doctrine of one of history's greatest scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln was not one of history's greatest scholars. In fact, he
wasn't a scholar at all; he was a lawyer, and _ like our current
president, his House prosecutors and his 100 Senate ``jurors'' _ a
professional politician. And like any politician, he was cunning,
pragmatic, self-serving and slick, and aware at all times of the
power of public speaking to further his aims.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also an idealist. Lincoln saw mankind as possessed of
a noble destiny, one far above Darwinian survival in nature.
Indeed, it was a destiny which ran counter to nature. Because while
nature favors the strong, humanity at its best plays no favorites;
government ``of the people, by the people, for the people'' does
not mean _ as Lincoln himself said in another context _ some of the
people some of the time. It always means everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, seldom naive about anything, did not believe that
simply having a special destiny guaranteed achieving it; when he
referred to ``the better angels of our nature,'' he was calling on
them, not counting on them.
</P>
<P>
   But he had faith that with patience, self-sacrifice and
forgiveness (``with malice toward none; with charity for all,''
those precious human impulses which contribute nothing to our
survival), humanity had the tools to crawl out of the muck of
nature and set up at least one country where equality meant
equality before the law and before God, not equality before the
rigorous hammer of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism of Lincoln's vision is a powerful and necessary
complement to Darwin's own vision, which itself is so moving and
powerful. We should thank Darwin for showing us our rightful place
in nature; we should thank Lincoln for telling us that we have the
capacity, all of us, to rise above it.

IT'S SILLY TO PLAY FAVORITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ I can see the sports future. I can tell you exactly what
will happen three months from now. I am clairvoyant. I read no
palms and need no tarot cards. Jeane Dixon? She had nothing on me,
baby. Now have a seat and let me tell you why something strange is
getting ready to happen in the NBA's Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Well, before we get to that, it is only fair that I _ to
paraphrase James Brown _ jump back and dis myself.
</P>
<P>
   I am the one who told you last month that there would be no pro
basketball until October 1999. Less than 24 hours after I wrote
that, the players and owners had an agreement to play _ in
February. There was also my first year as a journalist, when my
assignment was predicting high school football scores in Ohio. The
teams I wrote about played in something called the Suburban League,
which was appropriate. All the teams looked just like the
Midwestern 'burbs: a collection of identical strip malls and
two-lane highways. I was so good at picking scores that a coach
once begged me to pick his players to lose. He said his team was
undefeated and doubled its usual offensive output every time I
picked them to lose. So I did what I do best. I picked his team to
win, and of course, it lost.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not talk about the past, OK? The current makeup of the
East is much more interesting. It will be won by a team that has no
business winning it. Trust me. It is already beginning to take
shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are supposed to win the East. They won't. The Heat
are supposed to win the Atlantic (and some hacker using my byline
picked them to win the conference). They won't. In fact, they will
finish behind the Celtics. The Knicks and Nets? No chance. Lenny
Wilkens is a pleasant man and has won more games than any other
coach in history, but his Hawks won't win, either. If the Raptors
win, say your final I-love-yous and goodbyes because that will
signify the end of the world. The Celtics, 76ers, Pistons, or
Magic? Definite contenders. Absolutely. One of them will be in the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a secret: You don't have to be a registered soothsayer to
know this. All you have to do is observe injuries, look at practice
schedules, and disregard any talk of ``learning the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Many had speculated that the lockout-shortened season would
cause a legion of unconditioned players to go through an epidemic
of sprains, strains, tears, and pulls. That has not happened.
Certainly, players such as the Heat's Jamal Mashburn and Voshon
Lenard and the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell are injured. But the amount
of NBA injuries now is comparable to the amount of injuries in
other seasons. The difference is timing.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn said he will probably miss six weeks. Sprewell could
miss six weeks. Under regular circumstances, both players would
still have half a season to play. Not now. If they have even a
10-day setback during rehabilitation, which is normal, they could
return with less than a month remaining in the season. And think
about this: If the lockout had occurred during the 1985-86 season,
we wouldn't be talking about a young Michael Jordan's 63-point game
against the Celtics at Boston Garden. It wouldn't exist. The '85-86
season was the one in which MJ broke his left foot and missed 64
games. He was able to come back in the spring of '86 and lead the
Bulls into the playoffs. With the current 50-game setup, Jordan
would have been done for the year and the Bulls never would have
been in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Teams such as the Pacers and Hawks should be shuddering in the
shadow of history. That's because history tells us that a starter
on a good team is almost guaranteed to be injured. It has already
happened to Pat Riley's Heat. And despite his public statements
that the team will make do with scrubs such as Jamie Watson, Mark
Davis, and, possibly, Blue Edwards, Riley has to know his team will
be blessed to win 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to Larry Bird's Pacers. Does this bunch scare
you? I think they are one injury away from booking a flight to
Secaucus, N.J., for the lottery. Their average age is 32, old for
the NBA. Someone will get injured. The Hawks have invited the
injury vibe into their homes by signing the porcelain LaPhonso
Ellis. An 82-game season helps teams such as the Pacers and Hawks.
A season such as this one benefits young players, players who can
run for hours and play for days. If I were playing a pickup game
and had to choose from the rosters of the Celtics and Pacers, I
would pick Bird first and then fill the rest of my team with young
men in green.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, wait a minute. Excuse me? Did I hear someone snickering at
the clairvoyant one? Did I hear someone say this is not about
pickup ball? Yes it is. We have long complained about heavyhanded
coaches controlling the games. Well, they don't have time anymore.
They don't have time to squeeze players into systems because
everyone has fewer than 20 practices remaining for the rest of the
season. If you don't already know what your coach wants? Sorry. Too
late.
</P>
<P>
   That means improvisation takes over. Spontaneity takes over. Raw
talent takes over. In that environment, I'd take Allen Iverson over
Mark Jackson. I'd take Grant Hill over anybody. I'd take Penny
Hardaway over any healthy Knick. I'd rather have Paul Pierce, Ron
Mercer (who is almost ready to play), and Antoine Walker than Tim
Hardaway, Alonzo Mourning, and Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   None of these theories applies to the West because there are
still four teams there (Lakers, Rockets, Jazz, Spurs) with superior
talent compared to the rest of the conference. That's not the case
in the East. So get ready for an improbable finalist.
</P>
<P>
   You ask how I know these things. I am clairvoyant. I see the
future. I have already seen ahead to draft day and know who the
Patriots will acquire. He's a running back. His name is Edgerrin
James. But that's our secret, all right?

WORKERS, UNITE! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITE, the union that made Kathie Lee Gifford the poster girl
for the antisweatshop movement, and I have more in common than you
might think.
</P>
<P>
   It's got nothing to do with left-of-Trotsky politics and
everything to do with our basic needs, day in, day out: Unions and
columnists always need a supply of fresh targets.
</P>
<P>
   The art is in picking those targets.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, UNITE _ the Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and
Textile Employees _ has campaigned against Nike sneakers and Guess
jeans. Now the New York-based union has launched its latest jihad
against New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc., accusing the Boston company
of taking advantage of workers from China to Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: New Balance boss Jim Davis has built a good
company in a tough business and has done it by making athletic
shoes in this country. Virtually no one else is doing that.
</P>
<P>
   If UNITE needs new material, however, it need not look far.
While Davis has been building New Balance into the world's fourth
largest athletic shoe company, not far away in Stoughton Paul
Fireman has been destroying Reebok International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, management and workers want the same thing: a
well-run company, one built to last. Put simply, Davis has done
that at New Balance; Fireman has not at Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Which guy would you want running your company? The results speak
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With sales falling because kids finally got tired of paying
silly prices for sneakers, New Balance sales are up 36 percent in
two years to a projected $750 million. Employment has climbed a
third to 1,600 in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok, on the other hand, has lost market share for eight years
in a row. In the most recent quarter, Reebok lost $7 million after
seeing earnings decline an astounding 77 percent the previous
quarter. US employment is down about 600 jobs to 3,600 in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Fireman, Reebok simply got lost. Each bump in the road has
brought a new marketing direction, and today Reebok's brand stands
for nothing. Fireman has shuffled executives like Dan Duquette does
his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   While Reebok has stuffed millions into the pockets of Shaq and
other spoiled athletes, New Balance is proudly the company
``endorsed by no one.'' Instead, Davis has focused on making all
his decidedly utilitarian running shoes in widths from 2A to 4E so
that they fit, something no other shoe company has done.
</P>
<P>
   UNITE is upset that New Balance, which has made much of its
``made in America'' image, is manufacturing more shoes in low-wage
China. Last year New Balance made about half its shoes in Boston,
Lawrence, and Maine and the rest in China. That number could fall
to 40 percent this year, the company says, because US plants cannot
keep up with sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the shift to China, New Balance has about 1,000 US
factory workers making or assembling shoes at an average wage of
$10 an hour. Total domestic production has more than doubled since
1994. A sixth US plant is set to go on line this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the number of shoes Nike and Reebok make in America
combined: zero. And the union is picking on the guy who will make
or assemble 5 million shoes here this year?
</P>
<P>
   Davis is stubborn. He went to war with the Federal Trade
Commission over his made-in-America labeling for his shoes. He's
balked at negotiating a contract with workers in his Lawrence
distribution center because he says many of his workers don't want
to have to join the union. Most executives would work out a deal
and get on with life. Not Davis.
</P>
<P>
   UNITE could still provide a real service. In 1995 Fireman told
shareholders he would either fix the company in two years or step
aside. We're still waiting for him to do either.
</P>
<P>
   If UNITE were to give Fireman the old Kathie Lee treatment, he
might decide he wants to spend more time in that 27,000-square-foot
palace he's built off the 11th green on The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fireman, lace on those ruby Reeboks, click your heels
together, and repeat after me: There's no place like home, there's
no place like home.

   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. _ Yosemite National Park, home to
some of the most spectacular mountain scenery on the planet, can be
an ugly place on a summer weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic clogs the valley, tourists overrun the most popular
trails, humanity overwhelms nature's solitude.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, though, it is transformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yosemite in winter is a different place,'' said Keith Walklet,
who worked at the park for 14 years before leaving last month for a
new career as a nature photographer. ``A different place with a
different pace. That solitude is a lot easier to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Park visitation drops by 80 percent in the winter, Walklet said.
And this winter, that figure is even lower because of road repairs
that close the park's main entry highway for much of each day.
</P>
<P>
   On a winter weekday, tourists can stop at the deserted Crane
Flat campground and ski or snowshoe through the forest without
seeing another person. They can drive into Yosemite Valley at
sunset without encountering more than a handful of other cars. They
can have dinner at the Yosemite Lodge in a dining room where
two-thirds of the tables are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   And, if they love the outdoors with a chill in the air, they can
enjoy Yosemite in a way that most of the world misses. Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   At 4,000 feet in elevation, Yosemite Valley receives only a
fraction of the snow that buries the 7,000-foot plateaus that
surround it. Its spectacular waterfalls continue to flow; its views
are brushed with a frosting of white. Valley trails are accessible
on foot most of the winter, and those rare times when they are
buried in snow make for a delightful and non-strenuous
cross-country ski or snowshoe tour.
</P>
<P>
   When the light is just right, Half Dome is reflected on the
surface of the ice skating rink in Curry Village. One of the few
outdoor rinks in California, the rink offers skating every day from
late October to March, barring a warm spell. Each 2-1/2-hour
session costs $5; skate rentals are available for $2.
</P>
<P>
   Nature walks, snowshoe walks and camera walks are lead by
naturalists and photographers to introduce tourists to the park.
The free walks are offered in different sections of the park
throughout the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Badger Pass, a short drive from Yosemite Valley, is California's
original ski area. Known for being beginner-friendly, Badger offers
free midweek lift tickets to skiers who stay at park lodging. It
also is the hub of 90 miles of cross-country ski trails, including
the 10.5-mile groomed trail to Glacier Point. There are no trail
fees for cross-country skiing in Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight and multiday back-country tours offer a unique winter
experience to hardy visitors. In addition to the Glacier Point
tour, the Yosemite Cross Country Ski School offers one-and
two-night snow camping expeditions starting at $95, and six-day
trans-Sierra and back-country tours starting at $435.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the riverside Housekeeping Camp, Yosemite's
accommodations are open year-round, most with discounted rates
December through March. From a $3 wilderness permit for snow
camping to a $35 canvas tent cabin in Curry Village to a $250 room
at the Ahwahnee Hotel, the park offers a place to stay for the
plucky or the pampered.
</P>
<P>
   For park reservations, call (209) 252-4848. Information is
available on the Web at www.yosemitepark.com. There is a $20 fee
for each car entering the park.
</P>
<P>
   (Chris Coursey writes for The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa,
Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Glacier Point Ski Trip
</P>
<P>
   The trip: Guides from the Yosemite Cross Country Ski School lead
groups of five to 20 skiers along 10.5 miles of intermediate,
groomed tracks to the Glacier Point Lodge. The trip includes lunch,
dinner, breakfast and lunch the second day, and dormitory-style
accommodations at the Glacier Point Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Who can go: Experienced skiers 14 and older who can ski with a
pack for 21 miles.
</P>
<P>
   When: Trips leave on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and
Sundays. Most Saturday slots already are booked.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $110 per skier. Two-night trips are available for $150.

IT'S A PERFECT 10 FOR EARNHARDT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ He has come to Daytona International
Speedway 10 times this decade, and each time, Dale Earnhardt has
emerged the winner of his heat in the Gatorade Twin 125s.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has been so dominant in the qualifying races that
maybe they ought to think about renaming them after him. Something
along the lines of Dale's Doubleheader or the Dale-tona Twin 125s,
perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who snapped an 0-for-19 streak by winning his first
Daytona 500 last year, earned the fourth starting spot in the
43-car grid for Sunday's 500-miler by capturing the second half of
Thursday's Twin 125s, marking his 12th overall victory and 10th in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty awesome in itself,'' Earnhardt said. ``You don't
know why. All I can say is, I love Daytona and have a great race
team. It has just worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt chuckled and added, ``I come back every year thinking,
`This is going to be the year I lose the qualifying race.' And then
we go out and win it again. It makes you feel proud of the team.
Everybody's support was tremendous. I don't know how to explain it.
It was just a great run for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte won the first Twin 125 to earn the No. 3 starting
spot, visiting Victory Lane at Daytona for the first time in his
career. Labonte, the pole sitter for last year's Daytona 500, made
a bold maneuver on Lap 39 to overtake Jeff Gordon, who won the pole
for the 1999 Daytona 500 last Saturday with a fast lap of 195.067
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to pass in a 50-lap race,'' said Labonte, driver of
the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix, who became the
first Pontiac driver to win a Twin 125 since Bobby Allison in 1981.
``Everyone was just trying to feel their cars out. But there was a
lot more side-by-side racing up in the front pack of the first show
than there was in the second.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because once Earnhardt overtook Tony Stewart on Lap 8,
narrowly averting a collision with the Winston Cup rookie when he
was forced onto the grass on the backstretch, no one else
challenged for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go as fast in qualifying as I wanted to,'' said
Earnhardt, who went 193.865 m.p.h. during Busch Pole
qualifications. ``But we got in that race and the car was just
perfect. All week long in practice, we adjusted a small amount and
tuned a little bit. We really didn't do a lot of anything. We ran
the car and I said, `OK, that feels good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me what I wanted to change, and I said, `Well, I
don't know.' The car just drove so good, and it proved to be that
way today. It drove perfect every lap.''
</P>
<P>
   After departing Hendrick Motorsports last year, Ricky Craven, a
native of Newburgh, Maine, showed up at Daytona this year with no
provisionals of previous owner points to his name and needing to
run the race of his life in the Twin 125s to make the show. He did
so _ barely making the cut _ by steering his No. 58 Hollywood Video
Ford to a 14th-place finish in the second qualifying heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been scared to death since Monday because I knew we were
going to have to race our way in and there's no security in that,''
said Craven, who will start in Row 14 in the 28th position.
``There's mechanical issues, there's the accidents, but everybody
here passed the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Other New Englanders who made the field included Kevin Lepage of
Shelburne, Vt. (14th starting spot), and Jerry Nadeau of Danbury,
Conn. (25th).

`MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE' A SOGGY ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE 
Directed by: Luis Mandoki 
Screenplay by: Gerald DiPiego (novel: Nicholas Sparks) 
Starring: Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, Paul Newman, John
Savage, Illeana Douglas, Robbie Coltrane 
Running time: 126 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (a scene of sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle,'' a would-be Valentine-themed date movie,
wants to be hopelessly romantic. But it's only hopelessly soggy,
wasting good performances by Kevin Costner as a taciturn North
Carolina boat builder emotionally numbed since his wife died two
years earlier, and Robin Wright Penn as a divorced newspaper
researcher and single mom. The story is set in motion when she
discovers the bottle into which he placed a heartfelt and eloquent
love letter to his dying wife. Sensing a good story, she sells the
idea to her boss at The Chicago Tribune, Robbie Coltrane's
tough-on-the-outside but soft-on-the-inside columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane publishes the message in his column and she goes off to
find its sender. What happens when they meet occurs more on the
personal level than the professional. She feels herself drawn to
the pure-hearted man who's still so bottled up at the loss of his
wife that he can't bring himself to complete the small craft that
was to have been named after her. Wright's Theresa and Costner's
Garret are simpatico, but he has trouble opening up. When his
father, a fresh breath of salt air played by Paul Newman, tells him
to choose either the past or the future and urges him to follow her
back to Chicago, he does.
</P>
<P>
   Things go well for a while, until he discovers that she used the
letter, so intimate and personal to him, as a career builder. So
the embryonic romance, which included a rapport between Theresa's
son and Garret, hits a snag. He retreats, but not so far as to be
beyond the reach of a tear-jerker ending. It's a formula that has
worked hundreds of times in the past, but here it begins taking on
water pretty quickly, due to the sluggish and overblown visual
style of Luis Mandoki. There are too many vistas. Not that Maine,
subbing for North Carolina, doesn't look pretty, or that its
horizontal planes of beach and sea don't contrast with the spiky
verticals of Theresa's skyscraper-dominated Chicago skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to emphasize Garret's breadth and Theresa's edgy
nervousness. But Mandoki would have done better to take his cue
from Costner's spare performance as Garret, playing warmth against
bleak minimalism. It's a becomingly understated performance of an
understated man, but one that allows some believable depths to be
felt as well. Wright Penn is always a sentient screen presence and
the anxieties she projects here are persuasive, too. Also, you
can't help sharing the pleasure you feel Newman takes in playing
the curmudgeonly but feeling old-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd have thought even 10 years ago that Newman would become
the new Walter Brennan? But Newman apparently thinks so, and it's
hugely rewarding to watch him shed the burden of carrying romantic
lead roles and settle into juicy character acting. The trouble is
that nobody, including him, really is given enough to act. The
observations about love are simplistic and sentimental, and there's
little else in the script. Given the predictably linear plot, the
virtual absence of any diverting subplots, and Mandoki's lethargic
pacing, the actors spend a lot of time seeming stranded. ``Message
in a Bottle'' is waterlogged.

   What happens when your rainmaker goes dry?
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds managed by James Schmidt have been the runaway best
sellers at John Hancock for five years in a row, thanks to a long
track record of stellar investment performance.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's funds attracted $3 billion in their peak year of 1997
and accounted for about 65 cents of every new sales dollar at
Hancock. The $3 billion was actually more than the combined net
sales of the entire John Hancock fund family, but some of Schmidt's
money had sloshed in from other Hancock funds.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Schmidt was earning big returns within a narrow slice
of the market, focusing on bank stocks and, later, investments in
other financial services companies. When bank stocks fell hard in
the second half of last year, so did the sales momentum at
Schmidt's funds.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.4 billion John Hancock Financial Industries fund recorded
net sales of $1.5 billion in 1998, but practically all that money
arrived in the first half of the year. About $150 million moved out
of Financial Industries and into other Hancock funds during the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Customers pulled about $716 million out of John Hancock's $5.8
billion Regional Bank fund last year, including $339 million that
left the company entirely. Money is still going the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bank, the fund that made Schmidt a big name in the
financial services sector, had been closed to new customers between
March 1997 and last November. The fund generated net new sales
briefly when it reopened, but more money is leaving again.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's overall mutual fund sales turned on a dime with its
financial services funds last year. Strong net sales of $1.4
billion for the first two quarters of 1998 were followed by a
second half in which redemptions outpaced sales by about $550
million, according to Financial Research Corp. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't unusual for a star money manager to pull in the lion's
share of sales at a mutual fund company. MFS Investment Management
of Boston counted on manager John Ballen for more than 75 percent
of its sales around 1996, though his fund ranks third in MFS sales
today.
</P>
<P>
   But star sector managers pose a greater sales dilemma. Managers
can earn top ratings among their competitors but still perform
poorly and stop selling if their sector of the market falls out of
favor. The chances of a specific sector falling behind the pack at
some point are relatively high over time.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt isn't thinking about customer cash flows. He believes
that bank stocks have been beaten down too much, and he spends his
time trying to position his funds for a recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to manage money,'' said Schmidt. ``It isn't to carry
the load (at Hancock) or not carry it. I pretty much have been
encouraged to focus on that.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as if Schmidt's funds are suffering big investment
losses. After consecutive years of earning returns of 48 percent,
29 percent, and 54 percent, Regional Bank made a modest 1.4 percent
in 1998. Financial Industries earned 4.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hancock fund executives recognized that they had a
concentration problem long before bank stocks went cold. ``Our
number one strategic objective has been to diversify the company,
not just by product, but also by the partners we work with and the
types of business lines we were in,'' said Jim Bowhers, president
of John Hancock Funds Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Bowhers thinks that Schmidt's share of Hancock fund sales, which
fell from 65 percent in 1997 to about 50 percent last year, will
decline further this year, to about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock cut the compensation to wholesalers who sell the
company's bank stock funds by 25 percent last year and have reduced
the payout further, Bowhers said.
</P>
<P>
   It has increased the incentives, though not by the same degree,
for selling five other funds that Hancock has decided to promote
aggressively. Those five funds _ Independence Equity, Strategic
Income, Growth &AMP; Income, Sovereign Investors, and Emerging Growth _
target different but more mainstream investing options.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hancock has pushed harder into money-management lines
other than retail mutual funds. Those businesses account for $9.8
billion under management and a big part of Hancock's
diversification plan. The company manages about $26 billion in
mutual fund assets.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock jumped into the 401(k) market in 1997 and has attracted
about $2.5 billion so far. But 401(k) operations require
significant start-up expenses, and Bowhers said that Hancock
doesn't expect to start making money from the new venture until the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has also boosted its investment business with private
pension accounts and public retirement funds. The advisory
business, which managed $900 million in 1995, runs $6.8 billion
today. Big individual account wins, bringing in billions in 1996
and 1997, were the reason for the growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Hancock will still rely on mutual funds more than anything
else for new business this year. Unless bank stocks bounce bank, it
will have to do it by creating a new list of best sellers.

STILL PLAYING THE FIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like their forefathers, Mike Burns, Ian Feuer, and John Harkes
are seeking to escape oppression and/or find their fortune. But
they have reversed direction _ fleeing New England for England.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, dissatisfied with contract terms, has tried out for two
British teams, Hearts and Bolton Wanderers. Feuer, unhappy with the
prospect of being a backup to goalkeeper Walter Zenga, played
briefly for Rushden and Diamonds and had a tryout with First
Division Wolverhampton Wanderers. And Harkes, discarded by D.C.
United, is playing on loan for Nottingham Forest.
</P>
<P>
   At least they are in the Revolutionary spirit. Player-coach
Zenga has taken the team to Italy to expose the players to
authentic soccer culture.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has chosen to explore European soccer in a different way,
immersing himself in market forces by attempting to create or
enhance the demand for his services.
</P>
<P>
   He has failed tryouts with Utrecht in Holland and Hearts in
Scotland, but he does have an offer from Major League Soccer, and
there are dozens of countries yet explored, many hundreds of
professional teams for him to check out. In fact, while Burns was
training in Bolton, a potential opportunity opened in France,
according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   A decision from Bolton was due Friday (Feb. 12), according to
Burns's agent, Craig Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call Hearts a bad experience for Mike,'' Sharon
said. ``The club is struggling, the coach's job is on the line, and
they made a decision to add players who could score goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike had to explore opportunities. A lot of us apply for
multiple jobs, and they don't all work out. Does that affect his
power to negotiate with the (MLS)? No, because the league doesn't
negotiate?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three Revolution expatriates, only Burns has been counted
on to return. But that situation could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make some decisions,'' general manager Brian
O'Donovan said. ``If things don't work out for Mike this week, he's
not automatically out of our plans and we would certainly welcome
him back into the team. But we will have to try to start making
moves to fill his position.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran US players are apparently not in demand in Europe,
especially after the national team's poor World Cup showing.
Established clubs are pursuing young talents such as Frankie Hejduk
and Tony Sanneh, even 16-year-olds such as DeMarcus Beasley, an
Ajax recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer, who began playing in Europe at 16, will be traded to
another MLS team if he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another, Ian's talents will be put to better use,''
O'Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harkes could make a synergistic fit into the
Revolution's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes's salary, about $300,000, was considered unjustified by
D.C. United, which was in danger of exceeding the $1.8 million
salary cap imposed by the league, so the Revolution were able to
acquire him for draft choices. And at Nottingham Forest, Harkes has
relinquished his normal midfield role to play at right back _ which
just happens to be Burns's position.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have exhibitions scheduled next week against
Serie C clubs Carrarese and Prato. They will also meet Serie A and
B teams, if they are available, during their five-week stay.

BUILDING A `FOUNDATION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in November, when Brand Nubian's long-awaited comeback
album, ``Foundation,'' came out, hip-hop heads were standing on
lines, snatching up copies of Jay-Z's ``Hard Knock Life . . . Vol.
2'' and OutKast's ``Aquemeni.''
</P>
<P>
   Those three albums were released on the same day, but many
people overlooked Brand Nubian. ``Foundation'' should have debuted
at the top. Instead, ``Hard Knock Life'' took the No. 1 spot on the
Billboard Top 200 album chart, where it stayed for five weeks, the
first for a rap album. And ``Aquemini'' was nominated for a Grammy
for its single ``Rosa Parks,'' a funky song that has nothing to do
with civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   What helped those two albums was hype. Weeks before their
release, ads were splashed in hip-hop mags and publicists pushed
for articles. Brand Nubian, whose contract was bought out by Arista
Records, didn't get much publicity. Lord Jamar, one of the rappers
who makes up the foursome, said his group is the guinea pig for
Arista, which has never had a rap group signed directly to its
label. ``You've got to promote,'' Lord Jamar said, talking on his
celly from New York. ``People knew when Jay-Z and Outkast's (work)
was coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the group did well, making it to No. 3 on
Billboard's Rap Albums chart, and spinning off a hit single, the
old-school-style ``Don't Let It Go To Your Head.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand Nubian has come a long way since its debut album ``One For
All'' was released in 1990. After that disc, the four members _
Jamar, Grand Puba, Sadat X, and DJ Alamo _ disagreed on the
direction the group should take. Some wanted to continue delivering
positive, self-empowerment messages. Others, like Jamar, wanted to
create ``a more underground, more militant'' sound.
</P>
<P>
   After going their separate ways, with Jamar and Sadat X making
underground music using the Brand Nubian name, the foursome agreed
to reunite for an album that would have both commercially appealing
music and positive lyrics. Lord Jamar and Sadat X continued to make
albums under the Brand Nubian name: 1992's ``In God We Trust,'' and
1994's ``Everything is Everything.'' DJ Alamo worked with lots of
other groups, mostly behind the scenes. Grand Puba, the most
well-known member of the group, dropped two solo albums, ``Reel To
Reel'' and ``2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rumors that they didn't get along, Jamar said they
always remained strong friends and plan to continue working
together as a group. But on the side, each of them will continue do
pursue other interests. Jamar started his own production company,
Seven G Entertainment, which will put out a debut album by Dead
Prez in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the group is doing small shows. The group is already
working on its next album. ``We've always been slow and steady,''
Jamar said. ``You know Brand Nubian is about the hits.''

AN EXCITABLE BOY GROWS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm groggy from napping,'' warns Warren Zevon, picking up the
telephone from a hotel somewhere on the East Coast. ``So I don't
have that `banter' that you can always tell I wrote just before we
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to sell,'' he says, coming right to the
point of why virtually anyone in the entertainment business talks
to anyone in the media. True. He has no new record in the shops or
one on the way. He has no recording contract. Does he intend to
have one?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' Zevon says. His recorded legacy, going
back to 1976, has already garnered substantial critical acclaim for
its literate, often-acerbic, folk-rock. He enjoyed a rock star blip
in 1978 with the single ``Werewolves of London'' and the
``Excitable Boy'' album, and he's had a solid, sometimes rabid,
cult following since. He released a best-of compilation, ``I'll
Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology),'' on Rhino in 1996, but his
last new record was ``Mutineer'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recorded a bunch of songs at home in the most minimalist
possible manner,'' Zevon says, ``which makes sense to me because it
seems like the way they're going to be performed if they're going
to be performed at all. I don't see the sense in making a big band
record or a `star' record that's never going to sound that way
live. Presuming that I always have some kind of hankering to play
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't really done anything with (the tape),'' he
continues. ``It hasn't been shopped (to a label), there's no
manager, so there's nobody really.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always said that I was a pessimist, but I think
they don't understand. After all the years, I'm a pretty happy guy
. . . I just don't buy into that middle-aged Bonnie Raitt
`I'm-gonna-get-a-Grammy/I'm-gonna-sell-a-million-records' fantasy.
I think there's a small audience that would like a big record from
me and that ain't gonna work. It's not fair to whoever pays for the
record to get made. And I'm far too old to be putting it out like
Ani DiFranco and being a record company.''
</P>
<P>
   Zevon, a longtime recovering alcoholic, has a good life. ``I
like my car, I like my apartment which I've been in 10 years. I
live modestly.'' And, hey, he's Minnesota Governor Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura's favorite rocker. Zevon recently sang ``Werewolves
of London'' and ``Lawyers, Guns and Money'' with the Ventura at his
inaugural ball in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Zevon is taking what he sees as a reasonable approach to his
life in the pop world. ``You can't really delude yourself into
thinking there's a big career going along. You're not Bryan Adams.
There's no career machine going, but there's so much to do in the
world. I'd like to go to eastern Russia and learn Russian. It
sounds ridiculous, but I did spend a year learning to play flute.''
</P>
<P>
   Where might you hear these results?
</P>
<P>
   You could have heard them in Bangor last April when Zevon teamed
up with the famous writer/wannabe rock band the Rock Bottom
Remainders, helmed by fright-meister Stephen King. (They played a
benefit at the Bangor Auditorium.)
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a big career move, but, as Zevon says, ``certainly a
branch off the old tributary.''
</P>
<P>
   Does part of the condition of his being in the Rock Bottom
Remainders prohibit him from playing an instrument on which he's
not very proficient?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but you can rest assured I don't work at it,'' he says.
``You know, I play all the lead guitar _ too distasteful for anyone
(else) to ever have me play.. . . I did stipulate that Steve King
had to sing `Werewolves of London,' which he does magnificently.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Zevon's ties to King and his kinship to the writers
group _ Zevon linked up as a result of his longtime friendship with
novelist-Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen _ Zevon is a steady on
``The Late Show With David Letterman'' with or without a hit or a
contract. He's the only person who ever fills in as bandleader when
Paul Shaffer takes one of his rare breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the official second banana,'' says Zevon. ``It's
meaningful fun. It's different than being a guest. It doesn't make
me nervous. And, unlike being a guest, you're given completely free
reign. They tell me `We're turning your mike way up and we want you
to talk to Dave continuously and don't concern yourself with
whether he'd be offended, he won't be.' I think that's very much to
the guy's credit. It does kind of suit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zevon's set Saturday undoubtedly will include old favorites like
``Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner,'' ``Lawyers, Guns and
Money,'' ``Mr. Bad Example,'' ``I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,'' and
``Poor Poor Pitiful Me.'' ``There are a lot of songs,'' Zevon says,
``so I can pick an hour-and-a-half's worth that I like well enough
to play them 25 times once every three years. And you pick
something just because you can do a completely different version of
it. I still create places where I don't know what's gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quite a few new songs, certainly,'' continues Zevon,
some of which he'll unveil Saturday. Songs with guns in them? ``I
don't think there are any guns in them. They're kind of
autobiographical, believe it or not. (The album is) about being old
and (messed) up and happy. Those are ideal subjects for rock 'n'
roll, or the spirit of rock 'n' roll, even though I consider that
to be a loathsome conceit. Still, people can be more more `rock 'n'
roll' when they're old.''
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. Zevon says he was recently nearing sleep in some
hotel with the pay-per-view TV whirring and whatever movie he'd
selected segued into the wretched ``Meet Joe Black.'' Zevon woke up
enough to gaze at Brad Pitt as Death and realized that he _ Warren
Zevon, at 52 _ looks just like Brad Pitt as Death.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy, as you can probably tell, plays a part in Zevon's life
as it does his show. Zevon even turns that into a self-deprecating
dig. ``I was talking to (comic) Richard Lewis the other day,'' says
Zevon, ``and he says `You're starting to irritate me, you're
talking like an old Catskills comic. You're a songwriter.'''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Zevon: ``Yes, but we know I'm not a very good singer,
and I'm not a great musician, so I think it's the whole
totalitarity that has to work. (The humor) is equally important.
I'm not sure I'm happy about that, but I think it's probably
true.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   College basketball is approaching crunch time, when conference
championships and tournament bids are decided. The sport deserves
the best from everyone involved, including the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Is it getting it? One wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's nothing blatant, although the phantom foul in the last
seconds of Cincinnati's loss to DePaul Saturday was indeed a
travesty.
</P>
<P>
   No, it goes deeper than that. It has to do with the officials'
travel schedules.
</P>
<P>
   For a core group of superstar officials _ Ted Valentine, John
Cahill, Jim Burr, Tim Higgins _ it's a question of how much is too
much.
</P>
<P>
   Take Cahill, for example. Last Saturday, he was in Palo Alto,
Calif., working the Stanford-Connecticut game. On Sunday, he was in
New York for Duquesne-Fordham. On Monday, he was in New Jersey
doing Pittsburgh-Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Under the best of circumstances, without a travel glitch, it
meant that Cahill either had to catch a late plane from San
Franciso to New York Saturday or take a red-eye, check into a
hotel, get some rest, and work another game less than 24 hours
after UConn-Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a night's rest, working a third game in the
Meadowlands the next day would tax the stamina of the youngest
officials, not to mention those closer to middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in a travel snafu such as that caused by the American
Airlines labor situation the last several days and you have the
potential for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East says it will not schedule officials who have worked
a day earlier on the opposite coast or even halfway across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the schedules of all our officials and we won't have
them do back-to-back games with that much travel involved,'' said
Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese. ``But there's nothing we can
do to stop them from working games. They're independent
contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College athletic director Gene DeFilippo says he sees
potential problems. ``Sure, it's a concern,'' he said. ``It's near
the end of the season and everyone is tired. Players, coaches,
officials. You just hope everything goes right.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, it's a Catch-22 situation. Is a tired Jim Burr
worse than a lesser official who may be well rested but let a game
get out of hand?
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason you see the same officials working the big
games all over the country every week. They're good and they
deserve to be rewarded for their skills.
</P>
<P>
   But they also owe the game their best effort, and going coast to
coast on back-to-back days and working three games in three days
does not accommodate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope physically they can do it,'' said Atlantic 10
commissioner Linda Bruno. ``But you do have some concerns, and it
was an issue with our coaches last year. You try and do the best
you can, but there are only so many (good) officials. And in the
East especially, everybody is after them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil at UMass
</P>
<P>
   This has been a turbulent winter at the University of
Massachusetts. Fans are exercised at the methods of women's coach
Joan O'Brien; men's coach Bruiser Flint has tossed Ajmal Basit off
the team, has used every method known to man to motivate Charlton
Clarke to play better, and his team is more up-and-down than a
Stairmaster at a health club.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's problems are a sign that women's basketball has moved
forward, since how a team plays has become just as important as how
a team feels. Abusive language, sarcasm? Go to any men's program in
the country on any givn day and you will find some kind of verbal
abuse being given by coaches. It happens. It's part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball _ men's and women's _ has become a big
revenue item, with lots of pressure to succeed. Sometimes coaches
cross the line. But the days of ``Gee, Jack, or Gee, Sally, that
was really a bad pass you made. Why don't you try it this way?''
are long gone at the major college level. If players don't like it,
don't like the sellout crowds, don't like the television exposure,
don't like going to big-time tournaments, they can go to the
Division 2 or 3 or intramural level and play the game for the fun
of playing the game, with fewer voices urging them to be better.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does a coach erupt at a player simply because he or she
is meanspirited.
</P>
<P>
   As for the men, Flint must stay the course, fight through the
season, then do a major reevaluation of the program and probably
make some changes in the way things are done.
</P>
<P>
   Basit has been a tough case since he arrived at UMass. His
career in Amherst has been more style than substance, which can be
semi-tolerated if the rest of the team is playing well. But when a
team is struggling _ as UMass is _ it doesn't need any more
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Flint is right. Things just didn't work out. UMass and
Flint were not the right place and coach for Basit. It's time to
move on. And if you believe some of the stories you are hearing out
of UMass, it is time to give Basit's scholarship to someone else.

   Herrion hot again?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Herrion has done a nice job in reviving Drexel into an
America East contender. The question now is whether Herrion, who
two years ago was one of the hottest young coaches in the mid-major
conferernces, has revived his reputation as well. If he has, and
someone like a Pitt or an Iowa or another major conference school
calls, here's a word of advice. Take the job and don't look back .
. . The way it looks now, the Atlantic Coast Conference will have
fewer bids (4) than the Big East (5) in the NCAA tournament . . .
Auburn has played itself up to a No. 1 seed, probably in the South,
which means that either Duke or UConn could get shipped West,
although that could happen to the Tigers as well . . . Syracuse is
under .500 in its last 14 games at the Carrier Dome, which puzzles
even coach Jim Boeheim. ``I have absolutely no explanation for
it,'' said Boeheim. ``We're a better team on the road. I can't
figure it out.'' If the Orangemen are to make the NCAA tournament,
they will need wins over teams like Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, and
Boston College in the next few weeks, as well as at least one win
in the Big East tournament . . . The Ratings Percentage Index is
regarded as sacred by those who project and select the NCAA
tournament field of 64, but in looking at the last few RPIs, you
have to wonder how valid it is. Consider: Indiana has eight losses
and is 12th in the RPI rankings. Princeton started out last week
101st in the RPI, beat Harvard and Dartmouth and jumped to 74th,
then beat Penn and jumped to 58th. UConn is fourth in the RPI,
behind Duke and _ Michigan State and Stanford, two teams the
Huskies beat. Please . . . Wonder what Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins
is going to say at the next Conference USA officials meeting. Two
of the three Bearcats losses this season were the direct result of
bad calls by officials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willard still wants it
</P>
<P>
   Word has it that Pittsburgh's Ralph Willard, who is resigning at
the end of the season, still wants to coach and wouldn't mind
winding up in New England if any openings develop . . . Former
hot-shot recruit Shea Cotton, now at a junior college in Long
Beach, Calif., could wind up at Rhode Island next season. Rams
coach Jim Harrick first went after Cotton when Harrick was at UCLA.
But Cotton was a nonqualifier academically and has gone the JC
route (where he is a star) . . . Wisconsin has 20 wins for the
first time since 1941 . . . What's Going On Here Dept.? Nebraska
sweeps Kansas. The Cornhuskers' Danny Nee, who was on shaky ground
at the start of the season, now might be the front-runner for Big
12 Coach of the Year honors . . . Wonder if Pittsburgh AD Steve
Peterson will move Nee up on his short list to replace Willard.
Former St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla and Siena's Paul Hewitt
also loom as possibilities.

STEWART'S HEART MUST LEARN A NEW BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ever-enduring Rod Stewart has an upcoming tour, but on the
eve of rehearsals, he can't seem to recall the names of the three
new players in his band. ``I'm sorry. I haven't been paying too
much attention to business,'' says Stewart, who has been
preoccupied with the bombshell news of his supermodel wife Rachel
Hunter leaving him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I ever had a broken heart, so it's all new
to me,'' says Stewart. ``But I think I'm growing and I'm learning
from the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent breakup of Stewart, 54, and Hunter, 29, at least
hasn't hit the tabloids with the same lunatic frenzy that
accompanied Mick Jagger's schism with wife, model Jerry Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will, either,'' Stewart says. ``(Rachel) is a
very upstanding, honorable person and we're still good friends. We
spoke this morning on the phone about the kids. You've just got to
let these things work themselves out. If we get back together, we
do. If we don't, well, I'm single again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding as if he's already grown from the experience, Stewart,
who has two children with Hunter, says he doubts he'll go back to
the wild 'n' crazy ways that have been linked to his behavior since
his early '70s stint with the band the Faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think I'll go back to the craziness. I just want
to grow a little bit more spiritually. In fact, a lot more,'' he
says. ``And you can only do that by being on your own and learning
to live and be independent and self-sufficient. And not needing to
be with the guys or with the girls or being out every night. The
next year is going to be a growing period for me and whether that
will show in the recordings I make, I don't know. Hopefully, it
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he's just trying to restabilize his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through a lot of therapy, so rock 'n' roll is the
last thing on my mind at the moment,'' he notes. He's also
meditating and doing yoga. He even expresses interest in visiting
the Kripalu Yoga Retreat in the Berkshires (in the town of Lenox)
during his stay in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bringing a guy out on the road that's a yoga expert and is
a great masseuse,'' Stewart says on the same subject. ``He works me
out and keeps me fit. It keeps you nicely centered.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's not yet ready to commit to his next album project,
don't be surprised if Stewart does a record of classic torch songs,
that is, songs with romantic yearning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to do an album of all Gershwin songs or Cole
Porter songs _ the real great torch songs from the '30s and '40s,''
Stewart says. ``We were rehearsing some of the songs last night
with the producer Richard Perry. I may do that, or I may do a
country album . . . or maybe do more rock. I really don't know what
I'm going to do yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart hasn't had much time to keep up with the latest rock
CDs, but loves the new Black Crowes disc, ``By Your Side,'' which
expands from the rave-up sound of the early Faces. ``I'm absolutely
knocked out by that record. It's just brilliant. I'm going to put
it on again this afternoon,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his latest tour, Stewart says he'll do ``four or
five new songs,'' but also add a mini-set of ballads. ``I want to
do a batch of six or seven ballads which have been hits, so people
aren't just getting up and sitting down, and getting up and sitting
down in the audience. I don't mind if people sit down and listen.
It doesn't worry me at all. In fact, I usually encourage people to
sit down during ballads and put their bums on the expensive
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   He's added a player who doubles on violin and mandolin, so
expect more songs from his popular ``Unplugged'' album of a few
years ago. And he may pull out ``Rather Go Blind,'' an Etta James
song ``which I sang on one of my albums just after the Second World
War, I think it was.''
</P>
<P>
   He realizes, too, that some songs will be harder to sing because
of recent developments. ``It's going to be hard to sing the lyrics
to `Reason to Believe' and `Have I Told You Lately.' They sort of
ring home a little bit more true than they did.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's tour was booked before the breakup with Hunter, but
``I must thank God that I've got my work to fall back on, because I
don't know what I would have done if I hadn't,'' he says. ``It's
going to be pretty lonely out there, but not for the two hours that
I'm on the stage. We'll make the most of it. I'm sure there are
lots of friends out there that will come and party with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's personal hassles also have him rethinking the
institution of marriage. ``I wonder these days if it's worth
getting married,'' he says honestly. ``Sixty-eight percent of the
people getting married wind up in a divorce court. Maybe it's not
worth it. They should at least change the marriage vows, though
it's not for us to make those decisions.''

<P>
   Hendrix tribute on Bravo: Friday night (Feb. 12) is the premier
of ``Searching for Jimi Hendrix'' on the Bravo channel at 8 p.m.
It's co-directed by the legendary D. A. Pennebaker (``Monterey
Pop'') and Chris Hegedus. Strangely, there's no footage of Hendrix
in this intriguing but mixed-bag program, which instead follows
contemporary artists into their studios and rehearsal spaces for
performances of their favorite Hendrix tunes. The idea is
promising, but the quick-cut editing after about 30 seconds of each
performance is maddening (though we do hear more of each song
later). It's an overly ambitious show and would do better by
focusing on fewer artists. Still, peak moments include Los Lobos
doing a creepily psychedelic ``Are You Experienced?,'' Chuck D
rapping hard on ``Freedom,'' Laurie Anderson offering an ambient
``1983,'' Charlie Musselwhite doing a solo acoustic ``Hear My Train
A-Comin','' Los Illegals beefing up ``Little Wing,'' Rosanne Cash
surprising with ``Manic Depression,'' and Cassandra Wilson adding a
stunningly sensual ``Angel.'' A soundtrack from the program will be
released April 20.

KWAN A SILVER LINING IN SALT LAKE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ On Tuesday and Wednesday, a storm blew down
from the Wasatch Front here, unleashing winds of 60 miles per hour
and blowing snow. Yet another storm, an unceasing one, has been
buffeting Salt Lake City for week after week, the storm of Olympic
corruption that has engulfed the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and
has stained Utah as Utah seldom has been stained.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an oasis between the storms. It is there in the
Delta Center, the arena that virtually touches the historic Union
Pacific railroad station on one side and Temple Square and the
sacred Mormon Temple on the other. The oasis is there in the
presence of Michelle Kwan.
</P>
<P>
   Calmness. Infectious laughter. A bright eye toward the future.
And, most of all, integrity. All gifts to a stricken Salt Lake City
this week from America's top female figure skater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a competitor who goes out and skates just for
the fun of it,'' said Kwan of this week's US Figure Skating
Champioships, where she merely has to step onto the ice to win the
gold medal. ``I never think, `I have to win all the time,' or `I'm
untouchable.' You just never know. I mean, Tara was a skater of
whom no one had ever heard and . . . she won.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan's statement was fascinating. On her own, she brought up the
name of Tara Lipinski, her American rival who edged her out for the
gold medal at the Nagano Olympics last February. On her own, she
brought up what had to be the most crushing moment of her career,
when she went into Nagano as the favorite but came out with _ in
her own touching words moments after the loss _ ``the color medal I
might not have wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   And on her own, she uttered words similar to what she had said
after that defeat in Nagano, that the thrill for her ``is that I
love competing and I love what I'm doing. They always say, `Don't
change what you love doing,' and `Don't change what you're happy
with,' and I'm happy with what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   That scene in the cramped interview room overlooking those
frozen rice paddies in Nagano moments after Lipinski was presented
with the gold medal is still memorable. Kwan's only hint at
self-criticism then was that she felt she had skated ``too much
within myself'' in the long program that decided all between her
and Lipinski, but that was it. The rest was pure grace in defeat,
as Kwan said then _ as she repeated this week in Salt Lake City _
that she is happy ``as long as I skate my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most jaded observers of athletes were taken with how
maturely Kwan handled her defeat in Nagano. And if there were any
lingering doubts about how real were her words in Nagano, they
evaporated this week when Kwan repeated the thrust of those words.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I never think of how many titles I have or how many
times I've won,'' she said. ``I never compare myself with anybody.
I just want to go out there and skate from the heart. To win it
always gives good pleasure, but to skate well is even better.''
</P>
<P>
   When she left Nagano, said Kwan, ``I realized a lot of things
had happened and they were for the good. I don't think if I could
go back in time, I would change anything. (Nagano) has helped me
grow as a person and as an athlete, and I think what happened was
good, and it was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if she, not Lipinski, had won that gold medal in Nagano,
Kwan said this week, ``I believe I still would be (here). That's
because I love competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski is not here and has moved on to ice shows and the
professional ranks. In a way, the ever candid Kwan conceded, she
wishes Lipinski were still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I think it's great when the best skaters are out there
and they're skating their best,'' said Kwan. ``For me, that is pure
competition; that's what I love. So in a way, I do miss (Lipinski).
It was great for us. We tried to work harder (because of the
personal duel). Every time I'd go out on the ice, I'd think, `I've
got to work a little harder, a little harder,' because you know
someone's there.''
</P>
<P>
   And, irony of ironies, the fact that Lipinski is not here may be
as big an obstacle for Kwan as if her chief rival were still
competing. That's because Kwan now has no competition among the
Americans as she steadfastly continues her quest to win the gold
medal in the 2002 Olympics, three long years from now. Her major
competition for that medal is unknown, possibly some 11- or
12-year-old tyke now skating in junior competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be anybody next,'' said Kwan of her seemingly
pleasant status of being truly alone at the top. ``You just never
know. That's why you always have to be prepared. In a sport like
this, you just never know what's going to come next.''
</P>
<P>
   Age can be particularly unkind in two Olympic sports _
gymnastics and figure skating. On the female side, girls often have
bodies which can accomplish difficult jumps easier than women, and
Kwan clearly understands this.
</P>
<P>
   She and a friend looked at pictures of Kwan skating several
years ago just the other day, Kwan related, ``and she said, `Wow,
you were so young. You were so thin. Your legs were just two
sticks.' It's a case of every day you have to adjust to your body.
When I was 14 or 15, I did hit a growth spurt where I was a little
wobbly. It seemed like there were a couple inches (more of height)
and then a couple inches. But now I'm 5-2 and I'm not growing
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she is an ``elderly'' 19, Kwan finds that jumps ``are
harder, particularly at the end of the long program.'' And she
notices that the young girls now in juniors may blossom into true
competitors for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that a couple of the junior ladies skaters are
very good,'' said Kwan. ``Sasha Cohen, who comes up to like here on
me'' _ Kwan pointed to her shoulder _ ``is a great skater. Sara
Hughes (a 14-year-old competing in the seniors here) is also very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan named several more girls, all of whom say they look up to
her as their idol. More irony here, as Kwan explained, ``because I
looked up to Nancy (Kerrigan) and Tonya (Harding), but that never
stopped me from going out when I skated against them and saying, `I
want to win.' '' Kwan said she expects the young girls to take the
ice against her _ when it happens _ in the same vein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just take it a day at a time, not worrying about the
future,'' she said of this plight of not knowing who her
competition will be. ``I'll do it by taking it one day at a time,
just focusing on the present.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lipinski won the gold medal possibly by being more athletic
in her programs, in contrast to Kwan's artistic emphasis, Kwan
apprently has taken notice. She consciously has focused on being
more athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on a lot of triple triples (jumps),'' she
said, ``like triple Lutz, triple loop, and some other technical
things. I'm planning on doing a triple triple here, but it's going
to be triple toe, triple toe. We've also worked on more speed
(between her jumps), the spins, not spinning just because it's
required but to do the spins well. Those are the little things that
matter (to judges).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michelle has improved a lot,'' said Frank Carroll, her
coach. ``She's doing triple triples and she's running through her
programs with more maturity. I don't think she'll hold back. I
don't think it'll be a lackluster performance (here).''
</P>
<P>
   It seldom is with Michelle Kwan. And in so many ways, her
arrival here in a discouraged Salt Lake City and the gold medal she
is sure to win and the performance she is sure to give may give the
city the break it needs from the ceaseless storms that have
buffeted it.

CITY OF ROMANCE EXPECTS BRISK BUSINESS THIS WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Think little cable cars climbing halfway to the
stars. Think morning fog that fills the air. Now think chocolates,
champagne brunches, romantic Bay cruises, intimate evenings in city
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In short, think Valentine's Day in San Francisco, voted ``the
No. 1 romantic city in the United States'' last year by Honeymoon
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The city's $4 billion-a-year tourism trade is certainly thinking
about Valentine's Day _ an occasion that means more than hearts and
flowers to an industry gearing up for its first big holiday weekend
since New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   This Valentine's Day arrives none too soon for hotels,
restaurants and popular tourist destinations. They have waited out
the seasonal January slump as well as the blustery rains of early
February. Now the cash registers should ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year Valentine's is a three-day weekend. It has more
fiscal impact than if it wasn't. There are more tourist arrivals,
more spending,'' said San Francisco hotel consultant Jay Scott, of
Scott Hospitality Services.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine's is not that good, Scott said. It doesn't come in
at the top of the Richter scale for holidays. When it comes to
spending, Santa, not Cupid, is still The Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it compare to the millennium celebrations, Christmas or
New Year's? No, it doesn't,'' said Scott, who noted that Dec. 31 is
usually the year's biggest party, with Christmas and Thanksgiving
generating big spending on families.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``This weekend is a big ski weekend. When we had heavy
rains here, they had heavy snow in the (Lake) Tahoe region. There
could be some drainage of tourists,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard numbers are hard to come by when it comes to Valentine's
Day. The Golden Gate Restaurant Association and the Hotel Council
of San Francisco said they don't track customers or dollars spent
on valentines, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Valentine's Day 1999 could be busy, especially
since it falls on a Sunday, right in the middle of the three-day
Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can come and stay the night and not have to go in to
work on Monday, and that works for us; we let hotel rooms,'' said
Marsha Munro, area director of marketing and communications for
Westin Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At the Westin St. Francis, business is expected to be brisk in
the Compass Rose bar, which ``is one of the most romantic bars in
the city,'' Munro said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, action is expected in the bar's darkened,
semi-private ``monkey corner,'' so called because a large painting
of a monkey hangs there and ``because a lot of monkey business goes
on there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage proposals are common in the monkey corner. ``It's the
perfect place to pop the question. We don't know how many proposals
are made, but based on the amount of champagne we sell, easily 100
couples a year get engaged,'' Munro said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's also promises to be sweet for Pacific Marine Yachts,
a luxury cruise company that usually leases its four yachts only
for private parties and corporate wingdings. The only times the
company departs from that format are New Year's Eve and Valentine's
Day, said Danielle O'Doherty, vice president of sales and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Marine expects up to 1,000 people _ mostly couples _ for
two-a-day cruises on Saturday and Sunday scheduled to last 3 to 3
1/2 hours each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is very strong, and people are doing a little bit
extra this year. They're ordering special bottles of champagne,''
O'Doherty said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Intimations of mortality, hard to avoid at any funeral, were
inescapable at King Hussein's.
</P>
<P>
   The large and diverse collection of world leaders who came to
Amman this week to pay their respects to an extraordinary man
included the elderly, the frail and the one-man rulers of several
volatile places that have no constitutional line of succession.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, such as Syria's Hafez Assad and the Palestinians'
Yasser Arafat, combine in quite a perilous way all three
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago King Hussein himself was in this bracket. He
caused consternation with his last despotic act, emerging from
hospital to sack Hassan, his brother and longtime heir, and replace
him with his soldier son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators, The Economist included, brooded on the safety-nets
that would have been afforded by a genuine constitutional monarchy,
the folly of making oneself indispensable _ and the added folly of
inadequate provision for succession.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the early signals from Amman are promising.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, heads were bowed in honor of a king whose warmth
of heart and spirit even enemies respected. The new successor
conducted himself impeccably and so, most honorably, did his uncle,
Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has few natural advantages _ a sandpit of a place lying
like a bunker between states that hate each other _ but it gives no
impression of being about to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   What, however, of the others? What chance that the handover of
power in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Palestine will be as smooth?
</P>
<P>
   Take no bets on it. The rulers of these countries share a
certain myopia: all of them are despotic to one degree or another;
all are hitting 70, yet behave as though they were immortal,
without need of clear-cut succession plans.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion in any of these places would profoundly affect the
region. Saudi Arabia is the odd one out in that its king, Fahd, is
already disabled and the kingdom is competently run by Crown Prince
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudi Abdullah is himself in his mid-70s, and it is far
from clear which of his extended family of brothers and
half-brothers will eventually take over from him _ or whether the
others will accept the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Hosni Mubarak is confidently expected to be ``elected''
to a fourth six-year presidency this October, when he will be 71.
</P>
<P>
   Although his own role as vice-president helped Egypt to a smooth
transition when Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981, Mubarak has
chosen not to appoint a deputy. He prefers, it seems, to have the
driving seat to himself, without a potential rival fighting for the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He looks robust, but what happens if he does not survive his
next term? Some Egyptians wonder, not entirely in jest, whether he
might not, in a monarchical way, be grooming a son.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is what Syria's President Assad has long been
doing. After his favored son, Basil, died in a car crash, he turned
to Bashar, a former ophthalmologist, who is thought to be much less
of a chip off the harsh old block.
</P>
<P>
   The president may not be as frail as his gaunt looks suggest
but, when he does go, will Syrians quietly accept an Assad dynasty?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Arafat in this macabre actuarial exercise? At 69, he
looks poorly, and his trembling lip suggests the onset of
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   True, he takes good care of his health and his capacity for hard
work seems unimpaired. Moreover, he has shown survival powers that
match or surpass King Hussein's. But how reassuring is that, in the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters he holds two posts: president of the
Palestinian Authority (PA) and chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
   The man most likely to succeed him at the PA is still the
Palestinians' chief negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu
Mazen). But West Bankers and Gazans, having nudged noses with
Israeli democracy, may not be content to have an old PLO hand
imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of democracy was one of the reasons why they did not,
after Israel occupied their land in 1967, want King Hussein's
Hashemite rule back again. Instead, they got Arafat's erratic
authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Worse off by far are the Palestinian diaspora, whose members
have nobody to represent them but the PLO, a body that once made
history but has long since passed its best-before date.
</P>
<P>
   Will anything be left of the PLO when Arafat, whose name is
synonymous with it, joins his maker? The outlook for the hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian refugees who live stateless and ignored
in countries such as Lebanon is grim.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings matters back to Jordan, and its kings. Hashemite
rule was not the Palestinians' first choice, but refugees who
crossed the Jordan River were automatically given Jordanian
citizenship and the rights that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional rule should be King Abdullah's goal, but
continuing his father's civilized, intelligent conduct would be a
splendid start. &QL;

chosen not to appoint a deputy. He prefers, it seems, to have the
driving seat to himself, without a potential rival fighting for the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He looks robust, but what happens if he does not survive his
next term? Some Egyptians wonder, not entirely in jest, whether he
might not, in a monarchical way, be grooming a son.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is what Syria's President Assad has long been
doing. After his favored son, Basil, died in a car crash, he turned
to Bashar, a former ophthalmologist, who is thought to be much less
of a chip off the harsh old block.
</P>
<P>
   The president may not be as frail as his gaunt looks suggest
but, when he does go, will Syrians quietly accept an Assad dynasty?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Arafat in this macabre actuarial exercise? At 69, he
looks poorly, and his trembling lip suggests the onset of
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   True, he takes good care of his health and his capacity for hard
work seems unimpaired. Moreover, he has shown survival powers that
match or surpass King Hussein's. But how reassuring is that, in the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters he holds two posts: president of the
Palestinian Authority (PA) and chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
   The man most likely to succeed him at the PA is still the
Palestinians' chief negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu
Mazen). But West Bankers and Gazans, having nudged noses with
Israeli democracy, may not be content to have an old PLO hand
imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of democracy was one of the reasons why they did not,
after Israel occupied their land in 1967, want King Hussein's
Hashemite rule back again. Instead, they got Arafat's erratic
authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Worse off by far are the Palestinian diaspora, whose members
have nobody to represent them but the PLO, a body that once made
history but has long since passed its best-before date.
</P>
<P>
   Will anything be left of the PLO when Arafat, whose name is
synonymous with it, joins his maker? The outlook for the hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian refugees who live stateless and ignored
in countries such as Lebanon is grim.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings matters back to Jordan, and its kings. Hashemite
rule was not the Palestinians' first choice, but refugees who
crossed the Jordan River were automatically given Jordanian
citizenship and the rights that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional rule should be King Abdullah's goal, but
continuing his father's civilized, intelligent conduct would be a
splendid start. &QL;

MINISTER MOVES TO FOREFRONT IN FIGHT FOR GAY MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Rev. Don Fado is surprised to find himself
the new champion of the gay-marriage-rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the genial Methodist minister from Sacramento is the man of
the hour, much in demand at Friday's second annual National Freedom
to Marry Day.
</P>
<P>
   Fado is not a gay activist. He's 65, heterosexual, a family man
and man of conscience whose own thinking about homosexuality and
equality has evolved gradually into the realization that equal
rights has to mean marriage rights.
</P>
<P>
   When he risked his calling and led 94 other Methodist ministers
in blessing the 15-year love of two lesbians in front of 1,000
people on Jan. 16, his sole aim was to change his church, which
banned ``holy unions'' of gay and lesbian couples last year. He had
no designs on society at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be over Jan. 16,'' Fado, pastor of St.
Mark's United Methodist Church, said Thursday. ``I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he and other allies of the gay rights movement are emerging
as key players in the fight to change the minds of people about gay
marriage as the campaign starts to build over an initiative that
will appear on the California ballot in March 2000. That initiative
would prohibit California from recognizing same-sex marriages
performed legally in other states.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the pastor appeared at an early National Freedom to
Marry celebration in Sacramento, where state Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, denounced the ballot
initiative and urged support of gay and lesbian families.
</P>
<P>
   The gay marriage struggle is shifting from the legal arena to
the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, advocates of gay marriage had high hopes
that the Hawaii Supreme Court would make the Island State the first
to legalize same-sex marriage. But voters there, and in Alaska
where another favorable court ruling was on appeal, passed
anti-gay-marriage measures in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont courts are now considering the issue, and legally
it's still alive in the Hawaii Supreme Court, which still could
rule despite the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But with the measure on the California ballot, the battle here
has shifted to the political front. Already 29 states have passed
measures like the anti-gay marriage initiative sponsored by
conservative state Sen. Pete Knight, R-Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   And straight allies are key, activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Wolfson, who heads the Marriage Project of the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, a national gay rights group based in
New York, called the Methodist ministers' action the most exciting
activism he'd seen on the issue recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non-gay people need to understand that we need their voices as
this civil rights struggle unfolds,'' he said. ``What the ministers
are saying is that they will no longer allow right-wing groups to
usurp the name of religion to push discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of National Freedom to Marry Day, which Lambda and
others launched last year, is to spotlight the issue and to make
the case to the general public that gay and lesbian families
deserve the civil benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The event spread from 50 cities last year to close to 80 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities such as actor Meg Ryan have signed on to support gay
marriage, as have dozens of organizations from the American
Psychoanalytic Association to the Japanese-American Citizens
League.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``But with the morning cool repentance came,'' wrote Walter
Scott. So it is in Washington at the end of the Clinton impeachment
saga.
</P>
<P>
   It is still more twilight than dawn; the city, mocked by the
rest of the country, seems sunk in political and physical
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to remember where it all began; only that, while it
lasted, almost everyone did things and said things they wish they
had not.
</P>
<P>
   As at the end of a drunken orgy, there is a need to clean up:
sort through the wreckage, sweep the floor, throw open the windows,
and repent.
</P>
<P>
   That time is now. The Senate impeachment trial is over.
President Clinton has been acquitted of both charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice. The seemingly interminable saga has finally
come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   What was gained by it all? It's hard to say, but two things were
made clear, at least.
</P>
<P>
   First, what has happened over the past year should never have
happened at all; second, there is no guarantee that it will not
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The end of this awful tale still leaves in place the elements
that spawned it: a diminished presidency, a bitterly divided
Congress, an over-mighty prosecutor, and a media pack that is proud
to seek out scandal wherever it can.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, if not from the start then soon after, that the
president's impeachment should never have been undertaken. This
huge, ponderous machine, whose workings paralyze normal government,
should be activated only to remove a president who is agreed by
both political parties and by the people to be a menace to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's offenses, perjury and obstruction of justice _
not, it bears repeating, that he had a tawdry sexual fling _ were
in our view grave and shameful. Clinton disguised private lapses of
behavior with public lying, which had the public consequence of
destroying the people's trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   To this, the proper response of a man of honor would have been
to resign his office. But that was never the view of most
Americans; still less did most Americans feel that these crimes
justified the president's removal by another branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton would not go, his political enemies determined to
root him out, using impeachment to try to overturn, by a sort of
constitutional coup d'etat, the result of two elections.
</P>
<P>
   This is not impeachment's purpose, and no one has emerged from
the process untarnished: not the president, who refused even the
courtesy of answering senators' questions, nor the Republican trial
managers, who often exhibited pure vengeance, nor the Democrats,
whose scramble to embrace their president suggests a wholesale
abandonment of principle.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected (though nobody can be sure) that the Republicans
will reap the whirlwind in the elections of 2000 _ that they, not
the president or his Democrat apologists, will be blamed for taking
the country through this horror.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, impeachment once devalued may be used this way again,
not least by those who feel that vengeance and partisanship are
most neatly countered by more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Morning-after Washington also bears the scars of other excesses.
The scandal saw a sort of Faustian pact between the special
prosecutor, Ken Starr, and the press, whereby each seemed to feed
and encourage the prurient appetites of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's powers to investigate the president had long been
condemned as too far-reaching. But when the inquiry turned to sex,
rather than obscure tracts of scrubland in Arkansas, the press
became insatiable, and Starr obliged them with an extraordinary
flood of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Internet dared, the old press followed. Rumor was
published before it had been verified; the prosecutor's office
sprang leaks for which no apology was offered; and Congress, when
the time came, pushed titillating material immediately and
unthinkingly into the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   This howling after sex stoked the fires of Republican moralists,
obscured the valid reasons for condemning this president, and made
the public think one thing: this prosecution was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   There is a grain of truth in that. No other president has faced
a man of Starr's resources and persistence (a persistence that is
still unsated); and none has had to deal with such a torrent of
explicit revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton's successors will not have to. In the present
mood of national regret, the overwhelming wish never to go through
that again, the office of the special prosecutor may well be
eliminated before the year is out. Yet something will have to
replace it; the executive cannot go unwatched.
</P>
<P>
   The press will be restrained for a while, no doubt. Yet the
modern trend to keep close tabs on the powerful, to comb through
their private lives, to expose them and pull them down, is not
about to disappear. Every would-be presidential contender now
working the malls of New Hampshire must expect to have to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that during the presidency of Bill Clinton, the
perception of the office has changed and its authority has
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in history, it is said, America does not require a
leader to admire; prosperous and peaceful, it needs only a man who
can steer straight, and Clinton can do that capably enough. Respect
and special treatment are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude was both confirmed and reflected during the
Lewinsky affair, by the Supreme Court ruling that the Paula Jones
civil suit could proceed against Clinton while he was in office.
But this ruling was misguided; this, too, should not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   A president in office is not an ordinary man, but the head of
state of the most powerful country on earth. He represents an
entity to which, above all, the world looks for guidance. His
accountability as a man before the law must always be balanced by a
sense of the importance of the office he occupies.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he himself cannot grasp that? When Americans look
back over the presidency of Bill Clinton, they will see much that
impresses them: economic good times, balanced budgets, reform of
the welfare system, the dogged pursuit of peace in Northern Ireland
and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all has been tarnished by what flowed from things that
should never have happened in the first place: the president's own
sexual wantonness and his own recourse to lying.
</P>
<P>
   It will be said of Clinton that, in some deep way, he never
seemed to feel or understand the weight of the office he held; and
from that carelessness, that squandering of his own authority, came
all the other excesses America has seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all that has happened, a genuine expression of regret
would mark an end, of sorts. There will be stage-managed
``sincerity,'' no doubt _ there has been an abundance of that
throughout. But a genuine expression of repentance? That has always
seemed too much to hope for. &QL;

not least by those who feel that vengeance and partisanship are
most neatly countered by more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Morning-after Washington also bears the scars of other excesses.
The scandal saw a sort of Faustian pact between the special
prosecutor, Ken Starr, and the press, whereby each seemed to feed
and encourage the prurient appetites of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's powers to investigate the president had long been
condemned as too far-reaching. But when the inquiry turned to sex,
rather than obscure tracts of scrubland in Arkansas, the press
became insatiable, and Starr obliged them with an extraordinary
flood of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Internet dared, the old press followed. Rumor was
published before it had been verified; the prosecutor's office
sprang leaks for which no apology was offered; and Congress, when
the time came, pushed titillating material immediately and
unthinkingly into the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   This howling after sex stoked the fires of Republican moralists,
obscured the valid reasons for condemning this president, and made
the public think one thing: this prosecution was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   There is a grain of truth in that. No other president has faced
a man of Starr's resources and persistence (a persistence that is
still unsated); and none has had to deal with such a torrent of
explicit revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton's successors will not have to. In the present
mood of national regret, the overwhelming wish never to go through
that again, the office of the special prosecutor may well be
eliminated before the year is out. Yet something will have to
replace it; the executive cannot go unwatched.
</P>
<P>
   The press will be restrained for a while, no doubt. Yet the
modern trend to keep close tabs on the powerful, to comb through
their private lives, to expose them and pull them down, is not
about to disappear. Every would-be presidential contender now
working the malls of New Hampshire must expect to have to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that during the presidency of Bill Clinton, the
perception of the office has changed and its authority has
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in history, it is said, America does not require a
leader to admire; prosperous and peaceful, it needs only a man who
can steer straight, and Clinton can do that capably enough. Respect
and special treatment are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude was both confirmed and reflected during the
Lewinsky affair, by the Supreme Court ruling that the Paula Jones
civil suit could proceed against Clinton while he was in office.
But this ruling was misguided; this, too, should not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   A president in office is not an ordinary man, but the head of
state of the most powerful country on earth. He represents an
entity to which, above all, the world looks for guidance. His
accountability as a man before the law must always be balanced by a
sense of the importance of the office he occupies.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he himself cannot grasp that? When Americans look
back over the presidency of Bill Clinton, they will see much that
impresses them: economic good times, balanced budgets, reform of
the welfare system, the dogged pursuit of peace in Northern Ireland
and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all has been tarnished by what flowed from things that
should never have happened in the first place: the president's own
sexual wantonness and his own recourse to lying.
</P>
<P>
   It will be said of Clinton that, in some deep way, he never
seemed to feel or understand the weight of the office he held; and
from that carelessness, that squandering of his own authority, came
all the other excesses America has seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all that has happened, a genuine expression of regret
would mark an end, of sorts. There will be stage-managed
``sincerity,'' no doubt _ there has been an abundance of that
throughout. But a genuine expression of repentance? That has always
seemed too much to hope for. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Luck and fate always seem to appear at the edge
of the road as Bill Clinton drives along his highway of ambition,
two friendly hitchhikers, thumbs out, ready to be picked up for
stretches here and there when other passengers appear less
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   That judgment, in a 1995 biography of the president by David
Maraniss, was true enough after the scandals and near-scandals of
dodging the draft, not inhaling marijuana and committing adultery
with Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   True, too, after ``Travelgate,'' when White House staff were
dismissed in May 1993 in favor of a team from back home in Little
Rock; after the puzzling death in July that year of Vince Foster,
the White House deputy counsel; after ``Filegate'' in 1996, when
the administration admitted to having wrongly collected FBI files
in 1993 on Republican opponents; and after Whitewater, a murky 1978
property deal which put presidential friends in jail and launched
the investigation of the Clintons by the indefatigable independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But how much truer now, as Bill Clinton, buoyed by a
still-booming economy and high approval ratings, glides smoothly
away from his House impeachment and his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his wake are demoralized Republicans; an independent
prosecutor who is loathed for his zealotry; and a Democratic Party
which did unexpectedly well in last year's congressional elections
and has a better-than-even chance of reclaiming the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be, when only a year ago the pundits were
predicting a quick exit of the president from office?
</P>
<P>
   Fate in itself is too trite an answer. Arguably, the
provocations of Saddam Hussein were a timely help; but they also
gave the president's enemies the chance to accuse him of launching
strikes merely to deflect attention.
</P>
<P>
   The better argument is that Clinton, seemingly impervious to the
embarrassment that normal men might feel, makes his own luck, with
a mixture of personal charm, political brilliance, unshakeable
resolve and loyal allies _ not least his long-suffering wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has ``stood by her man'' (with incrementally nuanced
body language) even since last August, when the FBI confirmed that
Monica Lewinsky's blue dress was stained with the president's
semen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hillary alone is an insufficient explanation for the
Republicans' frustration, so ably expressed this week by the senior
senator from Washington, Slade Gorton: ``I cannot will to my
children and grandchildren the proposition that a president stands
above the law and can systematically obstruct justice simply
because both the polls and the Dow Jones index are high.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Clinton has always managed somehow to keep
separate the perceptions of his political and private lives.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ever since the Gennifer Flowers affair, the voters
have had no illusions about his moral standards (``He's slime,''
said one Washington doctor this week), but they have nonetheless
elected him twice to do what he calls ``the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase cleverly trivializes his impeachment, a proceeding
Clinton characterizes by that other clever phrase, ``the politics
of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has conducted ``the people's business'' with unmatched
political flair. Apart from the debacle of health-care reform in
1993, a failure of presidential inexperience and hubris, the
Clinton administrations have rarely stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have taken credit for achieving the Republican
goals of a balanced budget and a smaller government, while
simultaneously demonizing the Republicans as the party whose
selfishness ``shut down'' the government at the end of 1995 and
whose instincts are to cut the entitlements _ Social Security,
Medicare and Medicaid _ that ordinary folks take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In January last year, when the Lewinsky scandal first broke,
Clinton wrong-footed the tax-cutting Republicans with the call to
``Save Social Security first.'' And this year, even as the Senate
was conducting his trial, Clinton again wrong-footed the
Republicans with the mantra, ``Save Social Security for the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to such political skills a personality of extraordinary
warmth. Add a natural rapport with all Americans, regardless of
race and color (hence the ironic compliment that Clinton is the
country's ``first black president''). Add a team of defense lawyers
clever both in argument and in composition (including not just a
man in a wheelchair but a young black woman).
</P>
<P>
   Add, finally, the bungling of the House Republicans, first in
ruling out the alternative of a censure motion and then in needling
the Senate to be equally partisan. Given that total, perhaps the
president's escape was always certain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the suspicion that fate smiles kindly on the president
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in 1995, when the Gingrichian Republicans were
dominating politics, the Oklahoma City bombing of April 1995 gave
Clinton an occasion to be ``presidential,'' so too, as the Lewinsky
saga unfolded, have the peace process in Northern Ireland, the
antics of Saddam Hussein and the search for peace between
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the Senate trial entered its final phase, Clinton
travelled to Jordan for the funeral of King Hussein. That event
brought a tear to the president's eye _ and it revived memories of
King Hussein's public praise for Clinton when announcing the Wye
River peace deal at the White House last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President,'' said the king, ``I've had the privilege of
being a friend of the United States and presidents since the late
President Eisenhower. (But)...I have never...known someone with
your dedication, clearheadedness, focus and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise, indeed. Whether justified or not is another matter;
but ratings released this week by John Zogby, a well-known
pollster, claim that Bill Clinton has edged ahead of George Bush as
a great or near-great president, and is only a fraction behind
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the White House team, who have promised to celebrate
in a ``gloat-free zone,'' find it hard to hide their smiles. No
wonder the Republicans are so frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   As Zogby says of Clinton: ``He should continue to fascinate and
confound us for generations.'' &QL;

SALT LAKE CITY: NO LONGER A HOLIER-THAN-THOU HICKSVILLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Brigham Young's city in the Great Salt Desert has
been trying to get rid of its image as a holier-than-thou
Hicksville. Now it has managed it: the Olympics scandal has made it
a byword for bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A report released on Feb. 9 shows that Olympic officials were
offered anything they fancied on their shopping trips to the city,
including curtains, bathroom fixtures, lawn equipment, even dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Not typical behavior, you might think, for the city of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But there is more to
Salt Lake City than Mormonism, just as there is more to the Olympic
scandals than Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the population of the city are non-Mormons,
including the mayor, who is also a Democrat who once supported Ted
Kennedy for president.
</P>
<P>
   The city is home to so many micro-breweries and coffee shops
that, after a few drinks, you can be forgiven for thinking that you
have ended up in Seattle by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake can boast many of the vices of modern urban life.
Gangs have become a serious problem, thanks largely to migration
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tramps gather around the Greyhound bus station, just as they do
in any other American city; tattooed youths ask for spare change;
and not all the girls who accost you are trying to explain the
principles of Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4 the Rolling Stones played to a packed stadium; down
the road a less famous band, Evil Petting Zoo, entertained a
rowdier crowd. A local cinema is showing a film called ``Orgazmo,''
about a Mormon missionary who gets enmeshed in the porn industry.
</P>
<P>
   The city's boosters may prefer to keep quiet about ``Orgazmo.''
But in general they are desperate to prove that their city has
arrived in the big league.
</P>
<P>
   The city has acquired an impressive array of civic monuments in
the past few years, including basketball and football stadiums, a
huge courthouse, and a convention center for more than 20,000; and
building is proceeding at a furious pace, with a light railway
system under construction and new hotels emerging out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   The locals are particularly proud that their basketball team has
been in the National Basketball Association Finals for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of civic pride has been made possible by an
economy that has been on a roll since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Salt Lake was an isolated town, dependent
largely on mining and military expenditure. But Delta Air Lines'
decision in the mid-1980s to turn the city into its hub means that
it is easily accessible by air.
</P>
<P>
   And the computer revolution means that it can use its abundant
natural advantages _ notably its spectacular scenery and cheap but
educated labor force _ to attract companies from all around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 48 companies, including American Express and Dean
Witter, have moved their back-office operations to Salt Lake City,
where the growth rate in jobs has sometimes exceeded 6 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that growth rate is slowing down at last. The
industrial core is being battered by the Asian crisis: the state's
exports contracted by 8.3 percent last year. At the same time, the
relocation gold rush is not what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between pay in Utah and the rest of the country has
narrowed for the past nine years, and the service-sector received a
major blow recently when American Stores merged with Albertson's,
leaving the company's brand new $100 million headquarters empty.
</P>
<P>
   So where can the city look for renewed growth? Mostly to tourism
_ and particularly to winter sports. Utah is blessed with powdery
snow that is slippery without being particularly wet, a resource
that it shares with very few other places.
</P>
<P>
   The skiing industry is sinking hundreds of millions of dollars
into the slopes above Salt Lake. And winter sports are driving much
of the city's booming convention business.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February the city played host to 16,000 retailers of
outdoor clothes; later in the month it welcomes the National
Brotherhood of Skiers, a group of 4,000 African-American devotees
of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is this growing conviction of the economic potential of
winter sports, combined with a fierce local pride, that explains
why the city went to such lengths to secure the winter Olympics.
But the strategy is risky.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are acting as a huge economic stimulus at present,
as private investors build hotels and the city tries to cram ten
years of infrastructure investment into five. But once they are
over the construction bubble will burst, and the city could well be
left with thousands of surplus hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The occupancy rate has already fallen from 73 percent in 1996 to
63 percent in 1998. But ten hotels are currently under construction
in the region, and another 40 projects are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   All this sounds ominous. But Salt Lake still has one resource
that other bumptious cities cannot match (even though local
boosters tend to downplay it): the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more to the city than the church, but the church
nevertheless remains a vital force in the local economy. Mormonism
is a business-minded religion with about 10 million adherents (half
of them outside the United States) and assets worth a minimum of
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its global headquarters _ a vast complex that includes a temple,
a huge tabernacle, a genealogical library, a museum, an
administrative complex and an apartment for the Prophet _ has long
protected downtown Salt Lake from the urban blight that is
commonplace elsewhere.
</P>
<P>

even if the current property bubble bursts spectacularly. The

It paid for the project in cash.

The fashion for skiing will wax and wane. But the thing that
guarantees that Salt Lake City will continue to grow is precisely
what built it in the first place: the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. &QL;

SALT LAKE CITY: NO LONGER A HOLIER-THAN-THOU HICKSVILLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Brigham Young's city in the Great Salt Desert has
been trying to get rid of its image as a holier-than-thou
Hicksville. Now it has managed it: the Olympics scandal has made it
a byword for bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A report released on Feb. 9 shows that Olympic officials were
offered anything they fancied on their shopping trips to the city,
including curtains, bathroom fixtures, lawn equipment, even dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Not typical behavior, you might think, for the city of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But there is more to
Salt Lake City than Mormonism, just as there is more to the Olympic
scandals than Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the population of the city are non-Mormons,
including the mayor, who is also a Democrat who once supported Ted
Kennedy for president.
</P>
<P>
   The city is home to so many micro-breweries and coffee shops
that, after a few drinks, you can be forgiven for thinking that you
have ended up in Seattle by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake can boast many of the vices of modern urban life.
Gangs have become a serious problem, thanks largely to migration
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tramps gather around the Greyhound bus station, just as they do
in any other American city; tattooed youths ask for spare change;
and not all the girls who accost you are trying to explain the
principles of Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4 the Rolling Stones played to a packed stadium; down
the road a less famous band, Evil Petting Zoo, entertained a
rowdier crowd. A local cinema is showing a film called ``Orgazmo,''
about a Mormon missionary who gets enmeshed in the porn industry.
</P>
<P>
   The city's boosters may prefer to keep quiet about ``Orgazmo.''
But in general they are desperate to prove that their city has
arrived in the big league.
</P>
<P>
   The city has acquired an impressive array of civic monuments in
the past few years, including basketball and football stadiums, a
huge courthouse, and a convention center for more than 20,000; and
building is proceeding at a furious pace, with a light railway
system under construction and new hotels emerging out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   The locals are particularly proud that their basketball team has
been in the National Basketball Association Finals for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of civic pride has been made possible by an
economy that has been on a roll since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Salt Lake was an isolated town, dependent
largely on mining and military expenditure. But Delta Air Lines'
decision in the mid-1980s to turn the city into its hub means that
it is easily accessible by air.
</P>
<P>
   And the computer revolution means that it can use its abundant
natural advantages _ notably its spectacular scenery and cheap but
educated labor force _ to attract companies from all around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 48 companies, including American Express and Dean
Witter, have moved their back-office operations to Salt Lake City,
where the growth rate in jobs has sometimes exceeded 6 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that growth rate is slowing down at last. The
industrial core is being battered by the Asian crisis: the state's
exports contracted by 8.3 percent last year. At the same time, the
relocation gold rush is not what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between pay in Utah and the rest of the country has
narrowed for the past nine years, and the service-sector received a
major blow recently when American Stores merged with Albertson's,
leaving the company's brand new $100 million headquarters empty.
</P>
<P>
   So where can the city look for renewed growth? Mostly to tourism
_ and particularly to winter sports. Utah is blessed with powdery
snow that is slippery without being particularly wet, a resource
that it shares with very few other places.
</P>
<P>
   The skiing industry is sinking hundreds of millions of dollars
into the slopes above Salt Lake. And winter sports are driving much
of the city's booming convention business.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February the city played host to 16,000 retailers of
outdoor clothes; later in the month it welcomes the National
Brotherhood of Skiers, a group of 4,000 African-American devotees
of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is this growing conviction of the economic potential of
winter sports, combined with a fierce local pride, that explains
why the city went to such lengths to secure the winter Olympics.
But the strategy is risky.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are acting as a huge economic stimulus at present,
as private investors build hotels and the city tries to cram ten
years of infrastructure investment into five. But once they are
over the construction bubble will burst, and the city could well be
left with thousands of surplus hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The occupancy rate has already fallen from 73 percent in 1996 to
63 percent in 1998. But ten hotels are currently under construction
in the region, and another 40 projects are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   All this sounds ominous. But Salt Lake still has one resource
that other bumptious cities cannot match (even though local
boosters tend to downplay it): the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more to the city than the church, but the church
nevertheless remains a vital force in the local economy. Mormonism
is a business-minded religion with about 10 million adherents (half
of them outside the United States) and assets worth a minimum of
$30 billion.

   AMMAN _ In death, as in life, King Hussein dominates Jordan.
Even at the swearing-in of his son and successor, Abdullah, on Feb.
7, he remained the focus of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony, a workman, busy dusting the podium on which
the new king was to take his oath of office, was called away to the
more important task of wiping clean a nearby portrait of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah himself lingered longer in silent tribute to his
father's picture than over the oath itself. The wailing from the
gallery at every mention of the old king outdid the applause at the
inauguration of the new.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians seem consumed with genuine grief at the death of the
man who had been their king for nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
   During the three days he lay dying in an Amman hospital,
thousands waited outside the gates. With the news of his death,
crowds of young men surged through the streets chanting, ``There is
no god but Allah and Hussein is beloved by Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, perhaps a quarter of the population turned out for
the king's funeral, plus an array of foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   How can the huge void left by the king's death be filled? Quite
smoothly, at least to begin with. King Abdullah has been quick to
affirm the policies of his father, including peace with Israel and
a gradual (very gradual) process of democratization.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was promoted only two weeks before he took over and
has no political experience, he scarcely set a foot wrong during
the very public diplomatic encounters at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle and rival, Prince Hassan, who served as crown prince
for 34 years before being unceremoniously sacked last month, both
stood by his elbow and generously sent him an open letter of
submission and support.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Hamzeh, his 18-year-old half-brother and the elder son of
Hussein's widow, Queen Noor, was appointed crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of stability, and out of respect for the dead king,
the royal family, local politicians, ordinary Jordanians and a
panoply of world leaders have rallied behind King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The support is not only moral. The United States has announced
an extra $300 million in aid to Jordan over the next three years.
The United Arab Emirates has promised to deposit money in the
Central Bank, and Saudi Arabia, which fell out with Jordan during
the Gulf war over its forgiving stance towards Iraq, has promised
to resume its once-huge handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Amman's stock market barely budged in the face of King Hussein's
imminent death, and the Central Bank had little trouble defending
the Jordanian dinar. Jordan has not missed a beat, either
economically or politically.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, however, change is inevitable. Although Jordan
is theoretically a constitutional monarchy, its parliament has
always acted on the initiative of the king.
</P>
<P>
   During King Hussein's recent seven-month absence in America for
cancer treatment, an air of paralysis hung over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The government of the day lost popularity over a scandal about
contaminated water, but Jordan's political institutions were unable
to cope with the crisis. King Hussein had to intervene from his
sickbed to sack the prime minister and appoint a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Given the new king's lesser experience and stature, he will find
it hard to rule in such a hands-on manner. Already some liberal
members of parliament are calling for a revision of the restrictive
press and electoral laws, both of which were linchpins of King
Hussein's system of limited democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although King Abdullah seems to share his father's suspicion of
political freedom, the role of future governments and parliaments
is likely to expand in the face of his inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the new king hope to exert anything like the influence
his father had on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, King Hussein forced Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's prime minister, to release the spiritual leader of Hamas
in exchange for captured Israeli spies, faced down Syria's
iron-willed President Hafez Assad in a vitriolic propaganda war,
persuaded both Bill Clinton and his Iraqi counterpart, Saddam
Hussein, to give Jordan financial aid, and intervened personally to
secure the agreement at Wye between Yasser Arafat and skeptical
Israeli negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine King Abdullah holding his own against such
seasoned politicians, let alone wringing concessions from them.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, epitomizing the faint air of
condescension exuded by many of the Arab leaders at the funeral,
called the 37-year-old king ``a very good young man.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Jordan, bereft of its famous ruler, will be cut down
to size.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah will have to concentrate on domestic affairs,
attempting to improve the faltering economy of a small, poor,
desert country with few natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has reached fully 15 percent, and economic growth
is nonexistent. Various privatization schemes have stalled, along
with IMF-inspired liberalization _ and the present cabinet is
closely associated with the sidelined Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein won the affection of most Jordanians not through
his labors as an international statesman but as someone who cared
about and, over the course of his reign, improved the living
standards of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of his dynasty rests on the new king's ability to
provide for the masses who flocked to his father's funeral. &QL;

<P>
   Judged by the ultra-conservative tastes of Japan's business
establishment, Tsutomu Shida's office is gloriously vulgar. The
decor is garish. The wall cabinets are marbled and mirrored.
Threatening to skewer the unwary guest is a giant, stuffed
swordfish. ``My hobby,'' offers Shida, helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   Self-made men like Shida attract ridicule and condescension in
snooty Japan. As a rule, they keep quiet about their success. But
Shida is as loud as his carpet.
</P>
<P>
   He pops up regularly in the Japanese media. He has a starring
role on a government committee to encourage business start-ups. He
has written two books about life as an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife scolds me if I'm in the newspapers,'' he smiles. ``But
in Japan we have no role models. Somebody has to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's shortage of entrepreneurs is a real worry. Big employers
are horribly overstaffed. They are now shedding jobs almost as fast
as American firms did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   More young companies are needed to hire these people instead.
Yet for over a decade Japan has been losing more companies than it
has created. More startlingly, Japan's entrepreneurs are aging even
faster than its population, suggesting that entrepreneurialism is
dying out with the post-war generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government wants to find out why. But Shida has no
small interest in the question himself. His latest venture is to
run a school that seeks to teach Japanese people how to be
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Shida made his own fortune in food. He once managed an ice-cream
factory. Later, he opened a restaurant. He started a catering
business with the money he saved, then opened a chain of karaoke
bars.
</P>
<P>
   He has since built his catering firm, Shidax Food Service, into
Japan's biggest caterer, dishing up YEN 52 billion-worth ($456
million) of meals to companies, schools and hospitals last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he floated Shidax Food Service on the stock market.
Later the same year, he launched a fund to invest in entrepreneurs
and an institute to train them.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had YEN 5.5 billion for early-stage investments. But
Shida quickly found that it was a shortage of know-how, not money,
that was holding people back. Since then, he has put much of his
effort into making entrepreneurs, rather than financing them.
</P>
<P>
   The institute runs three courses, each tailored to a different
stage of business development. Applicants are asked to submit a
business plan. The curriculum covers accounting, marketing,
distribution and fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a separate ``golden age'' class for elderly
entrepreneurs. At the moment, 160 pupils are enrolled in the
standard classes; and 200 in the golden-age program. The oldest
beginner is a sprightly 82.
</P>
<P>
   Shida talks expansively about repaying his debts to society, but
his motives are not purely charitable. Although the classes are
free, students who do well may be selected for investment through
his fund.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fund's investments include a company making
microwave ovens that thaw frozen sushi evenly; a software developer
for the health-care industry; and a maker of digital maps for
car-navigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that the institute's graduates should take their
businesses public and recycle their wealth back into start-ups
themselves, forming what amounts to a business angels' collective.
</P>
<P>
   Shida readily acknowledges that there are barriers to starting a
business in Japan that no amount of schooling will get past.
</P>
<P>
   To set up a limited-liability company, for instance, you must
have at least YEN 10 million-worth of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Capital investments in early-stage Japanese companies do not get
the favorable tax treatment available in America, although Shida's
committee managed to get the rules changed modestly. Tax treatment
of business angels is also less favorable in Japan than in America.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists need sophisticated capital markets, such as
a welcoming stock market and a junk-bond market for speculative
debt investments _ both of which Japan lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the areas in which Shida thinks his school can help
that give the greatest pause for thought. Pupils need a lot of
support and encouragement, says Shida, if they are to cast off
their cultural inhibitions. For the traditionally conformist
Japanese, that is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Some handicaps are familiar in other countries trying to ape
American business dynamism. The stigma attached to failure
discourages start-ups; it also makes business plans less flexible.
Once launched, a business venture is not easily reversed for fear
of losing face.
</P>
<P>
   Other obstacles, such as its education system, are worse in
Japan. Japanese education gets flak for suppressing individuality;
encouraging group behavior and conformity; and cultivating amae, a
psychological reliance on other people. This behavior is reinforced
by bullying, which is sometimes even led by teachers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Shida's school is a valiant effort to fight against the tide.
Yet one class a month is unlikely to undo a childhood of such
things.
</P>
<P>
   Shida hopes that the way to inspire inhibited would-be
entrepreneurs is ``to show them the money.'' But even the appeal of
wealth has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shida is typical of most of those in her position when she
worries about being a nouveau riche: old money is classier money.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are fond of saying that ``the nail that sticks up
gets knocked back in.'' Until such attitudes change, the only
Japanese entrepreneurs will be those, like Shida, who are
impervious to the hammer. &QL;

   Judged by the ultra-conservative tastes of Japan's business
establishment, Tsutomu Shida's office is gloriously vulgar. The
decor is garish. The wall cabinets are marbled and mirrored.
Threatening to skewer the unwary guest is a giant, stuffed
swordfish. ``My hobby,'' offers Shida, helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   Self-made men like Shida attract ridicule and condescension in
snooty Japan. As a rule, they keep quiet about their success. But
Shida is as loud as his carpet.
</P>
<P>
   He pops up regularly in the Japanese media. He has a starring
role on a government committee to encourage business start-ups. He
has written two books about life as an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife scolds me if I'm in the newspapers,'' he smiles. ``But

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Americans, lawyers seem to embody extremes of both heroism
and greed, sometimes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   A film currently playing to packed cinemas across the country,
``A Civil Action,'' tells the true story of one crusading lawyer
(played by John Travolta) who bankrupted himself trying to sue two
big companies which had polluted a small town's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   But when they win, even lawyer-heroes expect to be well paid.
</P>
<P>
   The small group of contingency-fee lawyers who helped state
governments bring the tobacco industry to heel are about to collect
fees so colossal that they dwarf even the excesses of Wall Street
investment bankers in the mad, bad 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco remains a bonanza for lawyers in all kinds of ways. On
Feb. 10, a Californian jury awarded $51.5 million in damages
against Philip Morris to a woman with inoperable lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The award, by far the largest in a smoking-related lawsuit, was
a brusque reminder that, despite last year's settlement with the
states, tobacco companies remain vulnerable to suits brought by
individuals; and that as long as smokers want compensation, lawyers
will reap fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The legal profession is still trying to digest the implications
of the staggering $8.1 billion a three-man arbitration panel
awarded in December to lawyers for the work they did in helping
Florida, Mississippi and Texas win a settlement from the tobacco
industry for health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, the panel is expected to use the same
criteria to set fees for the lawyers who represented dozens of
other states in the negotiations which led to a national settlement
last November.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, some 250-450 lucky lawyers could collect between $20
billion and $25 billion in fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These amounts are grotesque and absurd,'' says Lester
Brickman, a law professor at New York's Cardozo School of Law.
``Most of this money should have gone to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Brickman, an expert on legal fees, predicts that the flood of
cash going to a small group of trial lawyers will finance a wave of
mass litigation against other industries, including alcohol and
fast food, on similar public-health grounds.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is already being pursued by big-city mayors
against gun manufacturers and distributors with the help of some of
the same law firms which represented the states in their suits
against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear wider political consequences. Trial lawyers are
well-connected, politically savvy, and among the most generous
contributors to campaign funds. (Most of them support the
Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very worried that the additional clout these
amounts give the trial bar will impede any reform of the legal
system,'' says Mary Ann Glendon, a law professor at Harvard. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 425 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers involved in the tobacco suits insist that the awards
are fair, reflecting the risk they ran by taking on the tobacco
firms when no one, including the state attorneys-general, thought
they had much chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers worked without pay, and as part of the settlement
have now agreed to submit to arbitration rather than insist on a
share of the money the states will receive, which is what the
contracts they signed with many state governments would have given
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees are huge,'' admits Philip Anderson, the president of
the American Bar Association. ``But these lawyers were able to do
something that governments have never been able to achieve on their
own _ assemble enough evidence to bring the tobacco industry to
account. And the fees were agreed by sophisticated parties on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much sophistication, in fact, may be the problem. Unusually,
neither plaintiffs nor defendants in these cases seem to have had
much interest in limiting the lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, these fees are being paid by the tobacco firms,
which spares the state attorneys-general the politically
embarrassing task of having to pay the lawyers huge amounts of
money out of their state's share of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers agreed to arbitration because they knew that state
politicians could never have honored their contingency contracts,
which would themselves have become the subject of prolonged
litigation. Most judges would have reduced the amounts the lawyers
would get.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the arbitration is a mere fig leaf. The money going
to the lawyers was clearly part of the overall amount that the
tobacco companies were willing to pay to settle the case. Whatever
the lawyers get, the states do not.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the tobacco companies has also been suspiciously
muted. Brown &AMP; Williamson, one of the firms, called the fee award
``obscene,'' but the other companies said little.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that they do not really care about the size of
the total fee award. Their deal with the states caps the amount
they must pay all the states' lawyers at $500 million a year. This
will be divided by the lawyers according to their proportions of
the overall fee award.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies will also shell out another $1.25 billion over
the next five years to pay off those lawyers who do not want to
wait years to receive all their money. So the companies' exposure
is limited, no matter what the lawyers get. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the lawyers are becoming joint business partners with
the states and the tobacco companies in levying a tax on smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The overall settlement has been widely misreported as giving the
states $206 billion. But this is only the amount that they will
receive in the first 25 years. The settlement actually runs in
perpetuity, turning the tobacco firms into permanent tax-collection
agencies for the states.
</P>
<P>
   The firms have already raised prices by about 50 cents a pack to
pay for the settlement. The $500 million they will be handing over
to the lawyers annually will also be paid for by smokers.
</P>
<P>
   If the total fee award to lawyers reaches $25 billion, these
annual payments will continue for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the outstanding fees are inflation-adjusted, as the
arbitrators decided they should be in Florida, Mississippi and
Texas, the payments to the lawyers and their heirs could go on
forever, because the $500 million annual cap will not be
inflation-adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco firms are threatening to challenge the
inflation-adjustment provision in the courts because they say it is
not part of the national settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation-adjusted or not, today's smokers _ 70 percent of
whom earn less than $40,000 a year _ will be paying the lawyers as
well as the states, via the tobacco companies, for the rest of
their (abbreviated) lives. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 200-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Tobacco companies' bottom lines will barely be affected. This is
why tobacco shares rose after the settlement with the states was
announced in November and barely reacted when the first gigantic
fee awards to lawyers were made in December.
</P>
<P>
   How the arbitrators came up with such a huge figure is something
of a mystery. The awards range from 20-35 percent of what the three
states will receive. But this is far more than the 8 percent fee
agreed last May by the lawyers in Minnesota, the only state
actually to take its tobacco case all the way to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brickman of Cardozo School of Law is lobbying Congress to impose
an excess-profits tax on the lawyers' fees. Few believe such a law
would withstand a constitutional challenge from the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And the tobacco companies have other things to worry about. They
are now facing the prospect of a giant lawsuit from the federal
government. The Justice Department says that it, too, may hire
outside lawyers to help fight that case, but that if it does, they
will be paid a salary, not a contingency fee. Progress of a sort. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Americans, lawyers seem to embody extremes of both heroism
and greed, sometimes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   A film currently playing to packed cinemas across the country,
``A Civil Action,'' tells the true story of one crusading lawyer
(played by John Travolta) who bankrupted himself trying to sue two
big companies which had polluted a small town's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   But when they win, even lawyer-heroes expect to be well paid.
</P>
<P>
   The small group of contingency-fee lawyers who helped state
governments bring the tobacco industry to heel are about to collect
fees so colossal that they dwarf even the excesses of Wall Street
investment bankers in the mad, bad 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco remains a bonanza for lawyers in all kinds of ways. On
Feb. 10, a Californian jury awarded $51.5 million in damages
against Philip Morris to a woman with inoperable lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The award, by far the largest in a smoking-related lawsuit, was
a brusque reminder that, despite last year's settlement with the
states, tobacco companies remain vulnerable to suits brought by
individuals; and that as long as smokers want compensation, lawyers
will reap fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The legal profession is still trying to digest the implications
of the staggering $8.1 billion a three-man arbitration panel
awarded in December to lawyers for the work they did in helping
Florida, Mississippi and Texas win a settlement from the tobacco
industry for health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, the panel is expected to use the same
criteria to set fees for the lawyers who represented dozens of
other states in the negotiations which led to a national settlement
last November.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, some 250-450 lucky lawyers could collect between $20
billion and $25 billion in fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These amounts are grotesque and absurd,'' says Lester
Brickman, a law professor at New York's Cardozo School of Law.
``Most of this money should have gone to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Brickman, an expert on legal fees, predicts that the flood of
cash going to a small group of trial lawyers will finance a wave of
mass litigation against other industries, including alcohol and
fast food, on similar public-health grounds.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is already being pursued by big-city mayors
against gun manufacturers and distributors with the help of some of
the same law firms which represented the states in their suits
against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear wider political consequences. Trial lawyers are
well-connected, politically savvy, and among the most generous
contributors to campaign funds. (Most of them support the
Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very worried that the additional clout these
amounts give the trial bar will impede any reform of the legal
system,'' says Mary Ann Glendon, a law professor at Harvard. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 425 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers involved in the tobacco suits insist that the awards
are fair, reflecting the risk they ran by taking on the tobacco
firms when no one, including the state attorneys-general, thought
they had much chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers worked without pay, and as part of the settlement
have now agreed to submit to arbitration rather than insist on a
share of the money the states will receive, which is what the
contracts they signed with many state governments would have given
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees are huge,'' admits Philip Anderson, the president of
the American Bar Association. ``But these lawyers were able to do
something that governments have never been able to achieve on their
own _ assemble enough evidence to bring the tobacco industry to
account. And the fees were agreed by sophisticated parties on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much sophistication, in fact, may be the problem. Unusually,
neither plaintiffs nor defendants in these cases seem to have had
much interest in limiting the lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, these fees are being paid by the tobacco firms,
which spares the state attorneys-general the politically
embarrassing task of having to pay the lawyers huge amounts of
money out of their state's share of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers agreed to arbitration because they knew that state
politicians could never have honored their contingency contracts,
which would themselves have become the subject of prolonged
litigation. Most judges would have reduced the amounts the lawyers
would get.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the arbitration is a mere fig leaf. The money going
to the lawyers was clearly part of the overall amount that the
tobacco companies were willing to pay to settle the case. Whatever
the lawyers get, the states do not.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the tobacco companies has also been suspiciously
muted. Brown &AMP; Williamson, one of the firms, called the fee award
``obscene,'' but the other companies said little.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that they do not really care about the size of
the total fee award. Their deal with the states caps the amount
they must pay all the states' lawyers at $500 million a year. This
will be divided by the lawyers according to their proportions of
the overall fee award.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies will also shell out another $1.25 billion over
the next five years to pay off those lawyers who do not want to
wait years to receive all their money. So the companies' exposure
is limited, no matter what the lawyers get. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the lawyers are becoming joint business partners with
the states and the tobacco companies in levying a tax on smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The overall settlement has been widely misreported as giving the
states $206 billion. But this is only the amount that they will
receive in the first 25 years. The settlement actually runs in
perpetuity, turning the tobacco firms into permanent tax-collection
agencies for the states.
</P>
<P>
   The firms have already raised prices by about 50 cents a pack to
pay for the settlement. The $500 million they will be handing over
to the lawyers annually will also be paid for by smokers.
</P>
<P>
   If the total fee award to lawyers reaches $25 billion, these
annual payments will continue for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the outstanding fees are inflation-adjusted, as the
arbitrators decided they should be in Florida, Mississippi and
Texas, the payments to the lawyers and their heirs could go on
forever, because the $500 million annual cap will not be
inflation-adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco firms are threatening to challenge the
inflation-adjustment provision in the courts because they say it is
not part of the national settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation-adjusted or not, today's smokers _ 70 percent of
whom earn less than $40,000 a year _ will be paying the lawyers as
well as the states, via the tobacco companies, for the rest of
their (abbreviated) lives. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 200-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Tobacco companies' bottom lines will barely be affected. This is
why tobacco shares rose after the settlement with the states was
announced in November and barely reacted when the first gigantic
fee awards to lawyers were made in December.
</P>
<P>
   How the arbitrators came up with such a huge figure is something
of a mystery. The awards range from 20-35 percent of what the three
states will receive. But this is far more than the 8 percent fee
agreed last May by the lawyers in Minnesota, the only state
actually to take its tobacco case all the way to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brickman of Cardozo School of Law is lobbying Congress to impose
an excess-profits tax on the lawyers' fees. Few believe such a law
would withstand a constitutional challenge from the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And the tobacco companies have other things to worry about. They
are now facing the prospect of a giant lawsuit from the federal
government. The Justice Department says that it, too, may hire
outside lawyers to help fight that case, but that if it does, they
will be paid a salary, not a contingency fee. Progress of a sort. &QL;

PUBLIC HOUSING FINDS ACCEPTANCE IN DALLAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The homeowners foresaw ruin. They feared cultural
clashes and crime, juvenile gangs and graffiti, drugs and litter,
and, above all, they imagined collapsing property values in one of
the state's hottest real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 of them banded together in an unsuccessful
battle to avert the looming disaster. But now, nearly a year after
an unusual public-housing project opened in their neighborhood, the
fears appear to have been allayed and the criticism silenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give them high grades,'' says Dick Prewitt, who had
been one of the most ardent opponents of Frankford Townhomes, a
complex of 75 two-story public-housing units completed last May in
an affluent, mostly white section of far north Dallas. ``They did
everything they said they would do, as far as landscaping,
ambience, facade. Everything they said would happen did happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial project was born in litigation but has grown
in an atmosphere of community cooperation that surprised even its
most optimistic advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fantastic,'' says Reginald Giles, the resident
manager of the complex. ``They've wrapped their arms around us with
nothing but support.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowner opposition, says Dallas Housing Authority director
Lori Moon, was based on observations of traditional public housing
_ large, drab complexes built in depressed, segregated
neighborhoods. Frequently, the units quickly grew to resemble their
surroundings and there were few programs to help residents lift
themselves out of that environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, public housing was built to maintain
segregation,'' Moon says. ``We can't build like that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, breaking out of that mold probably would have been
politically impossible, so in 1985, seven impoverished black women
took their complaints to court. They sued the housing authority,
alleging that low-income black families were being herded into
tax-supported slums. Ten years later, U.S. District Judge Jerry
Buchmeyer agreed and ordered the DHA to build 474 units in
predominantly white sections of Dallas and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   When the first site was selected at the intersection of
Frankford Road and Marsh Lane, nearby property owners, many of whom
had paid $300,000 or more for their homes, rallied in opposition.
They had powerful allies on the City Council and in Congress _
House Majority Leader Dick Armey of nearby Irving among them _ but
rather than be swayed by their arguments, Buchmeyer included them
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He formed the Frankford Townhomes Neighborhood Advisory Board
and ordered the DHA to work with the homeowners in the design of
the units, setting criteria for screening residents and drafting
rules and regulations that would be enforced at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude was, `We're going to make the best of it,'''
Moon says of the neighborhood advisers. ``We got them together with
the architects, told them how much money we had to work with and
let them design it. They even selected the fencing.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a stark departure from traditional public
housing. Frankford Townhomes, a cluster of brick four-plexes with
wide, clean drives, manicured lawns and an adjacent learning
center, blends seamlessly into the neighborhood of new garden
apartments and walled and gated residential developments. It is not
uncommon for apartment hunters to visit Giles' office, unaware that
they are in a public-housing development.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for residency, tenants must enroll in the federal
Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which imposes its own set of rules
aimed at ending dependency on public housing within five years. In
addition to keeping their property clean, heads of households must
work or attend school at least 20 hours a week and volunteer time
to their children's schools. They are encouraged to attend classes
in parenting and job-hunting skills that are offered on the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time in Dallas, a resident manager was
assigned to a public-housing complex.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the complex was filled, the controversy was largely
defused, but the homeowners continued to monitor the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a typical situation,'' Prewitt says. ``It is 100
percent better than we thought it would be, but only time will tell
... how well the screening of applicants goes ... how well they
patrol the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles welcomes the scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people driving through and looking around and I know
they don't live here, but that's fine,'' he says. ``I feel like I'm
being watched, but I enjoy it. This is going to work. We're going
to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the neighbors seemed equally committed to the success of
Frankford Townhomes.
</P>
<P>
   A local Boy Scout troop collects books for the children of the
complex, a nearby church sends a bus each day to take the children
to school, local companies have offered job training, Brookhaven
Community College conducts accredited classes at the learning
center, and Legal Ministries offers free legal services to the
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been overwhelming,'' says Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Marsona Turner, who moved in three months ago with her husband
and three children from public housing in West Dallas, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been made to feel very welcome,'' says Turner, who
recently became president of the residents council. ``No negative
feedback at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She applied for residency at Frankford Townhomes, she says, for
the opportunity to ``be around different people, for my children to
be able to interact with different people. It has been very nice,
very peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of the Frankford Townhomes and the
acceptance by the neighborhood, the housing authority is still
having to fight a block-by-block battle to fully comply with
Buchmeyer's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of two other north Dallas complexes has been
delayed by homeowner groups appealing the judge's order to the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Moon wishes those homeowners would pay a visit to Frankford
Townhomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any person driving by would never know this is public
housing,'' she said. ``The neighborhoods don't have anything to
fear.''

TARGETING TALENT MAY HELP KEEP IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When professionals decide to change jobs, they typically do it
after coming to the conclusion that they have no opportunity for
growth in their current position.
</P>
<P>
   They don't believe the company values their contribution, so
it's time to move on, said Jac Fitz-enz, who has conducted
thousands of exit interviews to find out why employees resign.
Fitz-enz, who recently spoke to the Houston Human Resource
Management Association, is founder of the Saratoga Institute, a
consulting company in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the importance of growth to employees, Harriet S.
Wasserstrum, vice chairman of Chase Bank of Texas, came up with the
idea of succession planning.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstrum instructed her 14 subordinates to identify three
individuals: someone who can take their jobs immediately, someone
who can take the jobs after two to three years of grooming and
someone who is either a woman or minority who can step in after
gaining some skills or experience.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the subordinates did the same thing for their
subordinates, said Wasserstrum. At the end of the exercise, which
stopped before reaching the first-line supervisor level, the
managers developed a list of about 450 names.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just a list of people, Wasserstrum said. The
managers spoke to each of their employees on the list who were
identified as up-and-comers and went through a career plan, laying
out the skills and experience they need to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that meant signing up for a high-profile committee
that could give an employee wide exposure. That way, if the
employee is later recommended for a management job supervising 800
employees and $300 million, he'd already be well known in the
company, Wasserstrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have spent a lot of time in one area are sent to
another part of the bank to get a broader range of experience.
</P>
<P>
   No one was told directly that they were identified as an
immediate successor, Wasserstrum said. The job may not pan out or
maybe the candidate is also pegged for another slot. And the bank
doesn't want successors to breathe down the necks of the people
they will replace, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GETTING READY TO MOVE UP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have succession plans but they're usually just
for top executives. And most companies don't spend much time
figuring out who will take a midlevel manager's job until a manager
submits his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The program has become a great way to identify candidates who
might have slipped through the cracks, said Carol Nichols, senior
vice president of capital markets fiduciary services.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, who is one of Wasserstrum's subordinates, said she
identified a candidate for her job and suggested he take a
management training course to learn communication skills, problem
solving and how to build strategic relationships.
</P>
<P>
   One of his weaknesses is he hasn't run a profit-and-loss
business line. So Nichols said she recommended that he take on a
special project in the corporate trust area. He also needs some
experience developing customer relationships, so he will spend time
picking up that skill too, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Managers often like to hog their good people _ keep them under
wraps so no one else can get them. The program that Wasserstrum
started is a way to make sure good candidates get on the radar
screen _ that they become known as top performers _ so when jobs
come up, someone thinks of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't promote them, NationsBank or Bank One will,''
Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CROSSING BOUNDARIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rafael A. Herrera has been tapped on the shoulder as a top
performer with a lot of potential. He was recently promoted to
manager of the ``deal team'' (they close deals), three steps away
from Wasserstrum's level.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, who works in capital markets fiduciary services and has
a staff of six, said his boss recommended that he join a formal
mentoring program at Chase that will link him with the senior vice
president of the retail division.

<P>
   Herrera said it's a chance to get to know a senior executive in
a totally different part of the bank who can help him delegate
authority, manage others and learn the ins and outs of getting
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera said it's been really helpful to sit down with his
manager to get an idea of what he needs to learn to be successful
at his new job and how to get to the next level. Eventually, he
hopes to step in and run the structured finance group, which has
about 180 employees in Texas.

A DAY FOR REMEMBERING EVEN LESS-NOTABLE PRESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use Monday, Feb. 15 and thereafter)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Presidents' Day, which has become a generic
February holiday, replaces birthday celebrations for Abraham
Lincoln on Feb. 12 and George Washington on Feb. 22 and focuses
attention on other presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens was impressed with the clothes of the 17th
president of the United States. Andrew Johnson probably sewed the
threads himself. He was a tailor by trade, born in a log cabin and
illiterate until he was 18. Johnson became president on April 15,
1865, after John Wilkes Booth assassinated Lincoln, a tragedy from
which neither President Johnson nor the nation swiftly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked somewhat worn and anxious _ and well he might, being
at war with everybody _ but the expression on his face was mild and
pleasant, and his manner was remarkably unaffected, gentlemanly and
agreeable,'' the British novelist wrote. ``I thought that in his
whole carriage and demeanor he became his station singularly
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans agreed with Dickens. The cartoonist Thomas Nast
depicted him as ``King Andy.'' The New York World called him ``an
insolent, drunken brute in comparison with whom Caligula's horse
was respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   First impressions are lasting. Lincoln had urged his running
mate to take the oath of office as vice president in person in
1865, although Johnson had typhoid fever. Before being sworn in,
Johnson fired down several tumblers of whiskey, then gave a short,
incoherent speech.
</P>
<P>
   His major accomplishment, the purchase of Alaska from Russia for
$7.2 million, was ridiculed as ``a garden for polar bears.'' During
his presidency, the 13th Amendment, outlawing slavery, and the 14th
Amendment, establishing equal rights, became part of the
Constitution, but race and civil rights were incidental to the
political battle about dealing with the defeated South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radical Republicans'' had denounced Lincoln's lenient
attitudes in his second inaugural speech about ``charity for all''
and his pledge ``to bind up the nation's wounds.'' They didn't
listen to Lincoln and dismissed Johnson, a Democrat from the
``rebel province'' of Tennessee, as ``a malignant usurper'' from
``alien territory.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 29, 1865, Johnson declared an amnesty ``to all persons
who have, directly or indirectly, participated in the existing
rebellion'' if they would swear to uphold the Union and the
Constitution. Former Confederate officers then seized political
power, inflaming public opinion in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows.'' wrote Georges Clemenceau, a French
correspondent who later become his country's prime minister, ``that
Mr. Johnson expects his salvation to come from the people and the
elections.'' In 1866, Johnson made a then-unusual presidential
speechmaking tour, but Republicans tightened their veto-proof grip
on Congress, then passed a law daring the president to fire a
Cabinet member. When he did, the House impeached him.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began on March 13, 1868. One of Johnson's lawyers,
William M. Evarts, was the great-grandfather of Archibald Cox, the
special prosecutor who pursued Richard Nixon in the 1970s. The
Senate acquitted Johnson by one vote on May 26. ``What had the
president accomplished with his victory?'' his biographer, Hans L.
Trefousse, asked in a 1989 biography. ``Above all, he had succeeded
in preserving the Constitution that he admired so much. No other
president would ever again be impeached for political differences
with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Democratic convention in Chicago rejected him in 1868,
Johnson went back to Tennessee, but returned in triumph to the
Senate in 1875. He gave only one speech, denouncing President US
Grant, before the Senate adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, 1875, Andrew Johnson, 66, died in Tennessee after a
stroke and was buried on a hill in Greeneville, according to his
earlier instructions: ``Pillow my head on the Constitution of my
country and let the flag of the nation be my winding sheet.'' And
so they did.

A CRASH COURSE IN DISK RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Crashed and had to do full disk recovery. Lost
all programs. Reloaded Netscape. Now have to enter password to get
into e-mail. Waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impatient
</P>
<P>
   DEAR IMP: Problem much worse than expected. All pronouns,
articles lost, too. Not sure can be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Editor says not supposed to mock the readers, but
sometimes can't help self. Anyway, you can teach Netscape to
remember your password, but it almost seems like the Poindexters
who wrote the program tried to hide that little feature.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming have newest version. If not, get, because perfect
opportunity for upgrade. Oops! Sorry. Won't mock again. Promise.
</P>
<P>
   Pull down Edit menu and select Preferences to open configuration
window. On left pane, click Mail and Newsgroups, then Mail Servers.
Now click Edit button. General settings page appears. Click
Remember Password. Save work. Hmmm. Wonder why editor scowling.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I made the mistake of upgrading to Win98 and
realized I couldn't access DOS from the Programs menu without
exiting Windows, then having to reboot to get back into Windows
from DOS. Is this stupid or what???
</P>
<P>
   _ DOS Boot
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BOOT: Yes, it is.
</P>
<P>
   After further review, my editor has arbitrarily decided that you
were asking for help and has imposed upon me to insert the
following paragraphs:
</P>
<P>
   You know what I hate about graphical interfaces? It takes twice
as long to do even simple things like copying a file. And you Mac
people wipe those sneers off your faces. I'm talking about you,
too. I could do file copies and directory listings on my Apple IIe
a whole lot more efficiently than I could wading through that mess
of folders on the first Macintosh I bought. And what is it with
these iMacs? What kind of doofus buys an orange ...
</P>
<P>
   My editor has snidely suggested that I may have strayed from the
original subject. Here is the rewrite:
</P>
<P>
   I miss using DOS. Some of us still cling to our 12-year-old DOS
word-processors, and many games run better under DOS. The sweet
thing about that DOS shortcut in the Programs menu is that you can
have it reboot your PC with specific configuration files so your
program runs optimally.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, though, it shouldn't be rebooting. It should simply
open a window with a DOS prompt. Open up the Programs menu, then
right-click on the shortcut. Pick Properties from the menu that
appears. Now click on the Program tab and look for the Advanced
button. Normally, the only thing that should be checked is
``Suggest MS-DOS mode as necessary.'' If ``MS-DOS mode'' is
selected instead, you'll reboot every time.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what else happens with MS-DOS mode: You have the
capability of specifying an Autoexec.bat and Config.sys that will
make Redneck Rampage fly. Oh sure, I know that doesn't mean
anything to Mac people with their silly puke-green computers and
their hopeless little one-button mice, but ...
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to continue this, but my editor has asked me to a
private conference in her office. I bet this is about the big raise
I've been expecting.
</P>

<P>
   It was all over in less than an hour, on a February day a
lifetime ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the decisions Eldridge Stanton made in that span of time
call through all the long years since for remembrance on
Valentine's, the one day on the calendar that celebrates true love.
</P>
<P>
   The date is Feb. 4, 1912. The place is Niagara Falls. Or rather,
the river just below the falls, where an ice bridge, made of great
frozen plates that have cascaded over the cataract and jammed
together below, forms during most winters. This particular ice span
had been in place for 10 days and was ``considered quite safe,''
according to the Buffalo Evening News, whose accounts of the day,
along with those from other local papers and a mid-century Reader's
Digest article, provide the details for this narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Offering both an awe-inspiring arctic icescape and an
unparalleled view of the falls, the natural bridge drew tourists
from miles around.
</P>
<P>
   On this Sunday, about 35 people were out on the ice, viewing the
falls, strolling, and taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Eldridge and Clara Stanton, a young Canadian couple in the habit
of visiting the falls twice a year, had come from Toronto
specifically to view the dramatic jumble of ice architecture. A gay
young couple on holiday, they were out strolling in sweaters and
stocking caps, marveling at the natural wonder of falls and floe.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there came a tremor, then a grinding sound, from deep
within the ice. Red Hill, who ran a refreshment stand each year on
the ice, knew instantly what was happening: The ice bridge was
breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   Hill left his stand and started running for the Canadian shore,
shouting for the others to follow him. Most did. But the Stantons
turned instead toward the American shore. The rasping grew louder,
and the frozen surface bucked and pitched as they ran. A virtual
ice earthquake was underway. By the time they neared shore, a gulf
of 30 feet of frigid water yawned before them.
</P>
<P>
   Thwarted, they turned and raced back toward the opposite bank.
Fifty yards from land, Clara fell, exhausted. Desperate,
28-year-old Eldridge pulled his 24-year-old wife across the ice
toward the narrow current that now loomed between them and shore,
calling for help as he went.
</P>
<P>
   Poised to leap to safety, Burrell Hecock, 17, heard Eldridge's
cries, and ran back to aid Stanton in pulling his wife to the ice's
edge. But by now the floe had nosed out into the current, leaving a
gap too wide to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Two miles below, the Niagara River passes beneath several steel
bridges, far overhead, then plunges into Whirlpool Rapids, full of
huge and deadly waves. As word of the emergency spread, would-be
rescuers searched frantically for rope, wire, block-and-tackle,
anything to lower to the woebegone tourists to save them from the
great thundering maw of the rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Now fate seemed to mock the stranded trio. The huge ice island
drifted steadily closer to shore, only to be thrust back out into
the current by the tailrace of a hydroelectric plant. A
quarter-mile further, the floe split, the empty half slowly
swinging in to beach upon the gravel bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the jagged late with its three human prisoners was in
center current now, and fast approaching the bridges that cross the
gorge near the head of Whirlpool Rapids. A quarter-mile from the
bridge, the floe split again, this time separating Hecock from the
Stantons.
</P>
<P>
   Their ice island carried the Stantons tantalizingly close to
shore, close enough that the would-be rescuers lining the bank
urged Eldridge to jump. Seemingly tempted, he looked down at his
wife, collapsed at his feet. She had succumbed to despair, and
seemed, to those on shore, to have lost the will to try to save
herself. He knelt instead to comfort her.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hecock's floe that came first to the bridges, even as a
crew of Canadian firemen rushed to lower ropes. ``We had no time to
make a slip noose in the rope . . . Every second counted, and we
had barely time to get the rope down to Hecock as he passed beneath
the bridge,'' one member of the company recalled later.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager lunged for a line and caught it. On the bridge 190
feet above, rescue workers heaved at the rope. The boy rose from
the floe, up 10 feet, now 20, 30, steadily higher into the air.
Then his frozen fingers began to slip. He attempted to wrap his leg
in the rope, missed, tried in desperation to clench it with his
teeth. Sixty feet above the roiling current, he lost hold and
tumbled to the churning water below.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ice prison carrying the Stantons approached the same
rope. Working feverishly, Eldridge knotted the line about his wife.
But as the rescue workers above began to pull, the cord, wet and
weakened, broke.
</P>
<P>
   The current swept the pitching iceberg toward the lines hanging
from the next bridge. Eldridge caught a second rope, and, as
rescuers played out slack, looped it around his wife's waist and
tried to fasten it. But the floe was sweeping too rapidly for his
fingers; the rope pulled tight before he could finish the knot.
</P>
<P>
   And so there Eldridge stood with the rope in one hand, and
everything in the balance. Twice he had had an opportunity to leap
to safety. Both times he had stayed with his wife. Now there was no
hope left of saving Clara, but perhaps still a chance to save
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Who can imagine what frantic thoughts, what desperate hopes,
what wild chances race through a person's mind at a moment when a
merciless destiny presents such a choice? Who can help but wonder
what he or she might do?
</P>
<P>
   And who can ever know for sure?
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that love won out.
</P>
<P>
   As scores watched in despair from the narrow bridge and the
frozen riverbanks, Eldridge let loose the rope. Kneeling, he took
his wife in his arms and kissed her. Above, some tearful spectators
thought the couple prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kneeling thus when the first breaker of the rapids
turned their frail ice raft over and they plunged into the icy
current,'' the Buffalo Evening News reported.
</P>
<P>
   In photographs from that day, the stranded couple appear as two
small specks on an ice island carrying them implacably to their
doom. But in love's annals, Eldridge Stanton's last act looms as a
timeless monument to devotion, as magnificent in its own stark
beauty as the natural phenomenon he and his wife had come to see.

MORE CONGRESSMEN, PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use Monday, Feb. 15 and thereafter)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last month settled the issue of whether, for
purposes of apportioning seats in Congress, the Census may rely on
statistical sampling in addition to the traditional head count. (It
may not.) But the court has never addressed the far graver issue of
whether Americans can in any meaningful way be
(itals)represented(unitals) by a body as small as the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   A few numbers:
</P>
<P>
   Between 1950 and 1990, the population of Illinois climbed by 31
percent, from 8.7 million to 11.4 million. Ohio's population grew
from 7.9 million to 10.8 million, a 37 percent increase. And the
number of Massachusetts residents rose 28 percent, from 4.7 million
to 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet over the same period, each of these states (along with 20
others) lost seats in Congress. Illinois sent 25 representatives to
Washington in the 1950s; it sends 20 today. Ohio's House delegation
shrank from 23 to 19. The number of Massachusetts congressmen
dropped from 14 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   For states that gain voters to lose seats in the ``people's
house'' is surely an affront to democracy. But it is unavoidable so
long as the number of representatives remains fixed at 435. When
the House is reapportioned after each decennial Census, only those
states whose populations have grown the most are awarded new seats.
Since reapportionment is a zero-sum game, for every state that
gains a member, another state must lose one.
</P>
<P>
   But what is sacrosanct about the number 435? It is not required
by the Constitution. On the contrary: The Framers envisioned a
House of Representatives that would keep growing as the nation
grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take for granted,'' James Madison wrote in The Federalist,
``that the number of representatives will be augmented from time to
time.'' The Constitution specified that the first House of
Representives comprise 65 members, one for every 30,000 Americans.
To Anti-Federalist complaints that 65 was too low a number to make
the House truly representative, Madison replied: ``The foresight of
the (Constitutional) Convention has . . . taken care that the
progress of population may be accompanied with a proper increase of
the representative branch of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   And to drive the point home, he noted that one reason for
conducting a Census every 10 years was to ``to augment the the
number of representatives at the same periods.''
</P>
<P>
   For 130 years, the system worked as the Framers intended. After
every Census, Congress routinely enlarged the House. From 65 seats
in 1789, the House swelled to 105 after the 1790 Census, 141 after
the 1800 Census, 181 after the 1810 Census, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time the House grew was after the 1910 census,
which counted 92 million people. The number of representatives was
raised to 435 _ and there it has stood ever since. When the 1920
Census confirmed that a tidal wave of immigrants was surging into
the nation's cities, anti-immigrant and rural forces in Congress
balked at creating new districts to accommodate them. This didn't
mean that the newcomers went unrepresented. It simply meant that
existing congressional districts grew more crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how we got to where we are today, when the average
district contains 600,000 persons. It is an iron law of politics
that the more constituents an elected official is answerable to,
the less he is answerable to anybody. When the House of
Representatives first convened, every 30,000 Americans had their
own voice in Congress. Today they share that voice with 570,000
others. What was meant to be the government's most democratic body
has lost 95 percent of its representativeness.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred thousand residents per district is an absurdly high
number by world standards. No industrialized nation in the world
elects members to its lower parliamentary chamber from districts so
congested. Many countries with much smaller populations than ours
have bigger legislatures. The Russian Duma has 450 members; the
lower house of the Japanese Diet, 500; the French Assemblee, 577;
the German Bundestag, 656. Great Britain's population is less than
one-fourth that of the United States, but its House of Commons,
with 659 members, is half again as large as the US House.
</P>
<P>
   Voters hold Congress in disdain because they sense that its
members are out of touch, more concerned with their political
careers than with the wishes of their constituents. A return to the
principle that growth in population requires growth in
representation would change that. Enlarge the House to 1,200, and
the ratio of members to residents would be about 1:215,000, roughly
where it was in 1910. Still far from the Framers' ideal of 1:30,000
_ but a long way toward making Congress more representative.
</P>
<P>
   And the benefits! Districts would be smaller and more compact,
more closely aligned with discrete communities and neighborhoods.
Because campaigns would cost less, PACs and lobbyists would recede
in importance. Because it would take fewer votes to win an
election, the House would be likelier to reflect America's social
diversity. Elections would be more competitive. Voters would pay
more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, representatives would be closer _ and more
accountable _ to those who elect them. We have drifted pretty far
from the core value of the American experience, that government
should answer to the people. A bigger House can help take us back.

SHOULD I DO PENANCE ABOUT CARNAHAN COMMENTS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The church-state debate continues. First, another letter from
the very same reader who blasted me in a recent column for my
criticism of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's decision to commute a
convicted killer's death sentence at the urging of Pope John Paul
II:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Bill,
</P>
<P>
   ``It's me again. I am flattered that you thought my letter was
one of the most interesting responses you received. I am taking it
as a compliment, although I am not sure it was intended as such.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your column you state: `What we don't expect public
officials to do is impose any particular religious beliefs or the
rules of any church on a citizenry that may not subscribe to those
specific beliefs or rules.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan did? I truly don't
think so. Opposition to the death penalty is not a uniquely
Catholic belief or rule. It has been espoused by many groups, some
religious, some not. Some, as your column corroborates, have no
apparent interest in the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Carnahan simply did what your column says he is entitled
and expected to do: `... we should certainly expect our leaders to
bring their values to bear in making decisions that affect the
public.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Gov. Carnahan respects the Pope and was moved
deeply by his personal plea. In short, he brought his values to
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader _ a self-described ``devout Roman Catholic'' _
had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution of the U.S. is an important document that was
written by our forefathers who I believe were God-fearing men.
Nowadays, we seem to be not as God-fearing, but more alert to what
is popular in society, to gain more votes or to be politically
correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pope and Billy Graham and other religious leaders uphold
and preach the truth _ God's truth _ and most of us choose not to
listen. Why? Because it is inconvenient, it is not modern thinking,
and we are too arrogant, and we think that we don't need God and
his wisdom to guide us.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, if the Governor of Missouri listens to a wise,
spiritual leader who is saying the truth about the dignity of human
life and mercy towards others, it is a simple and true message from
God that is expressed by a spiritual leader, in this case the Pope.
Wisdom comes from God.''
</P>
<P>
   And one more:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bill Thompson's (column) faulted Roman Catholics for
practicing Christianity and recognizing the Pope as the earthly
head of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Mr. Thompson will deny he faults Roman Catholics for
exercising their Christian faith. I'm equally sure Mr. Thompson
would find praise for Christians in the Southern Baptist
(Convention) exercising their Christian faith at work, in school
and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised Southern Baptist, and that's what we were taught.
We were taught exactly the same thing that Mr. Thompson faults the
Christian parent in the Roman Catholic church for teaching their
child. And, I take issue with Mr. Thompson favoring one member
(Southern Baptist) of the body of Christ over another (Roman
Catholic). ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm Roman Catholic, now. Unlike Mr. Thompson, I refuse to
write about religious issues from religious anonymity. In closing,
I think the Bible Belt is long past due to stop its Catholic
bashing. Instead, we all should turn to walking the talk in
Christian teamwork.''
</P>
<P>
   This last letter cries out for a response, seeing as how the
reader accused me of favoring Baptists over Catholics and operating
under the cover of ``religious anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I've lost count of the times that I have referred
to my Catholic upbringing and to the 12 highly beneficial years
that I spent attending Catholic schools. I mentioned this as
recently as Jan. 31, in fact, in the column about Carnahan and the
pope that provoked so many sermonettes from disgruntled readers.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan is a Baptist, by the way, and I'm still trying to
figure out why he decided to capitulate to the pope on a matter
that was best left to the judgment of the criminal justice system.

TRUE LEADERSHIP EMERGED AMID IMPEACHMENT FERVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use Monday, Feb. 15 and thereafter)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time around, in 1868, they were impeachment's hard-core
hotheads _ nearly a third of all the yes votes in the Senate _ and
classic examples of what happens when zeal and passion fail to
transcend party.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they were almost to a person impeachment's adults _
not by any means of one mind and not always clear or consistent,
but they were pivotal contributors at key points along the way and
in the end fully a fifth of all the no votes on the crucial tally,
including all but four of the five Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The last time around, New England's senators were the day's
Radical Republicans, driven by the passionate belief that their
opposition to a border state Democratic president's policies after
the Civil War was so righteous that it justified tossing Andrew
Johnson of Tennessee from office.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the Radical Republicans were almost all
elsewhere. A more mixed New England delegation, far from monolithic
in ideology and party status, ended up leading the Senate haltingly
to its thumbs-down vote on impeachment under circumstances that
were especially credible precisely because they could easily have
played out differently.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1868, two of the region's 12 Republican senators joined
five others to compose the minority that saved Johnson by a single
vote, on the grounds that the trumped-up charges and the capital
punishment remedy posed far more dangers to constitutional
government than Johnson's permissive policies toward the destroyed
South. James Dixon of Connecticut and William Pitt Fessenden of
Maine paid for their guts with their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week four Republicans and six Democrats were the base for
the Senate's anticonviction vote in a case that produced less of
the passion than Johnson's impeachment, in part because it was so
weak, in part because the Republicans were simply less numerous _ a
classic illustration of Alexander Hamilton's warning that
impeachment fervor confined to a faction is inherently defective.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, again, was the exception. The radicals of 1868 _
Aaron Cragin and James Patterson _ were aped by the radicals of
1999 _ Bob Smith and Judd Gregg; none of the four played a serious,
distinctive leadership role in the proceedings. The only
interesting difference is that Gregg and Smith also called for
President Clinton's resignation last fall, an example of
constitutional prejudgment matched only by three other senators.
</P>
<P>
   More typical this time were the genuine leaders:
</P>
<P>
   --Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, way back on Sept. 3,
probably saved the president from himself. By calling Clinton to
account for his behavior, calling it immoral, and pronouncing
inadequate Clinton's angry, self-centered speech after his
quasi-confession of long-denied sexual misconduct, Lieberman woke
his old friend up to reality and made him worthy of a factual,
legal, and constitutional defense.
</P>
<P>
   --Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts was the epitome of an
underappreciated virtue: the morality of loyalty. But as the trial
began, it was his statesmanship that helped forge the 100-0 vote
for a circumscribed procedure that gave the rabid House managers a
chance to make a preliminary case, which they then muffed. And he
was chosen to begin the Democrats' summary speeches in closed
session last week, raising the stakes by stressing the enormity of
conviction's consequences.
</P>
<P>
   --After the president's grand jury testimony was hastily dumped
into the public domain, it was John Kerry of Massachusetts who made
the first concrete suggestion of a way out of partisan impeachment.
Kerry's deft recommendation of an appearance by Clinton before the
House Judiciary Committee, to be followed by a censure, could have
produced consensus, and its crude rejection by Newt Gingrich and
Henry Hyde was the first sign that what was to come would not merit
public acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   --In the end, Republicans James Jeffords of Vermont, John Chafee
of Rhode Island, and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine gave
the final verdict its clout. Jeffords preached the dangers of
stooping to conviction on ``low crimes,'' forever dumbing down the
standard; the others, individually, stressed the evidence in the
case in depth, affirming the higher standards worthy of the
Constitution's authors. In the process, all four illustrated
independent thinking at its finest.
</P>
<P>
   For those who appreciate history's ironies, it doesn't get much
better than this. The region that shamed itself 130 years ago
distinguished itself this time in a squalid case that, like
Johnson's, should never have been brought in the first place.

`TELETUBBIES': BRITISH IMPERIALISM REDUX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Feb. 15)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Yes, ``Barney'' is a bore for anyone over 6 years
old. And ``The Big Comfy Couch'' features clowns that are frankly a
lot scarier than any you remember as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer adult terror, nothing _ I mean nothing _ compares
to the Fab Four Fuzzballs from the United Kingdom known as the
``Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   And, no, it has nothing to with the idiotic charge that one of
them is gay.
</P>
<P>
   My toddler has a simple internal clock: daylight means morning,
and morning means you wake up, regardless of the hour. Attempting
to steal 25 minutes or so of one-eyed sleep before breakfast, I
often curl up on the couch as she gets a morning dose of
``Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dose'' is the right word when it comes to ``Teletubbies.'' I
have watched her stare silent, frozen and unblinking at the
television the first, and second, and every time since she has seen
the show, transfixed at the babblings and repetition of four
``technological babies'' from ``Teletubbyland.''
</P>
<P>
   At least she sings through ``Barney'': I mean, in the
Teletubbyzone she doesn't move for a half-hour. Call it
narco-sitting.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``South Park'' episode that nailed it, showing a
group at the Betty Ford clinic getting a substitute fix and easing
withdrawal symptoms by watching the show. We are talking virtual
Quaaludes here.
</P>
<P>
   Some background: In March 1997, ``Teletubbies'' debuted in
Britain, and last year the British Broadcasting Corp. show was
picked up in America by PBS. The program features the characters
Tinky Winky (the big one; carries a bag and falls on his back);
Dipsy (second largest; funny walk, wears a hat, says ``Hello''
every five or so seconds); Laa-Laa (incessantly repeats ``nice'';
plays with a ball), and Po (the little one; rides a scooter). They
all like to say ``Bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot. Over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Baby-sitting them is a _ why not? _ vacuum cleaner named Noo-Noo
and disembodied human voices coming from pipes in the ground. The
basic premise of the teleplay is the four live in a land where
technology caters to their every need, down to the televisions in
their tummies (hence, ``Teletubbies'') that show real children at
school and play.
</P>
<P>
   The same real kid clips are shown twice in a row, at a pace a
hair above ``Pause,'' with the idea that toddlers can absorb both
language skills and content lessons at a maddeningly deliberate
pace. Another overarching goal is to introduce little ones to
technology in the most non-threatening manner imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   PBS said extensive research and focus groups went into the
program's conceptualization in order to maximize its educational
value. Does it have value? I think so, in the broadest sense for
the youngest of viewers in terms of developing language skills.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, I can gather my kid's things in the morning, finish
getting dressed, go outside to warm up the car and not worry she is
going to wander off into mischief. In moderation, it appears
relatively benign.
</P>
<P>
   I still think this surrealistic show was sketched out on a
napkin in an Amsterdam hash bar. Already, there is a backlash in
full force. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, in the February issue of his
National Liberty Journal, is charging that Tinky Winky is subtly
but definitely a gay character (and some used to say ``G.I. Joe''
was a gay icon). First there is that name, and he does carry a
purse (actually, it's a ``magic bag''). And, gasp, he's purple!
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tinky Winky is not exactly, well, Schwarzeneggar. But he is
also supposed to be playing a toddler. C'mon, Jerry: The gay lobby
is going after that crucial demographics of newborn to 2 years old
to sway the debate? This is a pretty crass attempt to get ink,
Rev., nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   And it takes away attention from the real threat. For more on
that, go on the Internet and scan some of the anti-Teletubbies
pages that have mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they pick on this show, you ask? Because these
conspiracists believe passionately, if not sarcastically, that
``Teletubbies'' is actually a mind-control vehicle being used by
aliens to take over the world, one toddler at a time.

   Mulder, Scully, forget Virginia: Ground Zero of the alien
invasion is Britain ... and our family rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies'' is everywhere, making ``Seinfeld'' reruns seem
comet-scarce. The marketing blitz is everywhere, from tapes to
pajamas to shoes. Yes, my daughter has a Po doll. First the show,
then the merchandising, then, before we know what hit us, we'll all
be eating Tubby Toast and Tubby Custard and adjusting the vertical
hold on the 19-inch screens in our guts. These alien imperialists
have no scruples.
</P>
<P>
   The horror of it all is enough to keep a parent awake all
morning.

PC MAINTENANCE BEST DONE MANUALLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least once a day, I get an e-mail that reads something like
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi. I've been going crazy trying to install and run (insert a
game, educational, productivity or utility software title here),
but every time I try, it (insert: locks up, crashes, reboots).
Help!''
</P>
<P>
   There is a series of questions I always ask at this point, if
the information was not included in the e-mail. ``Have you upgraded
your video or sound card drivers to the latest versions? Have you
applied all the available upgrade patches to your operating
system?''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, I've started asking a new question: ``Do
you have a program on your system that runs in the background _
specifically, a virus scanner, a crash catcher or an installation
monitor?''
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is yes, I recommend disabling it. And most of the
time, that fixes the problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KEEP IT SIMPLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you rely on the Windows 95/98 operating system _ with the
instabilities inherent from Microsoft's bending over backward to
make it compatible with older versions of Windows and MS-DOS _ then
you are better off running a system that is free of complications.
As with many things in life, simple is better.
</P>
<P>
   The programs that are causing grief sit in the background of a
computer's operation, watching for specific events, such as
virus-like activity, the start-up of an installation program or the
beginnings of a crash. When triggered, these programs swing into
action.
</P>
<P>
   In general, their intentions are good. Viruses are nasty things
_ no one wants them frolicking on a personal computer. Ditto for
program or system crashes. And with an installation monitor, a
uninstall program has a better road map for what to do when it
comes time to remove a given piece of software.
</P>
<P>
   But using these things comes at a price, and it's a price that I
am not sure is worth it _ system stability.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that while many of these programs are convenient,
they can cause more problems than they solve. And there are
alternatives to using them, though those alternatives require that
a user be vigilant and actively maintain his or her computer.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dilemma, because most PC users are lazy. They'd rather
have software perform a tedious task for them, than remember to do
it regularly themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you manually scanned your entire hard
drive for viruses, or scanned a software disk before you installed
a new program? When was the last time you made a full backup of
your hard drive's contents?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A TALK WITH SYMANTEC'S CEO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I recently discussed this point of view with Gordon Eubanks, the
chief executive of Symantec Corp., a software company that thrives
by selling PC utility software. Many of its titles rely heavily on
modules that run in the background of a Windows 95, 98 or NT PC.
Among the best-known are the Norton Utilities, Norton AntiVirus and
CleanSweep Deluxe, which it just acquired in its purchase of
Quarterdeck.
</P>
<P>
   When I told Eubanks I was thinking about writing a column urging
readers not to use programs that run in the background, the color
drained from the poor man's face and he put his hand on his chest.
I thought he was going to have a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He brought up the point I mentioned earlier _ that PC users are
unwilling to do their own maintenance. And he added that, in an era
in which PCs are connected via the global Internet, programs such
as in-the-background virus checkers become even more crucial.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested I try using his company's full suite of utility
products, Norton System Works, in an integrated fashion. Eubanks
argued that many of the problems that I've described come when
users try to mix-and-match software _ a virus scanner from one
company, a crash-catcher from another.
</P>
<P>
   (Indeed, I've heard from many users who think they're extra safe
by running two or three different virus scanners in the background.
This is similar to the belief that, if two aspirin tablets will
knock out a headache in an hour, 20 will do it in five minutes. It
doesn't work that way.)
</P>
<P>
   I agreed to his challenge, and tried Norton System Works for
about a month. Then, I ran without it for the same period. I used
all of the in-the-background features, and experimented with
running them in different combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Gordon, but the results were not pretty. Although the
programs are well designed and quite useful when run manually, the
components that run in the background were, in my opinion, more
trouble than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   Using Norton System Doctor noticeably slowed my 200-megahertz
Pentium MMX Dell system, with 64 megabytes of memory. This
seriously depressed me, because I really like Norton System Doctor
_ I am a sucker for all the information it offers about a system's
status. But all those gauges and meters exact a performance price.
</P>
<P>
   With CrashGuard 4.0 and Norton AntiVirus 5.0 also running, my
computer felt more like a 133-megahertz system.
</P>
<P>
   With CrashGuard, which is a well-designed program that halts
application crashes long enough for you to save your work, I found
I had more crashes, particularly in Netscape Communicator 4.5. When
I disabled CrashGuard, Communicator crashed less.
</P>
<P>
   However, CrashGuard saved my butt on a couple of occasions,
allowing me to recover crucial documents in an unruly word
processor. CrashGuard also caught a ``blue screen of death'' crash
_ an impressive feature in the newest version _ and allowed me to
save my work.
</P>
<P>
   Norton AntiVirus gave me the most conflicts with other
applications. In some cases, programs refused to install unless I
disabled it. In a couple of cases, I would click on a program and
it would not launch unless the virus scanner was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   But during the month I ran ``clean,'' my system was zippier and
more stable.
</P>
<P>
   My conclusion: I'll continue to advise readers to not use
background-based software if they have recurring problems. I'll
also strongly suggest they set up a regular maintenance routine for
their PC, and recommend using programs such as the non-background
components of Norton System Works to handle those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But each user must weigh what is more important _ the security
provided by background-based programs, or the system hassles that
come with them.

WHO WILL IT BE FOR GORE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the metaphor for Al Gore's presidential campaign? Is it
the Mondale campaign of 1984? Is it a Democratic version of George
Bush's campaign in 1988? Or is it a replay of Hubert Humphrey's
doomed effort in 1968? The lens through which Gore's campaign is
perceived will determine to some degree how it is understood.
</P>
<P>
   The early metaphor for the Gore campaign is Mondale. Both are
Democrats and Mondale aligns with many people's idea of Gore
(liberal but safe, safe but stolid). Like Mondale, Gore has raised
the most money, garnered the most endorsements and has the backing
of the most important interest groups. He leads in the polls and
many commentators insist his nomination is ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore advisers use Mondale as their metaphor, although they
burnish it a bit by describing Gore's campaign as ``Mondale-plus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Mondale without the base,'' is the way one Gore advisor
put it recently, meaning that Gore commands the Democratic stage
but carries none of Mondale's baggage (too liberal, too labor).
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Democratic primary opponents, Bill Bradley and John Kerry
(if he runs), employ the Mondale metaphor, imagining themselves in
the role of Gary Hart, the challenger who emerged. When you trail
in every poll in every state in every region of the country, you
need a hopeful metaphor to sustain the troops. The Hart metaphor
(minus the womanizing) works for them.
</P>
<P>
   The working press is also likely to lock onto the Mondale
metaphor, since it holds out the promise of a spirited contest.
Political reporters are irrelevant if presidential primary politics
is simply a matter of fund-raising, photo ops and tracking polls.
To justify their existence, reporters must insist that ``anything
can happen.'' The Mondale metaphor allows them to assert that
anything might happen and probably will.
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore campaign had any sense, they would lose the Mondale
metaphor immediately (he did, after all, lose every state but
Minnesota) and instead press forward with the Bush metaphor. The
Bush metaphor works for Gore because it communicates two central
themes of a Gore general election campaign: successful economic
management and political comity.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush metaphor also works for Gore because it allows for some
certain margin for error. Bush (who is my uncle) ran in the shadow
of a scandal (Iran-contra), which ultimately had little impact on
his campaign. He hit some bumps in the road, losing to Dole and
Robertson in Iowa. He trailed in early general election ``trial
heat'' polls. Yet he emerged triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   He did so because he argued successfully that you shouldn't
change horses in the middle of a good economic stream and you
certainly shouldn't go with a horse from outside the mainstream.
Throw in some technological mumbo-jumbo to appeal to New Economy
types and there, in a nutshell, are the makings of a successful
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Humphrey metaphor is likely to be employed by Republicans
and disaffected liberal Democrats, frustrated by the Clinton
administration's tactical successes. The metaphor seems like a
stretch (Vietnam and The Great Society are not even remotely
comparable to cruise missile launches and school uniforms), but
there are parallels that should give Gore pause.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is likely that someone will have to pick up the tab
for what might charitably be called the Clinton debacle. For the
moment, Republicans are paying the price for pressing the case. In
the near future, after the Republican ``threat'' has receded, the
Clinton administration scandals may come to be seen differently.
There are reports all over Washington that Clinton is planning to
fire Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. More shoes are expected to
drop in the various Clinton investigations. The stench of scandal
is unlikely to subside any time soon. Some analysts believe that it
may be Gore who will ultimately end up eating the cost of all this.
</P>
<P>
   Second, President Clinton is determined to win ``vindication''
in the year 2000 elections. Thursday, his minions planted a story
in The New York Times informing us all that he would personally
direct the Democratic campaign to recapture control of the House of
Representatives to get his revenge on House Republicans. Clinton is
certain to cast himself for a starring role in the year 2000
presidential campaign, desperately seeking ``exoneration.'' The
danger for Gore is that unlike Reagan in 1988, Clinton will not
step back from public view but rather continue to hog the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   If the year 2000 presidential campaign is about Clinton, and not
about us, Gore will be unable to campaign on his own terms. And by
then, in the wake of yet more scandal and yet more awful behavior
revealed, it may appear that Gore can't get out from under Clinton,
just as Humphrey never got out from under Johnson. This is the
metaphor Gore cannot afford. It is the one Republicans will press,
along with the promise of a new day.

DON'T DISCOUNT LUCK AS A WAY OUT OF A JAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sometimes, even the most experienced computer users
get themselves into a seemingly inescapable jam. Something happens
that's near-catastrophic, and all the tricks you know don't seem to
work. If you're lucky, this happens on your own computer. If you're
not, it happens on a friend's machine, one you were trying to, um,
``fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I was definitely unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   One of my co-workers received a Toshiba Satellite 105CS notebook
computer from her father. This is an older model with a
75-megahertz Pentium chip and just eight megabytes of memory. She
wanted me to clear some space off the hard drive and fix an error
message related to a missing file that appeared on bootup.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling my tech-support oats, I jumped at the chance _ and into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The file in question was related to software her father had
briefly installed. It also seemed to relate to the machine's
network setup and possibly to a Novell Netware client. Since all
she wanted to use it for was dialup Internet access, I figured we
could easily lose many of the networking components.
</P>
<P>
   I removed those pieces, leaving just what she'd need to get to
the Net, and rebooted. But when the notebook restarted, I got an
illegal instruction error trying to load a file called V86MMGR.VXD.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I didn't panic. There would be plenty of time for that
later. I restarted the computer in safe mode _ Windows 95's
diagnostic mode _ and went to restore what I'd removed.
</P>
<P>
   But no. The program asked for the Windows 95 installation disks.
I had it on CD-ROM, but this older notebook didn't have a CD-ROM
drive. And I didn't have Windows 95's installation on floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed great embarrassment to my colleague, who said,
``Don't worry. I trust you.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried pulling the file off another Windows 95 machine and
copying it onto the drive _ no luck. I even found a set of Windows
95 floppies, but found they would not work with the version on my
colleague's machine.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I played a hunch. I remembered that, in some cases,
removing Windows components doesn't actually remove them at all,
but rather strips references to them from the registry. The files
remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   I again tried reinstalling what I'd removed. This time, when the
Windows 95 dialog box asked for an installation disk, I directed it
to the folder where the files were supposed to be stored, in
windowssystem.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. The networking components reloaded, just as though I'd
inserted the correct disk. The computer rebooted, and all was well.
My colleague now thinks I'm a nice guy, instead of a bum.
</P>
<P>
   And her original problem, the machine's complaint that a file
was missing, was also fixed. How, I don't know, but I was not going
to ask any questions.
</P>
<P>
   The moral to the story is this: Keep in mind that Windows
doesn't always delete components you've removed. If you're without
install disks and need to restore something _ or fix a boneheaded
mistake _ the answer may be right on your own hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   A corollary: Make sure you have the Windows 95/98 install disk
or disks that came with your system. Don't count on being able to
borrow them from a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Second corollary: Think twice before offering to ``fix'' a
friend's compter.

 &HT;    Impeachment: There were no winners
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, I've been trying to make sense of the
national disaster that has come in the form of President Clinton's
impeachment and wondering how it would come out.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, while watching the House managers fight
to discredit the very witnesses they tried so hard to get before
the Senate, I heard the voice of Ace Ventura declare, ``losers.''
</P>
<P>
   That made me wonder who the winners would be and no one came to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody loses on this one. The Senate vote makes no
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, the Republicans, the congressmen, the senators,
the White House, the president, especially the president. And our
country.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans acknowledge that Clinton is a liar. That makes
him a big loser. But those who don't worry much about their place
in history know he lost really big in the ``what makes a man a
man'' department. The young woman who was supposed to idolize him
all her life, his daughter, now knows he is a lying lech.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional clones _ managers, as they are called _
they're losers too. They came off as hysterical Henny Pennys,
pouting and pointing fingers when they didn't get their way.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, as a whole, lost because it very ceremoniously was
handed the fiasco and expected to clean it up. I must note,
however, that the voices of calm and reason, those working hardest
to find a solution in that chamber, were mostly female and they
were from both sides of the aisle. The women senators from Texas,
Maine, Washington and California and others were ever present
during open discussions and at press conferences far more dignified
than the spectacles that took place when the House was playing the
impeachment game. These women also have been on the news talk
shows, not always agreeing, but always ready to listen and then
eloquently expressing their views. The guys in dark suits, who for
too long were the only members of the Senate club, seemed to look
comforted in the women's presence.
</P>
<P>
   And Monica Lewinsky. Loser.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, loser.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr, loser.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the pitiful ones, folks, that's us. As Ace would say,
``Luh-ooo-za-hers.''
</P>
<P>
   The people we put in office have wasted their time and they've
wasted ours. They have frittered away millions, our money.
</P>
<P>
   They have demeaned our society by keeping the tawdry, sordid
details of the president's peccadilloes out in front of the whole
world _ outlined in neon lights.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to turn out the lights. It's over.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody won.

   _ Hand made: On Jan. 24, surgeons in Louisville, Ky.,
transplanted a human hand onto the left arm of Mark Scott, who'd
lost his hand in a firecracker accident 13 years ago. While more
and more medical procedures are showing up live on the Web _ from
breast implants to open heart surgery _ this one was not dispatched
to the Net. But since the announcement, a Web site has been set up
at www.handtransplant.org. You can follow Scott's progress _ he
recently moved the fingers on his new hand _ and even see images
from the operation. There's only one particularly graphic shot, of
doctors as they actually prepare to attach the hand _ taken from a
cadaver _ to Scott's arm. Jewish Hospital and the University of
Louisville periodically post patient condition updates. You can
also view playbacks of news conferences using Microsoft's Netshow

   _ Unsupportive: Anyone who's called technical support for
computer help has heard that tone in the guru's voice. You know,
that point at which the expert realizes that you, the seeker of
truth, don't know much about computers. There's the pause, then
words dripping in disdain. If you've ever suspected that tech
support personnel have outright contempt for most users, then pay a
visit to SPAM! at www.spamm.net. This purports to be a collection
of technical support horror stories, but what it really amounts to
is a not-so-pretty glimpse into the way computer technicians view
their customers. To balance things out, they often seem to have
contempt for each other _ some of the stories focus on techies
dealing with other techies. At least, after reading the stories on
this site, you'll know they are consistent in their scorn. Some of
the stories, though, are pretty funny, such as the America Online
subscriber who was having problems getting the Internet _ so she
looked up ``Internet Service Provider'' in the phone book and
called one. When told she'd have to call AOL, she fumed: ``But
you're an Internet Service Provider! It says so right here in the
phone book! If you don't want to help me, fine. Thank you, have a
good day.''

   _ Dino-land: When James Gurney was a child, according to his
bio, dinosaurs weren't as cool among kids as they are today. But
Gurney himself is one of the reasons why they are hot now. His
``Dinotopia'' books _ about a land in which dinosaurs coexist
peacefully with man _ are incredibly popular with both children and
adults. A new edition in the series, ``Dinotopia: First Flight,''
is due to be released this year. A Web site devoted to Gurney's
work is available at www.dinotopia.com. Although it deals with his
books, puzzles and other ``Dinotopia'' offshoots, the site goes out
of its way to avoid being strictly commercial. In fact, you can't
buy anything at the site, though there are some links to places
where you can. Instead, you read about the universe Gurney has
created, how ``Dinotopia'' came to be, and see some of the
spectacular artwork found in the ``Dinotopia'' stories. But the
best parts of the site are its puzzles and games. You can download
a maze, a dinosaur drawing page, a matching game and more. There
also is a trivia area for those who fancy themselves ``Dinotopia''
experts.

   _ Martian chronicles: The public relations push is on to
convince Americans that it's time to begin planning missions to
Mars. Already we've sent several unmanned craft, with more on the
way, but the ultimate goal is to have humans walking on its red
surface. The Mars Millennium Project at www.mars2030.net is an
extension of this push, bringing together artists and scientists to
help people _ and particularly students _ envision what life on the
Red Planet might be like. It's a joint venture by NASA, the
National Endowment for the Arts, the J. Paul Getty Trust and the
White House Millennium Council.

   LONDON _ The box-office hit ``Shakespeare in Love'' Tuesday
guaranteed its place in film history when it garnered 13 Oscar
nominations, the highest number for a domestic movie.
</P>
<P>
   With the third-highest number of nominations in the Academy
Awards' 71-year history, it overshadows ``The English Patient,''
which two years ago received 12 nominations, and is only one short
of the record _ held jointly by ``All About Eve'' from 1950 and
last year's blockbuster, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Elizabeth'' bagging a further seven nominations,
Britain's film industry is hoping for one of its most successful
years at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ceremony
on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   But the hoped-for triumph highlights once again the vexed
question of what, exactly, is a British film?
</P>
<P>
   All $25 million of the ``Shakespeare In Love'' budget came from
an American company, Miramax, the former independent company now
owned by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``British'' hit, ``Little Voice,'' with Brenda Blethyn
nominated for best supporting actress, was also financed by
Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   So in terms of money, both films could be classed as American.
For the Department of Culture this is an issue best avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather not talk about what is, or what is not, a
British film,'' said a spokesman Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the department's actions speak more patriotically than
its words. It issues a quaintly titled ``Certificate of British
Nature Of A Film'' to films that the Government considers British
under the Films Act 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare In Love'' has a certificate, as do other British
Oscar nominees, such as ``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   David Parfitt, the British producer of ``Shakespeare In Love,''
said: ``We are most definitely a British film. To get the
certificate we had to meet certain criteria as regards use of
labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the entire crew was British, from the carpenter to
the director, and so were all of the cast, bar three _ Gwyneth
Paltrow, Ben Afleck and Geoffrey Rush. All of the locations were in
the U.K., and of the $25 million, $20 million was spent in the
U.K.''
</P>
<P>
   Parfitt said many ``British'' films were financed from the U.S.
Of his own films, ``The Wings of the Dove'' (1997) was 100 percent
financed by Miramax, and ``The Madness of King George'' and ``Much
Ado About Nothing'' had the majority of their financing from the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not where the profits go,'' he said, ``it's the labor and
talent you use, and the locations. Concentrating on the finance can
be very misleading. When people say a film is British and financed
in the U.K., you will still get sales agents madly selling off the
rights to foreign distributors.'' &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan knew the game of kings had
ended the moment his brother landed at Amman's Queen Alia airport
last month.
</P>
<P>
   There was a formal embrace from the man who had supposedly won
his battle with cancer. But King Hussein ignored Hassan's son
Rashid and then showed what he thought of his Crown Prince by
choosing to travel into the city not with Hassan _ his normal
routine _ but alongside Queen Noor. Hassan was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had waited 34 years to be king of Jordan was
stunned. For weeks, he had heard rumors that his days as crown
prince were numbered; a Lebanese newspaper suggested that King
Hussein believed his younger brother was plotting a coup.
</P>
<P>
   But the king had reassured Hassan only days earlier that he
intended to make him regent. Hassan's desperate, melodramatic
attempt to prove his good faith is already the talk of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   He presented himself before the king and _ according to
impeccable sources _ asked Hussein bluntly: ``How have I offended
you? Here is my gun. If I have been disloyal to you, please shoot
me _ but do not disgrace me.''
</P>
<P>
   The king ordered Hassan to take his gun back and reassured him
yet again.
</P>
<P>
   When a similar account appeared in the small Jordanian newspaper
``Al-Majed,'' its editor was accused of ``insulting the monarch.''
Jordan's authorities are sensitive to the slightest criticism of
the royal family, but in the days that have followed the king's
death it has been possible to put together an account of Crown
Prince Hassan's fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sequel to his astonishing gesture with the gun was
if anything even more striking.
</P>
<P>
   The king called Hassan to the royal palace at half past midnight
on Jan. 20 to present him with his letter of dismissal. A
photographer was waiting to snap Hassan handing over his insignia
to the new crown prince _ now King _ Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan returned to his car without time to read the document;
driving away, he turned on the radio only to hear the contents of
the unopened letter on the national news.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians feel that the manner of his dismissal was
unnecessarily cruel.
</P>
<P>
   As Crown Prince, Hassan had been ordered by the king to handle
Jordan's development projects _ a role that inevitably brought him
into conflict with the government of prime minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti who is said to dislike Hassan personally.
</P>
<P>
   Premiers believed that Hassan trespassed on their prerogatives _
something he had no right to do since the right of succession is
the crown prince's only constitutional power.
</P>
<P>
   Even before King Hussein's brave, hopeless insistence on his
recovery on Jan. 19, the royal court had been awash with stories
that the monarch was turning against his brother.
</P>
<P>
   First, the name of Abdullah would be mooted, then that of
Hamzeh, his son by Queen Noor (a post he was awarded when Abdullah
became king).
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's concerns only increased when he realized the extent to
which his communications were being monitored; for years, he talked
half-jokingly to visitors about the taps on his phone.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, King Hussein was told that
Hassan had tried to fire the chief of staff of the army, that
Hassan's Pakistani-born wife Princess Sarvath had gone so far as to
change the carpets in the royal palace in anticipation of becoming
queen.
</P>
<P>
   The truth appears to be more prosaic.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than (pounds sterling)3 million, King Hussein
had built a house for Field Marshal Abdul-Hafez Mureii-Kaabneh, a
very ugly but otherwise magnificent pile on top of a hill outside
Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor had it that Walid bin Talal, a Saudi millionaire, wanted
to purchase the property for (pounds sterling)10 million but Crown
prince Hassan, after consultations with the king, told the Saudi
that the property belonged to the field marshal.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's response _ which appears to have been in accordance
with the king's wishes _ nevertheless provoked the story that he
wanted to remove the field marshal. And the king was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the tale of the carpets. Hassan's home is a charming
building once owned by the former British ambassador, Sir Alec
Kirkbride, but last year the Crown Prince decided that after years
of neglect, the house should be refurbished, along with adjoining
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Sarvath, so it is said, wanted to change the decoration in both
house and office. And a new story, as unfair as it appears to be
untrue, went the rounds: that the princess was ``changing the royal
palace'' even before the sick king had died.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could make dangerous mistakes. Against the advice of
friends, he commiserated before parliament with the suffering of
Iraqi civilians under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government reacted angrily because it believed Hassan
had not given sufficient support to the regime while the king
reportedly complained that the crown prince had not been tough
enough on the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Sarvath was also widely believed to want to name her
son Rashid as crown prince when Hassan became king _ an idea that
would inevitably anger Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Those around the princess advised her to forget the notion but
it seems that Hassan, too, continued to toy with the idea of naming
his own son crown prince once he gained the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days of his own regency, Abdullah showed
considerable generosity to his deposed uncle. He greeted him warmly
and _ when Hassan offered to hand over control of the six academic
institutions he ran, the new king insisted that Hassan should
continue to administer the projects.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation in which the monarchy is the one unifying bond, it
is as well that the two men appear to get on well. More royal
shenanigans, and Jordanians will be wondering what kind of royal
family they have inherited. &QL;

the royal family, but in the days that have followed the king's
death it has been possible to put together an account of Crown
Prince Hassan's fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sequel to his astonishing gesture with the gun was
if anything even more striking.
</P>
<P>
   The king called Hassan to the royal palace at half past midnight
on Jan. 20 to present him with his letter of dismissal. A
photographer was waiting to snap Hassan handing over his insignia
to the new crown prince _ now King _ Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan returned to his car without time to read the document;
driving away, he turned on the radio only to hear the contents of
the unopened letter on the national news.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians feel that the manner of his dismissal was
unnecessarily cruel.
</P>
<P>
   As Crown Prince, Hassan had been ordered by the king to handle
Jordan's development projects _ a role that inevitably brought him
into conflict with the government of prime minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti who is said to dislike Hassan personally.
</P>
<P>
   Premiers believed that Hassan trespassed on their prerogatives _
something he had no right to do since the right of succession is
the crown prince's only constitutional power.
</P>
<P>
   Even before King Hussein's brave, hopeless insistence on his
recovery on Jan. 19, the royal court had been awash with stories
that the monarch was turning against his brother.
</P>
<P>
   First, the name of Abdullah would be mooted, then that of
Hamzeh, his son by Queen Noor (a post he was awarded when Abdullah
became king).
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's concerns only increased when he realized the extent to
which his communications were being monitored; for years, he talked
half-jokingly to visitors about the taps on his phone.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, King Hussein was told that
Hassan had tried to fire the chief of staff of the army, that
Hassan's Pakistani-born wife Princess Sarvath had gone so far as to
change the carpets in the royal palace in anticipation of becoming
queen.
</P>
<P>
   The truth appears to be more prosaic.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than (pounds sterling)3 million, King Hussein
had built a house for Field Marshal Abdul-Hafez Mureii-Kaabneh, a
very ugly but otherwise magnificent pile on top of a hill outside
Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor had it that Walid bin Talal, a Saudi millionaire, wanted
to purchase the property for (pounds sterling)10 million but Crown
prince Hassan, after consultations with the king, told the Saudi
that the property belonged to the field marshal.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's response _ which appears to have been in accordance
with the king's wishes _ nevertheless provoked the story that he
wanted to remove the field marshal. And the king was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the tale of the carpets. Hassan's home is a charming
building once owned by the former British ambassador, Sir Alec
Kirkbride, but last year the Crown Prince decided that after years
of neglect, the house should be refurbished, along with adjoining
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Sarvath, so it is said, wanted to change the decoration in both
house and office. And a new story, as unfair as it appears to be
untrue, went the rounds: that the princess was ``changing the royal
palace'' even before the sick king had died.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could make dangerous mistakes. Against the advice of
friends, he commiserated before parliament with the suffering of
Iraqi civilians under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government reacted angrily because it believed Hassan
had not given sufficient support to the regime while the king
reportedly complained that the crown prince had not been tough
enough on the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Sarvath was also widely believed to want to name her
son Rashid as crown prince when Hassan became king _ an idea that
would inevitably anger Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Those around the princess advised her to forget the notion but
it seems that Hassan, too, continued to toy with the idea of naming
his own son crown prince once he gained the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days of his own regency, Abdullah showed
considerable generosity to his deposed uncle. He greeted him warmly
and _ when Hassan offered to hand over control of the six academic
institutions he ran, the new king insisted that Hassan should
continue to administer the projects.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation in which the monarchy is the one unifying bond, it
is as well that the two men appear to get on well. More royal
shenanigans, and Jordanians will be wondering what kind of royal
family they have inherited. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Our long national nightmare is at
an end
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ After all the country has been put
through with the investigation, impeachment and trial of the
president of the United States, Clinton walks, with a spring in his
step.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of things, more and more, the older I get, I just
wanted it to be over with.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the Senate vote made for a very nice Lincoln's
birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   All that time and money wasted by the GOP gone amok. I
particularly liked a reader's comment in the local newspaper:
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Republicans who have been after Clinton all these years
are like the old dog that was always chasing the pickup truck. When
he finally caught it, he didn't know what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying Clinton was innocent. The man is as guilty as
sin.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, sin isn't an impeachable offense. If it were,
I doubt there would be hardly anybody left standing to stand for
office.
</P>
<P>
   But the saddest part of this sorry tale, they had him dead to
rights on wrongdoing of the worst kind _ the China money that found
its way into the Democratic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   We may never know the truth of that scheme of lies. No telling
what was given in return. Rocket technology may be just the tip of
the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue faded away, and for good reason. It's a can of
worms that makes the flesh crawl of Republicans and Democrats alike
_ exposing where the money comes from and where it goes.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few exceptions, I suppose. But honesty in politics
is no more profitable than dentistry for chickens.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, this last year has pointed up the flaws of the
impeachment process as set down by the framers of the Constitution,
who never envisioned the rise of political parties and the partisan
nature thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a cure-all amendment that ought to be adopted
retroactive:
</P>
<P>
   In the event that charges of impeachment fail to receive the
necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate, House members who
voted to bring the issue before the Senate will hereby be required
to introduce all future remarks made from the House floor with the
following disclaimer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hee-haw, hee-haw.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the event that a charge fails to receive even a
simple majority, Senate members who voted in favor of the issue
will be required to preface their future remarks from the Senate
floor with the identical disclaimer while, in addition, placing
thumbs in ears and waggling their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when and if charges against the chief executive involve
misbehavior that takes the form of vain, contemptuous and moronic
sexual arrogance, said president of the United States will be
required to appear at public occasions henceforth wearing a jackass
head, regardless of acquittal.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Bring back the draft
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Marines, perpetually looking for a few good men, seem to
have all they need. The Army and the Navy, who need more than a
few, have fallen on tougher times.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is good news. The economy has been whizzing along.
When that happens and civilian jobs are there for the taking,
recruitment in the armed forces lags. Historical fact.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a bit of talk lately of bringing back the draft.
Good idea. Some form of conscription ought to get serious thought.
It would be good for the country for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A draft would fill up the ranks _ and give a lot of young people
the feeling that serving their country was more than an empty
phrase. It would bring to the military and its culture a lot of
young people who wanted nothing more than to get out. That's a
healthy part of military service in a democracy. The armed forces
that protect us so nobly are also the best of our class levelers.
They are about as close as we come to a true meritocracy. Not a bad
thing to know when you're growing up. Not a bad thing for the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARGENTIERE _ Michel, a soft-spoken man in his 30's, stood,
weeping between the enormous banks of snow in the village street.
``No one dreamed anything like this could happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These houses were in the safest possible zone for avalanches.
But what does anyone of us really know? When the mountain decides,
the mountain decides. There is nothing you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lost people that I loved a great deal. Here, we have
all lost people that we loved a great deal. The whole village is
crying.'' He turned away, unable to say any more.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamonix valley was in a state of shock _ and fear _
Wednesday after a monumental avalanche crushed 18 chalets in the
hamlet of Montroc-le-Planet, at 4,600 feet in the Mont Blanc
massif, killing at least 10 people, including an entire local
family of five and an elderly couple and their four-year-old
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were definitely known to be missing; 20 were
rescued, including two Americans and a 12-year-old boy, found under
several feet of snow and rubble. All the dead were French.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue work was continuing last night, with heavy digging and
lifting equipment but hope of finding further survivors had been
virtually lost. With temperatures falling to minus seven celsius,
the snow had packed too hard for hands or shovels to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-yard-wide, 18-feet-high tidal wave of snow crashed into
the valley bottom at an estimated 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It crossed a stream and one part swept on for 30 to 40 yards _
uphill _ to consume a group of chalets on the opposite slope. Hence
the sense of shock and fear among local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived here all my life and I have never heard of an
avalanche so powerful, so low down in the mountains, and I have
never heard of an avalanches capable of going uphill,'' said one
gendarme, resting in the village of Argentiere, less than two miles
away, after hours of digging in the packed snow and debris.
</P>
<P>
   Other buildings, some old and some new, some local homes and
some vacation chalets, were carried some 120 feet down the valley
by the remainder of the avalanche, which had been inactive for 90
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible. There is nothing left,'' said Jean-Louis
Verdier, assistant mayor of Chamonix, 10 miles from the disaster
scene. ``Everything was wiped away. Where the chalets should be,
there is a big hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The chalet next to ours disappeared. It was pushed across the
road. There were blocks of cement everywhere... It was the
apocalypse,'' said Jean-Marie Pavy, 49, who was staying in a house
just outside the path of the avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old French boy was pulled from several feet of the
snow and rubble by rescuers working with sonic equipment and
sniffer dogs after being trapped for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to hospital with extreme hypothermia and his
condition appeared desperate at first, but he was said to be
recovering strongly.
</P>
<P>
   This was the only real success of an arduous night for 200
rescue workers. After an initial flurry of rescues, all the victims
recovered were dead, including a local couple and their children
aged 11 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year-old girl found in the wreckage of a chalet near
the bodies of her grandparents seemed to be just alive but was
declared dead on arrival at a hospital in Chamonix.
</P>
<P>
   Gendarmes and firemen returning from the rescue scene Wednesday
said nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy. The
highest level of avalanche alert had been given the day before, but
the homes in Montroc were not regarded as under threat.
</P>
<P>
   The chalets were in a ``white zone,'' regarded as almost
completely free of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had six feet of snow in three days,'' one fireman said.
``No one can remember snowfalls like that. When you have that much
fresh snow, piling up on other unstable soft snow, anything can
happen.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The danger from avalanches in this part of the Alps has been
endlessly studied, plotted and tracked over the years; defenses
have been erected and buildings banned in the danger zones.
</P>
<P>
   The process is so old and so elaborate that each large,
avalanche site has a name, like the mountains themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of snow which fell on the village of Montroc on Tuesday
was called the ``Avalanche des Pecleray.'' It was regarded as the
Alpine equivalent of an extinct volcano: it had not dislodged
itself and crashed down the mountain since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   The last serious avalanche incident of any kind in this area,
high in the valley of the Arve, on the shoulder of Mont Blanc, near
the French-Swiss border, was 21 years ago. An avalanche fell on the
village of Tour, next to Montroc, destroying two chalets and
killing five people.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists have predicted that _ partly because of the
disruption of weather patterns by global warming _ snowfalls in the
Alps will tend to be greater, and later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   This has certainly been the case this year, with falls of six
feet of snow in the Chamonix area since the weekend. If the pattern
continues, all the conventional wisdom about safe and dangerous
zones for avalanches will have to be torn up. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   There have been dozens of other avalanches in the French Alps in
the last two days, most occurring safely high in the mountains. But
three British vacationers were engulfed by a snow slide at Tignes
les Brevieres, 50 miles south of Chamonix. They were not deeply
buried and managed to scramble free.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers also resumed the search Wednesday for a 28-year-old
Briton who disappeared in an avalanche while skiing off-piste near
Courchevel. The man, who was not been named, is presumed to be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   French police and prosecutors have issued stern warnings and
threats once again this year that tough action will be taken
against skiers who ignore warnings of avalanche dangers and leave
the marked trails and recognized slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche at Montroc had no such obvious cause; and it was
all the more terrifying for that reason. &QL;

REGRADING HELPS KEEP WATER OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My split ranch roof has a a three-foot overhang on all four
sides of the hip roof. Recent rains channeled water to the
foundation and we got water in the basement, and there is a crack
in the foundation. The foundation is exposed three to four feet
from ground to siding. Is there an easy way to stop this water?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE FUSI, Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Just possibly, and the large exposure of foundation is the
key. I suggest you regrade the property around the house so that it
slopes down and away from the house, especially if the property is
now level or sloping down toward the house. You will have to bring
in some good fill, but ground that slopes down from the house can
prevent leaks. You can bring earth to within eight inches of the
siding, but you probably won't have to do that. Besides, windows
might get in the way. And, if you don't have gutters, the
three-foot roof overhang will allow water to stay away from the
house. If you have gutters, make sure the downspouts drain at least
10 feet from the house.
</P>
<P>
   If the crack in the foundation is not leaking water, forget
about it, or fill it on the outside, not the inside. If it is
leaking, fixing it might help the whole problem. To fill the crack,
chip it out an inch wide and as deep as practicable. Fill with
hydraulic cement. Apply a layer of roofing cement wider than the
crack, cover it with roofing felt (tarpaper) and another layer of
roofing cement, all below grade. For the crack above grade, filling
it with hydraulic cement will be cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some rough stucco or cement was skimcoated on my foundation.
I've been in the house for 6 1/2 years, and now it is cracking and
peeling off. How can I make it look good again?
</P>
<P>
   ERICA CAMPAGNA, Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try this: Apply a bonding agent to the areas where the
skimcoat peeled, but first chip off any loose skimcoat. The
original skimcoat failed because a bonding agent was not applied.
Apply a mortar mix (sold in lumber stores; just add water), let it
set for 15 minutes, then rub with a wood float (a wood trowel) or
piece of rough wood. You may have to stain the entire foundation so
the old will match the new. Use a concrete stain instead of paint.
Muralo makes one in numerous colors.
</P>
<P>
   Or, better, in my opinion, chip out every bit of that silly
skimcoat, using a wide cold chisel (mason's chisel) and mason's
hammer. If you can get it all off, leave the concrete bare; it's an
honest material that does not need gilding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   We didn't laugh when S. H. of Boston askedus if there are any
furniture restorers, rebuilders, refinishers, and upholsterers who
could work on her big, wonderful old sofa in situ, that is, in her
condo unit rather than in a shop. The sofa is very long, and try as
they might, her husband and sons could not get it down from the top
floor of the building to take it to a shop. Goodness knows, they
tried.
</P>
<P>
   Other than hoistng it out a window with a crane (bring money),
the handyman did not have an answer, except to ask last Sunday if
there was anyone who would, indeed, work on the sofa in the unit.
</P>
<P>
   We received no replies, but found just such a person who is
willing to do such work in the unit. He is Wayne Towle, who
operates out of Needham Heights, Mass. So, S. H., give Towle a call
at 781-449-1313. We found Towle at the Old House Fair last Sunday
at the Cyclorama. We're glad we went.
</P>
<P>
   We took S.H.'s phone numbner to inform her of any discovery, but
try as we might, we could not find it in the rat's nest we call our
desk.
</P>
<P>
   However, we did recieve this from George Robinson of Middelbury,
Conn.: ``The lady who asked how to remove the sofa from her condo _
my wife (who is very astute), questioned: howdid they get the sofa
in the condo (in the first place)? Did it get bigger? Just
asking.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have to have my house painted because the paint is peeling
severely, and mostly down to the bare wood. The painter said the
house has to be re-sided because of mildew. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   CLAUDIA CALDERHEAD, Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. While mildew caused paint to peel and to fail, re-siding is
not the answer, although it is an option which we will get to in a
second. Mildew can be killed and removed by applying a bleach/water
solution. The paint is more likely peeling because of moisture
(water) behind and in the wood siding. It is difficult to
impossible to prevent this moisture from occurring, so instead of
painting, you could have the siding scraped and sanded heavily,
then apply two coats of a solid latex stain, which will look like
paint but resist peeling.
</P>
<P>
   So now we get to the re-siding question. If you do re-side, I
suggest you apply white cedar shingles, and let them weather to a
silver gray; you do not have to treat them in any way (no
maintenance), and they will last for 40 years. It sure beats vinyl
siding.
</P>

   LONDON _ Blood transfusions given routinely to tens of thousands
of critically ill patients may be killing them, doctors have found.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian researchers have found that giving extra blood, despite
its essential role in maintaining life, can cause more harm than
good in those who have been thought in greatest need of it.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected finding, from a study of more than 800 critically
ill patients, will deliver a serious blow to the idea of accident
victims being stretchered into hospital with a bag of life-giving
blood suspended above them.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had assumed that any means of boosting oxygen supply to
the body's tissues in those who were seriously ill would improve
their chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian research shows that critically ill patients who
received more blood were up to twice as likely to die as those who
received less.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, an estimated 800,000 patients receive blood
transfusions each year, most after routine surgery, and demand for
blood is rising. Using less blood would also save costs and
conserve a scarce resource.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of a transfusion is to restore levels of hemoglobin, the
oxygen-carrying constituent of red blood cells. Normal levels of
hemoglobin range from 14 to 17 grams per deciliter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian study, half of the 838 seriously unwell patients
were given enough blood to raise their hemoglobin over 10 grams per
deciliter, while the other half were restricted to only 7-9 grams
per deciliter, half the normal level.
</P>
<P>
   One third of the restricted group received no blood at all. On
average the restricted group received three units of blood (one and
a half liters) less than the unrestricted group _ but more of them
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among patients under 55 and the less severely ill, those who
received less blood (or no blood at all) were half as likely to die
as those who received more.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions were patients with heart attacks and
unstable angina (chest pain).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Hebert and his colleagues from the University of Ottawa
say in the New England Journal of Medicine: ``Our findings indicate
that the use of a threshold...as low as 7 grams of hemoglobin per
deciliter...was at least as effective as and possibly superior to a
liberal transfusion strategy...in critically ill patients.''
</P>
<P>
   It is well-known that giving too much blood or other infusions
can cause heart attacks or water on the lungs because of the effort
required to pump the extra liquid around the body. But the
researchers found these factors could not explain the differences
they found.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary on the findings, Wesley Ely and Gordon Bernard
of the Vanderbilt School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., say it is
difficult to explain the harm caused by liberal transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that a transfusion, like a transplant,
delivers a shock to the immune system. ``Harmless'' viruses in the
blood may also be implicated.
</P>
<P>
   They say more trials are needed to determine the best treatment
for critically ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``With such knowledge, more physicians will be able to adhere to
the dictum `first do no harm,' and we will have a surplus of blood
for transfusion rather than a shortage.'' &QL;

SPREAD INVESTMENT OUT FOR BETTER RETURNS

 (For release Sunday, February 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 42-year-old self-employed roofing contractor. My SEP
IRA accounts consist of $40,000 in Vanguard Index 500, $11,000 in
Vanguard s Total Stock Market Index, $20,000 in American Century
Twentieth Century Ultra, $13,000 in Janus Worldwide, $10,000 in
Janus Special Situations, and $4,000 in Sound Shore funds. What do
you think of these funds and the overall portfolio? I have been
adding $350 a month _ $100 each to Sound Shore and Janus Worldwide,
and $150 to Ultra. What do you estimate I will have at retirement
age?
</P>
<P>
   M.T., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. There s no questions that you ve picked solid funds -- but it
also seems to me that you ve picked too many of them out of the
same barrel. Both of the Vanguard Indexes, American Century Ultra,
and the domestic side of the Janus Worldwide portfolio (which
comprises 56 percent of the fund's assets) are all concentrated on
large-cap investments.
</P>
<P>
   Adding it all together, I calculate that you thus have 79.1
percent of your portfolio in the domestic large-cap sector. This
sector has, of course, been the place to be for the last couple of
years, but for the long haul you ll want additional
diversification. I suggest you swap the entire position in Janus
Worldwide for shares in Janus Overseas, and also commit the $100
additional monthly investment to the pure international fund.
</P>
<P>
   This would immediately cut your large-cap concentration to 72.9
percent. You could then slowly chip away at that percentage by
reallocating some of your monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you continue building your mid-cap position, which is
represented by Janus Special Situations and Sound Shore funds. But
I would divert that $150 monthly that's now going to American
Century Twenmtieth Century Ultra to new investments in two
additional sectors. First, I would buy a small-cal fund (such as
Janus Venture or Vanguard Small-Cap Index). Finally, I'd build a
position in a health care fund, such as Vanguard Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   As for the likely accumulation, if you achieved average 10
percent portfolio returns and continued your $350 monthly
contributions, you would have $991,960 after 20 years, when you are
62. Under the same assumption, you would have $1,227,033 at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it better to reinvest dividends and interest payments
automatically, or to put them in a money market fund, using the
money to invest when the market is at a low, as someone has
suggested to me. If these are long-term investments, it seems to me
that over the long term the first option would be as good as the
second, especially for a person who does not have a lot of market
savvy.
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think there are two classes of people who are attracted to
the idea of religiously reinvesting distributions, regardless of
the state of the market. These are people of limited market
experience, and people with a very great deal of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two extremes falls the self-styled expert, who is
confident that he or she can assess market highs and lows closely
enough to do better than the market itself.
</P>
<P>
   When you reinvest distributions, whther they be through
reinvestments in a mutual fund or through a dividend reinvestment
program associated with a common stock, you have basically entered
into a sort of dollar-cost-averaging program. Through this, you
calculate that a sequence of periodic investments will bring you an
average cost for your position that reflect both high and low
markets. If it s a long-term program, the ultimate result should be
an average cost well below the value at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course the suggestion that was made to you is as
unassailable as the old market advice, buy low; sell high. The
problem is that nobody really knows where the markets are going,
and especially for a short-term time frame, few can predict with
any great accuracy when the markets are at a high or a low. But
studies have been done which indicate that if an investor who is
trying to time the markets has the correct general sense but
misjudges them only slightly -- being a few days or weeks late in
calling the highs or lows -- he or she will end up well behind the
steady plodders who just keep shoveling their money in. The reason
for this is that, at least in the past, markets have generally
tended to move very quickly when they are at extremes -- falling
quickly when the ability to sustain highs have been exhausted, and
rising very quickly in the earliest days of a bull market.
</P>
<P>
   And it's when the investor miscalculates on those precise points
of time that they lose ground to the dollar-cost-averagers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am about 60 years old and divorced. I have just learned
that my contract at work will last only another 16 months. I would
prefer to work until age 65, but the contract may not be extended.
So I'm planning on the possibility of retirement either at age 62
or age 65. I have two rental properties worth $225,000 combined,
owned free and clear. I also have $135,000 in money market
accounts, representing retirement savings from previous jobs. I
recently received $100,000 from the sale of a home, and am not sure
where it should be placed. It is currently in a money market
account, earning about 5 percent. Should I keep it there? Should I
put it in a teacher's annuity and not touch it until needed? It
would earn about 5.5 percent there. Or should I take a chance on
mutual funds? I'm a little timid after last fall. I won't need the
money for between 1.5 years or 4.5 years, depending on my
employment situation.
</P>
<P>
   L.E. Tigard, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. From your last remark, I'm presuming that it's not the
principal that you'll be calling upon at age 62 or 65, depending on
when you retire, but rather the income stream it can bring you.
Obviously the money markets are the correct place for funds which
you will need within a five-year period, but if it's the income
stream rather than the principal that you'll be requiring within
five years, it makes sense to invest it pretty much the same way
you would invest it once you re retired.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand your reluctance to invest it in mutual funds
after the choppy markets of last year, but I think you would do
well if you confined yourself to a diverse portfolio of
fixed-income funds. Specifically, I would suggest that about half
of the money go into a solid GNMA fund, from which you might expect
a yield of about 6.5 percent. Then I'd divide the balance between a
short-term bond fund and a high-yield bond fund, expecting returns
in the neighborhood of 5.75 percent and 8.25 percent respectively.
The net effect would be a projected yield of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you made such an investment now, by the time 18 months had
elapsed you would have, at least on paper, a $110,329 savings pool;
you might then presume that this would give you an income stream of
$7,447 annually, without invading the principal. If you did work
until age 65, the pool would grow to $134,205, and you could expect
an annual income stream of $9,058 henceforth. (In both cases, you
would have to use other funds to pay the taxes generated by the
reinvested distributions of your funds.) Most of the major fund
families offer funds in these categories.
</P>
<P>
   When you shop around for these, make sure you understand that
the highest yields don t necessarily mean the highest total
returns. Especially in the riskier of these three categories -- the
GNMA and high-yield funds -- you ll want to make sure you re not
buying a fund which manages to make distributions at levels that
are high relative to their peers, but then seem to regularly suffer
a compensating decline in net asset value. (This comes from buying
high-yielding securities above par value.) Look at total returns
instead of yield alone, and if you do decide to use funds which
have historically shed net asset value, you can compensate once you
begin drawing an income stream by having a small amount of the
distributions reinvested, insuring that your withdrawal schedule
will not bring a decline in your principal.

 By PHIL REEVES  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fate can be terribly cruel. Just after Boris Yeltsin
touched down in Moscow, returning from King Hussein's funeral, his
Ilyushin-96 presidential plane was in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Its wing hit a jet carrying the Italian prime minister; reports
said later that Rome's man was taxiing ``contrary to
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the damage was slight, it was the final humiliation in an
expedition that was fraught with risk from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ill and disoriented, Boris Yeltsin spent less than three
hours in Jordan before bolting home, leaving the world even more
convinced that his days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian papers were derisive. ``Yeltsin did not make it to
the grave but was very close to it,'' said Moskovski Komsomolets.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth did he go? His doctors warned against it. He was
not particularly close to the king, and was certainly less involved
in the Middle East than his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov _ the
obvious choice as Russia's representative.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his foreign ventures often produce disasters. No
Yeltsin obituary will omit his failure to disembark from his plane
in Ireland in 1994, or his inebriated attempts to conduct an
orchestra in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   As his physical and mental decline has steepened, these episodes
have become less comic than sad, and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden in late 1997, he caused astonishment by suggesting
that the Japanese and Germans had nuclear weapons; in Uzbekistan
last year, he almost keeled over in front of the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, in Kazakhstan, he looked astonishingly ashen
_ a lost, drugged figure who seemed barely able to summon up the
mental strength to sign a document.
</P>
<P>
   It took him 25 seconds to complete his signature; then he
shuffled out, after mumbling angrily about the press telling lies.
</P>
<P>
   So: why did he go to the funeral? The answer is part personality
and part politics. It was the desperate act of a leader worried
about his diminished status on the world stage. It was also that of
a politician badly irked by evidence that another _ Primakov _ has
stealthily taken the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin cares much about how history will view him.
Entwined deep within his complex character is a fear that he will
be remembered not as a world statesman, who _ in his winning,
rough-hewn way _ piloted an empire through the agony of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he fears being remembered as someone who failed to grow
much beyond his roots as a Siberian party boss, whose actions were
primarily determined by an instinct to survive _ just like other
former party apparatchiki who still control the power and perks
across many of Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he could have expected better. Reforms and
privatization (although appallingly corrupt) were staggering along.
The ruble was stable. Predictions of civil war and revolution had
proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had returned to power in an election which, by
post-Soviet standards, was fairly clean (although there were
campaign finance violations and grossly biased media coverage).
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya remained unforgiven by Russians, but in the
West _ which generally paid it far too little attention in the
first place _ it was quickly being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance that history would be generous, remembering
him as the defiant figure who bravely confronted hard-line coup
plotters in 1991 from the turret of a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the best of these achievements are in ruins. Tens of
thousands of skilled, young, urban Russians, the beginnings of a
consumer middle class, are jobless. The ruble is worth a quarter of
its value in mid-1998; Russia has _ at least for the time being _
alienated the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's misery is measured by a pulse of individual
tragedies: a pensioner who immolated himself on Red Square;
rampaging soldiers who slaughter their comrades and themselves with
amazing regularity; thieves who cut off the hair of bus passengers
to sell it; workers paid not in cash but in rolls of toilet paper
or canned food; countless children begging on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Or the three girls _ not one older than 14 _ who, after writing
a suicide note, on Monday hurled themselves to their deaths from an
eighth-story window. (Whatever their motives _ be they unrequited
love or a cult's influence _ this horror says much about the
alienation of youth, parenthood, and a derelict education system.)
</P>
<P>
   If you explore the wreckage, the charitably minded can still
find reasons to give credit to President Yeltsin. Today's Russians
can say and read what they like; and _ for the minority with the
money _ can travel freely.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, the world's chief sermonizer
on human rights, Russia has suspended capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is overshadowed by larger problems. Boris Yeltsin is
hated at home _ three-quarters of his population want to see him
impeached _ and regarded with a mixture of pity and dismay abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In his twilight years, he can counter this only by resorting to
a tactic at which he used to be a maestro _ grand, unexpected
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a trace of this in St. Petersburg last summer when he
appeared at the reburial of Nicholas II and his family. But, as the
King Hussein funeral fiasco in Jordan proved, his touch has
deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   He has acquired the air of an aging actor, long ago stripped of
the lead, who keeps blundering out of the wings in the hope of
stealing into a spotlight occupied by others. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (750-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Boris Yeltsin's presidency ended five months ago,
after he sacked his government (led by the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko) _ the second to go within a few months _ after it had
announced a default of foreign and domestic debts and abandoned the
battle to defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   His final demise came when the State Duma, the lower house,
rejected his nomination for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who had already done the job before _ dismally, in the eyes of most
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise candidate, Yevgeny Primakov, the foreign minister,
was ushered in, posing as a loyal servant who was too old (69, a
year older than Yeltsin) to have any greater ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated, the President retired to the shadows, in which he
has hidden for much of his second term, wrestling with illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Primakov has seized the initiative, steadily securing
the status of Russia's ``de facto'' leader. After a cautious start,
his presidential aspirations have grown more blatant.
</P>
<P>
   He has assiduously wooed the Duma's powerful Communists, and has
courted regional leaders, both key power bases. Allies from his
days as foreign intelligence chief have been planted in strategic
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At his back stands a government that has little sympathy for the
Kremlin or its occupant, but plenty for Soviet methods.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov first took over the prime minister's job, Yeltsin
appeared resigned to life in the twilight; his aides conceded that
he was no longer governing day to day but was working on
constitutional issues. His weekly radio addresses stopped, and his
staged appearances on TV grew rarer.
</P>
<P>
   But what he cannot have expected _ and clearly resents _ is the
manner in which Primakov has turned his firepower on the Kremlin
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has launched a campaign against the
oligarchic Boris Berezovsky, a friend of Yeltsin's influential
daughter Tatyana, a man who until recently could make or break a
government.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies _ affiliates of the oil conglomerate Sibneft, and
Aeroflot _ linked to the tycoon were raided by police amid
allegations that he was running a private intelligence-gathering
operation which spied on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the president amused when Primakov went to parliament
flourishing a deal in which Yeltsin would get immunity from
prosecution in retirement and an end to the (largely symbolic)
impeachment proceedings against him in return for an agreement not
to dissolve the legislature or sack the government.
</P>
<P>
   The president rejected the offer with warnings that he was not
about to give away any of his constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Primakov has insisted that he has no desire for the
top job. But there is a sense, hard to pinpoint, but palpable, that
he is quietly being anointed as the heir to the Kremlin, as the
monolithic forces that shape the land _ the minerals monopolies,
the regional elite, the media _ gradually coalesce around him.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer of power, a murky process in which the ballot box
will play but a minor role, is under way. So much for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This impression is underscored by most of the other likely
contenders for the Kremlin who _ for all their shrillness _ do not
seem ready to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   General Alexander Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk, is collapsing
beneath the weight of running a vast Siberian region. Russia's
democrats _ a much-abused term embracing Thatcherite economists,
liberal democrats and non-ideological super-rich with fortunes to
defend _ have proved incapable of unity, and are too widely
disliked to have a hope.
</P>
<P>
   It is questionable whether Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the
Communists, and runner-up at the last election, really wants the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He runs the only nationwide political party, and can still
expect to muster the support of one in five Russian voters. Yet
true power could quickly shatter the coalition of Stalinists,
mouth-frothing nationalists and progressive socialists who stand
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sums of money at stake in Russia, and the national
habit of settling scores with a Kalashnikov, his life would be at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man, the formidable mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov,
seems genuinely keen to compete for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for now, Boris Yeltsin is tolerated. Critically, this
allows him to fulfill one of his goals, again with an eye to
history.
</P>
<P>
   By completing his term, he takes another step towards ensuring
that the constitution _ a document that he forced through in a
suspect 1993 referendum, and which is still widely ignored _
becomes law. It is an issue about which he really seems to care. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 750-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many months, Western TV crews have been on death watch in
Moscow, confined to the capital. For months, obituaries have been
ready in newspaper offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though a political corpse, Boris Yeltsin is not dead yet.
He has been under assault from an array of conditions that would
floor many another, which _ if the Kremlin is to be believed _
include double pneumonia, bronchitis, heart trouble, a bleeding
ulcer, colds, flu and throat afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not impossible that he will follow the example of
another equally accomplished boozer, Winston Churchill, whose heart
and health caused his doctor concern from before the start of the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   He died at 91 _ a decade after his resignation in 1955, much of
which time was spent staring into a coal fire with a rug on his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Sick though he is, Boris Yeltsin could stagger on for a while
yet. Certainly, his aides _ led now by a former KGB general _ are
trying to discourage those full-time mourners who have long been
wringing their hands at their boss's graveside.
</P>
<P>
   This week a senior Kremlin official said that there would be
more outings to France, Germany and _ perilously, given the
distance and conditions _ to Africa and Latin America, before his
term ends in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, fearful of more embarrassment, will pray that he stays
at home. &QL;

NEWS ANALYSIS: HOW MUCH DAMAGE? AND FOR HOW LONG?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are those who think it will end up as Much
Ado About Nothing, at least as far as the country, its political
culture and its institutions of government are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the whole impeachment drama will have much
long-term impact on anybody or anything except President Clinton,''
said former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn., who made his name
during the Watergate hearings. ``And even the impact on him is
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the eminent historian, begs to
differ. A Democrat who served John F. Kennedy as a White House
adviser, he sees the travail of President Clinton as an event of
considerable moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failed impeachment of Andrew Johnson left a wounded,
weakened presidency, one that lasted for many years,'' Schlesinger
said, ``and I think the failed impeachment of Bill Clinton will do
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was imprudent to predict many months ago how the drama
would end, as it finally did Friday, to the relief of almost
everyone, it might be considered downright foolhardy to guess at
its consequences. But that does not stop Washington or
Washington-watchers elsewhere from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Few people doubt that the events of the last year have coarsened
the national political discourse. It is as if Clinton's own habit
of pushing the limits _ ``indulging all choices and accepting no
consequences,'' as Rep. James E. Rogan of California, one of the
House managers, put it last week _ infected the behavior of all the
major players.
</P>
<P>
   The capital has witnessed the breakdown of long-standing codes
of behavior on every side. Senior Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee accused their Republican counterparts of staging a coup
d'etat; Trent Lott, the leader of the Republican majority in the
Senate, strongly suggested that the president was bombing Iraq to
deflect attention from his domestic political problems. The conduct
of the independent counsel in the Lewinsky case, Kenneth W. Starr,
has attracted so much opprobrium that Congress is considering
allowing the Watergate-era law authorizing independent counsels to
lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the news media, a ravenous appetite for scandal has
developed. More salacious details about politicians have been
talked about and written about than at any time in modern history,
and the mainstream media have joined less well-established and more
marginal outlets in the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Monica and Bill and Ken and Henry has revulsed a
large portion of the American people, it has turned off foreigners,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A story with no heroes, no morals, no lessons,'' the Financial
Times of London called it last weekend, ``just self-obsessed
individuals in a fight for survival, a vast landscape painting of
life as it truly is in Washington at the turn of the millennium, a
Guernica of overfed egoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how permanent is the damage? Is the nation
witnessing merely an extreme example of Jefferson's maxim that ``no
man will ever bring out of the presidency the reputation that
carries him into it,'' or something much more substantial?
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Senate feel that the constitutional system worked in
the Clinton impeachment just as well as it had worked 25 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue that the House overstepped the line by
impeaching the president,'' said Sen. John S. McCain, R-Ariz., who
voted to convict Clinton on both articles. ``You can argue that we
should have removed him from office. But for me, the point is that
the process went forward the way the Framers intended. That
revalidates the Constitution and it means that whatever happens to
the reputation of individual presidents, the presidency remains
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who presided over the trial,
took leave of the Senate with compliments for the way it had
comported itself.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most ardent loyalists doubt that Clinton has besmirched
his reputation, more or less permanently. Even those who denounced
the whole impeachment process as a Republican vendetta denounced
the president's conduct in the next breath, using savage adjectives
like ``shameful,'' ``despicable'' and ``disgraceful.'' Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who fights his party's corner as hard
as any man, said this week: ``History will judge his actions and
significant lapses of judgment harshly, as it should.'' Statements
like that will make the revisionists' work harder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In a thousand books yet to be written, the word ``impeachment''
will cling to the name ``Clinton'' like a limpet. But there may be
other, kinder words as well. It may be that history will remember
Clinton as something more than the second president ever to stand
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon managed a partial rehabilitation of his name,
and he was driven from office, as Clinton was not. Through his
writings and the urgings of those who had worked for him, through
the success of some of his policies, Nixon came to be seen as an
intelligent, accomplished president brought low by tragic flaws.
That cheers Clinton's acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   The president's rehabilitation effort began Friday, and how well
it succeeds will depend in part on what he is able to achieve in
his remaining 23 months in office. Some signs are positive: the
collegial attitude of the new speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.;
Clinton's demonstrated ability to score at least limited successes
abroad, as in the Middle East, even when the going was toughest at
home; his continued high standing in the polls, and the astonishing
buoyancy of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the ominous polarization that has plagued Washington has
been intensified by the impeachment process. Clinton was impeached
by the House along party lines. Ten Republicans in the Senate
joined all the Democrats in voting to acquit him of perjury, and 5
voted to acquit him of obstruction of justice. But they were mostly
northeastern moderates who vote with the Democrats on important
policy issues fairly often, and not mainstream Republican
conservatives with no history of breaking party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's credibility has been severely damaged, which could
prove a serious handicap in future negotiations with Congress. Rep.
Tom DeLay of Texas said of the president a few weeks ago, ``I don't
believe a word he says.'' Democrats dismissed that as the ranting
of a Republican bomb-thrower. But it is not as easy to discount the
statement this week by Senator Richard G. Lugar, a level-headed
Republican from Indiana, who said during the final deliberations
earlier this week, ``He is not trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as predicted, Clinton mounts a campaign to punish the House
prosecutors at the polls next year, that will certainly do little
to advance his legislative agenda. And if, as his State of the
Union speech suggested, he veers away from his centrist,
smaller-government philosophy to reward the liberals who have stood
beside him, that could hurt him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another imponderable is Starr's follow-up to impeachment. If he
tries to indict Clinton before the president leaves office, that
would put a crimp in a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot harder to calculate how much the office, as opposed
to the man, has been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger looks to the 19th century and the example of Andrew
Johnson, and it is undeniable that he was followed by a succession
of second-rate presidents of both parties. The parade of
mediocrities lasted for three decades, until the election of
Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   But were the presidents of that day passive because Johnson's
impeachment had undercut the authority of the White House, or
because they and the American public saw little need for boldness
or innovation? It was an era, like the present one, when government
did not seem of major importance to the average citizen and much of
politics was mere shadow-boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, of course, problems built up, unaddressed if not
unidentified, notably the concentration of capital in the giant
trusts and the victimization of labor. But when President Roosevelt
_ it was he, remember, who first called the White House ``a bully
pulpit'' _ decided to confront those problems, he found ample
reservoirs of strength to do so in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Those like Sen. Baker who look to this century and the example
of Richard Nixon see a political system tough and resilient enough
to snap back quickly, even in a day of new media for whom little is
sacred and even in a day when fewer and fewer moderates find their
way to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, it is true, recovered even more quickly than
Nixon himself. Like Theodore Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, who took
office only six years after Nixon left it, found all the
presidential power he needed to impose lasting changes on American
politics and government, despite widespread earlier assertions that
Nixon had all but destroyed the office.
</P>
<P>
   But not even presidents with policies as popular as Reagan's and
Clinton's have been able to restore the reputation of the federal
government among American voters. Fewer and fewer pay attention to
what happens in Washington; fewer and fewer vote. Just the other
day, Curtis Gans, the leading student of the nation's voting
patterns, reported that the turnout for last year's midterm
elections had been the lowest in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism fuels that disturbing trend. Cynicism began growing in
the United States during the Vietnam war; it increased during
Watergate, and it may have reached a peak this year, with more than
half the public telling pollsters, the president lied under oath,
but leave him where he is.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical subtext of that dichotomy, what most Americans see
when they turn their eyes on Washington, is four words: ``They all
do it.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fate can be terribly cruel. Just after Boris Yeltsin
touched down in Moscow, returning from King Hussein's funeral, his
Ilyushin-96 presidential plane was in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Its wing hit a jet carrying the Italian prime minister; reports
said later that Rome's man was taxiing ``contrary to
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the damage was slight, it was the final humiliation in an
expedition that was fraught with risk from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ill and disoriented, Boris Yeltsin spent less than three
hours in Jordan before bolting home, leaving the world even more
convinced that his days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian papers were derisive. ``Yeltsin did not make it to
the grave but was very close to it,'' said Moskovski Komsomolets.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth did he go? His doctors warned against it. He was
not particularly close to the king, and was certainly less involved
in the Middle East than his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov _ the
obvious choice as Russia's representative.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his foreign ventures often produce disasters. No
Yeltsin obituary will omit his failure to disembark from his plane
in Ireland in 1994, or his inebriated attempts to conduct an
orchestra in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   As his physical and mental decline has steepened, these episodes
have become less comic than sad, and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden in late 1997, he caused astonishment by suggesting
that the Japanese and Germans had nuclear weapons; in Uzbekistan
last year, he almost keeled over in front of the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, in Kazakhstan, he looked astonishingly ashen
_ a lost, drugged figure who seemed barely able to summon up the
mental strength to sign a document.
</P>
<P>
   It took him 25 seconds to complete his signature; then he
shuffled out, after mumbling angrily about the press telling lies.
</P>
<P>
   So: why did he go to the funeral? The answer is part personality
and part politics. It was the desperate act of a leader worried
about his diminished status on the world stage. It was also that of
a politician badly irked by evidence that another _ Primakov _ has
stealthily taken the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin cares much about how history will view him.
Entwined deep within his complex character is a fear that he will
be remembered not as a world statesman, who _ in his winning,
rough-hewn way _ piloted an empire through the agony of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he fears being remembered as someone who failed to grow
much beyond his roots as a Siberian party boss, whose actions were
primarily determined by an instinct to survive _ just like other
former party apparatchiki who still control the power and perks
across many of Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he could have expected better. Reforms and
privatization (although appallingly corrupt) were staggering along.
The ruble was stable. Predictions of civil war and revolution had
proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had returned to power in an election which, by
post-Soviet standards, was fairly clean (although there were
campaign finance violations and grossly biased media coverage).
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya remained unforgiven by Russians, but in the
West _ which generally paid it far too little attention in the
first place _ it was quickly being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance that history would be generous, remembering
him as the defiant figure who bravely confronted hard-line coup
plotters in 1991 from the turret of a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the best of these achievements are in ruins. Tens of
thousands of skilled, young, urban Russians, the beginnings of a
consumer middle class, are jobless. The ruble is worth a quarter of
its value in mid-1998; Russia has _ at least for the time being _
alienated the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's misery is measured by a pulse of individual
tragedies: a pensioner who immolated himself on Red Square;
rampaging soldiers who slaughter their comrades and themselves with
amazing regularity; thieves who cut off the hair of bus passengers
to sell it; workers paid not in cash but in rolls of toilet paper
or canned food; countless children begging on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Or the three girls _ not one older than 14 _ who, after writing
a suicide note, on Monday hurled themselves to their deaths from an
eighth-story window. (Whatever their motives _ be they unrequited
love or a cult's influence _ this horror says much about the
alienation of youth, parenthood, and a derelict education system.)
</P>
<P>
   If you explore the wreckage, the charitably minded can still
find reasons to give credit to President Yeltsin. Today's Russians
can say and read what they like; and _ for the minority with the
money _ can travel freely.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, the world's chief sermonizer
on human rights, Russia has suspended capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is overshadowed by larger problems. Boris Yeltsin is
hated at home _ three-quarters of his population want to see him
impeached _ and regarded with a mixture of pity and dismay abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In his twilight years, he can counter this only by resorting to
a tactic at which he used to be a maestro _ grand, unexpected
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a trace of this in St. Petersburg last summer when he
appeared at the reburial of Nicholas II and his family. But, as the
King Hussein funeral fiasco in Jordan proved, his touch has
deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   He has acquired the air of an aging actor, long ago stripped of
the lead, who keeps blundering out of the wings in the hope of
stealing into a spotlight occupied by others. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (750-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Boris Yeltsin's presidency ended five months ago,
after he sacked his government (led by the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko) _ the second to go within a few months _ after it had
announced a default of foreign and domestic debts and abandoned the
battle to defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   His final demise came when the State Duma, the lower house,
rejected his nomination for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who had already done the job before _ dismally, in the eyes of most
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise candidate, Yevgeny Primakov, the foreign minister,
was ushered in, posing as a loyal servant who was too old (69, a
year older than Yeltsin) to have any greater ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated, the President retired to the shadows, in which he
has hidden for much of his second term, wrestling with illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Primakov has seized the initiative, steadily securing
the status of Russia's ``de facto'' leader. After a cautious start,
his presidential aspirations have grown more blatant.
</P>
<P>
   He has assiduously wooed the Duma's powerful Communists, and has
courted regional leaders, both key power bases. Allies from his
days as foreign intelligence chief have been planted in strategic
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At his back stands a government that has little sympathy for the
Kremlin or its occupant, but plenty for Soviet methods.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov first took over the prime minister's job, Yeltsin
appeared resigned to life in the twilight; his aides conceded that
he was no longer governing day to day but was working on
constitutional issues. His weekly radio addresses stopped, and his
staged appearances on TV grew rarer.
</P>
<P>
   But what he cannot have expected _ and clearly resents _ is the
manner in which Primakov has turned his firepower on the Kremlin
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has launched a campaign against the
oligarchic Boris Berezovsky, a friend of Yeltsin's influential
daughter Tatyana, a man who until recently could make or break a
government.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies _ affiliates of the oil conglomerate Sibneft, and
Aeroflot _ linked to the tycoon were raided by police amid
allegations that he was running a private intelligence-gathering
operation which spied on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the president amused when Primakov went to parliament
flourishing a deal in which Yeltsin would get immunity from
prosecution in retirement and an end to the (largely symbolic)
impeachment proceedings against him in return for an agreement not
to dissolve the legislature or sack the government.
</P>
<P>
   The president rejected the offer with warnings that he was not
about to give away any of his constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Primakov has insisted that he has no desire for the
top job. But there is a sense, hard to pinpoint, but palpable, that
he is quietly being anointed as the heir to the Kremlin, as the
monolithic forces that shape the land _ the minerals monopolies,
the regional elite, the media _ gradually coalesce around him.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer of power, a murky process in which the ballot box
will play but a minor role, is under way. So much for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This impression is underscored by most of the other likely
contenders for the Kremlin who _ for all their shrillness _ do not
seem ready to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   General Alexander Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk, is collapsing
beneath the weight of running a vast Siberian region. Russia's
democrats _ a much-abused term embracing Thatcherite economists,
liberal democrats and non-ideological super-rich with fortunes to
defend _ have proved incapable of unity, and are too widely
disliked to have a hope.
</P>
<P>
   It is questionable whether Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the
Communists, and runner-up at the last election, really wants the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He runs the only nationwide political party, and can still
expect to muster the support of one in five Russian voters. Yet
true power could quickly shatter the coalition of Stalinists,
mouth-frothing nationalists and progressive socialists who stand
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sums of money at stake in Russia, and the national
habit of settling scores with a Kalashnikov, his life would be at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man, the formidable mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov,
seems genuinely keen to compete for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for now, Boris Yeltsin is tolerated. Critically, this
allows him to fulfill one of his goals, again with an eye to
history.
</P>
<P>
   By completing his term, he takes another step towards ensuring
that the constitution _ a document that he forced through in a
suspect 1993 referendum, and which is still widely ignored _
becomes law. It is an issue about which he really seems to care. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   For many months, Western TV crews have been on death watch in
Moscow, confined to the capital. For months, obituaries have been
ready in newspaper offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though a political corpse, Boris Yeltsin is not dead yet.
He has been under assault from an array of conditions that would
floor many another, which _ if the Kremlin is to be believed _
include double pneumonia, bronchitis, heart trouble, a bleeding
ulcer, colds, flu and throat afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not impossible that he will follow the example of
another equally accomplished boozer, Winston Churchill, whose heart
and health caused his doctor concern from before the start of the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   He died at 91 _ a decade after his resignation in 1955, much of
which time was spent staring into a coal fire with a rug on his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Sick though he is, Boris Yeltsin could stagger on for a while
yet. Certainly, his aides _ led now by a former KGB general _ are
trying to discourage those full-time mourners who have long been
wringing their hands at their boss's graveside.
</P>
<P>
   This week a senior Kremlin official said that there would be
more outings to France, Germany and _ perilously, given the
distance and conditions _ to Africa and Latin America, before his
term ends in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, fearful of more embarrassment, will pray that he stays
at home. &QL;

NEWS ANALYSIS: HOW MUCH DAMAGE? AND FOR HOW LONG?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are those who think it will end up as Much
Ado About Nothing, at least as far as the country, its political
culture and its institutions of government are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the whole impeachment drama will have much
long-term impact on anybody or anything except President Clinton,''
said former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn., who made his name
during the Watergate hearings. ``And even the impact on him is
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the eminent historian, begs to
differ. A Democrat who served John F. Kennedy as a White House
adviser, he sees the travail of President Clinton as an event of
considerable moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failed impeachment of Andrew Johnson left a wounded,
weakened presidency, one that lasted for many years,'' Schlesinger
said, ``and I think the failed impeachment of Bill Clinton will do
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was imprudent to predict many months ago how the drama
would end, as it finally did Friday, to the relief of almost
everyone, it might be considered downright foolhardy to guess at
its consequences. But that does not stop Washington or
Washington-watchers elsewhere from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Few people doubt that the events of the last year have coarsened
the national political discourse. It is as if Clinton's own habit
of pushing the limits _ ``indulging all choices and accepting no
consequences,'' as Rep. James E. Rogan of California, one of the
House managers, put it last week _ infected the behavior of all the
major players.
</P>
<P>
   The capital has witnessed the breakdown of long-standing codes
of behavior on every side. Senior Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee accused their Republican counterparts of staging a coup
d'etat; Trent Lott, the leader of the Republican majority in the
Senate, strongly suggested that the president was bombing Iraq to
deflect attention from his domestic political problems. The conduct
of the independent counsel in the Lewinsky case, Kenneth W. Starr,
has attracted so much opprobrium that Congress is considering
allowing the Watergate-era law authorizing independent counsels to
lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the news media, a ravenous appetite for scandal has
developed. More salacious details about politicians have been
talked about and written about than at any time in modern history,
and the mainstream media have joined less well-established and more
marginal outlets in the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Monica and Bill and Ken and Henry has revulsed a
large portion of the American people, it has turned off foreigners,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A story with no heroes, no morals, no lessons,'' the Financial
Times of London called it last weekend, ``just self-obsessed
individuals in a fight for survival, a vast landscape painting of
life as it truly is in Washington at the turn of the millennium, a
Guernica of overfed egoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how permanent is the damage? Is the nation
witnessing merely an extreme example of Jefferson's maxim that ``no
man will ever bring out of the presidency the reputation that
carries him into it,'' or something much more substantial?
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Senate feel that the constitutional system worked in
the Clinton impeachment just as well as it had worked 25 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue that the House overstepped the line by
impeaching the president,'' said Sen. John S. McCain, R-Ariz., who
voted to convict Clinton on both articles. ``You can argue that we
should have removed him from office. But for me, the point is that
the process went forward the way the Framers intended. That
revalidates the Constitution and it means that whatever happens to
the reputation of individual presidents, the presidency remains
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who presided over the trial,
took leave of the Senate with compliments for the way it had
comported itself.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most ardent loyalists doubt that Clinton has besmirched
his reputation, more or less permanently. Even those who denounced
the whole impeachment process as a Republican vendetta denounced
the president's conduct in the next breath, using savage adjectives
like ``shameful,'' ``despicable'' and ``disgraceful.'' Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who fights his party's corner as hard
as any man, said this week: ``History will judge his actions and
significant lapses of judgment harshly, as it should.'' Statements
like that will make the revisionists' work harder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In a thousand books yet to be written, the word ``impeachment''
will cling to the name ``Clinton'' like a limpet. But there may be
other, kinder words as well. It may be that history will remember
Clinton as something more than the second president ever to stand
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon managed a partial rehabilitation of his name,
and he was driven from office, as Clinton was not. Through his
writings and the urgings of those who had worked for him, through
the success of some of his policies, Nixon came to be seen as an
intelligent, accomplished president brought low by tragic flaws.
That cheers Clinton's acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   The president's rehabilitation effort began Friday, and how well
it succeeds will depend in part on what he is able to achieve in
his remaining 23 months in office. Some signs are positive: the
collegial attitude of the new speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.;
Clinton's demonstrated ability to score at least limited successes
abroad, as in the Middle East, even when the going was toughest at
home; his continued high standing in the polls, and the astonishing
buoyancy of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the ominous polarization that has plagued Washington has
been intensified by the impeachment process. Clinton was impeached
by the House along party lines. Ten Republicans in the Senate
joined all the Democrats in voting to acquit him of perjury, and 5
voted to acquit him of obstruction of justice. But they were mostly
northeastern moderates who vote with the Democrats on important
policy issues fairly often, and not mainstream Republican
conservatives with no history of breaking party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's credibility has been severely damaged, which could
prove a serious handicap in future negotiations with Congress. Rep.
Tom DeLay of Texas said of the president a few weeks ago, ``I don't
believe a word he says.'' Democrats dismissed that as the ranting
of a Republican bomb-thrower. But it is not as easy to discount the
statement this week by Senator Richard G. Lugar, a level-headed
Republican from Indiana, who said during the final deliberations
earlier this week, ``He is not trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as predicted, Clinton mounts a campaign to punish the House
prosecutors at the polls next year, that will certainly do little
to advance his legislative agenda. And if, as his State of the
Union speech suggested, he veers away from his centrist,
smaller-government philosophy to reward the liberals who have stood
beside him, that could hurt him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another imponderable is Starr's follow-up to impeachment. If he
tries to indict Clinton before the president leaves office, that
would put a crimp in a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot harder to calculate how much the office, as opposed
to the man, has been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger looks to the 19th century and the example of Andrew
Johnson, and it is undeniable that he was followed by a succession
of second-rate presidents of both parties. The parade of
mediocrities lasted for three decades, until the election of
Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   But were the presidents of that day passive because Johnson's
impeachment had undercut the authority of the White House, or
because they and the American public saw little need for boldness
or innovation? It was an era, like the present one, when government
did not seem of major importance to the average citizen and much of
politics was mere shadow-boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, of course, problems built up, unaddressed if not
unidentified, notably the concentration of capital in the giant
trusts and the victimization of labor. But when President Roosevelt
_ it was he, remember, who first called the White House ``a bully
pulpit'' _ decided to confront those problems, he found ample
reservoirs of strength to do so in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Those like Sen. Baker who look to this century and the example
of Richard Nixon see a political system tough and resilient enough
to snap back quickly, even in a day of new media for whom little is
sacred and even in a day when fewer and fewer moderates find their
way to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, it is true, recovered even more quickly than
Nixon himself. Like Theodore Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, who took
office only six years after Nixon left it, found all the
presidential power he needed to impose lasting changes on American
politics and government, despite widespread earlier assertions that
Nixon had all but destroyed the office.
</P>
<P>
   But not even presidents with policies as popular as Reagan's and
Clinton's have been able to restore the reputation of the federal
government among American voters. Fewer and fewer pay attention to
what happens in Washington; fewer and fewer vote. Just the other
day, Curtis Gans, the leading student of the nation's voting
patterns, reported that the turnout for last year's midterm
elections had been the lowest in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism fuels that disturbing trend. Cynicism began growing in
the United States during the Vietnam war; it increased during
Watergate, and it may have reached a peak this year, with more than
half the public telling pollsters, the president lied under oath,
but leave him where he is.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical subtext of that dichotomy, what most Americans see
when they turn their eyes on Washington, is four words: ``They all
do it.''

HOW THE WEB CAN IMPROVE CORPORATE UNDERWRITING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal.)  (For Release Sunday, Feb. 14) 
(DW) 
 By   KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As E-commerce begins to plow its way through the retail sector,
and competes against shopping malls, so too is it starting to
challenge the established norms of corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   For years, raising money for debt and equity offerings has been
a hidebound _ and very profitable _ exercise for securities firms.
But the rise of the Internet now offers issuers and buyers at least
the potential to streamline the underwriting process.
</P>
<P>
   William R. Hambrecht, the longtime Silicon Valley investment
banker, has made a handsome living bankrolling the future. That
said, his decision to introduce an online auction system for
underwriting initial public stock offerings probably did not make
him many friends on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht, who now runs W.R. Hambrecht &UR;  &LR; &AMP; Co., an investment
banking boutique in San Francisco, took some time out from skiing
in Sun Valley, Idaho, last week to talk about E-underwriting. He
also offered some thoughts on the recent plunge in Internet
stocks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What made you think this sort of system is necessary?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Over the last few years, we did a few offerings that really
made me rethink the process and wonder if we were doing it right.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was for Boston Beer, the company that makes Samuel
Adams. Jim Koch, the head of Boston Beer, insisted that one-third
of the offering be sold to his customers. So he put a label
announcing the sale on his beer bottles. Within three weeks we had
orders from 120,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   After the offering was over, the company's chief financial
officer agreed to track what happened to those people. Two and a
half years later, half of those folks still owned the stock. I came
away from that experience thinking that people who had a real
natural affinity for the company were there.
</P>
<P>
   The other lesson I learned was that conventional investment
firms were not set up to handle that sort of volume. The more I
worked with the Net, it convinced me it was a great tool to
communicate. So I wanted to try to set up a system whereby the
Internet could communicate with affinity groups for companies and
do it in an efficient way. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You seem to believe that a Dutch auction system, where the
offering price is set by the underwriter at the highest price at
which it can sell all the shares, will help prevent volatility. How
will it do that? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The reason the Dutch auction will work is that it clears the
inventory all at once and doesn't make any buyer who bids
aggressively look dumb. The system will try to move the offering
price closer to the market level, and in so doing discourage day
traders. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If this auction system caught on, wouldn't it change the
economics of underwriting?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It will pare underwriting margins. But this is happening to
every distribution channel via the Internet. To be honest, the real
economics to the underwriter that will change are the trading
commissions that come back from preferential accounts. If you give
10 percent of an offering to a good client, he is generally a
pretty happy client. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What has been the reaction on Wall Street to this idea? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Initially, most of the people I respect on Wall Street have
reacted by asking, ``Why are you doing this to us?'' But most
understand something like this is going to happen, and they are
asking how they can work with us on this, because it is a more
efficient way to do it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Speaking of efficiency, is that the way you would
characterize the manner in which investors have repriced a lot of
Internet stocks over the past month? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Internet stocks got way ahead of themselves. The Lycos-USA
Networks deal reminded people that in the real world, market caps
have to have some relationship to future value. To me, what has
been going on is a very good thing, because a real price collapse
could be very destructive, particularly in the initial public
offering market. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Most of these companies are still not making any money. Is it
getting any easier to identify who the survivors will be? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Each month gives you more data as to who is getting there.
You can see the numbers of people using the system, the quality of
advertisers. The E-commerce numbers are starting to show some
things. Over the next year we should get a better idea. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. All of this interest in the Internet is coming at a time when
the economy is still growing at a vigorous rate. What happens to
these companies when it weakens? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My theory about software companies, and I think it will hold
for Internet companies, is that there is not a lot of risk to them
in cyclical turns in the economy. These companies don't have their
capital tied up in fixed inventories; they have it tied up in cash.
Yahoo, for example, has something like 700 employees and no fixed
assets. They should be able to adjust to almost anything.

BLONDES AND REDHEADS CAN HAVE MORE FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's no dumb blonde joke. Hair stylist to the
stars Frederic Fekkai really has a new shampoo just for blondes who
want to get their highlights shining as bright as possible. It's
called Baby Blonde, has lots of chamomile _ which he calls nature's
own hair brightener _ and works on natural or chemically enhanced
hair. The shampoo is $18.50 at his Beverly Hills salon, as well as
Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus stores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you've got red hair, listen up. There's a new catalog
called Just for Redheads, filled with hair-care products and
cosmetics (including mascara in five shades of red). To get a copy,
call (800) 831-8240.
</P>
<P>
   For really red hair, brush on Red Corvette or Hot Chili from the
nifty new Fudge Paintbox Home Kit. Each kit contains three tubes of
color and a brush to apply to virgin or prebleached hair, priced at
$19.95 at upscale hair salons, including Jim Wayne's and Umberto's
in Beverly Hills. For other locales, call (888) 383-4387.
</P>
<P>
   YAKKETY-YAK: Telephone chats have become a major pastime since
the invention of take-and-talk-anywhere cell phone. Not only are
folks having arguments with their spouses and reprimanding their
kids in the most public of places, but there's a lot of buzz over
which models are the most cell-chic.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the super-tiny model. It's so five minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Crayola-colored models (red is hot) to match your
ensemble, and the sleek black Samsung SCH-2000 Voice-Dialing Phone.
The latter is ultra-small, flips open and allows you to reach a
caller by saying their name into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Samsung's nifty voice-activated speed-dialing feature lets
you automatically dial up to 20 numbers by simply calling out a
name. For instance, you can ring up your boss by saying, ``the
jerk'' or some other endearment. It's also handy for names you need
but can't remember, like ``dog groomer'' or ``plumber,'' and allows
you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. The phone, at $149,
is available through Sprint. For more details, call (888) 987-4357.
</P>
<P>
   WIPE ON A TAN: Folks in Omaha or Duluth probably don't care
about maintaining their tan in February, but in la-la land it's as
important as having the latest designer sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's been a tad gloomy of late, so you may want to keep up
that sun-kissed look with a self-tanning product, like Clarins
Self-Tanning Milk, which requires you to get naked, exfoliate your
skin and stand around while the milk turns to tan. Or, if you're in
a hurry and just want your face to have glow, pull out a TanTowel,
a new product developed in Australia by the Darian Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tiny towelette dipped in clear self-tanning,
lemon-scented liquid that absorbs quickly and tans your face within
three hours. TanTowels, at $2 a packet, are available at Fred Segal
and other boutiques around town. For more information, call (888)
826-8695.

TEXAS SENATORS VOTE TO CONVICT PRESIDENT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two Republican senators from Texas _ Phil Gramm
and Kay Bailey Hutchison _ voted Friday to convict President
Clinton and remove him from office, though they ended up on the
losing side in the votes on the two impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   In closed-door Senate deliberations prior to the verdict votes,
Gramm and Hutchison said that presentations by 13 House managers
had convinced them Clinton was guilty of obstruction of justice and
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, in a two-page statement delivered during deliberations,
declared that Clinton was guilty ``beyond doubt, beyond a shadow of
a doubt, and he is guilty for one reason only: because he committed
the acts he is accused of.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said he strived for objectivity during the often partisan
five-week long trial by asking himself whether he would vote to
convict Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan or George Bush if they
were accused of the same crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is a sad but firm yes,'' said Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said the case for conviction and removal from office
was ``compelling,'' adding that Clinton ``lied outright to the
American people, to his close associates and to his Cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An enduring image of this whole tale will be his
finger-pointing lie to the American people,'' Hutchison said in a
four-page statement she delivered during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Senators shot down the obstruction of justice impeachment
article by a vote of 50-50, falling far short of the two-thirds _
or 67 votes _ required for conviction. Lawmakers also rejected the
charge of perjury by a 55-45 vote, as 10 Republicans broke ranks
and joined Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   During deliberations, all 100 senators were allowed to make a
single 15-minute presentation to colleagues during the closed-door
deliberations that began Tuesday. Hutchison and Gramm spoke on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the transcript of the deliberations was secret, some
senators released their remarks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly lied in ``a pattern of misconduct that was
consistent from beginning to end,'' said Gramm, adding that the
president ``used the power and influence of his office to obstruct
justice and to deny an ordinary citizen her constitutional
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   That ordinary citizen, Paula Jones, launched the proceedings
that culminated in Friday's acquittal when she brought a sexual
harassment lawsuit against Clinton. Clinton's sexual affair with
White House intern Monica Lewinsky was uncovered by Jones' lawyers.
The perjury and obstruction charges against the president involve
his attempts to conceal the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined numerous opportunities to head off the
investigation that erupted around him over the last year, Hutchison
said, asserting that ``at virtually every opportunity ... he chose
an action that further prolonged the matter and led directly to his
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison attacked Clinton's defenders for engaging in what she
said was moral relativism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asked not to judge his treatment of one woman or two
women but to evaluate his policies that affect all women,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison asked: ``Would the president's defenders forgive a
school teacher who molests a student simply because the teachers's
classes are popular and his students all go on to college?''

CHRISTIANS' MISSION IS TO MINISTER TO MARDI GRAS REVELERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mardi Gras is traditionally the last day of revelry before
repenting and recognizing one's mortality on Ash Wednesday, the
first day of 40 days of Lent leading up to Easter.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Vieux Carre (pronounced Voo Caray) Baptist Church _
located next to a bar in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter _
it's a day to rope in sinners.
</P>
<P>
   While feathered ladies are parading down New Orleans' Bourbon
Street and through other parts of the French Quarter, the Rev.
Randy Brown's church members and their visitors will be praying
with people and handing out tracts on ``How to Get to Heaven from
New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people here from all over the country staying in our
church who will be out on the streets preaching the gospel during
Mardi Gras,'' said Brown, 37. ``It's amazing how the Lord will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the church workers get beer spilled on them. They've
even been spat upon. But usually, they get a polite hearing from
the merrymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Christians carry wooden crosses to symbolize their
faith. More than 100 visitors came in Thursday from churches in
Texas, Illinois, Iowa and many other states. They will sleep in
shifts at the 2-story church, which has a few bunk beds. Most will
sleep on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly see plenty of sin going on,'' Brown said. ``We
stay out all night witnessing and sleep during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to sleep in the church at night, anyway,
he said, because the Gold Mine bar next door has music playing
until 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   One man from Tennessee comes each year and considers it his
calling to cook food for the visiting Christians, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a kitchen, and he always has a pot of soup or a pot of
beans going,'' the minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man from Chicago tries to helps drunken revelers who
become disabled on the streets. He either escorts them to their
hotel rooms or brings them back to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Brown mingles with the crowds that are shoulder-to-shoulder on
Bourbon Street. Many celebrators profess Christianity. Others
resent the intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man became angry and told me, `Can't you see these people
are trying to have a good time?' '' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The evangelizing on Mardi Gras isn't new. And it is happening at
other Mardi Gras celebrations, including those in Mobile, Ala., and
Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Human of Euless, a lay evangelist who operates the ``Jesus
Service Station'' for Fort Worth's homeless each Christmas, has
been doing street ministry at Mardi Gras celebrations for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what happens down there in New Orleans,'' said
Human, a member of Glenview Baptist Church in Haltom City. He first
did street preaching as a staff member for the Rev. Arthur Blessit,
who is known for carrying a 12-foot cross throughout the nation and
into many foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Human will travel to Mobile for six days during that
city's Mardi Gras celebration. He will be working with Blessit's
son, Joshua Blessit.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that the visiting Christians see some shocking
sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them if they see a crowd of people gathered around a
balcony, they should try to avoid that,'' he said, because it's
usually a place where a woman is exposing her breasts to get Mardi
Gras beads.
</P>
<P>
   How many heed his warning is not known.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has seen just about everything during his four years of
street preaching during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pray that God will protect your eyes,'' he said.

ARAFAT REVIVES IDEA OF PALESTINIAN-JORDANIAN CONFEDERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In what seemed a message to the new King of Jordan,
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said Friday that he still
favored the creation of a confederation between the future
Palestinian state and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a rally in the West Bank city of Hebron, Arafat
revived the idea, which is more than a decade old, of a
Palestinian-Jordanian federation, as if to remind the new king,
Abdullah, of promises his father, the late King Hussein, once made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to know that the Palestinian National Council has
agreed to a confederation with Jordan,'' Arafat said, referring to
Abdullah, who assumed the throne on his father's death last Sunday.
``We are, after all, twin brothers, Palestine and Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization have long
fought over who should represent the Palestinians who lived on the
West Bank of the Jordan River. Israel captured the land from Jordan
in the 1967 Middle East war, but it took Hussein another 21 years
to formally renounce his claim on the land and cede Jordan's rights
to the PLO. With that concession, the king agreed to the idea of a
confederation, in order to retain a foothold in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But after right-wing Israelis enthusiastically latched on to the
idea, preferring the Jordanian monarchy to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Jordanian and Palestinian enthusiasm ebbed. Also, the
Jordanians _ who had sketched plans for an Amman-based federation
with two prime ministers, two parliaments and one currency, the
Jordanian dinar _ began to fear the idea of sharing a federal
entity in which the Palestinians would outnumber them by a great
majority.
</P>
<P>
   And, after the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement was signed,
Hussein was keen on retaining an independent place at the table
during the final status negotiations over borders, refugees and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In resuscitating the idea Friday, at the end of a week that
began with Hussein's funeral, Arafat took the Jordanians _ and some
of his own advisers _ by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian government released a statement, broadcast on
Israeli radio, saying that the subject would have to await further
discussion ``until after the end of the occupation.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they are a sovereign country, we could sit down and have
a conversation about unity,'' said Abdullah Hassanat, editor of the
government-controlled Jordan Times. ``A confederation in the future
would be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking official in Arafat's Fatah party agreed. ``It
should come after independence,'' the official, Hani Al-Hasan,
said. ``It is the natural thing and the will of the people on both
banks of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians believed Arafat was aiming his remarks partly
at the Hebronites in his audience, who are believed to identify
keenly with the Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jordanian analysts said they believed Arafat was really
aiming his remarks at Israel. They said they thought he was looking
to capitalize on the great feeling toward Jordan that Israelis
showed over the last week, when they grieved for Hussein. They said
he may have wanted to signal to the Israelis that the Jordanians
they so trusted would be involved in the future Palestinian state
that many so dread.
</P>
<P>
   If so, a spokesman for the present government did not sound
assuaged. ``A confederation itself does not remove danger of a
Palestinian state declared unilaterally, which could raise a large
army and forge alliances with countries like Iraq, Syria and Iran
and control Israel's airspace and water resources,'' said David
Bar-Illan, the spokesman.

GOWNS SEEN ROUND THE WORLD ON OSCAR NIGHT, ON SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal.)   (For Release Sunday, Feb. 14)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID COLMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York hostess who would rather die than wear an
evening gown that has been seen on another woman will want to avoid
Christie's on March 18. That night, 54 vintage dresses will be up
for auction _ not just simple second-hand numbers, but ones that
have been paraded before the entire world by attendees of the
Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone else, the dresses in the New York auction of
``Unforgettable: Fashion of the Oscars'' represent some of the
century's most memorable and historic _ not to say histrionic _
fashion moments. They are a testament to the supporting role
fashion has played through the years in Hollywood, and the starring
role it increasingly plays today.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the gowns are on view this week in the Madison Avenue
windows of Barneys New York, including the violet silk chiffon
Prada dress worn by Uma Thurman to the 1994 awards, which caused
enough of a stir (and enough ink for Prada) to set off a stampede
of designers eager to outfit stars. Only a year later, Sharon
Stone, reportedly angered by leaks to the press about her planned
gown, outfoxed (and outshone) everyone by marrying a Valentino
skirt and an Armani coat with a humble Gap T-shirt. That ensemble
will also be auctioned, as will Kate Winslet's sea-green gown from
last year, designed by Alexander McQueen for Givenchy, and the
dresses in which Anjelica Huston, Emma Thompson and Frances
McDormand accepted their Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the auction is likely to be Elizabeth Taylor's
periwinkle colored decollete dress from the 1969 Oscars, said Nancy
Valentino, a vice president for marketing and a Hollywood
memorabilia specialist at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The dress was cunningly contrived by the Hollywood costume
designer Edith Head to showcase four of Ms. Taylor's assets: her
eyes, her bosom, the enormous 69.42-carat diamond dangling from her
neck and its donor, her husband Richard Burton, who was attached to
her arm. Since Ms. Head's work is highly collectible, Ms. Valentino
said, the Taylor dress is the favorite to break the
clothing-at-auction record _ $222,500 for a blue velvet dress from
the collection of Diana, Princess of Wales, sold in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Diana auction that inspired this one, which may well
outstrip the attention drawn to any previous auction of celebrity
memorabilia, a trend that began with a bang several years ago with
the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Richardson, the actress, read and heard about the Diana
auction and came up with the idea for Fashions of the Oscars, which
will benefit the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me think of all the dresses that the great actresses
wear to these events, that were now all sitting in a closet,'' Ms.
Richardson said. ``And I thought it could make a lot of money for
AIDS.'' Her father, the director Tony Richardson, died as a result
of AIDS in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining the dresses, which she did by writing to fellow
actresses, turned out to be harder than she had expected.
``Sometimes I would get an immediate response,'' she recalled.
``Emma Thompson was the first. She did it by return fax, saying
`Absolutely, any dresses you want, the shoes, the bags,
everything.' But with some it was quite difficult, going through a
sea of publicists and agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, joined Ms.
Richardson in helping to plan the auction and its $40 catalog,
which sold a 1,000 copies in eight minutes when Ms. Valentino
introduced it on the Home Shopping Network last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an obvious event for Vogue to support, and I hadn't
been doing as much for AIDS as I'd like to,'' Ms. Wintour said.
</P>
<P>
   In tacit recognition of the growing public fascination with
who's wearing what at the Oscars, ABC, which broadcasts them, will
present a more formal pre-show program than in the past, with Geena
Davis, the night of the ceremony, March 21. Executives of ABC and
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which is helping
produce the show, hope to compete with the popular pre-Oscar
commentary that Joan Rivers has done for three years on E!
Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's show will feature interviews with arriving celebrities out
front and backstage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. It is one
thing for Ms. Rivers to chew up the arrivals with her biting
comments about how they look; it is something else for the Academy
to produce a special focusing, at least in part, on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a very sharp eye to see that part of the
public's enjoyment of the Oscars has to do with fashion,'' said
Rick Robertson, the Academy's executive administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Mizrahi, who has dressed many Oscar attendees, said, ``We
don't have royalty in America, so this is the closest thing we get
to a coronation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to so many actresses while measuring them, and
it's always like talking to a bride,'' he added. ``You almost want
to sedate them so they'll hold still, but they stand there saying,
`This is the one time in my life. . . .'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wintour said that there appeared to be ``bottomless
interest'' in celebrities and their wardrobes. ``Possibly, there
will come along a new generation of actresses who are young and
rebellious and don't care about fashion,'' she said. ``But right
now, I think everyone's having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction's catalog documents the peaks and valleys of fashion
consciousness in Hollywood. The height of glamour embodied by Ms.
Taylor's gown from the 1960s was followed by an era of
anti-glamour, as feminism gained influence. That moment was
represented by the ivory crepe suit worn by Sally Field to accept
an Oscar for ``Norma Rae'' in 1979. In the post-feminist 90s,
glamour has returned, though generally as perfect, don't-touch
chic, the message of Ms. Stone's and Ms. Thurman's outfits.
</P>
<P>
   One good thing about the current era, from the actresses'
viewpoint, is that they have so many designers and stylists vying
to dress them. ``If most actresses had to buy a new dress every
time they went out, we'd all be broke,'' Ms. Richardson said.

BALMY DAYS AND DAFFODILS DON'T MEAN SPRING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a glorious, unseasonably warm day in late January, the
apricot trees opened their buds. You would think they would learn.
Three days later, a north wind whipped through with a sub-freezing
blast and blackened every petal.
</P>
<P>
   Early spring is the time of anticipation, and the garden is no
less susceptible than the gardener. At a friend's house in northern
Michigan in early February, the daffodils were already three inches
out of the ground and the Shasta daisies were sprouting new
greenery.
</P>
<P>
   In my south-central Pennsylvania garden, the azaleas are
budding. The lawn is likely to need mowing before the mower blades
have been sharpened. I am already fingering the packets of tomato
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The groundhog has spoken _ winter is over, spring is at hand.
Surely nature, in its wisdom, is telling me the same thing through
the language of swollen buds and blooming crocuses. Spring will be
early, and I must be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Then I remember those apricots, and am reminded that I've been
suckered before.
</P>
<P>
   On a 60-degree day in February, when the days are lengthening
noticeably and there is still light enough at 6 p.m. to stroll
through the perennial gardens in a light sweater, it's easy to skip
mentally over the entire month of March.
</P>
<P>
   I have a yen to plant pea seeds. But a tentative hand in the
soil comes back aching from the cold and wet. Too soon. The seeds
would rot before sprouting. Better to wait for a more reliable
sign: when the garden shows the first flush of pale green lamb's
quarter seedlings, the soil is warm enough for peas.
</P>
<P>
   There is no point in being impressed by the eagerness of
dandelions and chickweed. They are capable of blooming all year,
and the loss of a few flowers in February is of no consequence to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are tulips and daffodils good indicators of spring's onset.
They don't care that the foliage they throw up with abandon now
will be tattered by a late-winter sleet storm. In almost all years,
the flowers will be as beautiful as ever, and only the persnickety
gardener frets over the leaves' appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Apricots are all but useless in gauging the season. The trees
have but one bloom period each year _ one chance to be pollinated
and set fruit. In my climate, they squander that chance four years
out of five, succumbing to the temptation of a few balmy days in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that apricots have a low chill requirement. They
are primed to bloom after experiencing only a few short weeks of
winter cold. As soon as the requisite number of cold days are past,
buds will begin to form after the first good warm spell. I've seen
them start to swell in early December.
</P>
<P>
   In its native Siberia, this is no disadvantage for the apricot.
When the weather finally breaks in Siberia, it generally means
business. Because the season to grow and be fruitful is brief when
it finally arrives, apricots have adapted to bloom quickly and
ripen their fruit in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Most gardeners, it seems, have also adapted to a low chill
requirement. A few weeks of winter suffices for a seasonal break. A
few more weeks huddled with seed catalogs gets the sap moving, and
the first sunny morning with a bird chirping outside is an
imperative to get on with it.
</P>
<P>
   But chirping birds aren't good indicators of spring, either. The
ones singing in February have been around all winter, and they're
just letting the world know how pleased they are not to be freezing
their tail feathers off. Gardeners hereabouts wait for the barn
swallows to return before they do any serious planting, and even
that is not a sure-fire indicator. The best method is to wait until
after the usual last frost date for your area.
</P>
<P>
   There will be time, and there will be time. The apricot is
incapable of remembering from one year to the next what happens
when it opens its flowers too early. Washington's famous flowering
cherry trees have the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival have learned
that the vagaries of spring do not mesh well with the logistics of
a festival, so they carry on without much regard for the trees,
which sometimes cooperate and sometimes do not.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners, blessed with cognitive powers, are supposed to learn
that tomatoes started too early will grow lanky on the windowsill,
forlornly waiting for the warm weather that seemed so close in
February. If seeds must be started now, let them be of leeks,
onions and parsley, which are slow to sprout and will tolerate the
frosts still to come after they are ready to be planted in the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   If esthetics require that the tulip foliage be unblemished, let
the gardener use that early-spring energy to cover the emerging
leaves with some loose mulch or a scrap of polyester row cover. If
the urge to plant cannot be squelched, then buy some pansies or
snapdragons and plant them outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   They will revel in the chill and are quite capable of surviving
even under a blanket of snow.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of advanced gardening wisdom is the ability to resist the
temptation to do anything at all, except maybe prune the apples and
clear away a bit of brush. This may run counter to primeval
instinct, but it has its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The gardener who eschews an early start to the season will have
time in January to admire the short-lived, fragrant clouds of
blossoms on those foolish apricots.

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential sex-and-lies scandal that blew
through the nation's capital over the past year left few
institutions or politicians untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the wreckage of the sometimes sordid, sometimes tedious
events, a few players emerged stronger, while others struggled to
survive, and some stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who clearly had the most to lose, managed to
weather the storm swirling around his presidency but not without
sustaining severe damage.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the impeachment, the president has maintained
sky-high public approval ratings, as voters cast a critical eye at
his Republican accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations about his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky not only cost him a year's worth of
legislative accomplishments but may permanently blemish his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has survived, but he is no winner,'' said Mark
Rozell, a political science professor at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, on the other hand, landed on
top as a result of the manner in which she handled her husband's
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Once castigated as a polarizing, power-hungry spouse, the first
lady now has won over much of the public. Indeed, so popular is
Hillary Clinton she is now being urged to run for an open Senate
seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, who were jittery when the Lewinsky
matter first broke, not only survived the scandal but now score
better than their Republican colleagues with voters on a host of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that credit goes to their leaders, House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., who kept their members unified through the process.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, found that pursuing the president proved
to be more of a burden than a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Their top casualty was former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,R-Ga.,
who resigned after the party's poor showing in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   His intended successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., also fell by
the wayside as a result of pornography publisher Larry Flynt's
probe into his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, on the other hand, commanded unprecedented attention from
the mainstream press and politicians as he threatened more
revelations about Republican affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Another beneficiary of Livingston's misfortune was Rep. Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., a relatively unknown former wrestling coach who
was catapulted into the top House job.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope that the amiable demeanor of the new House
Speaker will mend the wounds from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The man who aggressively led the impeachment effort, Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., did not lose his job but his
reputation as the fair and wise old sage of the House took a
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13-member House prosecution team, Rep. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., and Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., managed to raise their
national profile and earned praise, even from Democrats, for their
folksy yet pointed presentations.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the House Judiciary Committe member
from Houston, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, made the most of her role in
the impeachment proceedings. Jackson Lee may not have equaled the
eloquence of the woman who once held her seat, Barbara Jordan, but
she was a regular on the talk show circuit, where she vigorously
defended the president.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, also saw his status rise
as a vociferous critic of the president. But DeLay,who was key in
marshalling support for Clinton's impeachment, may have been singed
by taking such a visible role. He has replaced Gingrich as the
Democrats' top enemy and has been forced to defend himself against
charges that he, like the president, may have been misleading in a
court proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Another Texas Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison took a more
conciliatory tact and won plaudits as she worked with Democrats in
an unsuccessful effort to open up closed portions of the Senate
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' senior Republican senator, Phil Gramm, teased colleagues
that he was seeking a gentler reputation when he conceived a way to
begin the trial in consultation with liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy,
D-Mass, although he later joined fellow conservatives in trying to
block Democratic initiatives, including a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers who argued before the Senate generally
won high marks from experts for their meticulously argued defense.
One was Cheryl Mills, the 33-year-old deputy White House counsel,
who held senators spellbound with her defense of her boss.
</P>
<P>
   As for Paula Jones, who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton that indirectly sparked the impeachment probe, she
finally extracted $800,000 in a settlement with Clinton, but she
now must deal with former lawyers who are demanding a large chunk
of that money.
</P>
<P>
   One likely casualty of the yearlong saga is the Independent
Counsel Law, which gave prosecutor Kenneth Starr wide latitude to
pursue the sex-and-lies case.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and Republicans believe the law, up for renewal
this year, needs radical revision to reign in overly aggressive
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, although he has won his share of court battles against
the Clinton administration, ranks in public polls as one of the
most unpopular figures in Washington as a result of his relentless
pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest losers in the scandal may be the media,
including the 24-hour news cable talk shows, which peddled the
scandal story relentlessly. Critics have faulted the media for
relying to much on anonymous sources, airing unsubstantiated rumors
and substituting opinion for fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of the media are concerned about commenting on
information rather than gathering it,'' said Tom Rosentiel,
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.

SENDING THE VERY BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK DECARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cupid has been going to the gym. A lot. In the latest ad for
Hallmark Cards, the chubby little cherub with the wings and the
bow-and-arrow set has grown into a blond hunk with no body fat and
a crown tattoo on his bulging biceps. Having shortened Valentine's
Day into the more masculine moniker of V-Day, Hallmark has recast
the infant god of love as a grown-up guardian of good loving.
``Fight Heartache!'' this muscled arrow-slinger says, all
testosterone, feathers and big-smile wholesomeness. It's enough to
make some people quiver.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Leo Burnett USA Chicago as part of a multimedia
campaign running nationally through Sunday's holiday, the ads use
World War II-era ideas of manliness to sell Valentine greetings.
Television spots are shot in black-and-white for a 1940s feel. But
it is the contemporary-looking stud muffin in the illustrated print
ad on the sides of buses and the back of last week's TV Guide that
caused the commotion. The ad was named Image of the Week by
Advertising Age in its Feb. 8 issue. And free postcards of the
buffed Cupid, given away in those take-a-dozen card racks in
upscale restaurants, are all but gone around the city. ``Everyone
is talking about it,'' said Michelle Buckley, the self-described
``Valentine's Day spokesperson'' for Hallmark. ``Men love it. Women
love it. Kids love it. It's so today and with-it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can argue with her when so many mythical characters are
being made over these days? Wander through a Warner Brothers Studio
Store, for instance, and take a look at the DC Comics merchandise.
Superman's abs are more super than ever. The Flash now has thighs
as big as tree trunks. And while Aquaman may have lost a forearm
since we were kids _ he wears a hook now _ he has gained more
muscle mass in recent years than Schwarzenegger in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   These super-duper heroes are a far cry from the crime-fighters
portrayed by George Reeves, television's Superman in the '50s, and
John Wesley Shipp, who played the Flash in 1990. This new Aquaman
looks more like Ariel's strong-finned father in ``The Little
Mermaid'' than Patrick Duffy's skinny 1977 ``Man From Atlantis.''
These superhumans really are.
</P>
<P>
   More startling, however, is the makeover a certain man in red
got last Christmas. An animated advertisement for a local
electronics chain portrayed St. Nick as a superhero with a body
more Stone Cold Steve Austin than North Pole Kris Kringle.
Concurrently, an advertisement for a health club chain suggested
Santa Claus needed to shape up if he was going to ship out all
those toys. The man has been portrayed as a cute fat guy in red
velvet and fur since the 19th century, but for the 21st century he
apparently needs to take steroids and look good in Lycra.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Bacchus will be hawking Slim-Fast.
</P>
<P>
   While undoubtedly provocative, these mythical makeovers elicit
mixed feelings _ titillation but with an underlying discomfort.
``We're living in a time when you can use male bodies as an overt
selling tool,'' said Donald F. Reuter, the author of ``Heartthrob:
A Hundred Years of Beautiful Men,'' a scrapbook of male archetypes
published last year by Universe Publishing. ``It's very current to
take an icon and mature it. A fat little baby-type roly-poly
cherub? Who is that going to attract? This is still the messenger
of love; he's just a little older and cuter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reuter also says there are limits. ``When I saw Santa Claus
with muscles, a waistline and a crotch, that was kind of freaky,''
he admitted. ``That's putting sex into a character who had no
sexuality at all, unless you are a chubby-chaser.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Truly, when even fictional characters need real muscles to be
appealing, some of us lose sleep rather than lose weight. The other
night while watching ``Fosse,'' the stylish celebration on Broadway
of Bob Fosse's choreography, I was struck not only by the sensual
gyrations of the dancers, but also by the rock-hard perfection of
their bodies _ the sculptured arms, the six-pack stomachs, the
pumped-up rumps of the men as well as the women. Sitting there
munching a box of Dots, I tried to remember the afternoon 21 years
ago when, at 16, I took the bus to see ``Dancin','' the
``dance-ical'' that is the stylistic ancestor of this current Fosse
musical.
</P>
<P>
   Those bodies, as beautiful as they were back then, didn't look
anything like the ones now on display at the Broadhurst Theater. We
have raised the bar of physical perfection so very high.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the original ``Star Trek'' episodes currently being run on
the Sci-Fi Channel for proof. William Shatner was considered so
sexy in 1966 that the pioneering space opera wasted no opportunity
to show Capt. James T. Kirk shirtless. Seen today on those shows,
he looks like the Poppin' Fresh Doughboy.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful body is a wonderful thing _ there's no denying that.
And the benefits of exercise are myriad. When I'm feeling
particularly fat, I just leave Manhattan. After a weekend in the
suburbs, where even the good-looking men look like Drew Carey, I
feel 20 pounds lighter. But a gym-rat Cupid and a super Santa?
Hasn't the cult of the body beautiful gotten a little out of hand?

LESSON OF IMPEACHMENT: PERSONAL BEHAVIOR ISN'T A PROPER TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political and legal scholars say the impeachment
trial of President Clinton will be remembered for drawing a hard
line between the personal and political behavior of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   They also gave this advice for future would-be impeachment
advocates: Only impeach if the official abused the office or
mishandled power.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, one of five Republican senators
to vote for acquittal on both the perjury and obstruction of
justice charges, echoed that concept when she said Clinton's
misconduct didn't represent such ``an egregious and immediate
threat to the very structure of our government'' that would justify
his removal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who also opposed conviction, said he
was ``unconvinced that impeachment is the best course to vindicate
the rule of law on this offensive conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats who were critical of Clinton's conduct but who
voted to acquit him voiced similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., who strongly criticized Clinton
last fall on the Senate floor, said his job was not to ``judge the
rightness or wrongness of the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky'' but to decide if his behavior is a ``threat to our
government, our people and our national interest.'' Like all 45
Democrats, Lieberman voted to acquit Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in
an attempt to hide his relationship with Lewinsky from lawyers for
Paula Jones, who had sued the president for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Cass Sunstein, an expert on impeachments at the University of
Chicago Law School, said the greatest lesson to be learned from
Clinton's trial is that impeachment is for ``political crimes not
personal ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton did was personally horrible, possibly a crime,
but did he abuse the power of his office, did he directly attempt
to use being the president to undermine an opponent or illegally
push his policies or to commit that crime?'' asked Sunstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is no, and that's why impeachment failed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunstein said the founding fathers intended impeachment to be
used for ``blatant'' abuses of office, not as a ``political
weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want it used to get rid of presidents that the
majority party simply didn't like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Freedman, a law professor at Hofstra University in
Hempstead, N.Y., said Clinton's trial shows that impeachment was
the wrong tool for addressing the president's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a crime, it was a regular, every-day crime, not a
crime intended to subvert the government, and as such, it should be
handled in a regular court, not the U.S. Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe echoed this idea Friday, saying, ``The president's
wrongdoing can and should be effectively addressed by the criminal
justice system rather than removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Freedman argued that the law should allow for sitting
presidents to be indicted and tried while in office in order to
ensure that presidents are not given carte blanche to commit crimes
while in office.
</P>
<P>
   If a president were found guilty, Congress could then decide
whether the crime undermines his or her ability to govern, Freedman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Katy Harriger, a political science professor at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C., cautioned that future presidents
and members of Congress should not conclude from this trial that
perjury and obstruction of justice are not impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are still very serious crimes, and if they are committed
in relation to some abuse of office, you can bet that president
would probably be impeached,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman agreed that perjury and obstruction of justice remain
serious offenses, adding that the booming economy would not have
saved Clinton if his crimes had been seen as a ``threat'' to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep saying, `Well, the country let him get away with
it because unemployment is low,''' he said. ``But that view doesn't
give Americans the credit they deserve for being able to understand
the difference between personal crimes and political crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown
University in Washington, said the Clinton case has reminded
Congress that impeachment should be used only when it has the
support of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is the nuclear weapon of politics, and for that
reason, the American public is very wary of either party using
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch said House Republicans should not have sent the articles
of impeachment to the Senate when they knew the articles would not
pass. ``They were bucking the will of the people, which is not what
the founding fathers had in mind and which doomed them from the
start,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., alluded to that lack of public
support in explaining on Friday why he voted against the articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has shaken me that we stood on the brink of removing the
president not because of a popular groundswell to remove him ...
but because a small group of people who hate Bill Clinton almost
succeeded in undoing him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton was acquitted of the charges, constitutional
scholars say the presidency has not escaped unharmed from the year
of legal fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman said Clinton's failed attempts to use privilege claims
to block Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation have
weakened the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``His frivolous claims that what he and his aides were talking
about was `national security' will result in skepticism toward
every future president who uses the privilege responsibly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Without a doubt, Clinton has severely hurt the aura
of respectability and trust that used to surround the presidency.''

 (For Release Sunday, Feb. 14)  
(DW) 
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The client, a writer, 32, with a shock of curly hair
and a hound-dog look, had been on a romantic road that he described
as rocky at best. ``More like craters on the moon,'' he said,
settling into a chair across from Madalyn Aslan, a blonde with a
dewy complexion and a smile that seemed to say she understood
completely. ``Just tell me, will the woman I'm chasing these days
let herself be caught?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aslan, 30, who has been called one of New York's most
fashionable psychics by W magazine, took his hands in hers with the
gently practiced air of a surgeon. She turned his palms upward and
began to knead them, hard, with her thumbs, as though trying to
push something to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this line here tells me you aren't very patient,'' Ms.
Aslan said, chiding her client (who did not want to be identified,
to protect his romantic opportunities) in a soft, smoky voice.
``That works against you. But are you willing to be romantic, to do
`the thing?''' Though it was his first visit, he seemed to
understand that Ms. Aslan was referring to the kinds of grand
gestures and declarations that would make a woman swoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. I'm definitely willing to do `the thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I have a good feeling about it,'' Ms. Aslan said,
exhaling as if in relief. ``And don't worry, if it's not her, then
there will be someone else. Immediately. I'm even getting a date,
March 1. By then, all of the tension lifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes, a dozen tarot cards and a scan of his
astrological chart later, the writer emerged from his first visit a
happy man.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aslan, however, was drained. This is the busy season for
psychics, especially Ms. Aslan, whose specialty is maladies of the
heart. ``Valentine's Day brings people out of the bushes,'' she
said with a concerned sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aslan is a reluctant love psychic. Like a slightly tired
young mother, she indulges the romantic obsessions of her
high-powered clients, who often seem to have all their houses in
order except the love shack. Her Rolodex is a virtual directory of
downtown's literary and cultural elite, from Uma Thurman to Kate
White, editor of Cosmopolitan, but few steer a session toward work
and career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I try to get them to focus on that, but the more
powerful they are, the more they want to talk about finding their
soul mate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Ms. Aslan's clientele was entirely women,
but now nearly 40 percent of those who come for a consultation are
men, mostly young successful professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are even more interested in finding out about
relationships than women are,'' she said. ``They really don't want
to talk about work at all. They just want to know if they're going
to find the person who really changes their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aslan, whose psychic readings have been auctioned at
Christie's and who has done palmistry at fund-raisers from the
Guggenheim Museum to the Union League, does private readings from
an elegant apartment for $150 to $200 an hour. On Saturday
afternoons and Thursday mornings, she gives briefer readings at a
small table in the tearoom at Felissimo, the Japanese-style
department store on 56th Street, for $18. Her forte is palmistry.
``I think the hands are the most immediate channel to the soul,''
she said. ``They change hour to hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say her predictions are vague and meant to be more
generally comforting than specifically right. Ms. Aslan keeps a
letter from Isaac Mizrahi, in which the designer lavishes praise on
her ``bedside manner.'' She concedes that she is ``basically a
Polyanna psychic.'' She said, ``People have to really coax me to
tell them the bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond her calming presence, Ms. Aslan has made predictions
that have changed her clients' love lives. She is an accomplished
matchmaker, and the pressure rises around Valentine's Day. ``You
can't force these things, but sometimes the perfect setup just
appears like a sort of vision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, three years ago, Donna Rubinstein, who was then the
model editor at Seventeen, came for a reading. Ms. Aslan told her
she had got the image of Jim Coogan, a commercial real estate
developer, whose cards she had read a few days before. ``The night
we went out, it was like _ I know this sounds cliche _ but it was
like we'd known each other all our lives,'' Ms. Rubinstein said.
They are still together.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Simpson, a producer for ``48 Hours,'' met Ms. Aslan a
year ago, when she was researching a segment on the paranormal. Ms.
Simpson had to get readings from a dozen psychics, most of whom she
thought were ``just silly,'' she said. But Ms. Aslan's
``combination of comfort and energy'' impressed her, so she
continued to see her for readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was single at the time, and Madalyn told me I was going to
meet a Jewish man 10 years older than I was with green eyes,'' Ms.
Simpson recalled. ``She said we'd have a whirlwind courtship and
get married within the year.'' Last October, Ms. Simpson met Steve
Friedman, also a television producer; they became engaged 10 weeks
later. His eyes are green. ``I'm still floored,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aslan believes that her career as a love psychic was in the
cards from the start. She was, she said, a ``love child,'' born in
the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco the year following the
``Summer of Love'' _ 1967. Her mother was a hippie-turned-actress
who fooled around with tarot cards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aslan dabbled in acting as a teen-ager. She was, she said,
in ``Priest of Love,'' a 1981 movie starring Ian McKellen as D.H.
Lawrence, and in the television mini-series ``The Martian
Chronicles'' (1980), with Rock Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   During the shooting of the mini-series, Ms. Aslan did her first
tape-recorded reading, of Hudson. ``He was a Scorpio,'' she
recalled. ``The most hidden sign. I looked at his palm and told him
I saw a storm behind the stream. He just laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   She abandoned acting because, she said, she felt the life was
too flaky. After pursuing a bachelor's degree at Cornell University
and a master's degree in creative writing at Sarah Lawrence
College, she taught freshman composition in a preparatory course at
New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's a full-time psychic, she's writing a roman a clef
with the working title ``Heir to a Feral Wonderland.'' It is based
on her rootless childhood and what she calls the ``the healing
power of psychic development.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Ms. Aslan has not been able to heal is her own love
life, it seems. She sighs at the mention of it. To begin with, she
said, she makes an ethical point of not dating her clients. ``It's
too one-sided,'' she said. ``You're never sure if they want you for
your insight or really for you.''

THREE GOP SENATORS WHO BROKE PARTY RANKS FACE RE-ELECTION IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three of the five Republican senators who voted
Friday to acquit President Clinton on both impeachment articles
face re-election next year in states Clinton carried in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The three _ Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, Sen. Jim Jeffords of
Vermont and Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island _ are all moderate
mavericks from New England, a region that prizes its independence.
</P>
<P>
   In statements, the three said they decided the case against
Clinton on the merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do what's right and true,'' Snowe said. ``I have
to live with this for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political implications of their votes could not have
been far from their minds. ``I'm sure there's a mixture of motives
there,'' said Douglas Hodgkin, a political science professor at
Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, Hodgkin said, could not have helped but notice a
statewide poll released this week showing 71 percent of those
questioned approving of the job Clinton is doing as president, and
66 percent saying Snowe and Maine's other senator, Republican Susan
Collins, should not vote to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   The president was accused of perjury and obstruction of justice
in trying to conceal his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., were the other two
Republican votes for acquittal on both counts. In addition, five
other Republican senators voted to acquit Clinton on the perjury
article, but voted to convict the president on the obstruction
charge. One of those is Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who also faces
re-election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkin said that Snowe, 51, ``responded to public opinion in
the state. But, he added, ``her vote is also consistent with her
previous record as a moderate Republican who votes with her party
only half the time or less.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jeffords, 64, the votes to acquit Clinton could well cut
both ways in 2000, said Patrick Garahan, state Republican Party
chairman in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly takes away an issue that any Democrat would have
raised,'' Garahan said. ``On the other hand, it may lead to a
primary challenge'' from conservative Republicans disgruntled over
Jeffords bolting the party majority in the impeachment votes.
</P>
<P>
   While opposition to impeachment was the more popular viewpoint,
numerous Republican loyalists have called Garahan to complain about
Jeffords, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim has always been a maverick in the moderate wing of the
party,'' Garahan said, pointing to Jeffords' vote as a House member
against President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, a virtual litmus
test for Republicans serving at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, as far as avoiding a primary challenge goes, (Jeffords
acquittal votes were) probably the worst thing to do,'' Garahan
said. ``But in the general election, it's a positive, no question
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, 76, has not announced whether he will seek re-election.
A moderate, he has crossed swords with GOP conservatives on issues
ranging from the environment to Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement prior to the votes, he said that even though he
found Clinton's behavior ``reckless'' and ``tawdry,'' his support
for acquittal was based on ``murky'' impeachment trial evidence
that did not justify removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 19 Republican senators are up for re-election in
2000. Of those, 13 are from states won by Clinton in 1996. On the
Democratic side, there are 13 senators up for re-election, and one
_ Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York _ has said he will not seek
another term.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, two are from states won by Republican
candidate Bob Dole in 1996. They are Kent Conrad of North Dakota
and Charles Robb of Virginia. Both voted to acquit Clinton on the
two impeachment articles.

 &HT;    TEXAS SENATORS DISCUSS 'GUILTY' VOTES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As expected, both Republican senators from Texas
voted Friday to convict President Clinton, but the real drama for
Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison came shortly after they
answered ``guilty'' in successive roll call votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the chamber floor, a resolute Gramm stood and used Senate
rules to stop a motion by Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., to
censure Clinton for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible''
behavior. And at a press conference in the nearby Senate television
studio, Hutchison was halted mid-sentence when evacuation was
ordered because of a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's one way to end a press conference,'' Hutchison
told an aide as she and the assembled journalists quickly complied
when a Senate official interrupted the questions and answers with a
terse, ``Everyone has to leave the building right now.''
</P>
<P>
   People were allowed back into the Senate more than an hour later
after a search found no bomb.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gramm has vowed to block any Senate attempt at
censuring Clinton _ charging that such a vote was only to provide
political cover to those who voted for acquittal and that such a
formal expression of congressional disapproval would set a bad
precedent. Moments after the impeachment trial ended, Gramm made
good on his promise.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein sought consideration of a censure motion that Clinton
had brought ``shame and dishonor to himself and the office of the
president.'' But Gramm successfully called for a vote that required
a two-thirds majority to continue debate on the censure resolution.
With Sen. Pet. Domenici, R-N.M., not voting, the Senate voted 56-43
for continuing _ 11 votes short.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said a censure
movement will ``have to gather a lot (more) steam than it has right
now'' to be revived after a week-long Presidents' Day recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Senate has been through this,'' Lott said.
``We've done what was required, and we ought to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison was one of 12 Republicans who voted for considering
censure. At her abbreviated press conference, she said she thought
senators should have had that option.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison was the only woman in the Senate to vote ``guilty'' on
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would we be telling Americans _ and those worldwide who
see in America what they can only hope for in their own countries _
if the Senate of the United States were to conclude: 'The president
lied under oath as an element to obstruct the due process of law,
but we chose to look the other way'?'' Hutchison asked her fellow
senators in her floor speech in the closed final deliberations. She
released the speech Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot make that choice,'' she said. ``I cannot look away. I
vote 'guilty' on Article I, Perjury. I vote 'guilty' on Article II,
Obstruction of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   At her press conference, Hutchison said she cast the votes
``with great disappointment, but firm resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was mostly unchallenged in the trial, Hutchison
said. So there were two types of votes cast: ``Yes, but'' which
meant the senator did not think the wrongdoing rose to the level of
impeachable offenses. And ``Yes, and'' which meant the senator did.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is now time for Congress and the president to put
impeachment behind them and ``address other pressing issues we
face.''
</P>
<P>
   In his floor speech during the closed deliberations _ released
after the vote _ Gramm also said it is time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward now to turning to the two issues that will
dominate debate in this Congress and for the first decade of the
new millennium,'' Gramm said. ``We must find a way to save Social
Security, not just for our parents but for our children. And,
secondly, we must determine whether the non-Social Security surplus
should be spent by government or given back to the families so that
they can spend it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, he expressed no misgivings about voting to
convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is guilty beyond doubt, beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' said
Gramm. ``He is guilty for one reason only _ because he committed
the acts he is accused of, perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gramm denied any political motivations for his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an impeachment process steeped in partisanship, I have
tried to screen out my own strong partisan sentiments by asking a
simple question: 'Would I vote to convict President Ronald Reagan
or President George Bush if they had committed the acts that
President Clinton has committed?' `` Gramm said. ``The answer is a
sad but firm 'yes.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton sought to set himself above the law,'' Gramm
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   At her press conference, Hutchison said her ``greatest regret
was that the people of America did not see the final
deliberations.'' The Texas senator had led an unsuccessful movement
to open the deliberations, which were closed under rules set up
over a century ago for the impeachment trial of President Andrew
Johnson.

IMPEACHMENT MAY, OR MAY NOT, BECOME 2000 ELECTION ISSUE

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ As the impeachment trial of President
Clinton wound down, Democrats were betting that voter disgust with
Congress could galvanize the party at the expense of the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   First on the Democrats' hit list is likely to be Rep. James
Rogan, one of the Republican prosecutors in the Senate impeachment
trial, who was already a target of Democrats even before he became
a high-profile figure in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has denied that Clinton will target his
prosecutors in a special effort to oust them from office. But
Rogan, whose district is heavily Democratic, could face an uphill
re-election bid. Republicans are whispering about him as a possible
candidate for Los Angeles district attorney or the party's nominee
against Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and his the party are really planning revenge,
California Republican strategist Dan Schnur and other analysts
believe that they do so at their own peril. If the Clinton
impeachment proved anything, it's that voters can't be predicted. A
year ago, when the Monica Lewinsky story was breaking, it was
assumed Clinton would be forced out in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have since stridently protected the president against
Republican efforts to drive him from office, gained seats in
Congress and virtually obliterated the California Republican Party
with a campaign that briskly condemned Clinton's behavior while
touting his public policies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson California Democrats have learned, even as others
in their national party salivate over punishing Rogan and dream of
exploiting, however obliquely, the Republican handling of Clinton's
sexual affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the danger is getting obsessed with this,'' said Bill
Carrick, a chief political consultant to Feinstein. ``I think we
have a chance of getting the House of Representatives back and I
think we ought to do it in the simple, old-fashioned way: targeting
districts where voters are more inclined to vote Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have plans for other California Republicans in
moderate ``swing'' districts in California, such as that of Rep.
Tom Campbell of the Silicon Valley, Rep. Brian Bilbray of San Diego
and Rep. Steve Kuykendall from Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way announced this week it would spend
$5 million on television advertising and grass-roots organizing to
oust vulnerable Republicans from Congress. Hollywood is getting
involved too, with entertainment mogul David Geffen telling the New
York Times, ``Many of us are looking forward to spending time and
money and effort to defeating James Rogan.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in California also can expect to see Vice President Al
Gore many times leading up to the March 2000 primary. He's already
made 53 stops in California since 1992, dropping off federal
grants, collecting cash from wealthy Democrats, and joking with
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis about their respective dull public
personas.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, while he's at it, may be dropping off references to
how Republicans handled the Lewinsky scandal. The strategy can be
found in a recent Gore fund-raising letter, where he tried to
exploit the unpopularity of the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider the alternative we face. Will our nation succumb to
the forces of divisiveness, extremism and personal destruction that
threaten to engulf Washington as I write this?'' Gore declared.
``Will we surrender to the `us versus them' syndrome that paralyzes
our government, stalls progress and pits American against
American?''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's letter to party faithful may garner campaign
contributions, some predict that a nationwide strategy of
exploiting the impeachment could backfire for Democrats just as it
did for Republicans during the last election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you can't predict the future, you can still learn from
the past,'' Schnur said. ``The lesson to be learned from last
November's election is that voters would rather hear about policy
than scandal. So if either party tries to run on impeachment, they
would be making a mistake.''

 &HT;    TEXAS SENATORS DISCUSS 'GUILTY' VOTES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As expected, both Republican senators from Texas
voted Friday to convict President Clinton, but the real drama for
Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison came shortly after they
answered ``guilty'' in successive roll call votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the chamber floor, a resolute Gramm stood and used Senate
rules to stop a motion by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to
censure Clinton for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible''
behavior. And at a press conference in the nearby Senate television
studio, Hutchison was halted mid-sentence when evacuation was
ordered because of a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's one way to end a press conference,'' Hutchison
told an aide as she and the assembled journalists quickly complied
when a Senate official interrupted the questions and answers with a
terse, ``Everyone has to leave the building right now.''
</P>
<P>
   People were allowed back into the Senate more than an hour later
after a search found no bomb.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gramm has vowed to block any Senate attempt at
censuring Clinton _ charging that such a vote was only to provide
political cover to those who voted for acquittal and that such a
formal expression of congressional disapproval would set a bad
precedent. Moments after the impeachment trial ended, Gramm made
good on his promise.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein sought consideration of a censure motion that Clinton
had brought ``shame and dishonor to himself and the office of the
president.'' But Gramm successfully called for a vote that required
a two-thirds majority to continue debate on the censure resolution.
With Sen. Pet. Domenici, R-N.M., not voting, the Senate voted 56-43
for continuing _ 11 votes short.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said a censure
movement will ``have to gather a lot (more) steam than it has right
now'' to be revived after a week-long Presidents' Day recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Senate has been through this,'' Lott said.
``We've done what was required, and we ought to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison was one of 12 Republicans who voted for considering
censure. At her abbreviated press conference, she said she thought
senators should have had that option.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison was the only woman in the Senate to vote ``guilty'' on
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would we be telling Americans _ and those worldwide who
see in America what they can only hope for in their own countries _
if the Senate of the United States were to conclude: 'The president
lied under oath as an element to obstruct the due process of law,
but we chose to look the other way'?'' Hutchison asked her fellow
senators in her floor speech in the closed final deliberations. She
released the speech Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot make that choice,'' she said. ``I cannot look away. I
vote 'guilty' on Article I, Perjury. I vote 'guilty' on Article II,
Obstruction of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   At her press conference, Hutchison said she cast the votes
``with great disappointment, but firm resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was mostly unchallenged in the trial, Hutchison
said. So there were two types of votes cast: ``Yes, but'' which
meant the senator did not think the wrongdoing rose to the level of
impeachable offenses. And ``Yes, and'' which meant the senator did.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is now time for Congress and the president to put
impeachment behind them and ``address other pressing issues we
face.''
</P>
<P>
   In his floor speech during the closed deliberations _ released
after the vote _ Gramm also said it is time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward now to turning to the two issues that will
dominate debate in this Congress and for the first decade of the
new millennium,'' Gramm said. ``We must find a way to save Social
Security, not just for our parents but for our children. And,
secondly, we must determine whether the non-Social Security surplus
should be spent by government or given back to the families so that
they can spend it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, he expressed no misgivings about voting to
convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is guilty beyond doubt, beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' said
Gramm. ``He is guilty for one reason only _ because he committed
the acts he is accused of, perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gramm denied any political motivations for his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an impeachment process steeped in partisanship, I have
tried to screen out my own strong partisan sentiments by asking a
simple question: 'Would I vote to convict President Ronald Reagan
or President George Bush if they had committed the acts that
President Clinton has committed?' `` Gramm said. ``The answer is a
sad but firm 'yes.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton sought to set himself above the law,'' Gramm
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   At her press conference, Hutchison said her ``greatest regret
was that the people of America did not see the final
deliberations.'' The Texas senator had led an unsuccessful movement
to open the deliberations, which were closed under rules set up
over a century ago for the impeachment trial of President Andrew
Johnson.

TEXAS SENATORS TOOK DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although both Texas senators ultimately agreed that
President Clinton should be removed from office, they approached
the trial in dramatically different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the leadership styles of Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay
Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans, became increasingly apparent as
the trial proceeded, sometimes putting the senators on opposites
sides of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gramm thought former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky should testify on the floor of the Senate. Hutchison did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison worked with Democrats to open deliberations to the
public. Gramm voted to keep them closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil has always taken a more direct, charge-the-hill approach,
and Kay has been known for more of a subtle, light touch,'' said
Houston Republican political consultant Allen Blakemore.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Ed Martin, former executive director of the Texas
Democratic Party, put it, ``She's been rather circumspect, and he's
been Phil Gramm.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were surprised when Gramm, known for stubbornly sticking to
his conservative views regardless of popular opinion, joined with
liberal Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts to fashion
a compromise to get the trial rolling.
</P>
<P>
   From there, however, Gramm's spirit of bipartisanship seemed to
wane as he sided with his Republican colleagues on a number of
issues that split along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has been bipartisan, but the result is probably
not going to be bipartisan,'' he said as he was leaving the Capitol
after the second day of deliberations. ``That is just the way it
turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm was determined from the start that the trial would
continue to a verdict, even as his colleagues in both parties
searched for a way to short-circuit the trial for the weary nation.
Anything less would be unconstitutional, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison had a more flexible view of the proceedings, stating
early on that the Senate had an obligation to start the trial out
of respect for constitutional precedent and the House, but that
``from that point on, I think our options are open.''
</P>
<P>
   She also voted Friday against Gramm's procedural move to
indefinitely put off censure, which Gramm has called a
``covering-your-fanny approach'' and a violation of the separation
of powers doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Both senators stuck with their party in two 56-44 votes last
month against dismissing the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges and allowing depositions of Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon
Jordan and presidential aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to allowing Lewinsky to testify live on the
Senate floor, Hutchison voted no along with 69 other senators while
Gramm voted to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Gramm said he didn't know whether live testimony
would have affected the trial's outcome, but that he felt required
by his oath of impartiality to allow witnesses for both the House
managers or the president.
</P>
<P>
   Depositions were ``more effective than calling live witnesses,''
which wouldn't have added any new evidence anyway, Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought questioning Monica Lewinsky was best handled in a
small room by a small number of people where she would not feel
intimidated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gramm may be better known for crusading for a cause,
Hutchison, a former broadcast journalist, led her own battle to
change Senate rules to allow open deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   It was a battle Gramm opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique and historic event for the United States, and
the public has a right to know how we arrived at our decision,''
said Hutchison, who faces re-election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, however, relied on tradition for his argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 2,600 years, since the ancient lawgiver Solon in Athens,
and every day since, in every courthouse in America, we have open
trials, we have public evidence, we have public witnesses, but when
the jury deliberates, it goes behind closed doors,'' he said last
weekend on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, although 59 senators voted to open the
deliberations, it failed to get the two-thirds majority, or 67
votes, needed to override the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Murray, a political science professor at the University
of Houston, said the senators' styles and differing opinions might
be attributable to their long-range political goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who ran a failed 1996 presidential campaign, may not feel
as pressured to play nice in the political forum. Hutchison, on the
other hand, may be angling for a vice-presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gramm feels he's free now with no ambitions for higher
office to take positions that appeal to him intellectually without
considering political consequences,'' Murray said. ``Hutchison
remains on the list of possible vice-presidential nominees, so she
arguably has national political prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Hutchison's own experience with being indicted
and acquitted in 1993 on charges of misusing her office while she
was state treasurer? Did that color her interpretation of the
president's impeachment trial?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Hutchison sees a little bit of (Travis County District
Attorney) Ronnie Earle in (Independent Counsel) Ken Starr,'' Murray
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hutchison said two years ago that Paula Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president evoked memories of Earle's
charges, Hutchison said Wednesday that the president's situation
was not at all similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that there was no basis for what the
district attorney was trying to do to me,'' she said. ``He was
trying to get a Senate seat back. What President Clinton has
admitted to and the evidence shows is an admission of wrong-doing
and cover-up.''

FOXY WENT OUT ON A CHILLY NIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID KIRBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Sunday night, Foxy Brown and her crew were in a
stretch limousine snaking their way uptown through a slushy
snowfall. The hip-hop star, 19, whose ``Chyna Doll'' had just
premiered at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart, was
Harlem-bound for a victory lap in the neighborhood that is home to
her favorite haunts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, who in private prefers to be called by her real name,
Inga Marchand, was traveling caravan-style to accommodate her many
friends. In the limousine with her was Denise Rich, a songwriter
and high-profile party-giver, with whom she is collaborating on a
song; Jimmy Hester, a music manager, and Tim Rosta, executive
director of Lifebeat, the music industry's AIDS charity.
</P>
<P>
   (By the time the limo reached East 86th Street, Rosta had
persuaded Ms. Brown to serve as host at a pre-Grammy Awards benefit
breakfast in Los Angeles). Trailing behind in a black sports
utility vehicle, in constant cell-phone contact, were Ms. Brown's
fiance, the rapper Kurupt, and J. Alexander Martin, the young mogul
who owns the Fubu line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was speaking simultaneously on separate cells. Ms.
Brown discussed MTV specials and Essence magazine shoots, an Oliver
Stone screen test and her new album.
</P>
<P>
   Marvet Britto, Ms. Brown's publicity agent, called around for a
place to eat, not easy on a Sunday night, when Harlem goes to bed
early. She rang the Sugar Shack, on Frederick Douglas Boulevard, a
year-old soul food place with live jazz and poetry jams. No answer.
</P>
<P>
   On West 125th Street next to the Apollo Theater, Ms. Brown had
the limo pull to a stop before a 100-foot-long ``Chyna Doll''
billboard, featuring a very foxy Foxy, clad only in a blue feather
bikini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, me!'' the singer cooed to herself, climbing out of the
limo and into the snowy night to get a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Foxy inspecting Foxy caused quite a stir with passers-by. ``Yo!
You're naked!'' clucked one woman walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Ms. Brown replied sweetly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Foxy! Hey Chyna Doll! We love you baby. We're playing you
right now,'' two men shouted from a car. Sure enough, her hit
single, ``My Life,'' rapped through the car windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Baby!'' Ms. Brown shouted back, waving and grinning like
Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Harlem, it's like a second home to me,'' Ms. Brown
said. Although she grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and now lives
in Fort Lee, N.J., with Kurupt, as a girl Ms. Brown would ride the
A train on Sundays to 125th Street to attend services at the
Abyssinian Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going to Japan, it seemed so far,'' she said. ``My
mother would give me $2, one for the plate and one to have in my
pocket. But I always kept them both.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Ms. Brown recalled, she and her friends would
wile away time in Harlem in abandoned buildings. ``They looked just
like that,'' she said, pointing out the window at a row of
boarded-up buildings. One of them had a smaller ``Chyna Doll''
billboard on it.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that Ms. Brown was discovered by the
producers Tone and Poke, whom she had grown up with in Brooklyn.
They put her in a single with LL Cool J called ``I Shot Ya.'' She
gave herself the name Foxy Brown. It was inspired by the title
character, a killer nurse, played by Pam Grier in the 1974
blaxploitation film ``Foxy Brown.'' Ms. Grier has since become a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pam is like my second mom,'' Ms. Brown said. ``She called my
house one day, and we started planning a remake of `Foxy Brown'
where she gives birth and passes the torch on to me. She teaches me
there's more to being Foxy Brown than just pulling razor blades
from your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The party landed at Well's Famous Chicken and Waffles on Adam
Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. Recognizing Ms. Brown, who was
wearing a tight pewter Prada tube top and a hooded down jacket she
calls her Gucci goose, the staff immediately put ``Ill Na Na,'' her
debut album, on the sound system. (On Ms. Brown's shoulder is a
tattoo of the song title in Japanese.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We need your new CD,'' Elliot Young, the manager, said
apologetically. He told Ms. Brown she was an honored guest. The
80-year-old restaurant, which was once patronized by Malcolm X,
Paul Robeson and Nat King Cole, closed for a few years in the
1980s. But now it has become a destination again, attracting crowds
to brunch on Sundays with live gospel singers, and on Monday nights
with a 12-piece swing orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, somewhere, the slender Ms. Brown put away several corn
muffins slathered in strawberry butter, fried flounder, macaroni
and cheese, yams and potato salad. While she was waiting for her
collard greens, Kurupt got up from the far end of the table and
nuzzled her neck. Ms. Brown giggled, then pushed him away
playfully. ``I'm still waiting for my collard greens,'' she said.
``I told you, I love to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown held reservations at St. Nick's Pub on St. Nicholas
Avenue, a classic club that features the famed Sugar Hill Jazz
Quartet on Mondays, and a house band on Sunday until 11. But by the
time all that eating was over, it was already 10:45, too late to
drop in at St. Nick's.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the cell phones, searching for live music, Ms. Britto
called Cafe Largo, a new jazz spot, and Snooky's Cafe, a year-old
bistro next to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture,
on West 137th Street. Harlem is in the midst of a night life
revival; but both places were closed.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped at the Lenox Lounge, an Art Deco relic. There was
no music on Sundays, however, and Ms. Brown told Kurupt she wanted
to leave. ``C'mon, baby let's go to Wilson's,'' she said, naming
the jazz club on West 72d Street. ``I really want to hear some
music. Wilson's is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Back into the vehicles everyone piled, heading to the Upper West
Side and leaving Harlem behind.

HUNK, HE-MAN, MENSCH, MILQUETOAST: THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Mass., N.Y., Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The consummate tough-guy persona of Humphrey Bogart. The
vulnerability of James Stewart. The bad-boy sexuality of Marlon
Brando. The romanticism of Cary Grant. It would not be hard for a
moviegoer to end up wondering whether masculinity is a mode of
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This, as it turns out, is the conviction of a growing number of
scholars in the field of so-called masculinity studies, a somewhat
surprising offshoot of feminism in which mostly male academics have
taken feminist theory and applied it to the study of masculinity
and men.
</P>
<P>
   Masculinity studies are not part of any antifeminist backlash.
Practitioners do not talk about male bonding or affirming
traditional male values. Instead, they have been inspired by a
central principle of feminist theory, that gender is not inborn but
created, that gender is performance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, scholars in fields like sociology,
history and film studies have tried to dissect how manhood has been
``constructed,'' as they put it, examining everything from its
shifting representation in movies to what men's letters and diaries
reveal about their roles over time.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusion is that masculinity is not monolithic. The
masculine ideal varies widely among groups and often varies by age,
region and race, they say. It changes as circumstances change over
time, often in response to historical and cultural change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What male scholars started doing was they said, `What if there
is more than one masculinity?''' said Dennis Bingham, an associate
professor of English at Indiana University-Purdue University and
the author of a book on masculinity in the movies of James Stewart,
Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. ```What if masculinity is a
construction, something we unconsciously work very hard on making
ourselves into that we've all conned ourselves into believing is
natural?'''
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Manhood: Transformations in Masculinity From the
Revolution to the Modern Era'' (Basic Books, 1993), E. Anthony
Rotundo, a historian who teaches at Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass., divides manhood over the past 250 years into three distinct
phases.
</P>
<P>
   In colonial New England, the dominant form was ``communal
manhood,'' he writes. A man's identity was defined by his
usefulness to his community. With the rise of a market economy and
the growth of the middle class, that form was eclipsed in the early
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-made manhood'' supplanted it, Rotundo says. A man's
identity and social status came from his achievements more than any
accident of birth. Ambition, rivalry and aggression were given
freer rein, he writes; manhood depended on channeling, rather than
moderating, his passions.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 19th century, there was another shift: Combativeness
had become a positive male virtue, the book argues. Competitiveness
was exalted, toughness admired, tenderness scorned. Male sexual
desire, seen earlier as worrisome, became an important part of the
new ``passionate manhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Images of masculinity appear to shift even more on screen than
in real life. Steven Cohan, an English professor at Syracuse
University, devotes his book ``Masked Men: Masculinity and the
Movies in the Fifties'' (Indiana University Press, 1997) to
tracking the contradictory images of manhood in postwar films.
</P>
<P>
   Masculinity was in flux, Cohan writes. The war had shaken up
gender relations at work and at home, and anxiety about the mental
stability of returning veterans had ``exaggerated the danger their
ungovernable masculinity posed to the social order.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the Cold War, too, projected contradictory
messages for manhood, Cohan writes. A ``hard'' masculinity was
required for defending the nation's borders, but a ``soft''
masculinity was insisted upon as ``the foundation of an orderly,
responsible home life.''
</P>
<P>
   That complex mix of historical and cultural pressures influenced
what Cohan calls ``the masculine masquerade'' he finds in movies of
the 1950s, which he examines in the on- and off-screen images of
actors like Grant, Bogart, Brando and William Holden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though men have supposedly been invisible, looking at how
their bodies appear in film can reveal the same kind of shifts that
looking at the female body in film does,'' Cohan said recently,
giving as an example the contrast between the exoticism of Rudolph
Valentino and the athleticism of Douglas Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The roots of masculinity studies as a field can be traced to the
mid-1970s, when a group of men, mostly social psychologists, began
using feminism to examine their own lives. Out of that effort came
the first two anthologies of scholarly articles on masculinity and
a national conference on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, a couple of professors in sociology and
history departments were teaching courses on manhood and
masculinity, relying on stacks of Xerox copies for the reading.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, there has been a steady stream of books and
articles on the subject, including ``Manhood in America: A Cultural
History'' (The Free Press, 1995) by Michael Kimmel, a professor of
sociology at SUNY Stony Brook, who teaches a course on masculinity
and edits a quarterly journal for the field.
</P>
<P>
   In an article entitled ``The `Flabby American,' the Body and the
Cold War,'' Robert Griswold, a professor of history at the
University of Oklahoma who has also written a history of
fatherhood, recently explored national concerns about the male body
as being a repository of social ills during the Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold wrote that promoters of physical fitness under the
Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations hoped ``to revitalize
manhood so that it could better meet the communist threat to
national survival.'' He added, ``Cold wars could not be fought with
soft bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Running Scared: Masculinity and the Representation of the
Male Body'' (Temple University Press, 1993), Peter Lehman, a
professor of media arts at the University of Arizona, suggested
that the taboo against showing the penis in film and other media
has reinforced patriarchal notions about its power.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman contends that the penis appears commonly only in very
limited contexts: It is visible in pornography, where it is always
intended to be impressive; and it features regularly in humor,
usually in jokes implying that any dimensions short of awesomely
large are laughable or pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other aspects of masculinity are being studied,
including fatherhood and masculinity in the 19-century American
North, the rise of the bachelor subculture, the domestic life of
colonial men and representations of masculinity in Italian film.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Reich, a scholar of Italian cinema and an assistant
professor at SUNY Stony Brook who is writing a book on
Italian-movie masculinity, has found that the dominant image is not
that of the Latin lover, as might be imagined, but that of an
Italian version of the schlemiel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think of the Italian as being the consummate ideal of
masculinity,'' she said in an interview. ``But from Fellini to
Antonioni, you see men who are constantly struggling to achieve
their goals and are at odds with a rapidly changing social,
political, cultural environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several feminist historians said they approved of much of the
new work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since about the mid-1980s, it has been very clear that one
can't look at women's history without looking at the history of men
as men,'' said Nancy Cott, a professor of history and American
studies at Yale. ``So I see the two things as really mutually
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, many predict that men and masculinity will be
integrated into the emerging field of gender studies. Several
colleges have already headed in that direction, including Hobart
and William Smith Colleges, which last fall inaugurated a new
center, the Fisher Center for the Study of Women and Men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not in the past seven years taught a specific course on
masculinity because I work it into everything else,'' said Bingham,
who wrote the book on Stewart, Nicholson and Eastwood. ``When I
teach the western, what is that if not all about masculinity? It
works its way into virtually everything I do.''

HYDE SAYS STARR SHOULD NOT INDICT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bitterness, disappointment, relief. That was how
many of the 13 House prosecutors described their feelings Friday
after seeing their case against President Clinton rejected by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Republican prosecutors expressed chagrin that
they couldn't win a simple 51-vote majority of the 100-member
Senate on either of the two articles of impeachment charging
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   It would have required 67 votes to remove Clinton from office,
but they were at least hoping for a psychological victory by
winning simple majorities on both articles.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., expressed bewilderment that 10
Senate Republicans joined all 45 Democrats to acquit Clinton on the
perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt that it was a very strong case for perjury,''
Graham said. He said he was curious to find out why Republican
senators deserted him on the perjury case.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who led the
impeachment proceedings against Clinton in the House and the
prosecution team at the Senate trial, summed up the month-long
trial: ``It could have been better, but everything could have been
better, let's face it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old Hyde seemed to harbor no ill-feelings toward
Clinton and suggested that it was time for Independent Counsel
Kenneth W. Starr to close up shop after investigating Clinton for
more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to put something to bed, or put it on the
shelf,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also said he didn't believe Starr should move to indict
Clinton, which he can still do through the court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think indicting and criminally trying him, after all
that we have been through, is going to be helpful to the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., another prosecutor, appeared visibly
upset as he delivered a terse statement and quickly left the House
Judiciary Committee room where the prosecutors held a final press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer accused senators of not following through ``on their
conscience and conviction.'' He said the Senate vote damaged the
Constitution and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great fear is that future presidents will now flaunt the
law in a more egregious manner,'' Buyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson simply said he was looking forward to taking
a long walk in the Ozark hills in his home state of Arkansas during
next week's congressional recess. Unlike Buyer, Hutchinson and the
other prosecutors felt that the Constitution was strengthened
because the impeachment process outlined in the document was
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who has long been one of Clinton's
fiercest critics, said he passed a group of tourists after leaving
the Senate chamber who ``broke out into spontaneous applause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That to me, more than anything that happened in the Senate
chamber over the last month, including today, tells me that we did
the right thing,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and others said they felt hamstrung by the Senate at times.
Through informal channels senators sent word that they didn't want
to hear from dozens of witnesses during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors responded by narrowing their list to
three; former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, White House
adviser Bruce Lindsey and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then blocked House managers from bringing the
witnesses into the Senate chamber for questioning. They were
limited to a four-hour videotaped deposition, parts of which were
later played before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't familiar with the structure of how they operate,''
Hyde said. ``Bipartisanship is very, very critical to them and it
isn't as critical to us because a subject like impeaching a
president doesn't lend itself to studied bipartisanship.'' The
House voted to impeach President Clinton mostly along party lines
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., took comfort in the
fact that many public opinion polls showed that a majority of
Americans believe that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed
justice while trying to cover up his affair with Lewinsky. Those
same polls, however, also showed that more than two-thirds of
Americans didn't want Clinton removed from office.

`DEEP IN THE HEART': THE COLOR OF LOVE ISN'T BLACK OR WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young white woman walking home from a movie on a rainy night
in Boston is dragged behind a fence and raped by a black man. Soon
she's pregnant, and in turmoil. The child could be mine, her
husband says; who can say? They agree to have the baby. Then
they'll see what color it is. Then they'll decide.
</P>
<P>
   As feared, the child, a girl, turns out to be black. Half-black,
in truth. But everybody knows that the white half is beside the
point. What the mother hadn't counted on, though, was feeling like
a mother. She loves the baby, an innocent even if heinously
conceived. This is 1961, however, and race matters. When hasn't it?
The mother, with a pained kiss, gives the child away. The story
will be: the baby died.
</P>
<P>
   But the story has only begun, and ``Deep in the Heart,'' a
quietly compelling movie on CBS on Sunday, tells the rest, tracing
what becomes of this swaddled outcast. Or what became of her. For
the movie is grounded in the real-life stories of birth mother and
daughter, played by Anne Bancroft and Gloria Reuben (of ``E.R.''),
respectively, and quite convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's no coincidence that the movie arrives during Black
History Month; the film moves across an American racial landscape.
But it does so with only a passing look at the civil unrest of
recent decades. If it's black history, it's one person's searing
slice of it.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense the film is truer to its unfortunate Harlequin
romance title than to any wider ambitions. Here the ground is
mainly emotional, and the movie, braced by a strong supporting
cast, covers it sure-footedly, sidestepping traps of
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   An early scene sets the tone. The mother (played in her young
years by Cara Buono) arrives on the doorstep of a rundown Roxbury
foster home to hand over the baby, Barbara. The potential for
mawkishness is rich, but the moment is handled with restraint; the
mother's clutching goodbye, the husband's awkward excuse-making and
the black foster mother's I've-heard-it-all-before expression say
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The film then begins to take leaps of time and place. We soon
see Barbara, at age 7, torn from the loving foster mother (Lynn
Whitfield) and shunted off to white adoptive parents in Wisconsin,
a couple of well-meaning but emotionally arid social do-gooders.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara's teen-age years also sprint by. In a sequence of
dissolving images, she ages while planted sullenly in a chair as
her now divorced, career-consumed adoptive mother (Alice Krige, who
makes her character both sympathetic and infuriating) enters and
exits at a chilly remove.
</P>
<P>
   All this fast-forwarding drives the story to its crux: the
search by the daughter, now 34, happily married and middle-class,
for the woman who gave her up.
</P>
<P>
   But what's lost in the blur is a fuller picture of the lonely
racial limbo in which Barbara, as a girl, is forced to live.
Instead, we have to trust her moodiness and her own testimony to
understand her unhappiness. In that she's blunt. Of the rapist
father she never knew, she says, ``He made the black part of me
ugly, and I haven't had a great history with white people, so
there's no part of me I've wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The film moves toward an unsurprising resolution. But here again
the facts are on its side, reminding us that even in the midst of
social strife, one person may achieve a separate peace.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Sunday night, Foxy Brown and her crew were in a
stretch limousine snaking their way uptown through a slushy
snowfall. The hip-hop star, 19, whose ``Chyna Doll'' had just
premiered at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart, was
Harlem-bound for a victory lap in the neighborhood that is home to
her favorite haunts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, who in private prefers to be called by her real name,
Inga Marchand, was traveling caravan-style to accommodate her many
friends. In the limousine with her was Denise Rich, a songwriter
and high-profile party-giver, with whom she is collaborating on a
song; Jimmy Hester, a music manager, and Tim Rosta, executive
director of Lifebeat, the music industry's AIDS charity.
</P>
<P>
   (By the time the limo reached East 86th Street, Rosta had
persuaded Ms. Brown to serve as host at a pre-Grammy Awards benefit
breakfast in Los Angeles). Trailing behind in a black sports
utility vehicle, in constant cell-phone contact, were Ms. Brown's
fiance, the rapper Kurupt, and J. Alexander Martin, the young mogul
who owns the Fubu line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was speaking simultaneously on separate cells. Ms.
Brown discussed MTV specials and Essence magazine shoots, an Oliver
Stone screen test and her new album.
</P>
<P>
   Marvet Britto, Ms. Brown's publicity agent, called around for a
place to eat, not easy on a Sunday night, when Harlem goes to bed
early. She rang the Sugar Shack, on Frederick Douglas Boulevard, a
year-old soul food place with live jazz and poetry jams. No answer.
</P>
<P>
   On West 125th Street next to the Apollo Theater, Ms. Brown had
the limo pull to a stop before a 100-foot-long ``Chyna Doll''
billboard, featuring a very foxy Foxy, clad only in a blue feather
bikini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, me!'' the singer cooed to herself, climbing out of the
limo and into the snowy night to get a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Foxy inspecting Foxy caused quite a stir with passers-by. ``Yo!
You're naked!'' clucked one woman walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Ms. Brown replied sweetly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Foxy! Hey Chyna Doll! We love you baby. We're playing you
right now,'' two men shouted from a car. Sure enough, her hit
single, ``My Life,'' rapped through the car windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Baby!'' Ms. Brown shouted back, waving and grinning like
Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Harlem, it's like a second home to me,'' Ms. Brown
said. Although she grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and now lives
in Fort Lee, N.J., with Kurupt, as a girl Ms. Brown would ride the
A train on Sundays to 125th Street to attend services at the
Abyssinian Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going to Japan, it seemed so far,'' she said. ``My
mother would give me $2, one for the plate and one to have in my
pocket. But I always kept them both.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Ms. Brown recalled, she and her friends would
wile away time in Harlem in abandoned buildings. ``They looked just
like that,'' she said, pointing out the window at a row of
boarded-up buildings. One of them had a smaller ``Chyna Doll''
billboard on it.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that Ms. Brown was discovered by the
producers Tone and Poke, whom she had grown up with in Brooklyn.
They put her in a single with LL Cool J called ``I Shot Ya.'' She
gave herself the name Foxy Brown. It was inspired by the title
character, a killer nurse, played by Pam Grier in the 1974
blaxploitation film ``Foxy Brown.'' Ms. Grier has since become a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pam is like my second mom,'' Ms. Brown said. ``She called my
house one day, and we started planning a remake of `Foxy Brown'
where she gives birth and passes the torch on to me. She teaches me
there's more to being Foxy Brown than just pulling razor blades
from your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The party landed at Well's Famous Chicken and Waffles on Adam
Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. Recognizing Ms. Brown, who was
wearing a tight pewter Prada tube top and a hooded down jacket she
calls her Gucci goose, the staff immediately put ``Ill Na Na,'' her
debut album, on the sound system. (On Ms. Brown's shoulder is a
tattoo of the song title in Japanese.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We need your new CD,'' Elliot Young, the manager, said
apologetically. He told Ms. Brown she was an honored guest. The
80-year-old restaurant, which was once patronized by Malcolm X,
Paul Robeson and Nat King Cole, closed for a few years in the
1980s. But now it has become a destination again, attracting crowds
to brunch on Sundays with live gospel singers, and on Monday nights
with a 12-piece swing orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, somewhere, the slender Ms. Brown put away several corn
muffins slathered in strawberry butter, fried flounder, macaroni
and cheese, yams and potato salad. While she was waiting for her
collard greens, Kurupt got up from the far end of the table and
nuzzled her neck. Ms. Brown giggled, then pushed him away
playfully. ``I'm still waiting for my collard greens,'' she said.
``I told you, I love to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown held reservations at St. Nick's Pub on St. Nicholas
Avenue, a classic club that features the famed Sugar Hill Jazz
Quartet on Mondays, and a house band on Sunday until 11. But by the
time all that eating was over, it was already 10:45, too late to
drop in at St. Nick's.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the cell phones, searching for live music, Ms. Britto
called Cafe Largo, a new jazz spot, and Snooky's Cafe, a year-old
bistro next to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture,
on West 137th Street. Harlem is in the midst of a night life
revival; but both places were closed.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped at the Lenox Lounge, an Art Deco relic. There was
no music on Sundays, however, and Ms. Brown told Kurupt she wanted
to leave. ``C'mon, baby let's go to Wilson's,'' she said, naming
the jazz club on West 72d Street. ``I really want to hear some
music. Wilson's is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Back into the vehicles everyone piled, heading to the Upper West
Side and leaving Harlem behind.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential sex-and-lies scandal that blew
through the nation's capital over the past year left few
institutions or politicians untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the wreckage of the sometimes sordid, sometimes tedious
events, a few players emerged stronger, while others struggled to
survive, and some stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who clearly had the most to lose, managed to
weather the storm swirling around his presidency but not without
sustaining severe damage.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the impeachment, the president has maintained
sky-high public approval ratings, as voters cast a critical eye at
his Republican accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations about his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky not only cost him a year's worth of
legislative accomplishments but may permanently blemish his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has survived, but he is no winner,'' said Mark
Rozell, a political science professor at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, on the other hand, landed on
top as a result of the manner in which she handled her husband's
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Once castigated as a polarizing, power-hungry spouse, the first
lady now has won over much of the public. Indeed, so popular is
Hillary Clinton she is now being urged to run for an open Senate
seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, who were jittery when the Lewinsky
matter first broke, not only survived the scandal but now score
better than their Republican colleagues with voters on a host of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that credit goes to their leaders, House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., who kept their members unified through the process.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, found that pursuing the president proved
to be more of a burden than a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Their top casualty was former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,R-Ga.,
who resigned after the party's poor showing in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   His intended successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., also fell by
the wayside as a result of pornography publisher Larry Flynt's
probe into his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, on the other hand, commanded unprecedented attention from
the mainstream press and politicians as he threatened more
revelations about Republican affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Another beneficiary of Livingston's misfortune was Rep. Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., a relatively unknown former wrestling coach who
was catapulted into the top House job.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope that the amiable demeanor of the new House
Speaker will mend the wounds from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The man who aggressively led the impeachment effort, Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., did not lose his job but his
reputation as the fair and wise old sage of the House took a
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13-member House prosecution team, Rep. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., and Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., managed to raise their
national profile and earned praise, even from Democrats, for their
folksy yet pointed presentations.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the House Judiciary Committee member
from Houston, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, made the most of her role in
the impeachment proceedings. Jackson Lee may not have equaled the
eloquence of the woman who once held her seat, Barbara Jordan, but
she was a regular on the talk show circuit, where she vigorously
defended the president.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, also saw his status rise
as a vociferous critic of the president. But DeLay,who was key in
marshalling support for Clinton's impeachment, may have been singed
by taking such a visible role. He has replaced Gingrich as the
Democrats' top enemy and has been forced to defend himself against
charges that he, like the president, may have been misleading in a
court proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Another Texas Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison took a more
conciliatory tact and won plaudits as she worked with Democrats in
an unsuccessful effort to open up closed portions of the Senate
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' senior Republican senator, Phil Gramm, teased colleagues
that he was seeking a gentler reputation when he conceived a way to
begin the trial in consultation with liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy,
D-Mass., although he later joined fellow conservatives in trying to
block Democratic initiatives, including a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers who argued before the Senate generally
won high marks from experts for their meticulously argued defense.
One was Cheryl Mills, the 33-year-old deputy White House counsel,
who held senators spellbound with her defense of her boss.
</P>
<P>
   As for Paula Jones, who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton that indirectly sparked the impeachment probe, she
finally extracted $800,000 in a settlement with Clinton, but she
now must deal with former lawyers who are demanding a large chunk
of that money.
</P>
<P>
   One likely casualty of the yearlong saga is the Independent
Counsel Law, which gave prosecutor Kenneth Starr wide latitude to
pursue the sex-and-lies case.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and Republicans believe the law, up for renewal
this year, needs radical revision to reign in overly aggressive
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, although he has won his share of court battles against
the Clinton administration, ranks in public polls as one of the
most unpopular figures in Washington as a result of his relentless
pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest losers in the scandal may be the media,
including the 24-hour news cable talk shows, which peddled the
scandal story relentlessly. Critics have faulted the media for
relying too much on anonymous sources, airing unsubstantiated
rumors and substituting opinion for fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of the media are concerned about commenting on
information rather than gathering it,'' said Tom Rosentiel,
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just over a year ago, Monica Lewinsky was packing
up her belongings in Washington and preparing to leave for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   To most people, she was just another one of the thousands of
young people who move through the city every year, working as
assistants or interns before moving on to another job. Those who
met her at parties described her as shy, and not especially
striking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time she made her first television appearance this
year, giving videotaped evidence to the impeachment trial of her
former boss, Lewinsky's name and face were amongst the most
recognized images on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Her trademark beret (by then swapped for a black baseball cap)
was an instantly-recognizable cliche. Her relationship with the
President had been set out in minute detail in newspapers and on
television programs around the world, and her most intimate
exchanges with her friends had been put on the internet or recorded
on tape.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern and Pentagon employee will not now
work for Revlon, as she had hoped when she left Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what will happen to her life. She says she lives
in California, as much as she lives anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   She will tell her own story through a forthcoming book,
``Monica's Story,'' by the journalist Andrew Morton, and she will
be interviewed by Barbara Walters for ABC and by Channel Four News.
</P>
<P>
   Once the last flush of media attention has drained, she will
doubtless try to resurrect something close to a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Monica is just one of the figures in the drama of the last year
whose daily existence has been transformed beyond recognition, but
few have seen their lives so wrecked as she.
</P>
<P>
   Most will carry on in their present jobs, or have a network of
supporters to call on. She has spent close to a million dollars on
legal fees, most of which she will recoup from the book and
television, but she has no easy return to normal life mapped out.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's first lawyer, William Ginsburg, did not help with the
presentational aspects of her case. He appeared to relish the
publicity, and arranged for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair that
made her look sexually alluring. But Ginsburg was quickly replaced
with two old Washington pros, who kept her literally and
metaphorically under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   She was initially described as a stalker by some (apparently
White House-inspired) reports, which stressed her parents' divorce
and her unstable nature. But everything that we have seen and heard
since belies that.
</P>
<P>
   She has appeared as a bright and composed figure with an
excellent recall of the events that took place around her. She has
a degree in psychology, which must have come in handy in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she spoke to President Clinton was on Jan. 5 a
year ago, when she had already been subpoenaed to give evidence in
the sexual harassment suit brought by former Arkansas employee
Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   She was angry with the president, whom she had recently seen on
television with his wife ``being romantic on their holiday
vacation.'' They discussed her affidavit, and she said goodbye,
``very abruptly,'' she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she felt for Clinton now, she said: ``I have mixed
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think he's a good president, and I assume you think he's a
very intelligent man,'' she was asked, and she responded, simply:
``I think he's an intelligent president.'' &QL;

SOME HEARTFELT HINTS FOR INTERNET VALENTINE SHOPPING

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're still looking for last-minute Valentine
help, your fearless Internet love doctor has put together some
online shopping suggestions that will swell your heart to bursting
with gratitude and _ dare we say it? _ love for your fellow man,
woman or significant other. Herewith:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; America Online has a huge area devoted to Valentine's Day
(keyword: Valentine's Day), with lots of shopping ideas, plus tips
on such timely topics as hot monogamy, wedding planning and how to
play the game of love. And if you want to get enmeshed with
someone, there's always their personals sections and meat-market
chat rooms for folks of virtually every persuasion imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; E! Online (www.eonline.com) is conducting an online sex poll
whose results will be released on Valentine's Day. Go give 'em your
opinions on such things as your favorite hearthrob performers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Love Shack
(www.tripod.com/promotions/valentine/index.html) at online
community Tripod has a variety of tests to tell you whether you're
Casanova 2.0 or Codfish Release 1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Portal Excite offers a Love-O-Meter to test your astrological
appropriateness with your lover
(www.excite.com/horoscopes/fun/love(underscore)o(underscore)meter),
and a Rate Your Romance site, too 
(www.excite.com/horoscopes/fun/rate(underscore)your(underscore)roman
ce/). I was dismayed to find I'm only ``red hot'' on the
Love-O-Meter with another Scorpio. Hmmm, maybe that explains those
difficult Sagittarians, Capricorns, Geminis, Libras and Cancers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you'd rather stay in and watch a movie together on your new
DVD player, Netflix.com (www.netflix.com) has several suggestions
for good smooch films.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Think those roses at the corner flower shop are too darned
expensive for something that's going to be brown and wrinkly in a
few days? You might do better at www.12flowers.com, which is
selling a dozen for $32.95. It still doesn't sound like a bargain,
but at least on the Net, you can shop around for the best price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And if you're just a meathead when it comes to picking out
presents, try All the Right Gifts (www.alltherightgifts.com.), an
online site designed to help shoppers find the right gift. It even
has a Top 10 Valentine's Day list to help that dangerous process
along. &QL;

publicity, and arranged for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair that
made her look sexually alluring. But Ginsburg was quickly replaced
with two old Washington pros, who kept her literally and
metaphorically under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   She was initially described as a stalker by some (apparently
White House-inspired) reports, which stressed her parents' divorce
and her unstable nature. But everything that we have seen and heard
since belies that.
</P>
<P>
   She has appeared as a bright and composed figure with an
excellent recall of the events that took place around her. She has
a degree in psychology, which must have come in handy in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she spoke to President Clinton was on Jan. 5 a
year ago, when she had already been subpoenaed to give evidence in
the sexual harassment suit brought by former Arkansas employee
Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   She was angry with the president, whom she had recently seen on
television with his wife ``being romantic on their holiday
vacation.'' They discussed her affidavit, and she said goodbye,
``very abruptly,'' she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she felt for Clinton now, she said: ``I have mixed
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think he's a good president, and I assume you think he's a
very intelligent man,'' she was asked, and she responded, simply:
``I think he's an intelligent president.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The woman who alienated all America when she stood
on the steps of the Washington District courthouse and said: ``I'm
you...an average American,'' emerged Friday from half a year of
obscurity to start rebuilding her shattered image.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, whose clandestine taping of Monica Lewinsky's most
intimate confessions won her the label ``most reviled woman in
America,'' was back as suddenly as she had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a new Linda Tripp, so comprehensively ``made over''
as to be almost unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy, clumsy, boxy woman whose ponderous frame inspired
Linda Tripp look-alike contests in gay bars across the country has
lost weight (a lot), softened her hair and her make-up and revamped
her wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   She is fragile _ breaking down in tears, reportedly, during a
two-hour interview with the New York Times _ but largely
unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   Her deepest regret, she said, was the pain she had caused her
young friend, Monica. She said she saw Monica ``as a kid'' and
wanted to save her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw her as a lost soul,'' she told the paper. ``I
believe she and the country will never understand that I believed
this was in her best interest, and that makes me very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   By revealing the tapes, she says, she wanted to ``sever''
Monica's relationship with the president once and for all. ``This
was a young girl who...fell head over heels in love with the
president. He clearly did not share those feelings, and his callous
abuse in discarding Monica Lewinsky made it look as if he thought
of her as a servicing contract.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mom, especially with a daughter close in age to Monica
(her daughter is 19),'' she said amid tears, ``I would hope some
other mom would do for my daughter what I did for Monica, despite
the fact that it looks horrible, that it looks like betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times interview, which appeared Friday, was the
first of three, so far announced. She also appeared Friday on the
NBC morning ``Today'' program, and will be on CNN's Larry King Live
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She insists, however, that she has no plans to write a book,
though it was her idea for a book-length expose of scandal in the
Clinton White House that inspired her to record her conversations
with Monica.
</P>
<P>
   As she told the New York Times, she blames the New York literary
agent whom she contacted _ Lucianne Goldberg _ for prompting what
are perceived as some of her more egregious acts of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Goldberg, she said, who suggested she passed her tapes to
the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and Goldberg, who
suggested she talk to lawyers representing Paula Jones, the woman
suing Clinton for sexual harassment. (Goldberg had no comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, 49, remains employed by the Pentagon but has worked from
home since the Lewinsky affair broke.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of her ``relaunch'' on the metropolitan media
circuit was the surest sign that the 13-month scandal was drawing
to a close. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thank goodness it is all over.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, President Clinton looked bruised, vulnerable,
truculent and earnest. After going through the wringer of
investigation, trial and acquittal, he looks, well, bruised,
vulnerable, truculent and earnest.
</P>
<P>
   It is most odd. The full weight of the American Constitution has
borne down on Clinton. The high-rise moralizing of the American and
world media has toppled over on him.
</P>
<P>
   And he has emerged from the cyclone like Dorothy at the end of
``The Wizard of Oz,'' back at home behind the white picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much has changed, except that Clinton is more popular
now than a year ago. The American economy has continued to defy the
laws of both gravity and economics, and the president has continued
to take the credit for Alan Greenspan's shrewd management.
</P>
<P>
   But important lessons have been learned. Journalists, and not
just in the United States, have discovered that voters are quite
capable of deciding, if they are given the facts, that a politician
can be flawed and still be good at his job.
</P>
<P>
   And they were certainly given the facts. However, although
journalists may have contributed to the hysteria preceding the
successive waves of salacious revelation, they were not responsible
for the revelations themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the president himself who caused the gross invasion of
his own and Monica Lewinsky's privacy. If he had only pleaded the
Fifth Amendment _ the right not to incriminate himself _ in the
Paula Jones case, he would not have lied about his affair with the
intern.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrogance of power, he could not have foreseen that he
would be tripped up by a caricature Nemesis called Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, knowing more than any of them could reasonably
have wanted to know, the American people decided none of it
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Their verdict was transmitted through the machinery of the
Constitution, which may not be as good as American patriots think
it is, but which is nevertheless a magnificent democratic
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the president was more than fully aired and the
right result was achieved: Clinton was humiliated and embarrassed,
but endorsed as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Republican Party has learned something too,
although it is too shell-shocked to know what it is. The one person
who seems to have learned nothing is Kenneth Starr, whom Mrs.
Malaprop might have described as the ``independent persecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote may not be, of course, the absolute end of the
story because Starr shows every sign of wanting to bring criminal
charges against his quarry in the ordinary courts.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether he can do this while Clinton is still in
office, but as Starr's commission lasts for one year after the
president leaves office, he will certainly be able to do it then.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's coda apart, though, the world can breathe a sigh of
relief and turn to more important matters. Clinton has a world to
lead and a place in history to secure.
</P>
<P>
   And it is in foreign policy that he needs to work hardest in
order to make up for lost time. For, although the agonies and
distractions of the impeachment process have had surprisingly few
ill effects in domestic affairs, damage has been done to America's
moral authority abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton bombed an aspirin factory in the suburbs
of Khartoum in order to draw attention away from his broadcast
admission, two days before, of a relationship with Lewinsky that
was ``not appropriate'' and ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That was inexcusable, and it is noticeable that no evidence has
since been produced to substantiate the claim that it was making
chemical weapons. Not in America, and not here, despite the British
government's fulsome support for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   It was illegal, but it was also a big tactical error, because it
will have fuelled the sense of Arab Muslim grievance against the
U.S. and its allies _ the sense of grievance which inspires the
same fundamentalist terrorists against whom the bombing was aimed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Clinton has the chance to look forward over the
next two years and to redeem himself as the last 20th-century
president.
</P>
<P>
   There is bound to be a worry that he only operates well _ and
when he operates well, he is undoubtedly a brilliant politician _
when he is under pressure. He may be tempted to relax into an
extended transition to an Al Gore presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of a world which could see the rule of law
increasingly take the place of the superpower rivalries which once
held sway, it is to be hoped that Clinton feels the goad of the
historian's pen in the small of his back.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, human rights and a sustainable ecology require an
attentive leader of the most powerful nation.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot escape the fate of being the president who brought the
Oval Office into bawdy ridicule. But now that he has been
acquitted, he has the chance to add to that the distinction of
being the first president to emerge strengthened from impeachment,
and the first to translate the high ideals of the American
Constitution, which in the end served him well, into international
law. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are those who think it will end up as Much
Ado About Nothing, at least as far as the country, its political
culture and its institutions of government are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the whole impeachment drama will have much
long-term impact on anybody or anything except President Clinton,''
said former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn., who made his name
during the Watergate hearings. ``And even the impact on him is
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the eminent historian, begs to
differ. A Democrat who served John F. Kennedy as a White House
adviser, he sees the travail of President Clinton as an event of
considerable moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failed impeachment of Andrew Johnson left a wounded,
weakened presidency, one that lasted for many years,'' Schlesinger
said, ``and I think the failed impeachment of Bill Clinton will do
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was imprudent to predict many months ago how the drama
would end, as it finally did Friday, to the relief of almost
everyone, it might be considered downright foolhardy to guess at
its consequences. But that does not stop Washington or
Washington-watchers elsewhere from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Few people doubt that the events of the last year have coarsened
the national political discourse. It is as if Clinton's own habit
of pushing the limits _ ``indulging all choices and accepting no
consequences,'' as Rep. James E. Rogan of California, one of the
House managers, put it last week _ infected the behavior of all the
major players.
</P>
<P>
   The capital has witnessed the breakdown of long-standing codes
of behavior on every side. Senior Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee accused their Republican counterparts of staging a coup
d'etat; Trent Lott, the leader of the Republican majority in the
Senate, strongly suggested that the president was bombing Iraq to
deflect attention from his domestic political problems. The conduct
of the independent counsel in the Lewinsky case, Kenneth W. Starr,
has attracted so much opprobrium that Congress is considering
allowing the Watergate-era law authorizing independent counsels to
lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the news media, a ravenous appetite for scandal has
developed. More salacious details about politicians have been
talked about and written about than at any time in modern history,
and the mainstream media have joined less well-established and more
marginal outlets in the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Monica and Bill and Ken and Henry has revulsed a
large portion of the American people, it has turned off foreigners,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A story with no heroes, no morals, no lessons,'' the Financial
Times of London called it last weekend, ``just self-obsessed
individuals in a fight for survival, a vast landscape painting of
life as it truly is in Washington at the turn of the millennium, a
Guernica of overfed egoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how permanent is the damage? Is the nation
witnessing merely an extreme example of Jefferson's maxim that ``no
man will ever bring out of the presidency the reputation that
carries him into it,'' or something much more substantial?
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Senate feel that the constitutional system worked in
the Clinton impeachment just as well as it had worked 25 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue that the House overstepped the line by
impeaching the president,'' said Sen. John S. McCain, R-Ariz., who
voted to convict Clinton on both articles. ``You can argue that we
should have removed him from office. But for me, the point is that
the process went forward the way the Framers intended. That
revalidates the Constitution and it means that whatever happens to
the reputation of individual presidents, the presidency remains
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who presided over the trial,
took leave of the Senate with compliments for the way it had
comported itself.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most ardent loyalists doubt that Clinton has besmirched
his reputation, more or less permanently. Even those who denounced
the whole impeachment process as a Republican vendetta denounced
the president's conduct in the next breath, using savage adjectives
like ``shameful,'' ``despicable'' and ``disgraceful.'' Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who fights his party's corner as hard
as any man, said this week: ``History will judge his actions and
significant lapses of judgment harshly, as it should.'' Statements
like that will make the revisionists' work harder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In a thousand books yet to be written, the word ``impeachment''
will cling to the name ``Clinton'' like a limpet. But there may be
other, kinder words as well. It may be that history will remember
Clinton as something more than the second president ever to stand
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Nixon managed a partial rehabilitation of his name,
and he was driven from office, as Clinton was not. Through his
writings and the urgings of those who had worked for him, through
the success of some of his policies, Nixon came to be seen as an
intelligent, accomplished president brought low by tragic flaws.
That cheers Clinton's acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   The president's rehabilitation effort began Friday, and how well
it succeeds will depend in part on what he is able to achieve in
his remaining 23 months in office. Some signs are positive: the
collegial attitude of the new speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.;
Clinton's demonstrated ability to score at least limited successes
abroad, as in the Middle East, even when the going was toughest at
home; his continued high standing in the polls, and the astonishing
buoyancy of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the ominous polarization that has plagued Washington has
been intensified by the impeachment process. Clinton was impeached
by the House along party lines. Ten Republicans in the Senate
joined all the Democrats in voting to acquit him of perjury, and 5
voted to acquit him of obstruction of justice. But they were mostly
northeastern moderates who vote with the Democrats on important
policy issues fairly often, and not mainstream Republican
conservatives with no history of breaking party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's credibility has been severely damaged, which could
prove a serious handicap in future negotiations with Congress. Rep.
Tom DeLay of Texas said of the president a few weeks ago, ``I don't
believe a word he says.'' Democrats dismissed that as the ranting
of a Republican bomb-thrower. But it is not as easy to discount the
statement this week by Senator Richard G. Lugar, a level-headed
Republican from Indiana, who said during the final deliberations
earlier this week, ``He is not trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as predicted, Clinton mounts a campaign to punish the House
prosecutors at the polls next year, that will certainly do little
to advance his legislative agenda. And if, as his State of the
Union speech suggested, he veers away from his centrist,
smaller-government philosophy to reward the liberals who have stood
beside him, that could hurt him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another imponderable is Starr's follow-up to impeachment. If he
tries to indict Clinton before the president leaves office, that
would put a crimp in a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot harder to calculate how much the office, as opposed
to the man, has been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger looks to the 19th century and the example of Andrew
Johnson, and it is undeniable that he was followed by a succession
of second-rate presidents of both parties. The parade of
mediocrities lasted for three decades, until the election of
Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   But were the presidents of that day passive because Johnson's
impeachment had undercut the authority of the White House, or
because they and the American public saw little need for boldness
or innovation? It was an era, like the present one, when government
did not seem of major importance to the average citizen and much of
politics was mere shadow-boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, of course, problems built up, unaddressed if not
unidentified, notably the concentration of capital in the giant
trusts and the victimization of labor. But when President Roosevelt
_ it was he, remember, who first called the White House ``a bully
pulpit'' _ decided to confront those problems, he found ample
reservoirs of strength to do so in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Those like Sen. Baker who look to this century and the example
of Richard Nixon see a political system tough and resilient enough
to snap back quickly, even in a day of new media for whom little is
sacred and even in a day when fewer and fewer moderates find their
way to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, it is true, recovered even more quickly than
Nixon himself. Like Theodore Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, who took
office only six years after Nixon left it, found all the
presidential power he needed to impose lasting changes on American
politics and government, despite widespread earlier assertions that
Nixon had all but destroyed the office.
</P>
<P>
   But not even presidents with policies as popular as Reagan's and
Clinton's have been able to restore the reputation of the federal
government among American voters. Fewer and fewer pay attention to
what happens in Washington; fewer and fewer vote. Just the other
day, Curtis Gans, the leading student of the nation's voting
patterns, reported that the turnout for last year's midterm
elections had been the lowest in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism fuels that disturbing trend. Cynicism began growing in
the United States during the Vietnam war; it increased during
Watergate, and it may have reached a peak this year, with more than
half the public telling pollsters, the president lied under oath,
but leave him where he is.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical subtext of that dichotomy, what most Americans see
when they turn their eyes on Washington, is four words: ``They all
do it.''

   IMPEACH-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton makes a
statement Friday after the Senate votes on the articles of
impeachment. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS _WASHINGTON _ Now that impeachment is finally
over, how is national politics affected? While races for the White
House, Senate and House will all be conducted in impeachment's
shadow, the closely divided House may be touched the most. The
White House says it will surely raise money and campaign hard to
regain a Democratic majority there, though it denies a ``Clinton's
revenge'' strategy to target the House members who pushed
impeachment the hardest. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TEXANS _WASHINGTON _ Texas's two senators, Republicans
Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, discuss their votes Friday on
the articles of impeachment against president Clinton. (Dart, Cox

<P>
   IMPEACH-REACT _ Many Americans seem blase about the impeachment
that's expected to end Friday with acquittal. How will the episode,
certainly a watershed political and historical moment, be viewed in
coming decades and centuries? We talk to some historians, political
scientists and presidential scholars for the long view. (Copelin,

   IMPEACH-BARR-HOME _ ATLANTA _ Talker out of the 7th District
about how constituents view Bob Barr now _ from his being one of
the earliest Republicans to use the I-word, to his role as one of
the House managers in the impeachment trial _ and whether his
prominent and sometimes confrontational role could hamper his
re-election bid. NYT story of Thursday says Dems will be targeting
seats of impeachment managers. Is there a Democrat who can get the
financing to take on Barr, who has not shown a wide victory margin
in races against underfinanced Democrats. (Bennett, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15-18.

Blassie (the other set is believed to be in storage at the

metro Atlanta, in a State House ceremony Feb. 18. Among the photos,
which are of varying sizes and were on display at the

   JUDICIAL-ELECTION _ A bill lobbied by Chief Justice Tom Phillips

states. Phillips' proposal answers criticism brought by the latest
60 Minutes scrutiny of the Texas judicial selection process.

   TX-CONSTITUTION _ Though rewriting the Texas constitution is a
top concern of the state's two budget-writers, Texans rank it dead
last in a recent poll asking about the relative importance of
various state issues. Will this affect the plan's chances?
(McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman).

<P>
   TEX-LEGIS-GAYADOPT _ AUSTIN _ Gays and lesbians would no longer
be allowed to adopt children under bills filed by Rep. Warren
Chisum, R-Pampa, and Rep. Robert Talton R-Pasadena. Chisum and
Talton say that children are better off in traditional family
situations. Opponents note that gays and lesbians often adopt
children with ``special needs'' who might not be adopted otherwise,
and that the bills would prevent straight parents who die or can no
longer care for their children from leaving them with gay siblings
or friends. We visit with some of the people who would be affected
and scrutinize the data marshaled by both sides. (Greenberger,

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thank goodness it is all over.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, President Clinton looked bruised, vulnerable,
truculent and earnest. After going through the wringer of
investigation, trial and acquittal, he looks, well, bruised,
vulnerable, truculent and earnest.
</P>
<P>
   It is most odd. The full weight of the American Constitution has
borne down on Clinton. The high-rise moralizing of the American and
world media has toppled over on him.
</P>
<P>
   And he has emerged from the cyclone like Dorothy at the end of
``The Wizard of Oz,'' back at home behind the white picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much has changed, except that Clinton is more popular
now than a year ago. The American economy has continued to defy the
laws of both gravity and economics, and the president has continued
to take the credit for Alan Greenspan's shrewd management.
</P>
<P>
   But important lessons have been learned. Journalists, and not
just in the United States, have discovered that voters are quite
capable of deciding, if they are given the facts, that a politician
can be flawed and still be good at his job.
</P>
<P>
   And they were certainly given the facts. However, although
journalists may have contributed to the hysteria preceding the
successive waves of salacious revelation, they were not responsible
for the revelations themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the president himself who caused the gross invasion of
his own and Monica Lewinsky's privacy. If he had only pleaded the
Fifth Amendment _ the right not to incriminate himself _ in the
Paula Jones case, he would not have lied about his affair with the
intern.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrogance of power, he could not have foreseen that he
would be tripped up by a caricature Nemesis called Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, knowing more than any of them could reasonably
have wanted to know, the American people decided none of it
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Their verdict was transmitted through the machinery of the
Constitution, which may not be as good as American patriots think
it is, but which is nevertheless a magnificent democratic
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the president was more than fully aired and the
right result was achieved: Clinton was humiliated and embarrassed,
but endorsed as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Republican Party has learned something too,
although it is too shell-shocked to know what it is. The one person
who seems to have learned nothing is Kenneth Starr, whom Mrs.
Malaprop might have described as the ``independent persecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote may not be, of course, the absolute end of the
story because Starr shows every sign of wanting to bring criminal
charges against his quarry in the ordinary courts.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether he can do this while Clinton is still in
office, but as Starr's commission lasts for one year after the
president leaves office, he will certainly be able to do it then.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's coda apart, though, the world can breathe a sigh of
relief and turn to more important matters. Clinton has a world to
lead and a place in history to secure.
</P>
<P>
   And it is in foreign policy that he needs to work hardest in
order to make up for lost time. For, although the agonies and
distractions of the impeachment process have had surprisingly few
ill effects in domestic affairs, damage has been done to America's
moral authority abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton bombed an aspirin factory in the suburbs
of Khartoum in order to draw attention away from his broadcast
admission, two days before, of a relationship with Lewinsky that
was ``not appropriate'' and ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That was inexcusable, and it is noticeable that no evidence has
since been produced to substantiate the claim that it was making
chemical weapons. Not in America, and not here, despite the British
government's fulsome support for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   It was illegal, but it was also a big tactical error, because it
will have fuelled the sense of Arab Muslim grievance against the
U.S. and its allies _ the sense of grievance which inspires the
same fundamentalist terrorists against whom the bombing was aimed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Clinton has the chance to look forward over the
next two years and to redeem himself as the last 20th-century
president.
</P>
<P>
   There is bound to be a worry that he only operates well _ and
when he operates well, he is undoubtedly a brilliant politician _
when he is under pressure. He may be tempted to relax into an
extended transition to an Al Gore presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of a world which could see the rule of law
increasingly take the place of the superpower rivalries which once
held sway, it is to be hoped that Clinton feels the goad of the
historian's pen in the small of his back.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, human rights and a sustainable ecology require an
attentive leader of the most powerful nation.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot escape the fate of being the president who brought the
Oval Office into bawdy ridicule. But now that he has been
acquitted, he has the chance to add to that the distinction of
being the first president to emerge strengthened from impeachment,
and the first to translate the high ideals of the American
Constitution, which in the end served him well, into international
law. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ How do you say I love you? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a poet, a lyricist, a novelist or screenwriter, the
challenge is neverending. But for the rest of us Jacks and Jills,
there is Valentine's Day. And what do we do? Cede our heartfelt
feelings to Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what we think, for most of us the muse of poetry has
long ago moved away without leaving a forwarding address. But do
you really want to express your love with some drippy lines written
by God-knows-who in a little cubicle in Kansas City?
</P>
<P>
   Like love, love lines are in the air. Or in some cases on the
airwaves in songs and movies and even verse. Lose your Hallmark
habit. OK, you can buy a Hallmark card, but buy a blank one. If you
really care enough to send the very best, write your own epistle to
the object of your affection. You don't have to pretend to be
Shakespeare in love, but you can borrow from the Bard and others to
tell the one you love how you feel.
</P>
<P>
   So here are some suggestions to get you started. But whether
it's from the king or Rick in Casablanca, remember it can be simple
or profound, long or short. But one suggestion _ keep it sweet.  &UR;  &QL;

mine?  &UR;  &QL;

For all the wrong that you made right &QL;

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
   WASHINGTON _ There were moments during the long hours he spent
presiding over the impeachment trial when Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist lived up to his billing as stern and controlling. A
request one day from Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican
leader, that his fidgety fellow senators be granted a break was met
with a prompt denial by the chief justice, who is renowned at the
Supreme Court for keeping things moving.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But for the most part, having found himself adrift in a process
he could do little to steer, Rehnquist went with the flow. And by
the time the trial had come to an end early Friday afternoon with
President Clinton's acquittal, the nation's ranking jurist was
drily tossing off one-liners to the 100 erstwhile jurors sitting
before him and gamely allowing himself to be used as a prop in a
let's-put-this-behind-us display of bipartisanship orchestrated by
Lott and the Democratic leader, Sen &UR; .  &LR; Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chair wishes to make a brief statement _ without objection
I trust,'' Rehnquist said to titters of laughter a minute after
formally declaring Clinton acquitted of the two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Having come to the Senate as a stranger to most in the chamber,
the chief justice said to more chuckles, ``I underwent the sort of
culture shock that naturally occurs when one moves from the very
structured environment of the Supreme Court to what I shall call,
for want of a better phrase, the more free-form environment of the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   As one used to getting the last word on most issues that come
before him, Rehnquist could not resist a final judgment, and his
verdict seemed to be that the Senate had done well, though perhaps
best when it debated behind closed doors with the television
cameras turned off. Hardly surprising from a justice known to abhor
the idea of trials being played out before cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave you now a wiser, but not a sadder man,'' Rehnquist
said. ``I have been impressed by the manner in which the majority
leader and the minority leader have agreed on procedural rules in
spite of the differences that separate their two parties on matters
of substance. I have been impressed by the quality of debate in
closed session on the entire question of impeachment as provided
for in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having served on the Supreme Court for 27 years, more
than 12 of them as chief justice, Rehnquist's stint overseeing the
impeachment trial was the first time most people had a chance to
see him in action. His weeks in the limelight hardly left him with
the same kind of place in the popular culture as, say, Judge Ito or
Judge Wapner, but he had his moments.
</P>
<P>
   Who, for example, has not heard about how the Gilbert and
Sullivan-loving chief justice designed his own robes, with their
trademark four gold stripes on each sleeve, after admiring the
costume worn by the Lord Chancellor in a production of
``Iolanthe''? (It's a good thing he didn't see ``La Cage aux
Folles,'' the satirist Mark Russell cracked the other day.)
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment proceeding drew to a close, Lott and Daschle
made it particularly difficult for Rehnquist to maintain an air of
complete dignity. Like game-show hosts congratulating a departing
contestant, they presented him with a plaque holding a golden gavel
to commemorate his brief reign in their midst before ushering him
on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a small token of our appreciation,'' Lott said,
apparently so concerned about being a good loser in the game of
impeachment that his first thought upon defeat was to thank the
referee.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after pausing to request that Rehnquist enter into the
record three last affidavits, Lott asked that the chief justice be
escorted from the chamber.

SENATE ACQUITTAL BRINGS DEEP APOLOGY FROM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND And JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate acquitted President Clinton Friday of
perjury and obstruction of justice charges stemming from the
nagging sex-and-cover-up scandal at the White House, eliciting the
deepest public apology yet from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Senators decisively rejected House prosecutors' appeals for the
Senate to convict and remove Clinton from office for hiding a
sexual dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
from special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and lawyers for Paula Jones,
a former Arkansas state employee who filed a civil sexual
harassment suit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Republicans broke ranks with the 55-member GOP majority to
join 45 Democrats and acquit Clinton of allegations that he
committed perjury. That vote was 55 to 45 in favor of acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the same Republicans, all from states in the Northeast
that voted for Clinton in the last two presidential elections,
defected a second time to align themselves with Senate Democrats to
acquit Clinton of obstruction of justice charges on a vote of 50 to
50.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors pressing two articles of impeachment lodged
against Clinton by the House on Dec. 19 needed two-thirds of the
Senate, or 67 of the 100 members, to convict and remove the
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's acquittal had been a foregone conclusion since Jan. 27
when 44 Democrats voted to dismiss the charges _ 10 more votes than
needed to defeat conviction and removal. The Senate also rejected
moves to censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action means the nation's 42nd president will be free
to complete the final 23 months of his eight year term, though he
will go down in the history books as only the second president to
be impeached. The other impeached president, Andrew Johnson, who
succeeded to the job after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln,
escaped conviction in the Senate by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained in the private White House residential quarters
during the vote. Aides said he did not watch the voting on
television, but received telephone updates on senators' votes from
White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   The president, wearing a somber expression, emerged from the
White House two hours after the Senate acquittal to stand alone in
the Rose Garden on a blustery afternoon with storm clouds closing
in to apologize for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American
people,'' Clinton said. He spoke in slow, deliberate tones, his
facial expression mournful, his gray hair tousled by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who fought impeachment by portraying himself as a busy
chief executive ``doing the nation's business,'' said the
conclusion of the Senate trial signals that it is time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I ask all Americans _ and I hope all Americans _ here in
Washington and throughout our land, (to) rededicate ourselves to
the work of serving our nation and building our future together,''
Clinton said. ``This can be _ and this must be _ a time of
reconciliation and renewal for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had already turned to climb the stairs to return to the
Oval Office when he returned to the podium to respond to a question
from ABC News' correspondent Sam Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your heart, sir, can you forgive and forget?'' Donaldson
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was reported earlier to be planning revenge against
the House prosecutors, replied: ``I believe any person who asks for
forgiveness has to be prepared to give it.'' White House officials
have denied there is any plan to single out the House members in
the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance was in sharp contrast to the bristling pep
rally that he staged at the White House last Dec. 19 following the
House vote to impeach him. Then, First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., joined more than 100 House Democrats flanking the president
as he defiantly vowed to continue working for the American people
``until the last hour of the last day of my term.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the first Senate impeachment trial of an elected
president in American history rushed to proclaim an end to partisan
differences and appeal for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who voted to convict
Clinton on both charges, said future cooperation with the White
House ``won't be easy, I'm sure, for a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott added: ``We're going to move forward legislatively, and
if he'll join us, that would be fine. We have to deal with him as
long as he's president.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president would meet with bipartisan
Senate and House leaders to seek possible cooperation on
legislation and the fiscal 2000 budget after Congress returns from
a week-long recess on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors voiced support for reconciliation even though
the 13-member team failed to assemble a simple Senate majority on
either charge against Clinton, much less the two-third vote
required to convict.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled House began grappling with the
allegations against Clinton on Sept. 9 when it received a report
from Starr following the special prosecutor's no-holds-barred eight
month investigation.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he
had ``no regrets,'' adding: ``We must all now look forward to the
many challenges facing our great nation in a spirit of
reconciliation, not revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., underscored House
acceptance of the outcome, saying: ``There will be post mortems _
but not from members of this committee and not from House
managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., was alone in voicing implicit
criticism of the Senate. House prosecutors ``sought the truth, laid
out the facts, applied the law, applied Senate precedents, and it
scared some members of the Senate,'' Buyer lamented. ``It's
unfortunate that they didn't follow through on their conscience and
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Senate vote, police evacuated the Senate
chamber, galleries and nearby offices for 75 minutes following a
telephone bomb threat to a local business in which the caller said
a bomb would go off in the Senate at 2 p.m.

</P>
<P>
   Senators voiced little interest in taking up a proposed
resolution of censure drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
The proposal urges Senate condemnation for Clinton's ``shameful,
reckless and indefensible'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, blocked introduction of the censure
resolution on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Key Democrats balked, too, indicated they won't be eager to take
up a censure resolution after returning from the congressional
recess on Feb. 22. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., weighing whether to
challenge Vice President Al Gore for the 2000 Democratic
presidential nomination, said: ``I don't want to go back into it.
It's over. Let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators appeared exhausted as they headed home. Lott said
senators had no appetite for plunging into a debate on a
post-impeachment resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a general agreement that developed that we
need to do this job and then recess, go home, be with our
constituents, and then come back and begin work on the legislative
agenda,'' Lott explained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans a comeback effort in coming days, with a two-day
visit to Merida, Mexico, for a summit with Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo and a nostalgic trip to New Hampshire next Thursday
for fund raising and to recall his comeback second-place finish in
the nation's first presidential primary in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Lewinsky said the 25-year-old former White House
and Pentagon staffer watched the Senate voting on television. With
the trial concluded, Lewinsky was expected to move forward with her
planned prime-time interview with ABC News' correspondent Barbara
Walters.

A HORRIFIC `PARADISE' FOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' is a wonder. Larry Clark, the
writer-director of ``Kids,'' pulls you waist-deep into the scabby,
feculent world of petty crime, and James Woods has added another
crusty layer of mastery to his world of sociopaths. In
``Paradise,'' he's Mel, the glittery-eyed hood who seduces Bobbie
(Vincent Kartheiser) into his way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradise'' is also a love story, although it seems to be the
story of Clark's continuing infatuation with tender flesh. Clark
rapturously photographs Kartheiser as he languorously brings
cigarette after cigarettes to his pink scar of a mouth, puffing on
Marlboros that are almost as thick as his slender wrists. He shoots
the reedy Kartheiser as if he were the latest ``jeune fille'' to
grace the cover of Marie Claire, and to Clark, the kid may be just
that.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the director's job to carve out a believable world, then
Clark has done his job. This planet of lowlife, barely a step up
from pond scum, is a perversely loving family. The greasy, potent
Memphis soul that slowly cooks on the soundtrack is a specific
complement to the movie; it echoes the sounds that Mel pumps out on
the 8-track player of his cherry 1973 Coupe de Ville, a rolling
mac-mobile that's the only suitable carriage for a king. All Mel
wants to do is pass on his skills and attitudes to his young
protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradise'' is also a horror story, because Mel and his
girlfriend, Syd, (Melanie Griffith) are the last people you'd ever
want to spend time with your child. Woods, with his captivating
alternation between caring and bluster, is affectionate and daring.
And he's capable of anything. Clark's achieved something alarming,
a low-budget crime story that doesn't attempt to make us care about
the crooks who populate his world. But you can't take your eyes off
them. Bobbie falls in love with this pathetic pair of surrogate
parents. And Mel abuses him as surely as his real father must've.
Mel's eyes pop with anger, his mouth goes slack and a trail of
viciousness spews out of him. Then, his eyes rolling contemptuously
back into his head, Mel offers an apology, ``It's the booze, kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bobbie's girlfriend, Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner), doesn't
take to the life. After the foursome barely escapes a botched drug
deal with their lives, Rosie's haunted and depressed. Curled up
like an infant, she nestles into Syd and cries. ``Paradise'' may
meander, although that makes it feel like it's being told by a real
heroin addict. The performances of Woods and, surprisingly,
Griffith, have the frayed, exhausted rhythm of reality. Griffith's
anxious attempt to be maternal _ she really cares for these kids _
can't compete with her dysfunctional ties to Mel. It's as if she's
been tattooed onto him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids'' was fascinating for about 20 minutes or so because it
was like watching a child pornographer proudly showing off his
video album. But the kids who were supposed to carry the story
weren't good enough actors by a long shot _ each tiresome boast was
like another cigarette butt tossed onto an ashtray. But Clark seems
to have advanced a step in directing. The grown-up acting of Woods
and Griffith adds a broken-down, hostile life to ``Paradise.'' It's
said that the movie's final edit was made by the producers, but
Clark's skill with the actors is evident. Who'd have thought that
anybody could get a performance out of Griffith at this point, but
she comes through with a jittery, junkie's tenacity. And Gregson
Wagner's vacant hurt stays with you. It's the best she's ever been.

   As Z.Z. Hill once said, I want to talk to the fellas a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Fellas, the big day is here. If you've got a gal, and you've got
a brain, you've made reservations at a nice restaurant (I said
nice; at minimum a waitperson and no plastic utensils, OK?), you've
gotten her a present, you've long ago ordered the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   You're not whining, either, because A) she puts up with you
24-7-365, a minor miracle in itself, and B) she's so incredibly
adorable in that little black dress, and you feel so good walking
down the street next to her. Moreover, you're acting like you're
enjoying all this, which is not the same as just ``not whining'' _
and infinitely smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ladies can tell, they really can.
</P>
<P>
   But have you thought about the music you're going to put on when
the two of you go back to your place/her place/whoever's place and
the lights go low and all that?
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting you haven't, sport. I'm betting that when the big
moment comes, you'll either not have any music playing (big
mistake) or you'll put on something totally inappropriate
(potentially much bigger mistake).
</P>
<P>
   And this is because you didn't plan (oops) or you don't have any
appropriate music (bigger oops).
</P>
<P>
   News flash, daddy-o: Women like it when you ``make the effort.''
And having appropriate music can be most impressive: It shows you
care, shows you didn't throw everything together at the last
minute, shows you understand attention to detail. All that. It
shows you know better than to put on Skid Row, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There are many options here: Frank Sinatra's ``Close to You.''
The new Miles Davis ``Love Songs'' collection, which contains his
gorgeous version of ``My Funny Valentine,'' which is as good as it
gets, period. John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman's eponymous 1963
collaboration, as silky as fine champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Al Green's ``The Belle Album.'' Boz Scaggs' ``Silk Degrees,''
which contains the best makeout song of the '70s, ``We're All
Alone.'' Van Morrison's ``Veedon Fleece,'' which contains the
second-best makeout song of the '70s, ``Comfort You.''
</P>
<P>
   Worthy choices all. But to me, THE romantic CD to own is Roxy
Music's ``Avalon.'' Released in 1982, and the band's last studio
recording, ``Avalon'' is the ultimate romantic rock 'n' roll CD not
only because the individual songs are so spare and supple, but
because the mood is sustained throughout.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years of making records, Roxy's Bryan Ferry sang about
everything from his admiration of Humphrey Bogart to a guy who
lives with an inflatable doll to the damage a failed romance can
cause to the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avalon,'' though, is all about the good stuff: the thrill of
new love, of seeing a woman walk into a room and knowing you've GOT
to meet her. Courtship. Pitching woo. Call it what you will, it's
the sound of a guy wanting one woman above all others, and going
after her, leading with the heart, all stops out. And the subtle
music _ all spare guitar, sax and synthesizer _ perfectly fits the
lyrical content.
</P>
<P>
   On the title track, Ferry compares the mythical island paradise
of Celtic legend with attraction and falling in love. There are few
moments in rock 'n' roll as grandly romantic as this, or the
equally elegant ``More Than This.''
</P>
<P>
   When, on the latter, Ferry sings ``More than this/You know
there's nothing/More than this/Tell me one thing,'' you know he's
right. What else is there, after all, besides love? Two people
sublimely happy to be alone in a room together.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing he's found, and nothing you'll ever find, either. And
that's why you should be playing ``Avalon'' tonight, or any night
when the mood is right and the lights are low and there aren't many
words left to say.

A MESSAGE IN PSYCHOBABBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Overstated, clunky dialogue can turn a lyrical love story into a
psychoanalytical relationship story, which is one of the things
that happens to ``Message in a Bottle.'' At one point, Robin Wright
Penn and Kevin Costner tell each other something like, ``I don't
know what the boundaries are.'' Do people really say stuff like
this outside of John Gray seminars? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they do, but they shouldn't in movies, and exchanges
like this make moviegoers long for the sexually charged banter of
Bogart and Bacall, or at least the more natural-sounding words from
Nicholas Sparks' source novel. Sparks' book has some awkward
dialogue, but at least it doesn't sound like an adaptation of a
self-help manual. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wright Penn plays Theresa Osborne, a divorced mother and
research assistant for a Chicago Tribune columnist (a demotion from
the book, in which Theresa was the columnist, and worked in
Boston). Jogging on the Atlantic shore during an R&AMP;R trip, she
stumbles across the titular bottle and finds a sorrowful letter
written to a woman named Catherine. It's signed, simply, ``G.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moved by the message, Theresa takes it back to Chicago, where it
shows its magical powers by turning intelligent, professional women
into swooning saps. Theresa's boss (Robbie Coltrane), who looks
like Jimmy Breslin after having devoured Bob Greene, decides to run
it verbatim in his column. The response is enormous, turning up two
other notes apparently from the same author, and Theresa becomes so
intrigued that she finagles a trip down to North Carolina's Outer
Banks, which appear to be the letter's source. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Theresa tracks down G (for Garret, demoted from two t's in
the novel), she's pleasantly surprised to find that he looks just
like Kevin Costner. Their attraction is so immediate, you might
think the movie is missing a reel, but then it settles down as they
begin a cautious flirtation that turns into an equally cautious
romance _ er, relationship, egged on by Garret's father (Paul
Newman), who just knows that these two crazy kids are in love.
There's an obstacle, though: Garret's also in love with a ghost,
his apparently perfect dead wife, Catherine, who's referred to as
``She'' so much that she begins to sound like a deity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the movie were content to stick with the love story, it might
overcome its flaws, which include some rather slack pacing. That
could have been eliminated by tossing out an unncessary subplot
with John Savage leading a pack of Garret's in-laws in a feud over
Catherine's paintings. The feud leads to a front-porch
confrontation that must be one of the worst-directed scenes of the
past two years, and an inevitable reconciliation scene that plays
like a humorless beer commercial _ you half-expect Savage to say,
``I love you, man!'' and try to swipe Costner's Bud Light. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Wright Penn escapes with her dignity intact. An edgy,
adventurous actress, she seems out of place here; maybe after the
yell-fests ``She's So Lovely'' and ``Hurlyburly,'' she just yearned
for peace and quiet. It's instructive to see how the lead actors
handle the material: Costner takes it seriously, Wright Penn looks
like a trouper who figures it's best to keep a straight face, and
Newman, all sly crustiness, looks relieved that he has some
comic-relief lines, which allow him to get away with almost
cracking up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The movie's real love story is cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's
love affair with the Atlantic Coast, although he uses Maine as a
surrogate for North Carolina. Deschanel caresses the ocean, the
banks and even the interiors; when Wright Penn comments on how
nicely the light enters Garret's home, you want Costner to say,
``Yeah, didn't the crew do a great job?'' The Chicago scenes, on
the other hand, have a tinge of gloom _ judging from the movie, the
Tribune would be a great place to work if it weren't overcast in
the building all the time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Movies shouldn't be slavishly faithful to novels, but rather to
their spirits, and ``Message'' sticks to the heart of Sparks' book.
But it diminishes the body; although Sparks says he supports the
changes, it's almost offensive how a so-called women's picture
removes or demotes the female characters Sparks respects. It's also
said that the left brain controls logic and the right brain
controls emotion, and although Sparks' book is at least a little
balanced, the movie is so devoid of a left brain that it falls over
on its right side. There is a place for movies like this,
especially on Valentine's weekend _ the same place inhabited by
instant-coffee commercials and lite-jazz stations. If that sounds
like your cup of Taster's Choice, then this is the movie for you.
Everyone else, send out an S.O.S. to the world.

CANDIDATE GORE FACES PRESSURE TO CONDEMN CLINTON'S CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (EDs: ADDS Gore reaction to acquittal, quotes; edits to tighten)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore emerges from President
Clinton's impeachment struggle with his own presidential campaign
strengthened by the disciplined Democratic unity that helped rescue
the embattled chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president's campaign for the White House faces a
fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want Gore to
criticize the president's conduct to help the party distinguish
itself more effectively from Clinton on the hot-button issue of
personal values.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, impeached by the House for perjury and obstruction of
justice for trying to conceal his dalliance with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, was acquitted by the Senate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all condemned the president's personal conduct on an
individual basis,'' said a prominent Democratic lawmaker who has
been involved in national Democratic fund-raising efforts. ``But we
need Gore to speak for all Democrats and make our stance more clear
to help us reclaim the values issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior official in Gore's presidential campaign, speaking on
condition anonymity, said Gore may ``say something again'' about
Clinton's personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people are tired of hearing about this,''
the official added. ``They want us to start talking about their
problems and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore issued a statement Friday welcoming Senate acquittal of
Clinton and urging the nation to ``heal the wounds of this
impeachment debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``I know that President Clinton is eager to work
across party lines on these and other challenges. And I know that
his leadership will continue to be good'' for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore plans to gradually highlight differences with
Clinton on policies and programs later this spring as he shifts
into campaign mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk about what we're going to do _ and not
about what we did,'' his campaign aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, the civil rights activist who has twice
campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination, says that
Gore emerges from Clinton's impeachment fight as a formidable
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stronger because he has the absolute support of a strong
president, a robust economy and has made no outstanding mistakes,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added in an interview on CNN that he may compete against
Gore for the Democratic nomination in order to ``broaden the base
of our party.'' Gore must ``earn the nomination, not inherit the
nomination,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Patterson, a presidential campaign scholar at Harvard,
says Gore has to distinguish himself from Clinton with considerable
delicacy to avoid appearing disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former senator from Tennessee, owes his shot at the
White House to Clinton, the Arkansas governor who defied
conventional electoral strategy in 1992 by naming a fellow
southerner to join a baby-boom ticket. Gore was born in 1948,
Clinton in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Gore underscored his loyalty to Clinton in the depths of the
impeachment fight at a Democratic pep rally on the White House lawn
on Dec. 19, hours after the House voted to impeach a president for
first time in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ``acknowledged that what he did was wrong,'' Gore
said, adding that the nation must also ``acknowledge that invoking
the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of partisan politics
is wrong.'' Gore then introduced Clinton as ``my friend, America's
great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that Gore must now ``look for an opportunity to
express unhappiness with the president's conduct'' sometime over
the next month. ``You do it; you say you've done it; and you move
on,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sullivan, incoming chairwoman of the Democratic Party in
New Hampshire, the state planning to hold the nation's first
presidential primary in 2000, warned that Democrats in New
Hampshire aren't looking for Gore to condemn Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``scores a lot of points for loyalty to the president,''
Sullivan said. Gore's fidelity and commitment to his family are so
widely known that he doesn't need to highlight differences with
Clinton on values, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment behind Clinton, Gore is now free to confront
his lone declared Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, and to begin taking on potential Republican
challengers such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross
president Elizabeth Dole, wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most formidable Democratic challenger has already stepped
aside. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri announced
in early February that he would abandon a threatened bid for the
Democratic nomination in favor of efforts to help Democrats reclaim
political control of the House that was lost to Republicans in 1994
for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., have also
announced they will forego presidential campaigns in 2000. Gore
still could face challenges for the Democratic nomination from Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, as well as Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Gore well ahead of all potential Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys also show that Gore's stature has barely dimmed as a
result of six years of service in the White House. A survey for ABC
News in May 1994 found that 58 percent of American adults had a
favorable impression of Gore; a survey for Time/CNN conducted last
month found 58 percent of respondents had a favorable impression.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said Gore has emerged from Clinton's travails largely
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add it all up, I don't think that it's had a
tremendous impact on Gore,'' Sabato said. ``Gore's popularity stems
from the economy. If we continue to have a good economy, he will
continue to benefit.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who opened a campaign headquarters in Washington in early
February, is building his bid to succeed Clinton on powers of
incumbency. A Washington insider and son of a senator, he has
served in the House, Senate and White House for 22 years. Gore
crisscrosses the nation on thinly veiled political missions to
announce federal grants in early caucus or primary states such as
Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's blessing, Gore increasingly steps forward to
spotlight initiatives that court powerful Democratic constituencies
including labor unions, women, African-Americans, Hispanics and
liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointedly cited Gore's ``visionary leadership'' in his
own nationally televised State of the Union address on Jan. 19 and
followed up with praise the next day at campaign events in Buffalo,
N.Y., and Norristown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say without qualification that no vice president in
history has had so much responsibility or done so much good,''
Clinton told a boisterous rally in Norristown.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is tapping into a network of loyal Democratic campaign
donors whose contributions to the Clinton-Gore ticket and the
Democratic Party in 1992 and 1996 enabled Democrats to mount the
most expensive presidential campaign in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that Gore will easily raise the $33 million by
year's end that is permitted for presidential candidates accepting
federal matching funds. Attorney General Janet Reno last year
cleared Gore of any wrongdoing in the Democrats' controversial 1996
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential primaries are stacked early in 2000, playing
into the hands of an elected official with a built-in platform.
Some 35 states are expected to have held their primaries by March
21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has history on his side as well. Four of the five
Democratic vice presidents who have sought the party's nomination
since World War II have captured the nomination. Five of the last
10 presidents first served as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's delicate balancing act between loyalty and independence
recalls challenges faced by Vice President George Bush as he
prepared to launch his 1988 campaign to succeed Ronald Reagan and
Vice President Hubert Humphrey as he sought to succeed Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Polls asking voters about a hypothetical race show Gore trailing
two undeclared Republican presidential candidates. A Los Angles
Times survey completed Jan. 29 showed Bush, the Texas governor,
topping Gore 57 percent to 39 percent. The same study found Mrs.
Dole beating Gore 50 percent to 42 percent.

BOOKS ON LOVE THAT THE WRITERS LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOYCE JENSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  NEW YORK _ Romantics and realists alike have tried to capture
and define that frustrating, joyous, irritating, maddening,
delicious, exasperating, sensual, soul-wrenching emotion called
love. On the eve of Valentine's Day, Arts &AMP; Ideas asked some
writers what their favorite book on love was and why.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wright, author of ``The Moral Animal: Evolutionary
Psychology and Everyday Life,'' cited Paul's First Letter to the
Corinthians in the Revised Standard Version of the Bible:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I don't mean the part that advises against marriage (a
distraction from serving God, Paul says). I mean the part that now
gets read at weddings (including mine): Love is ``not jealous or
boastful, does not insist on its own way,'' and so on. What strikes
me about this passage is its contrast with the modern Darwinian
conception of love.
</P>
<P>
   In the Darwinian view, love between man and woman evolved as a
tool of genetic self-interest. Love is jealous, by design; it does
insist on its own way; it isn't ``patient and kind,'' as Paul
recommends. Sure, love seems generous at first, during the
valentine phase, but, to a hard-core Darwinian, that's just the
sales pitch. In First Corinthians, Paul is describing a kind of
love that's not natural _ or, at least, a kind that doesn't
naturally endure. But that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   Love starts out hormonal, but to mature it has to morph into
something _ if my fellow Darwinians will pardon the expression _
spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   John Bayley, author of ``Elegy for Iris,'' about his wife, Iris
Murdoch, and her struggle with Alzheimer's disease:
</P>
<P>
   I think ``The Golden Bowl'' is a fascinating account of what
Henry James thought was the difference between erotic love and
matrimonial love. The idea would be Charlotte and the prince, who
represent an erotic attraction whereas Maggie and the prince
represent something that hoards and guards the idea of love as if
it were a sacred flame. Maggie's triumph is when the prince comes
to realize that Charlotte is essentially a rather shallow and
stupid person, at least according to Maggie, and that he is really
much more in love with his wife than he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pinsky, the American poet laureate and author most
recently of ``The Sounds of Poetry: A Brief Guide'' and ``The
Handbook of Heartbreak: 101 Poems of Lost Love and Sorrow'':
</P>
<P>
   Love is like the lion's tooth. So says Yeats' Jane in his poem
``Crazy Jane Grown Old Looks at the Dancers'' (from The Collected
Poems of William Butler Yeats). Certainly it is more like a lion's
tooth more of the time than it is like a box of chocolates.
Profound writing about love embraces love's attraction with its
ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   No writer evokes love's beauty, sorrow and savagery more sharply
than William Butler Yeats, who was willing to risk absurdity, who
carried his prolonged virginity and a long unrequited love well on
into life.
</P>
<P>
   I did the dragon's will until you came. The mysterious, fiery
dragon-force of sexual passion is no more mysterious than the
attachment to one particular person, the allegiance or fixation
that supplants that old reptile domination. Love is neither a
casual improvisation nor a settled game, says Yeats' ``A Woman
Young and Old,'' but a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   I had a thought for no one's but your ears:
</P>
<P>
   That you were beautiful, and that I strove
</P>
<P>
   To love you in the old high way of love;
</P>
<P>
   That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown
</P>
<P>
   As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.
</P>
<P>
   These lines at the end of Yeats' ``Adam's Curse'' accomplish
what pedestrian narrative fiction might manage in a hundred pages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the author of ``Sex for Dummies'' and other
books on sex therapy:
</P>
<P>
   In the Jewish tradition, there is the ``Song of Solomon.'' This
is read in synagogues on Friday night and is a beautiful piece of
erotic literature. It talks about the woman lying in the garden,
her breasts exposed, waiting for her beloved. The rabbis teach us
that this is an allegory of the love between the Jewish people and
God. I do not dispute the rabbis, but I use it in teaching about
the brilliance of the sages to make Jews read this particular poem
on Friday night when it is a good deed to engage in sexual activity
with one's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Roberts, a Harlequin romance writer whose latest book is
``River's End,'' published by Putnam:
</P>
<P>
   I read Charlotte Bronte's ``Jane Eyre'' first as a young girl;
I'm sure I've reread it a half-dozen times over the years. It has
everything a reader could ask for in a love story. The heroine with
the difficult past and enduring generous heart. The brooding hero
with wealth and position, and a tragic secret. Neither looks for
love nor expects to find it. Both Jane and Rochester are strong
characters who develop a friendship and respect for each other that
adds the foundation for love. Add the madwoman in the attic and
that nebulous sense of danger throughout and you have a marvelous
backdrop for two dramatically different people who discover each
other and despite the odds and the circumstances, fall in love.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no getting around the fact that Vivienne Westwood, the
British designer, looks extraordinary. Wisps of yellow-blond hair
spill around her oval face, which has been plucked, painted and
powdered into a perfect cameo. Her lips are bright red, while her
walk is that of a slowly advancing, scepter-toting monarch.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder eyebrows fly up and forks stall between plate and
mouth when she enters London restaurants, especially with her
Austrian-born husband and collaborator, Andreas Kronthaler, who is
25 years her junior.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, what could be more English, eccentric and fun
than a 57-year-old dressmaker gliding into a room with the majesty
of a queen and the glory of a sexpot?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a woman who's an English eccentric,'' said Ms.
Westwood's managing partner, Carlo D'Amario.
</P>
<P>
   To imagine what that means, all you have to do is picture this
quaint-looking lady sallying onto the Dame Edna Show in 1989 before
eight million television viewers in flesh-tone tights and a
glimmering green fig leaf. After her famous entrance into
Buckingham Palace in 1992 to receive her Order of the British
Empire from the Queen, she obliged photographers with a triumphant
twirl.
</P>
<P>
   As she told The Daily Telegraph, ``Well, I don't wear
underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at an age when many other designers are resting on their
laurels, Ms. Westwood is taking on New York. Saturday in SoHo, she
opened her first store in the United States, a 7,000-square-foot
emporium at 71 Greene Street that will sell her men's and women's
collections, as well as more popular secondary lines. When she
shows her clothes on Wednesday for the first time ever at Fashion
Week in New York, it may or may not bring out every Westwood
groupie in town.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Westwood's career began in 1971 selling drainpipe trousers
and brothel-creeper shoes the Kings Road. In the 1970s, she was
punk rock's original queen, the housewife and art teacher who
shifted from paint pots to making fetish wear and, with her
enterprising lover, Malcolm McLaren, defined the era's vicious
mood.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot imagine the '70s without the Sex Pistols, which
McLaren managed, or the Kings Road without the daily parade of
punks Ms. Westwood helped to adorn. In the '80s, shifting
dramatically, she caught the first wave of nostalgia for the
England of formal rooms and misty landscapes, pink-coated ladies
riding to hounds, demented old aristocrats in moldering tweeds _
and sexpots in flaring crinolines.
</P>
<P>
   At almost every turn in contemporary fashion, Ms. Westwood has
been there, like Kilroy _ the first designer to make a subversive
statement with underwear, the first to show the pouf skirt (a year
before Christian Lacroix). When at the height of grunge, in the
early '90s, she announced she would make clothes in the elegant
manner of Dior, many people thought the Queen of Punk had cracked.
</P>
<P>
   As Jasper Conran, the London designer, once said in a television
documentary, acknowledging Ms. Westwood's influence, ``Vivienne's
effect on other designers has been rather like a laxative: Vivienne
does, and others follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she is one of fashion's true originators, and has
influenced the designers Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Paul Gaultier and
John Galliano, her clothes have never earned her a great deal of
money.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, most women cannot picture themselves going to the
market in an Edwardian suit with a pair of 10-inch platform shoes,
or greeting hubby in a fake fur G-string.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, Ms. Westwood is only interested in pleasing
Ms. Westwood. To her, it's a matter of integrity that her clothes
be original, exciting, rather than something she simply puts on.
``I think her creativity comes from wanting to provoke people,''
said Usha Pohl, a former assistant who is now a designer in New
York. ``She loves to shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the whole, Ms. Westwood is asocial _ practically living
in a bubble. ``She may be in fashion, but she's the most
unfashionable person,'' said McLaren, who is now writing an
autobiography in France.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived in the same cramped council flat (paying about
$400 a month) in Clapham, in south London, for 30 years, and often
bicycles to her studio in Battersea. She doesn't own a television,
rarely looks at a newspaper and can quote Bertrand Russell to a
journalist with a perfectly straight face.
</P>
<P>
   Her stature as a fashion maverick comes from being both wildly
inventive and perversely out of touch. Until recently, it has cost
her. Five years ago, her company's annual sales were just over $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after a lot of belt-tightening and product
diversification, Westwood Studios appears to be a solid commercial
success, with sales of $45 million, said D'Amario, who transformed
what was essentially a shoestring operation into a global brand. He
has done this by introducing a perfume, Boudoir; by putting Ms.
Westwood's orb logo on a range of licenses and by plundering her
extensive design archives for new and cheaper lines like
Anglomania.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amario, a member of the Italian Communist Party, has
negotiated deals with Itochu, the Japanese licensing giant (more
than 30 percent of Ms. Westwood's sales are in Japan), and he
recently acquired a building in Milan, where Ms. Westwood will open
a store this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, we are a really young company,'' he said. ``In
the '80s, we were about fashion. We did grunge. We did glamour. Now
we want to do product. People don't listen anymore to what fashion
magazines say. That's finissimo. The less we are in Vogue, the more
we sell.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, then, that Ms. Westwood arrives in New York at a
moment when, at least to fashion nabobs, her influence has waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little impact in the women's line, though I think
her men's collections have taken over,'' said Andre Leon Talley, a
Vogue editor, who has known Ms. Westwood since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Many insiders have grown impatient with her historical pastiches
and wish she would move on. ``She doesn't genuinely fit in
anymore,'' McLaren said, speaking by phone. ``Vivienne's esthetic,
pursuing this notion of history, has become rather eccentric and,
at the same time, somewhat unfashionable. Nobody gives a damn about
the history of fashion, much less the history of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She was nonplused. ``I think I'm the only one who is original,''
she said. ``I don't see anyone doing anything that doesn't come
from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas most designers take a humble slice of the cultural pie,
Ms. Westwood wallows in the whole glorious mess. She will refer to
the Industrial Revolution, Greek skeptcism, the Sex Pistols, the
decline of standards in English art schools, Picasso, sex, John
Stuart Mill _ in one sitting. ``I've always needed to explain
myself in more general terms rather than only through fashion,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The essential paradox in Ms. Westwood is that beneath her
majestic presence and newly minted intellectualism lies a
small-town person. The daughter of a greengrocer who later became a
postmaster, Ms. Westwood was born in a village in northern England.
After completing school, she took a variety of jobs, including one
in a Pickering's pea factory. In the '70s, she met McLaren, then a
beaky, self-obsessed art student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I latched onto Malcolm as somebody who opened doors for me,''
Ms. Westwood said. ``I mean, he seemed to know everything that I
needed at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of pop culture, two people have rarely seized
their moment with more audacity or provoked the British
establishment with more glee. Throughout the 1970s, the pair waged
their war from the same shop, at 430 Kings Rd. They changed the
name five times to reflect each new wave of style. Most famously,
it was called Sex, though today it is known as World's End, and is
one of Ms. Westwood's three London shops. Ms. Westwood's and
McLaren's styles were drawn from the underworlds of bikers,
fetishists and prostitutes. Moral discomfort was their pleasure,
and Ms. Westwood, especially, kept increasing the ante with
perverse slogans and graphic T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to realize _ and it was a turning point _ that you
would be a victim if you continued to think in this way,'' Ms.
Westwood said. ``It wasn't enough just to be angry. You had to have
some ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she and McLaren parted in 1983, her clothes became more
genuinely perverse, as she drew inspiration not from the streets
but from the leering comedy of such popular British entertainment
as the ``Carry On'' films, which had been part of Ms. Westwood's
provincial upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   In her well-researched biography of Ms. Westwood, published last
year in Britain, Jane Mulvagh argues that Ms. Westwood's reputation
as an innovator is equaled, and in some cases exceeded, by a
reputation for belligerence, selfishness and rudeness. Ms.
Westwood, who didn't have the benefit of a literary upbringing and
had to use other people's knowledge to gain her own, often strikes
people as terse and oblivious to social graces.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' Talley of Vogue said. ``Everyone can't be that
slick thing. You have to be tolerant of her being a little mimsy,
finicky and persnickety. The woman has great depth. She may lecture
you, but it's a lecture of love, and you come away knowing much
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Westwood said that one reason she married Kronthaler, who
was her assistant, in 1992, was so that he could remain legally in
England. In any case, she added, ``I've never felt more secure in a
relationship, if that's what a marriage is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual,'' Kronthaler said of a marriage to a woman many
years his senior. ``But I'm more happy every day. I enjoy it more
and more. I still get a lot out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were sitting in Kronthaler's office as the remains of a
lovely blue and white English day seeped through the windows.
Kronthaler looked at his wife and smiled. ``There's a lot of give
and take,'' he said. ``And Vivienne does a lot of taking. My
darling.'' He paused, watching her with affection. ``And anyway,
you take a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Westwood was silent for a long moment. Then she smiled
slowly and said, ``Well, you're very useful to me.''

JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE: MATCHING MARCO POLO WITH MISS MANNERS

 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask the man who owns one,'' Packard once suggested, on the
theory that a satisfied customer provided the best advertising. So
ask me about the two Jeep Grand Cherokees that have served my
household over four years. You can fool some of the people some of
the time, but you're unlikely to pull the wool over the Ray-Bans of
anyone who logs 60,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   I am happy to report that the Grand Cherokees I know best _
leased in succession from a suburban New York dealer _ have
performed admirably. Despite Chrysler's lingering reputation for
slipshod quality, these sport utilities have had no mechanical
problems, in contrast to the cranky Jeep Wrangler that preceded
them. (That Wrangler, which is now someone else's problem, dated
from the era when American Motors built Jeeps, sometimes not very
well.)
</P>
<P>
   The resident Grand Cherokees weren't perfect: Two radios failed
and were replaced under warranty, and trim panels on the '96 Laredo
peeled from the doors, a common problem with that model but one
that was also fixed without charge.
</P>
<P>
   The gold Laredo had also started to feel a little tired by
36,000 miles, when a black TSi took its place. That vehicle has
been trouble-free _ though I dislike the tipsy feel of its optional
``Up Country suspension,'' which is intended for off-road use. My
advice: Unless you plan to emulate Lewis and Clark, stick to the
standard suspension and highway tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Cherokee made its debut in 1992, and along with the
Ford Explorer it gets much of the credit, or blame, for the sport
utility craze. But while the Explorer was roomy and truck-like,
with body-on-frame construction and limited ground clearance that
restricted its off-roading prowess, the Jeep had a one-piece unit
body like a car, along with the compact dimensions, rugged
suspension and durable four-wheel drive that made it a tiger in the
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Any vehicle bearing the Jeep name, even if it flashes gold
wheels and a $40,000 sticker, is said to be capable of crawling
over the grueling Rubicon Trail in California.
</P>
<P>
   Like most sport utilities, our Grand Cherokees seldom blazed
trails, but their full-time four-wheel drive shrugged off the
winter snows and springtime washouts that bedevil those of us with
homes high in the mountains. This is no small matter if you've
often had to abandon cars that could not make it up steep grades
during snowstorms.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Cherokee was our original choice for several reasons,
all of them still valid: Small enough for tight city quarters, it
was big enough for four or five occupants or all the shopping bags,
folding chairs and laundry that shuttled between New York apartment
and upstate house.
</P>
<P>
   It offered a good view of the road, but wasn't insurmountably
high for older passengers. The 5.2-liter V8, while thirsty, had
enough pep for lead-footed drivers. And it felt more like a
comfortable car than a clunky truck.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 version has changed more than is apparent at a glance,
and it now has the manners of a finishing-school graduate. Chrysler
_ oops, make that DaimlerChrysler _ says only 127 small parts were
carried over.
</P>
<P>
   Two engines are new: the 4.7-liter gasoline V8 for North America
and a five cylinder turbo diesel for foreign markets; the base
engine, a 4-liter in-line 6, was also tweaked for more power. The
recirculating-ball steering and anti-lock disk brakes have been
redone.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new ``multi speed'' automatic transmission with the
V8 and a new Quadra-Drive four-wheel-drive system on some models.
That system seemed to work well, though one could feel the wheels
binding if the wheels were cut sharply when parking.
</P>
<P>
   The wheelbase is unchanged, at 105.9 inches, but the vehicle is
4.4 inches longer, 1.6 inches wider and 2.2 inches higher. Still,
the front and rear overhangs are short, to keep the Jeep from
getting hung up on logs or boulders. The door sills are lower, but
the seating position is higher.
</P>
<P>
   The styling is more rounded and fluid, from the trademark
seven-slot Jeep grille, now curved and protruding, to new
three-color taillamps. The windshield is more raked, the wheel
arches are more prominent and the side moldings look cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   New door handles, including the release for the liftgate, are
thick and substantial, and they look and feel just right.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the appearance is refined and a little sleeker, but
still very familiar. One wishes the designers had been more daring,
but clearly they were under orders not to mess with success. More
than 1.6 million Grand Cherokees have been sold; they are now built
in five locations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pushing the envelope, Jeep tried to answer owners'
gripes, like the way the side-mounted spare tire intruded into the
cargo compartment. By lengthening the cargo area three inches,
designers freed up space to hide the full-size spare tire under the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The split back seat goes down easier to form a flat cargo floor,
because the headrests are hinged to fold out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Through an information center, the driver can easily tailor 13
functions, like how long the headlamps stay on after the ignition
is shut off, to personal taste. Color-coded key fobs control ``his
and hers'' memory settings for seat, mirrors and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the '99 Grand Cherokee is the way it
handles. Hardly a bowl of Jell-O before, the new model seems much
more solid, smooth and quiet. While it would be a stretch to say it
grips the road like a sport sedan, it does hunker down in
modest-speed maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   The steering response is excellent, with less free play and far
more ``road feel'' sent back to the driver. The ride is nicely
dampened, too, though some passengers said it felt too floaty.
</P>
<P>
   The new overhead-cam V8 is 10 percent smaller than the old
pushrod engine, but it has 7 percent more power (235 horsepower, up
from 220) and 30 percent less emissions, and goes about three
highway miles farther on a gallon of regular. Peak torque is down
slightly, though, from 300 foot-pounds at 2,800 rpm to 295 at 3,200
rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the numbers, the V8s in two test vehicles were smooth
and muscular; they will dash from a stop to 60 miles an hour in 7.7
seconds, comparable with a Lexus GS 300. The multi-speed automatic
_ a four-speed unit with a long first gear and a second gear that
engages at either of two ratios, depending on speed and throttle
position _ was mostly unobtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has also been redone, and it looks swell aside from
some really phony-looking fake wood. (At least, ``Jeep'' is no
longer embossed on that pseudo-veneer, as if it it grew that way on
a plastic tree.) Bins and trays are scattered thoughtfully here and
there, though the coin holder and tissue dispenser in the center
console are awkwardly placed under a rear-hinged lid.
</P>
<P>
   All the myriad light and wiper functions have been jammed onto
two stalks on the steering column, which may be too much of a good
thing. But the steering wheel's cruise buttons (on the front) and
audio switches (on the back) are handy. A new dual-zone climate
control is said to monitor skin temperature with infrared sensors
and adjust the settings for optimal comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $26,725 for the plainest rear-drive Laredo and
$34,940 for a four-wheel-drive Limited, which tops out at about
$38,500 fully equipped. Prices for a typical model are up about
$800 from '98.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves me with just one nagging complaint about the 1999
Grand Cherokee: I felt uncomfortable at the wheel. The seat seemed
too high, the foot well seemed too narrow and the steering wheel
(which tilts but doesn't telescope) jutted awkwardly close to my
chest.
</P>
<P>
   All this I'd have overlooked, since I am taller and heavier than
the average American, if I hadn't heard complaints from others of
various sizes. A 6-foot-1 man, who loves his '97 Grand Cherokee,
said: ``I feel like everything is closing in on me. I'm pushed up
too high and too far forward.'' A 5-foot-2 woman: ``I couldn't
comfortably work the pedals.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler says that a survey of 600 early buyers turned up no
such complaints. And after taking a tape measure to old and new
Jeeps, I found that most dimensions were the same, or down just
slightly, though a wider center tunnel intrudes on the foot well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something about the spatial relationships felt so odd that
the Jeep drivers in my household strongly preferred the old model,
expressing some ambivalence to the prospect of leasing Grand
Cherokee No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   And that is too bad. Because the '99 is clearly, in so many
ways, the best Jeep yet. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonable warmth graced the Northeast and Middle Atlantic
states Friday with record highs occurring in several cities across
the region. A stark change in temperature is expected Saturday as
colder air arrives on gusty breezes from the northwest. Despite
plenty of sunshine, temperatures will remain in the 30s throughout
the day along the Northeast seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lake-effect snow showers will occur downwind of the
eastern Great Lakes as the chilly air moves across the unfrozen
waters. Several inches of accumulation are likely in the snowbelt
communities to the east and southeast of Lakes Erie and Ontario. An
inch or two of snow will also fall in the Appalachians from Maine
to the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine is expected in much of the South, though it will
be much cooler than recently. A very cold night is expected
Saturday with subfreezing temperatures likely in portions of
northern and central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the advancing chill over the eastern half of the
country, a rapid warming is expected across the western Plains
Saturday. After a frigid morning with temperatures in the single
digits, warm breezes from the west will combine with sunshine to
boost temperatures into the 50s and 60s from the Dakotas to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Rain showers and mountain snow will plague areas in the Pacific
Northwest and extreme northern California as a weak storm moves
ashore. Snow levels will hover near 3,000 feet in the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Southwest will be sunny and unseasonably warm
with temperatures in the lower 80s in the deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Ground Blizzard
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lack of snow falling from the sky, a blizzard warning
was issued for parts of northwest Montana Friday. Technically, two
criteria must be met for a blizzard to occur. Winds must be
sustained at 35 mph for at least three consecutive hours. All the
while, visibility must be reduced to one-quarter of a mile or less
in blowing or falling snow. On Friday, strong winds from the west
gusting as high as 60 mph whipped up snow on the ground, reducing
visibility to almost zero in some areas. Such a blizzard that
occurs without snow falling from the sky is called a ground
blizzard.

INAUGURAL COMPETITION FOR ARCHITECTS FOCUSES ON MANHATTAN SITE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five architects have been selected to submit
proposals for the development of a 16-block area west of midtown
Manhattan in the first competition sponsored by the International
Foundation for the Canadian Center for Architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The architects are Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos of Van Berkel
&AMP; Bos UN Studio in Amsterdam; Peter Eisenman of Eisenman Architects
in New York; Thom Mayne of Morphosis in Santa Monica, Calif.;
Cedric Price of Cedric Price Architects in London, and Jesse Reiser
and Nanako Umemoto of Reiser &AMP; Umemoto RUR Architecture PC in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Created to encourage new contributions to urban design in the
21st century, the competition offers a prize of $100,000 and will
take place every three years in a different city.
</P>
<P>
   The architects in the inaugural competition have been asked to
focus on a ``pivotal'' site running from 30th to 34th streets and
bounded by the Hudson River and Eighth Avenue. The area, which
includes the open railway cut and storage yards for Amtrak, New
Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, has been mentioned as
a possible location for a new sports stadium. The post office at
33rd Street and Eighth Avenue is not to be incorporated within the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The architects are expected to ``address the many ways in which
this site might interact with the rest of New York City and its
infrastructure,'' said Phyllis Lambert, the founding director and
chairman of the Montreal-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   The projects will be submitted to a jury and judged in June, and
are to be exhibited at Grand Central Terminal in October. A winner
is to be announced in early 2000.

DOLE AVOIDS TALK ABOUT SENATE IMPEACHMENT VOTE AT CHARITY
FUND-RAISER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Elizabeth Dole, a leading Republican almost-candidate
for president along with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, praised
volunteerism, criticized pop culture and avoided direct mention of
current White House politics in a speech Friday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Political trappings came into focus anyway, as Dole spoke at an
annual fund-raising luncheon for Neighborhood Centers Inc., which
serves low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who recently resigned as American Red Cross chief to
prepare for a possible presidential campaign, said her greatest joy
has come from public service in government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must renew the American sense that individuals can make a
difference no matter how large the challenge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest challenges include a degraded national culture, Dole
contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cities have become zones of terror. Our suburbs are no
longer safe. Violence and obscenity have become prerequisites for
entertainment as our popular culture coarsens rather than
enlightens our souls in so many cases,'' she said. ``Our children
are suffering from a daily assault by a toxic culture that is
poisoning their spirits and undermining generations of solid
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole highlighted her experience as a former Cabinet secretary of
transportation and labor, the latter under President Bush, and as a
world traveler for the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a unique vantage point from which to view the world
at its very best and very worst,'' she remarked.
</P>
<P>
   She also looked back, with no hint of bitterness, on the
unsuccessful campaign by her husband, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole,
to unseat President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was not a negative experience, and we had fun along
the way,'' she said during her 30-minute talk.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole made no mention of the Senate vote that, an hour before
her speech, acquitted President Clinton of impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she make herself available to reporters seeking comment
about her potential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who agreed to address Neighborhood Centers Inc. several
months ago before her resignation from the Red Cross, did not want
to draw attention away from the organization's event, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers brought up the potential campaign anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Baker, a Dole friend married to former Secretary of State
James A. Baker III of Houston, told the audience, ``We have a
sneaking suspicion that she might be coming back to Texas from time
to time in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chip Carlisle, president of Wells Fargo Bank Texas, said in his
introduction of Dole that he ''just can't wait`` to see what she
will do in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of Republican voters show that if Bush and Dole enter
the race as expected, they would start as the leading contenders
for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Neil Bush, one of the governor's brothers,
attended the luncheon and said afterward that Dole's speech was
``great _ really good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another local businessman in the audience, former state
Republican Party Chairman George Strake Jr., said Dole reaped
political benefits by making the speech, her first in Texas since
she started preparing for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing the smart thing by just being seen down here and
anywhere else she wants to go,'' Strake said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospects of a battle for the nomination between
Bush and Dole, Strake said, ``It's more of a beginning of a
friendlier type of campaign than it might otherwise be. Because I'm
not saying she is running for vice president, but I don't think she
would mind being on his ticket, and if it gets ugly during the
primary, (that) wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience member Bette John, a Democratic Party volunteer, said
she would not support Dole for president. But she praised the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``She talked about family values and moral character,'' John
said. ``People seem to want to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people attended the luncheon, which raised more than
$30,000 and honored former County Commissioner Elizabeth Ghrist for
her civic leadership. She has helped raise money for NCI.
</P>
<P>
   Dole praised NCI for encouraging low-income clients to become
self-sufficient by, among other things, providing child care for
working parents.

 &HT;    Audi hitches its wagon to luxury
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ North American buyers may not immediately think of
Audi when station wagons are mentioned, but the European
manufacturer actually has commonality with those vehicles
traditionally regarded as family haulers _ primarily, change. Like
the new-for-'99 A6 Avant, both Audi and station wagons in general
are putting the past far behind them.
</P>
<P>
   As the gleaming silver metallic test A6 Avant proved, today's
station wagons can draw comments about being good-looking, although
the phrase ``for a wagon'' is sometimes added. But beyond their
ability to carry five to seven occupants like the behemoth wagons
of the '60s and '70s, forget comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   The A6 Avant is a highly evolved wagon that drives, rides and
feels like a sedan. Its all-time four-wheel-drive quattro system
gives sure-footed stability much like that of a sport-utility, a
comparison wagon builders like to make.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive pricing _ the base is $36,600 _ helps Audi hold a
``near-luxury'' classification for its A6 Avant and some of the
other vehicles, helping it move out from under the shadow of BMW
and Mercedes-Benz, its prime European competitors. But the safety
features and standard equipment Audi gives the A6 Avant are likely
to convince comparison shoppers that near-luxury is an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Dual front air bags, seat-mounted air bags up front and
comfortable three-point belts front and rear are only the
beginning. Audi tries to prevent the driving blahs with the A6
Avant by using the 200-horsepower
</P>
<P>
   V-6 found in its popular and praised A6 sedan (``a relaxing car
to drive,'' Consumer Reports says).
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the Tiptronic five-speed transmission that has a
smooth automatic mode and an enthusiast-oriented feature that
permits clutchless manual shifting, the V-6 gives the 3,900-pound
A6 Avant the potential for near-respectable acceleration
(zero-to-60 mph in about 9 seconds). The large-ish doors and rear
opening mean easy entry and exit for multiple passengers and their
cargo. Space goes from 36.4 cubic feet with the rear seat up to
73.2 cubic feet with it folded.
</P>
<P>
   The interior appearance is equally impressive, thanks to the use
of attractive plastic and real wood (``Drop-dead gorgeous,'' gushes
Automobile magazine). It's comfortable, too, with 12-way power
adjustable front seats that are pleasantly firm with good support
and adjustable lumbar supports. The leatherette upholstery can pass
for real cowhide, and the test A6's heated front and rear seats and
steering wheel were very effective during cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Audi's attention to detail is evident in some of the features
that make the A6 Avant a heavily equipped car. The drink holders on
the dash and console and in the rear really work, storage pockets
on the doors have flip-out sides, and the passenger-assist handles
don't snap back after use _ they slowly glide to rest. Other
niceties include a trip computer, sizable rear heat/AC ducts, and
vertical and horizontal cargo partitions/covers.
</P>
<P>
   Start adding up those features and the few complaints about the
A6 Avant, primarily about sometimes-sluggish acceleration and some
visibility problems to the rear and sides, are easily overlooked _
as is the underlying fact that this is a station wagon, not a car.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Audi A6 Avant quattro all-wheel-drive sport
wagon
</P>
<P>
   Base price: $36,600
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $39,475
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front and side air bags, side-impact
beams, power anti-lock disc brakes
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.8-liter V-6 engine with five valves per cylinder
(200 horsepower), five-speed automatic overdrive Tiptronic
transmission with manual-shift feature.
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: package with heated front and rear
seats and steering wheel, $650; package with glass sunroof,
driver's seat and mirror memory, garage openers, $1,500; 16-inch
alloy wheels, $225.
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 17 mpg premium unleaded city, 26 mpg highway.

 &HT;    Hayes Corp. rescue elusive at auction
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The auction was held but apparently no white knight
showed up, and various pieces of Hayes Corp. were sold off Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Liquidation of the once high-flying modem-maker was not
completed, and no details are to be released until they are posted
Monday on the company's Internet site (http://www.hayes.com).
Moreover, any formal action must await ratification by a federal
bankruptcy judge in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   But the auction apparently ended with most of Hayes Corp.
effectively gone, along with hope a last-minute offer would emerge
to purchase Hayes _ lock, stock and modems. Creditors had hoped the
four-hour auction, held in Manhattan, would help recoup most of the
approximately $40 million they say they are owed. The amount raised
Friday was not available. In fact, information about the auction
itself was scarce, since attendees were required to sign a
confidentiality agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Sawyer, managing director of Volpe, Brown, Whelan &AMP; Co.,
which has been advising Hayes, would say only that ``a large number
of bids were submitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidders were permitted to make offers for Hayes' contract
rights, technology, inventory, equipment and ``general
intangibles,'' according to the order issued by U.S. Bankruptcy
Court Judge Mary F. Walrath.
</P>
<P>
   Unavailable for comment Friday were officials of NationsCredit,
the largest creditor of Hayes. Also unavailable was Steve Mank,
Hayes chief executive since January. Peter Wolfson, the company's
lead bankruptcy attorney, also did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, which once dominated the market for analog modems,
emerged from a previous episode of bankruptcy in 1996 with high
hopes only to stumble after a few months. Hayes merged with Access
Beyond at the end of 1997, fell deeper into debt and filed again
for Chapter 11 protection in October.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the liquidation in bankruptcy court is set for
April 19.

   RAC-NASCAR-BIRTH _ The Birth of a Racecar: Through interviews
with visionaries, designers, engine builders, testers and shop
foremen, we chronicle the birth of a race car. Suggest ledein that
breaks into side stories on four or five elements, but will be

information about how many cars are built each year, etc. (Levine,

   RAC-NASCAR-GORDON _ THE TARGET: As if he didn't have a large
enough target on his back . . . Jeff Gordon and his team realizes
that their domination in 1998 will make things extremely difficult
in 1999. The target wears No. 24. But Gordon thinks his team will
respond in typical fashion: Competition makes 'em faster.

</P>
<P>
   RAC-NASCAR-CHALLENGERS _ The Challengers: Mark Martin had one of

</P>
<P>
   RAC-NASCAR-RULES _ When we left 'em in Atlanta last November,

should arise. (Levine, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   RAC-NASCAR-CIRCUIT _ Bill France Jr. said at the end of the
racing season that NASCAR was pumping millions into the Busch
circuit because ``it's the second best race circuit in the world.''

   FBC-AUBURN _ The last nine months have been a public relations
nightmare for Auburn University. Beginning with the drug scandal
involving former football player Robert Baker and continuing with
the recent controversy surrounding the decision to cancel the
Florida State football game next season, Auburn has been in the
news for all of the wrong reasons. Currently, the school has the
nation's third-ranked basketball team that is one of the most
exciting in the country, but talk at Auburn has focused on the
troubles of the athletics department and the football program.
(Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is that exotic, pleasure-making activity taking
place at City Center this weekend? It is officially described as a
musical, but surely that's not the right word for this suave, silly
and zephyrlike concoction that makes you want to dance all the way
down Seventh Avenue. Anyone who has spent time on Broadway this
season knows that musicals just aren't this much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Encores series of American Musicals in Concert
is demonstrating exactly what's lacking in most song-and-dance
shows in New York, where earnest behemoths like ``Ragtime'' are
major tourist attractions. Kathleen Marshall's witty, utterly
invigorating resurrection of ``Babes in Arms,'' the 1937 Rodgers
and Hart musical, is almost too enjoyable for a theatergoer's good.
The show, which opened on Thursday, runs only through Sunday, and
then what's left for the hedonists? It will feel like the closing
of the last speak-easy in a Prohibition town.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Encores has been presenting productions of vintage
American fare that are only nominally just concerts. Although the
shows have no proper scenery and the performers carry scripts, what
happens onstage completely conjures a world in ways that make the
pageantry of Disney's ``Lion King'' seem bloodless.
</P>
<P>
   Staged and choreographed by Ms. Marshall, the series' artistic
director, ``Babes in Arms'' may feel like the freshest thing going,
but considered coldly, the musical would seem to have the shelf
life of egg salad. Its very premise is a hard-core, much parodied
cliche: A group of spunky, enterprising kids (in a Long Island
town), threatened with being sent to a work farm when their
vaudevillian parents go on tour, decide to earn their own way by,
yes, putting on a show in an old red barn.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1937, critics remarked on the slightness and sketchiness
of the book. But no one carped about the songs, a majority of which
have gone on to become pop standards, including ``Where or When,''
``I Wish I Were in Love Again,'' ``Way Out West'' and ``Johnny
One-Note.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, with Rob Fisher and his Coffee Club Orchestra
providing the music, Richard Rodgers' score, a blend of
foot-tapping swinginess and wistful caresses, is presented in
life-giving, loving arrangements. The extra bonus in hearing these
old favorites is discovering their original contexts, whose
sensibility is miles away from the sophisticated smokiness of a
cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   As heavenly as Lena Horne's or Frank Sinatra's take on ``The
Lady Is a Tramp'' may be, how refreshing to see it done as a
buoyant paean to youthful liberty by a fresh-faced, relatively
unknown actress like Erin Dilly. (Plus you get verse after verse of
deliciously rhymed Lorenz Hart lyrics that you probably didn't know
existed.) Or to realize that ``My Funny Valentine'' was first sung
about a character whose name is Valentine, a song-prone philosophy
student here portrayed with shimmering, all-American brightness by
the young Australian cabaret star David Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dilly's character is a tramp only because she likes a life
of care-free vagabondage. She's really pretty wholesome, as are all
of the lively young things in ``Babes,'' which is not to say they
are without sexual instincts. The show glows with a healthy,
frolicsome eroticism, most pointedly embodied by Jessica Stone and
Christopher Fitzgerald as a pair of Punch and Judy lovers, that is
the perfect antidote to the solemn carnality of ``The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone, who suggests an angular Joan Blondell and has comic
timing you could cut your finger on, and the Puckish Fitzgerald get
to sing ``I Wish I Were in Love Again,'' that thorny ode to the
tribulations of romance and a reminder that though the setting may
be sunny and rural, Hart's lyrics remain martini dry. It is also
danced here as a delicious pas de deux that is part embrace, part
wrestling hold.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall's choreography throughout has a souffle-light
inventiveness that makes you wonder why she hasn't been forced into
contractual perpetuity on Broadway. She does the darnedest things
with numbers ranging from the youth-on-the-march extroversion of
the title song (led by the appealing Perry Laylon Ojeda, late of
``On the Town'') to the sublimely ridiculous ``Johnny One-Note,''
in which a chorus line of Egyptian dancers making like
hieroglyphics find all sorts of uses for canoe paddles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dream ballet, prompted by the reveries of Peter
(the winningly nerdy Kevin Cahoon), a self-proclaimed communist,
after he wins the Irish Sweepstakes. The show's nimble core dance
team effortlessly takes us from Manhattan to Paris to the briny
deep (don't ask). The original choreographer of ``Babes,'' by the
way, was Balanchine, to whom Ms. Marshall nods genially while
making the dances her own.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to communism, assorted social and political issues
are raised with a frivolity that would be unthinkable a decade
after the show opened. ``Babes,'' at least in its entirety, has
been considered unrevivable because of a subplot in which a rich
Southern racist (Shaun Powell) tries to keep a pair of dancing
brothers (Scott Irby-Ranniar and Carter Anthony Williams), who are
black, from participating in the barn show.
</P>
<P>
   Here, with a little finessing of the script (whose adaptation
was overseen by no less a playwright than John Guare) and some
significant deletion of song lyrics, the brothers get to stay. This
is a blessing, because both performers are charmers, and the
9-year-old Williams tap dances with an easygoing confidence that
could give Savion Glover pause.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many treasures in this ``Babe'' to itemize. But
you should know about Melissa Rain Anderson, who plays a former
run-to-plumpness child movie star and is a musical rarity: a belter
with a velvet touch. The show's danced prologue, performed by those
departing vaudevillian parents and executed to perfection, is given
a special associative resonance by Priscilla Lopez, Thommie Walsh,
Donna McKechnie and Don Correia, who all appeared in Michael
Bennett's legendary ``Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The set, overseen by John Lee Beatty, is minimal, although the
production still convincingly evokes a plane crash and an
underwater encounter with a mermaid, while Peter Kaczorowski's
shifting colored lighting slyly matches changing moods. And the
period jokes, by the way, are still funny, despite their period
topicality.
</P>
<P>
   I'd quote a few, but somehow they wither in print. You'll have
to trust me when I say that nothing in the production gives off, as
one of Hart's lyrics puts it, ``the faint aroma of performing
seals.'' What ``Babes in Arms'' smells like is springtime.

ABERCROMBIE'S STOCK   LOOKS FASHIONABLE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Ohio)  (For Release Sunday, Feb. 14) 
(DW) 
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the fast-growing purveyor of classic,
high-quality casual clothing, is shaping up as the specialty retail
industry's ``it'' stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch &UR;  &LR; closed Friday at $74.5625, up
from a low of $29.50 in October. Analysts expect the company's
earnings to grow around 30 percent in each of the next three years.
By contrast, they expect earnings for Gap Inc., the gold standard
among retailers, to grow 18 percent annually in the period.
Abercrombie's stock trades at 32 times next year's estimated
earnings per share, versus 36 for Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts remain bullish on Abercrombie. Last month, Richard
Baum, senior retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs, named it his
favorite stock for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to Abercrombie, no company we covered ever swept all the
profitability measures,'' he said. Baum cited Abercrombie's 19.1
percent operating margins, 11.6 percent net margins and 88.4
percent return on equity, all of which are the highest of the
retailers he follows. He expects shares to hit $90 in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Abercrombie, of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, has
seen 17 percent annualized growth in same-store sales _ those for
stores open at least a year. (The figure includes estimated
earnings for 1998; Abercrombie will report results on Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the gain is attributable to what analysts call the
``cool'' fashion image it has honed: American, collegiate, upscale
yet hip. Stores look like clubs, with leather chairs and sofas,
tables and lamps. Its merchandise catalog, or ``magalog,'' as the
company calls it, has articles about the Abercrombie-correct books,
even careers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most effective has been the company's recruitment of
clean-cut college graduates to serve as ``brand reps,''
Abercrombie's name for sales people. Selected to project the right
esprit de corps, such recruits act as models of, and proselytizers
for, the chain's image.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie was a division of the Limited Inc. until a public
offering of about 15 percent of its shares in 1996. The Limited
made the break complete last May. Abercrombie now has 184
locations, and it plans to increase the number of stores by 20
percent a year. It has room to grow, analysts and money managers
said. ``There are enough attractive malls to absorb at least 500
stores,'' said Pam Milunovich, manager of the Solomon Brothers
Small Cap Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for caution. Momentum investors fancy the
shares, and could put pressure on the stock in the first half of
the year, when growth may moderate because of comparisons with
1998's big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Praveen Gottipalli, manager of Accessor Small to Midcap, bought
Abercrombie shares last April at $40 a share. But he worries about
the fickle tastes of Abercrombie's relatively narrow customer base
of younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the fashion risk is low for the chain's classically
styled clothes. Patrick Adams, manager of the Berger 100 fund,
expects higher-than-forecast earnings this year and an expanding
price-earnings ratio to push the shares to about $110 ``as Wall
Street recognizes the strength of this franchise.''

 &HT;    NOW, NATION'S POLITICAL SYSTEM IS ON TRIAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the end of the Senate impeachment trial, a new
one begins _ of a political system that has sunk to new lows in the
eyes of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as Republicans and Democrats squared off in the
House over whether to impeach President Clinton, only 36 percent of
the eligible voters turned out at the polls, the lowest in more
than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if the voters have physically turned their back on the
whole process,'' said Celinda Lake, a veteran pollster for the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Clinton's acquittal, both parties face the challenge
of halting what is widely lamented as the politics of personal
destruction and how to win back an American electorate that, for
more than a year, has been screaming at Republicans to leave
Clinton alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office of the presidency has been debased, perhaps beyond
the damage done by Richard Nixon,'' said Harry Wilson, a political
scientist at Roanoke College in Virginia. ``And the House of
Representatives has become a national embarrassment. The
partisanship on both sides is deplorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties face challenges in the post-impeachment political
world, but the Republicans' may be bigger. It is the GOP, after
all, that pushed ahead with the impeachment of Clinton despite
polls that consistently showed a healthy majority against it.
</P>
<P>
   Just five years ago, the GOP, with Newt Gingrich as its leader,
was the party of new ideas. Today, Gingrich is gone, banished
because of the party's shrinking congressional majority, and
Republican approval ratings are at Watergate-era levels. It has
become the impeachment party, or, more specifically, the
anti-Clinton party.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little evidence that the Clinton-bashing will stop
now that the trial is over. Dan Quayle vowed this week to make it
an issue against Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
nominee in 2000. And Lamar Alexander, another GOP presidential
hopeful, recently declared, ``It's not the economy, stupid _ it's
character.''
</P>
<P>
   But that rephrasing of Clinton's 1992 unofficial campaign slogan
bucks a relatively new trend in political polls showing that
competency is a more valued quality in presidents than character. A
USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll this week, for example, found that 68
percent of Americans do not believe it is critical for a president
to have ``high moral values.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling during the year-long investigation and trial of Clinton
has also shown great discomfort with politicians' personal lives
becoming public. But in the age of the Internet, where rumors are
daily fodder, there appears little chance that trend will reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question of turnout, pundits dispute how the
impeachment trauma will play out in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need only six seats to reclaim the House majority they
lost in 1994 after 40 years of dominance. And there are 14 GOP
incumbents who won with less than 55 percent of the vote in
districts that Clinton carried in both his presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts even see a chance Democrats can pick up five or
six seats to control the Senate, where 19 Republicans face
re-election as opposed to only 14 Democrats. Such a coup would
raises the prospect of a Democrat-led Congress and White House that
could launch an ambitious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats already smell blood in the water,'' said Charles
Cook, publisher of The Cook Political Report, a political
newsletter with a wide and influential audience in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 race is critical to us,'' said RNC press secretary
Mike Collins. ``This is the most important election the party has
faced in decades at all levels, including, local, state, federal
and presidential.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Keene, president of the Conservative Political Action
Committee, questioned whether impeachment will have any serious
repercussions for Republicans. ``Americans are not going to punish
a member of Congress for voting their conscience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republicans can generate a record of accomplishment that
they can take to the people, and if the party nominates an
attractive presidential candidate, then at this point, I'm
guardedly optimistic,'' said Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out for that. At best, there is an eight-month
window of opportunity this year to enact legislation before the
natural partisanship of the 2000 campaign sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a successful legislative partnership would also help
Clinton rehabilitate his tarnished legacy, much as welfare reform
in 1996 helped the president over GOP rival Bob Dole. It would be
equally beneficial to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt may
want is GOP House incumbents running for re-election crowing about
their accomplishments. It would be to Gephardt's advantage, then,
if he wants to become speaker in 2001, to stymie the legislative
partnership of Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

DESPITE AZIZ VISIT, TURKEY NOT BREAKING RANKS WITH U.S.  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey reassured the United States Friday
that despite its decision to receive a high-ranking Iraqi official,
it will continue to allow U.S. warplanes to use a base in Turkey
for attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a decision made by Parliament, and only the Parliament
can change that,'' Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told reporters in
Ankara. ``The government cannot do anything about it and does not
have the intention, in any case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has expressed displeasure at the
Turkish announcement that Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
would arrive here on Monday for talks. The visit will be made as
the United States seems to be making headway in its efforts to
isolate the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz's visit is part of an Iraqi campaign to break out of that
isolation. In recent days, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf
has visited Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia bearing letters to their
leaders from President Saddam Hussein. Al-Sahaf is expected to
visit other Arab and African countries soon.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders have told their U.S. allies that they are not
seeking to undermine U.S. policy toward Iraq. They say that as a
neighbor of Iraq they have to maintain contact with the government
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural to try to broaden our ties with our neighbors,''
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said at a news conference. He will
offer ``constructive proposals'' to Aziz, he said, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are worried about this meeting will see their
concerns are unfounded,'' Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military planes based at Incirlik in southern Turkey have
been regularly attacking Iraqi positions in response to Iraqi
violations of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq.
Several Turkish leaders including Ecevit have suggested that they
are uncomfortable with the steady raids.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Turkey are NATO allies and cooperate
closely on a host of military and political issues. But there is
growing resentment that American policy-makers have not consulted
Turkey more fully on issues related to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey was a member of the allied coalition in the Persian Gulf
war, but has not been pleased with U.S. policy toward Iraq since
the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, much of southeastern Turkey lived from border
trade with Iraq. Most of that trade has been cut off because of
trade sanctions that the United Nations has imposed on Iraq. Turkey
has lost billions of dollars, and thousands of families in the
border area have lost their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders are also unhappy about the American role in
creating and sustaining a Kurdish haven in northern Iraq. They say
it has become a sanctuary for Kurdish guerrillas who operate in
Turkey, as well as an unwelcome model for Turkish Kurds, who would
like a self-governing enclave of their own. ``The Turks want to be
players, and they don't want to give Iraq the sense that they are
100 percent beholden to the Americans,'' a senior European diplomat
based in Ankara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're suffering economically from the sanctions, and they're
living next to a mad dictator who's being bombed every day and who
might strike out against his neighbors. There's a feeling of
insecurity in the neighborhood. It's very natural that they should
want to take Iraq's pulse and see if they can start a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish military commanders, who traditionally support close
ties with the United States, would probably oppose any effort to
move the country closer to Iraq. Their concerns have been
underlined in recent days by a debate over the new Iraqi ambassador
to Turkey, Faruk Hejazi.
</P>
<P>
   News reports have identified Hejazi as a former top official of
the Iraqi intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz's planned visit to Turkey has become a major topic of
political and diplomatic speculation here, and news commentators
have focused on it.
</P>
<P>
   One called it ``no ordinary diplomatic event.'' Another,
referring to the negative reaction from Washington, said, ``This is
not exactly a crisis, but the atmosphere has certainly been stirred
up.''

A NEW WAY TO GET A GRIP  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14)

<P>
   Four-wheel-drive systems have been around about as long as there
have been cars. Until recently, they have pretty much worked on the
same principles. But these systems have been changing as four-wheel
drive has become more popular even while great strides have been
made in sophisticated electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The latest innovation is Gerodisc, used in the new Quadra-Drive
system of the 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. This is a fully automatic,
hydro-mechanical traction control device that improves traction and
handling by limiting wheel spin. Gerodisc was developed by the ASHA
Corp., an engineering company in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Using oil pumps in the front and rear axles and in the transfer
case, Gerodisc distributes the vehicle's power to any wheel or
wheels, in any proportion, to provide optimal traction. Up to 100
percent of the power can go to a single wheel, if it is only one
that has grip, and the system continuously monitors driving
conditions and changes the power distribution accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other systems in which power is distributed in
predetermined proportions _ for instance, 50 percent to the front
wheels and 50 percent to the rear _ Quadra-Drive varies the power
in infinite combinations. It does so in milliseconds and requires
no action from the driver. If the Jeep is crossing ice patches, the
wheel or wheels with traction always have the power.
</P>
<P>
   Each Gerodisc oil pump is small, about three inches wide and two
inches long, so it easily installed. It is also simple, durable and
relatively inexpensive, in contrast to costly, sensitive electronic
systems or bulky mechanical units.
</P>
<P>
   ASHA licenses the Gerodisc technology to companies that supply
axles and transfer cases to auto makers. DaimlerChrysler has
exclusive rights to the technology for one year, starting with the
introduction of the Grand Cherokee last fall. ASHA says the
technology will be used in some 2000 models other than the Jeep. &QL;

MOYNIHAN SAYS REMOVING CLINTON WOULD HAVE THREATENED CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring Senate
elder and onetime Harvard professor, told his colleagues in
preparation for Friday's historic impeachment vote that removing
President Clinton from office could destabilize the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators, do not take the imprudent risk that removing William
Jefferson Clinton for low crimes will not in the end jeopardize the
Constitution itself,'' said Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not let his misdeeds put in jeopardy the Constitution we
are sworn to uphold and defend,'' he told the Senate Wednesday
during a closed-door debate on whether to convict Clinton of
perjury and obstruction of justice. A copy of the speech was
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the five-week impeachment trial that ended with
Clinton's acquittal Friday, Moynihan was one of a few senators who
declined to discuss his views, preferring to wait until the trial
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan took lawmakers back through history as he explained why
he would vote to acquit Clinton on both impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to impeachment proceedings in England's House of
Commons from 1786, to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787,
to the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson and the
impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804. Johnson
and Chase were both impeached by the House by acquitted by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who plans to retire in 2000 after serving four terms,
quoted liberally from The Federalist, a set of 85 articles by
Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay that urged the
adoption of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   While these first constitutional scholars didn't spell out what
constituted impeachable offenses, Moynihan cited George Mason's
adage that a president had to commit ``great and dangerous
offenses'' in order to trigger removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Moynihan said, he referred to that standard
regularly. ``I found myself asking whether the assorted charges,
even if proven, would rise to the standard of `great and dangerous
offenses''' against the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Clinton shared a common theme with the
impeachments of Chase and Andrew Johnson: none was for a high
crime, Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Moynihan asserted, impeachment should be used
sparingly and only when there is a sufficient criminal threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is a power singularly lacking any of the checks
and balances on which the framers depended,'' he said. ``Do not
doubt that it could bring radical instability to American
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators shot down the obstruction of justice impeachment
article by a vote of 50-50, falling far short of the two-thirds _
or 67 votes _ required for conviction. Lawmakers also rejected the
charge of perjury by a 55-45 vote, as 10 Republicans broke ranks
and joined Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   During deliberations, all 100 senators were allowed to make a
single 15-minute presentation to colleagues during the closed-door
deliberations that began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York's other senator, Charles Schumer, a Democrat, also
voted against both articles of impeachment.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14)

 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A white porcelain cat sits atop Alexander L. Muromcew's computer
in his San Diego office, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. ``Its left
paw is raised, which means good luck in making money,'' said
Muromcew, co-manager and Asia specialist for the Nicholas-Applegate
International Small Cap Growth fund. ``Most Japanese businesses
have one of these cats displayed somewhere in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is probably more than good fortune at work in the
track record forged by Muromcew (pronounced MURE-um-sev) and his
co-manager, Loretta J. Morris, the fund's specialist for Europe.
The fund's oldest shares, series I institutional, have returned
17.7 percent, annualized, from their offering date in 1993 through
Feb. 5, compared with a 7.2 percent for the average foreign stock
fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the fund, with $149.6 million in assets, the top
performer of the 157 foreign stock funds tracked by Morningstar
over that period.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris and Muromcew are also co-managers for two other
Nicholas-Applegate funds, &UR;  &LR; International Core Growth and Worldwide
Growth, which have handily beaten their peers over their histories,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris, 45, has managed International Small Cap Growth since
its launch; Muromcew, 35, joined her in 1996. They lead a team of
10 other managers and analysts. Pilgrim America Capital recently
said it was buying Nicholas-Applegate's fund business, but
Nicholas-Applegate will keep running most of the funds, including
those run by Ms. Morris and Muromcew, as subadviser, a common
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the two co-managers is simple: to find companies
that benefit from developments that produce industry-beating
earnings growth. ``We look for a positive change in a company and
the sustainability of that change,'' Muromcew said. Such changes,
he said, can include restructuring or new products, technologies,
management and industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   Neither co-manager uses formal price targets. ``We sell a
stock,'' Ms. Morris said, ``when we've found a more compelling
investment idea elsewhere in the world or when the fundamentals of
the company we own have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fund's portfolio turnover is a steep 130 percent,
versus 68 percent for the average foreign stock fund. The portfolio
has a high price-to-earnings multiple _ 33 _ but Ms. Morris and
Muromcew said they were sensitive to the prices they pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see relative strengths, like the stock
outperforming the local markets, and that valuations make sense in
terms of earnings growth,'' Ms. Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest investments are in Japan (18 percent of the fund),
Germany (16 percent), Britain (12 percent) and France (11 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Muromcew likes Fancl, which makes cosmetics from
natural ingredients. He noticed the popularity of such products
while walking through Tokyo on a research trip last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Japanese economy and personal spending are
weak, you can find small entrepreneurial companies that target
niche markets,'' he said. ``These companies are able to identify
opportunities better than bigger, more traditional firms.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in December at 8,900 yen and predicts that
Fancl will have annual earnings growth of 20 percent over the next
three years. The shares closed at 13,400 yen on Friday, or 36 times
analysts' earnings estimates of 373 yen for next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, he likes Natsteel Electronics, a contract computer
manufacturer and assembler that is benefiting from a surge in
outsourcing. Companies like Apple Computer, Compaq Computer and
Hewlett-Packard do design work and then contract production to
Natsteel, he said. One catalyst of growth is the motherboards that
Natsteel makes for Apple's new iMac computer.
</P>
<P>
   Natsteel's earnings per share should climb 25 percent a year
over three years, Muromcew said. The fund began buying shares last
September at $2.82 (Singapore); they closed on Friday at $4.78
(Singapore), 23 times the consensus 1999 earnings estimate of 21
cents.
</P>
<P>
   One attraction in Europe, Ms. Morris said, is the recent opening
of two stock markets _ the Neurer &UR;  &LR; Markt in Germany and the Nouveau
Marche in France _ that attract high-growth companies. One of her
favorite stocks on the Neurer Markt is Mobilcom, a German
telecommunications company offering Internet access and cellular
and fixed-line telephone services. It ``is a direct beneficiary of
subscriber growth in cellular,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet access in Europe is not as extensive as in the
United States, that business accounts for less than 5 percent of
sales, but she expects it to increase to 15 percent to 20 percent
in about two years. She expects earnings growth of 170 percent in
1999 and 48 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The fund bought Mobilcom shares in April at 418 marks, or about
214 euros. The shares are now at 401 euros, or 53 times the 1999
consensus earnings estimate of 7.59 euros.

BARCLAYS NEW CEO LINKS HIS PAY   TO SHARE VALUE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Ill.)   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The newly named chief executive of Barclays PLC,
Michael O'Neill, has negotiated a compensation package that is
based on his success in turning around the bank, Britain's second
largest.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who was named Thursday and takes office March 26, will
buy 5 million pounds ($8.25 million) worth of Barclays stock, which
will be matched by the bank if he stays three years. He will also
be paid a salary of 850,000 pounds ($1.4 million) plus a first-year
bonus of the same amount and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always felt that shareholder value is more than just
words,'' O'Neill, the president of BankAmerica Corp.'s financial
services group, said in an interview. ``I felt it appropriate that
I own a lot of stock. Barclays liked the idea and was willing to
match my commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea fared well in the markets: Barclays stock gained 74
pence to close at 14.20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment means that O'Neill, who says he also has
demonstrated his resolve by putting his two dogs into Britain's six
months of mandatory quarantine for animals coming from abroad, will
face an array of problems in an increasingly competitive market.
Barclays Capital _ the investment banking arm of the company _ lost
250 million pounds ($412 million) in Russia last year. Its retail
branches are under pressure from rivals offering direct banking
services. Its credit card business, Britain's biggest, is being
eroded by American challengers offering cheaper consumer credit.
</P>
<P>
   Besides all that, Barclays, Europe's fifth-biggest bank by
market value, has been riven by a debate over future strategy that
forced the resignation late last year of O'Neill's predecessor,
Martin Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the bank's problems within Britain. The British
industry is again abuzz with talk of mergers to match the
consolidation of other European banks in Switzerland, the
Netherlands and, most recently, France.
</P>
<P>
   With experience in two big American banking mergers _
BankAmerica-Nationsbank in September and BankAmerica-Continental
Bank in 1994 _ O'Neill, 52, might be thought likely to lead Barclay
into some deals. That, he says, is unlikely. Maintaining and
expanding the Barclays position might involve ``some deals,'' he
said, ``but I don't think that requires a lot of M&AMP;A activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, he said, already has undergone the process of creating
big financial institutions that happened with banking deregulation
in the United States and the approach of the euro single currency
in Continental Europe. Rather, he said, in the next four to six
months he will focus on tightening up the relationship between
Barclays executives and the various divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of balance,'' said Sir Peter Middleton, the
Barclays acting chief executive and chairman-designate who spoke in
the same interview. Until Taylor's departure last year, there had
been talk of Barclays dividing into retail and corporate units, but
such discussion seems to have ended. Middleton has said Barclays is
``not actively considering'' the idea.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill is the first American chief executive at Barclays and,
according to Barclays, the only American head of a major British
bank. Middleton said what Barclays was looking for in a new chief
executive was the ability to manage a big and complex organization,
and a ``cultural fit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for someone I would get on with,'' Middleton
said. ``That's very important in driving things forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclays also was looking for a clean break with Taylor, a
former journalist and textile company executive. ``We were looking
for a banker,'' Middleton said. `'There is such ferment in the
banking world.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill began his career almost 25 years ago at Continental
Bank, working at its Chicago headquarters as well as in Belgium,
Hong Kong and London, where he lived for eight years. Both his sons
were born here. ``I like living here; I like the lifestyle,'' he
said, while adding that ``the nature of the job and the institution
is really what sold me.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a period as a London-based independent consultant
from 1985 to 1988, O'Neill remained at Continental and was chief
financial officer at the time of the 1994 BankAmerica-Continental
merger, a position he regained at BankAmerica in November 1995.
After last September's merger of BankAmerica and Nationsbank, his
departure was not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill will be taking over while Britain is trying to decide
whether or not to join Europe's single currency, the euro. He would
not say whether he favors the new currency. But Middleton said,
``We reckon we can do very well whether we are out, half-out or
in.'' Barclays has not taken a position, leading Middleton to say,
``It's not a bad idea for banks to stick to banking and governments
to stick to governing.''

TEXAS MURDERER WHO DRANK BOY'S BLOOD GETS DEATH PENALTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURG, Texas _ A jury returned a death sentence Friday for a
troubled high school dropout who confessed to killing a 12-year-old
boy and drinking his blood last April.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys fought for a life sentence for Pablo Lucio
Vasquez, 21, who they argued suffered from mental problems,
substance abuse and learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead prosecutor said the jury chose the right punishment
for Vasquez, noting previous arrests for burglarizing a high
school, stabbing a cocaine dealer and hurling a brick at a former
schoolmate's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an evil person, and he showed it even when he received
the death sentence,'' said Joseph Orendain, a Hidalgo County
assistant district attorney. ``It didn't faze him a bit, no tears,
no nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, jurors watched a videotaped confession where
Vasquez admitted using a lead pipe to crush the head of David
Cardenas, a popular seventh-grader. He then slit the boy's throat,
and hoisted the youth's body above him so he could drink his blood.
Vasquez also claimed he heard the voice of the devil commanding him
to kill Cardenas, and told police he tried to sever the boy's head
with a shovel to keep as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of Cardenas' mutilated body in a vacant lot in the
South Texas city of Donna, with both arms and a leg severed and his
scalp missing, fueled fears that satanic cults were at work.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Donna police had found a small dog, skinned and
deposited in an ice cooler at a busy car wash, and also found
evidence of satanic rituals in abandoned houses used by local
gangs. But Donna police investigators say the motive was more
mundane: Vasquez wanted to steal gold jewelry Cardenas was wearing
along with a small baggie of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, prosecutors introduced evidence Vasquez and
his cousin, 15-year-old Andy Chapa, left a beer party April 17 with
Cardenas, ending up at the trailer home of Vasquez's uncle in
Donna. Police say Chapa, who is facing capital murder charges,
helped Vasquez murder the boy and dispose of his remains beneath
some aluminum siding in a nearby vacant lot. Five other family
members have been charged with helping Vasquez conceal evidence of
the killing, prosecutor Orendain said.
</P>
<P>
   The two murder defendants told Donna police they heard the boy
beg for help as they bludgeoned him. ``He was choking on his own
blood, and they (Vasquez and his cousin) said it sounded like he
was saying `help.' And they hit him some more with the shovel,''
said Detective Ruben De Leon.
</P>
<P>
   During the punishment phase of the trial, defense attorney
Daniel Reyes called witnesses in an effort to convince jurors that
Vasquez's mental and emotional problems, which they said were
inherited, were mitigating circumstances that warranted a lesser
punishment of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diego Rodriguez Escobar, a McAllen psychiatrist, testified
Vasquez had an anti-social personality, suffered from attention
deficit-hyperactivity disorder, had difficulty learning to read and
write, and abused several substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't help it, it's in his genes, but they (prosecutors)
want you to punish him for it,'' Reyes told the jury Thursday.

 &HT;    Home Depot ads take teamwork to the pit
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The only slow motion Daytona 500 TV viewers are likely
to see tomorrow will come from Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's do-it-yourself giant is launching an ad campaign that
veers from the usual car and driver screaming around the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the opposite tact. Our ads really give you a feel for
what it means to be a member of the crew, more than a driver,''
said spokeswoman Carol Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the slo-mo shots linger on individual members of the
pit crew changing a tire on Home Depot's orange No. 20 car. An
eerie silence is broken only by the sound of a heartbeat and
snippets of engine noise in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to capture the emotions a pit crew would feel.
Teamwork is such a part of NASCAR, and it's a big part of Home
Depot's culture,'' Schumacher said. The spots end with the tag
line, ``You have your weekend project, we have ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Richards Group of Dallas produced the ads. They'll first air
during the race tomorrow and will run throughout 1999 in sports
events on ESPN.

 &HT;    Athlete's Foot takes bigger step into international arena
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Athlete's Foot Group Inc. is expanding its
international reach by six countries in a major franchise move, the
company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company already operates in 33 countries through more than
700 corporate and franchise stores. The new deal, signed with
Sportec S.A. of the Dominican Republic, will add a minimum of 42
stores in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico
and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest international deal in the company's
history,'' said Robert J. Corliss, president and chief executive.
Corliss joined the privately owned company in August with a goal of
increasing the number of international stores by 40 percent this
year. He plans to add about 100 stores in North America, including
five in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is particularly timely. This week at the Super Show,
industry conferences have focused on oversaturation by sporting
goods retailers. A waning consumer interest in functional athletic
footwear is compounding the problem.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating on international growth, Athlete's Foot can
sidestep the softening U.S. arena, Corliss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market and opportunity for growth in the U.S. is flat. But
the retail markets are not as well developed in other countries,''
Corliss said. ``Plus, the international consumer is aspiring to
American tastes and lifestyles. We're banking on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Athlete's Foot, which is privately held, will open a new
prototype store in Sandy Springs, Ga., in the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   The company employs about 125 people in its corporate office in
Kennesaw, Ga.

 &HT;    A winning product
 &HT;    By Patti Bond

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Austin didn't have a glitzy exhibit with sports
stars, thumping dance music or strobe lights.
</P>
<P>
   But he did have a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to put the inventor from Custer, Mont., and his
``Lucky Catch Cap'' among the likes of Adidas, New Balance and a
slew of other high-muscle manufacturers at this year's Super Show.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy whose product was born in a town of 300
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Austin was sitting behind home plate at a California Angels
baseball game several years ago when a line drive foul came
straight at him. He reached out to catch the ball barehanded but
pulled back at the last second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just coming too fast. It ricocheted off a rail and
nearly hit a little girl sitting near me,'' Austin recalled Friday
as the Super Show opened at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so bad, I decided to make something so that fans
wouldn't get stuck in that situation,'' said Austin, who created a
cap that converts to a glove.
</P>
<P>
   His Lucky Catch baseball hat and 19 other products are vying for
the Nasdaq-Amex Sports Product of the Year. Retailers and media
will vote at the Super Show, and the winner will be announced in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The products in the contest must have a specific use in the
sports industry and be available in the market. And improved
versions of existing products cannot be entered.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner was Rawlings' high-tech Radar Ball, a
baseball with an LCD readout in it that records the speed at which
it is thrown.
</P>
<P>
   The products competing for the top award run the gamut. There's
the Vortex Power Bat by Oddz On, which features an air-pressured
barrel that promises maximum speed and hitting distance. And Baby's
1st Club by La Jolla Club Golf Co., designed for newborns who just
can't wait to tee off or, more likely, executives who'll put the
company logo on the mini-club and give it away as promo.
</P>
<P>
   Statesboro, Ga., resident George Willcox and his Stroke Coach
also landed a spot in the competition. The Stroke Coach is a
polyurethane ball mounted on swiveling arm that helps athletes work
on their swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to play tennis in Statesboro one day last spring,
but the weather was bad,'' said Willcox, a former Georgia Southern
tennis player. ``I just went home and thought up a way that I could
practice in my garage and not worry about the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stroke Coach can be adjusted for eight sports, including
baseball, hockey and soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The winning product doesn't get a monetary award, but it does
get something better. ``The national exposure they'll get is much
more valuable,'' said Super Show spokesman Dave Tribble. After the
winner is announced in May, it will likely get a mention on NBC's
Today Show by Gadget Guru Andy Pargh, Tribble said. Pargh picked
the 20 semifinalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Show, which is not open to the public, continues
through Monday.

TEXAS OFFICIALS URGE JUDGE TO END OVERSIGHT OF STATE PRISONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State officials pleaded with a federal judge
Friday to end his role overseeing Texas prisons, but a lawyer for
inmates argued that the state still needs the ``incentive'' of
court sanctions to curtail brutality behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Capping 100 hours of testimony, lawyers for inmates and the
state waged final arguments before U.S. District Judge William
Wayne Justice. The judge has until March 1 to reclaim jurisdiction
over the long-running prison litigation, which started with inmate
David Ruiz's handwritten complaint in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how Justice rules, both sides plan to appeal an
adverse ruling to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come a long way, thanks in large part to the court.
But we believe we have arrived,'' said solicitor general Greg
Coleman, representing Attorney General John Cornyn. ``The time has
come for Texas to run its own prison system.''
</P>
<P>
   But inmate attorney Donna Brorby, saying she represents a
``despised'' minority, said Texas prisoners are denied basic
necessities and treated inhumanely _ despite a proliferation of
policies and procedures to define proper treatment of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1996 federal law and subsequent appellate court rulings,
Justice must find that there is a ``current and ongoing violation
of (a) federal right'' in order to reassert his authority over
prison issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Justice approved a final judgment that retained his
right to issue injunctive relief _ such as contempt-of-court
citations _ in 12 specific areas, including crowding, use of force
and medical care. At the time, citing a decade of hard-fought
improvements, Justice ended use of a ``special master'' and
relinquished control over inmate classification and provision of
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   In intervening years, the 140,000-inmate Texas Department of
Criminal Justice has shown ``deliberate indifference'' to inmates'
welfare and a conscious disregard for their safety, claimed
court-appointed attorney Donna Brorby. As a result, inmates are
raped and beaten by other inmates, and guards inflict ``brutal''
and ``sadistic'' punishment on prisoners with few consequences, she
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a multibillion-dollar building and hiring program, the
state still lacks adequate personnel and housing,
especially &UR;  &LR; safekeeping cells for inmates who are in danger or
particularly vulnerable, Brorby said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, she claimed, is a systematic ``dehumanization'' of
inmates that causes a downward psychological spiral, sometimes
resulting in suicide. Officials too often contend that inmates are
not just criminals but liars and manipulators who deserve to be
``demonized,'' Brorby added.
</P>
<P>
   Brorby said the U.S. Constitution requires that inmates be
protected from ``rape and mayhem'' and from ``malicious and
sadistic'' use of force. Inmates who are psychotic require
in-patient treatment, rather than solitary confinement, she said.
</P>
<P>
   None of those requirements are being met, she asserted, adding
that guards fail to prevent gang violence and predatory behavior
that victimizes the small and weak.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 40 inmates who testified said he ``wanted to sew his
anus shut so he couldn't be raped anymore,'' Brorby said. Others
said their despair and fear of being victimized caused them to
mutilate themselves and attempt suicide. Several said they were
beaten by guards unnecessarily or witnessed others being
mistreated. Many complained of inadequate health care, or guards'
refusal to recognize doctor-ordered work limitations.
</P>
<P>
   No system is perfect, state lawyers countered. Cited incidents
were ``anecdotal'' and not reflective of systemwide
unconstitutional conditions, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate and regrettable,'' he said, ``but the
inmates are sometimes beaten and raped by other inmates.''

   Diane Cook-Tench put herself through art school in the 1970's by
driving a short-haul tractor-trailer during the summers. ``Every
day I was determined to get in one more run than any other
driver,'' Ms. Cook-Tench said, and as a result she was often pulled
over for speeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.K., Diane, let's try to keep it down,'' she recalls state
troopers admonishing her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook-Tench, 44, is still pushing the limits as the founder
of a master's degree program in advertising at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond. When faced with red tape, she
likes to cite her truck-driving days as evidence of her
willfulness. One result is one of the top programs in the country
for training advertising's future elite.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook-Tench had raced to the top of the Martin Agency in
Richmond, where she became an internationally recognized art
director, brainstorming campaigns for such companies as Banc One
and Mobil. At 35, she became the youngest board member in the
firm's history _ insisting that her bosses were ``making a big
mistake'' in giving her so much authority. More than once, she
says, ``they were sorry'' when she told them things they didn't
want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years, hoping to spend more time with her family,
Ms. Cook-Tench left Martin to teach at Virginia Commonwealth.
Listening to colleagues in advertising carp about what they saw as
academia's benign neglect of their trade, she decided to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   So what if she never made it beyond a bachelor's degree in art?
She approached Eugene P. Tranni, the VCU president, with a proposal
to set up the first master's program in the United States to give
students a choice of four advertising specialties: writing, art
direction, planning or account management.
</P>
<P>
   Though advertising is a $200 billion-a-year business in the
United States, most practitioners learn the craft by the seat of
their pants, and most graduate programs turn out researchers, not
writers and artists.
</P>
<P>
   To make her case, Ms. Cook-Tench got backing, including
financial help, from a who's who of the advertising elite. ``She
came to us with a very well thought out proposal that could turn
the industry on its ear,'' Tranni said.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1995, the Ad Center was born, with a board that included
luminaries like Jay Chiat, founder of Chiat/Day, now TBWA
Chiat/Day; Phil Dusenberry, chairman of BBDO New York; Burt
Manning, chairman emeritus of J. Walter Thompson, now part of the
WPP Group, and Dan Wieden, president and creative director of
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Ad Center is the only program that gives formal training to
account managers who do the strategic thinking behind the ads that
writers and artists produce. Because ``creatives'' work with
planning students, ``it gives these kids a realistic agency
experience, rather than working in just creative teams,'' said
Linda Harless, director of creative services at Goodby Silverstein
&AMP; Partners in San Francisco, which hired 2 of the first class's 48
graduates last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even before venturing into the working world, the Ad Center's
students have scored some coups. Last year, they won first, second
and third places in the student category in The One Show, an
advertising competition sponsored by The One Club for Art and Copy
in New York. Mary Warlick, a One Club director, said their work was
``creative without being harsh or in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   And two students produced national ads while on internships, a
highly unusual accomplishment. One ad showed the Jaguar hood
ornament with a chain leash restraining it, headlined,
``Introducing the 8-cylinder XJ series.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook-Tench says one big challenge is dissuading guest
lecturers from raiding her classes before students graduate. It
works the other way around as well. ``In two years, there will be
no industry leaders left because they are all retiring to teach at
V.C.U.,'' joked Mike Hughes, president and creative director of the
Martin Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Already, David (Jelly) Helm, mastermind of the Nike commercial
that pits an international soccer team against Team Satan, splits
his time between Martin and the Ad Center _ and he is only 34.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook-Tench is also pushing boundaries in the curriculum,
with a focus on ethics that borders on a condemnation of the
industry. Each student takes a 15-week course that dissects issues
like ``Is it morally justifiable to promote music that portrays
violence and murder?'' from the perspectives of industry, the
public and various philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a lot of students think a lot more about
responsibility,'' said Tom Scharpf, a graduate who now works on the
Miller Lite and Weyerhauser paper accounts at Fallon McElligott in
Minneapolis. ``I think you'll see a lot more of us selling for
companies we believe in and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the emphasis on values? Ms. Cook-Tench says she was taken
aback by an opinion poll a few years ago in which advertising was
rated among the least ethical of 25 professions, placing No. 24 and
saved from the ignominy of last place only by used-car salesmen.
The Ad Center has even adopted the motto, ``We're not out to save
the world. Just advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Motherhood isn't something Ms. Cook-Tench does halfway, either.
A few years ago, she arranged an ordinary Easter egg hunt for her
children. Before long, it turned into an annual hunt for 500 eggs
with a three-tier prize system, followed by a gourmet brunch.
</P>
<P>
   For relaxation, she enjoys biking with her daughters, Julia, 16,
and Ryan, 6, around the village of Irvington, Va., where she and
her husband, Hal, recently bought a waterfront vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook-Tench figures that she could retire anytime _ her
husband is not only an art director at the Martin Agency, but makes
enough money as a painter to pay the bills, she says _ but she
isn't quite ready.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she has barely gotten started at the Ad Center.
Doubling the size of the school's graduating class is just one of
her goals. ``It's still a small industry,'' she said of
advertising. ``I think you can massively influence what goes on by
planting 100 people out there each year.''

BOXING'S FUZZY TV PICTURE IS CLEARING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve and Tracey Parsons love the fights. As they have for other
marquee bouts over the years, the Dallas couple plans to plunk down
their $40 or $50 next month to watch Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis mix it up in a heavyweight title unification match on
pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas couple also tuned in last month's Mike Tyson-Francois
Botha bout on PPV. Only that time they didn't pay. They watched for
free over at a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to pay,'' Tracey, 28, explained, ``to watch
Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the irony that is boxing: The biggest draw in the sport is
also its most repellent figure.
</P>
<P>
   But then, everything about boxing is a little confused nowadays,
including its place on television. Tyson is out of the TV mix for a
while, thanks to his version of road rage, but things aren't any
clearer.
</P>
<P>
   From one perspective, the prognosis hasn't been better in years.
Viewership for HBO's ``World Championship Boxing'' and ``Boxing
After Dark'' programs and for ESPN2's ``Friday Night Fights'' has
been relatively strong and growing, proving that there is an
audience for quality bouts, especially those booked in regular time
slots. Also, despite the disappointing sales of the Tyson-Botha
match, pay-per-view offerings like tonight's Oscar De La Hoya-Ike
Quartey bout have mostly proven popular.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, most of the big matches, at least those featuring the top
names in the game such as DeLaHoya and Holyfield, end up on pay TV,
freezing out a lot of real boxing fans who can't afford the tab.
That's no way to reward the sport's grassroots fan base, even if it
is economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there are the usual concerns that hover over boxing,
ranging from the ethical shortfalls of promoters to the very
brutality of the ring. As a result, wary advertisers have stayed
away, helping keep boxing off free network TV where a broader fan
base could be cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are mixed opinions among network boxing people
about the future of the sport on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a built-in fan base for televised boxing which is
very solid,'' said Bob Yalen, manager for programming at ESPN.
``The key is to reach those fringe fans, those who may or may not
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday Night Fights'' tries to lure those fringe viewers by
offering more than the old three-bouts-and-we're-outta-here TV
boxing formula. There is a studio show, for one, plus features,
news items and some classic fight footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to throw a little entertainment into it,'' Yalen said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, by scheduling boxing every Friday night at the same time,
(8 p.m. Central), fight fans now have their guaranteed moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're conditioned. You know when to tune in now,'' Yalen
said.
</P>
<P>
   HBO Sports senior vice president Lou DiBella believes boxing
``is healthier than it's been in a long time,'' thanks to new
efforts to police the sport and an influx of young ring talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more excellent young fighters today, probably the
best crop in a generation,'' DiBella said. ``You probably have to
go back to the days of \RMarvin\S Hagler, \RThomas\S Hearns and
\RSugar Ray\S Leonard to compare.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he added, ``they're good kids.'' Which, of course,
means TV-friendly kids.
</P>
<P>
   As for the loss of top attraction Tyson, DiBella is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Mike Tyson has anything to do with boxing
anymore,'' DiBella said. ``He's an attraction more as a sideshow
than as a boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Yalen suggests that televised boxing needs a charismatic
heavyweight champion, a guy who can rightfully claim to be ``the
baddest man on the planet.'' Sounds a lot like a guy named Tyson.
Oh well.
</P>
<P>
   DiBella, though, sees lots of potential stars on the come.
What's more, he feels boxing fans are ready to return _ under the
right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just need to make good fights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where boxing is being telecast, it is doing real well,''
DiBella added. ``The public is responding to good fights. They're
going to pay attention to boxing because of the quality matchups.''

   WASHINGTON _ In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show Friday,
Linda Tripp appeared to contradict the testimony of the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, who told the House Judiciary Committee that
his office had no knowledge of a meeting Mrs. Tripp attended with
lawyers for Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have mentioned to one or two of the agents, one of the
agents that was responsible for transporting me, that I needed to
get home because I had an interview with the Paula Jones
attorneys,'' Mrs. Tripp said in the ``Today'' interview, which was
aired Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the day, she retreated. Through a spokesman, she
amended her statement on ``Today,'' and said, ``I did not inform
the prosecutors of my plan to meet with a lawyer for Paula Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp was subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers and had agreed to
brief them about details of the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky if they dropped their plan to depose her. She did meet
with one of the Jones lawyers on Jan. 16, 1998, the evening before
the president's deposition in the case. The meeting came only hours
after she had helped lure Ms. Lewinsky to the Ritz-Carlton hotel in
suburban Virginia where Ms. Lewinsky was confronted by a team of
prosecutors and agents working for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has said he knew nothing about Mrs. Tripp's meeting with
the Jones lawyer. But in a televised interview late last year, he
said he wished he had instructed Mrs. Tripp not to talk to anyone
about Ms. Lewinsky after his criminal investigation had started.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his prosecution team have faced mounting criticism
stemming from accusations that they colluded with the Jones team,
charges that Starr has strenuously denied. The Justice Department
has begun an inquiry into whether Starr's office failed to disclose
early contacts with lawyers working for Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp stood by her account on ``Today'' that she had shared
some limited information with Starr's agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told one of several agents at the Ritz-Carlton that I needed
to leave to get to an interview that I had agreed to give in lieu
of a deposition,'' she explained on Friday through her spokesman.
``I was bound by a subpoena to attend the meeting. I don't believe
I was ever specific with anyone about who I was meeting with.''

   Should the Boss Own More Stock? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors trying to divine a stock's future performance ought to
look at how much of it is held by the company's chief executive:
the more the better, according to a study by Watson Wyatt
Worldwide, a consulting firm based in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Watson Wyatt examined 261 large-capitalization
companies that had the same chief executive in 1993 and 1997,
dividing them into high and low performers, based on five-year
total returns through 1997. Then it examined the amount of company
stock held by the boss in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that performed above the median _ returning an average
of 28 percent annually to shareholders over the five years _ were
headed by chief executives who held an average $8.1 million in
company stock in 1993. The chiefs of companies that performed below
the median _ returning an average of 13 percent annually _ held
just $4.5 million in company stock.
</P>
<P>
   Is this evidence that stock is an effective performance
incentive? Not necessarily. It's possible that chiefs of companies
that are likely to underperform simply shun stock compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But Ira T. Kay, global practice director of executive
compensation consulting at Watson Wyatt, said he believes that
encouraging the boss to own stock is good for performance, noting
that the pattern holds even in lackluster, low growth industries.
``You've got to come up with creative ways to get CEOs to buy more
stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just pay the chief executives more? In part because such
compensation _ defined as salary, bonus, other cash compensation
and profit from exercised options _ seemed to have a somewhat less
direct effect on shareholder returns.
</P>
<P>
   Watson Wyatt divided a somewhat larger sample of 451 companies
based on the chief executives' 1997 compensation. Companies above
the median paid their top executives an average of $5.7 million and
gave shareholders a 26 percent one-year return. Those below the
median paid an average of of $1.3 million and returned 18 percent. &QL;

   For Internet Users, Safety Is an Issue &QL;

</P>
<P>
   What worries Internet users when it comes to trading stocks on
line? Safety, first and foremost, according to a poll by CBS News
and cbs.marketwatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2, found that
security was the No. 1 concern of 35 percent of the 876
respondents. Execution of trades was the next-biggest worry, cited
by 10 percent. Traditional publishers should take note: The quality
of financial data available on the Internet was only the No. 3
concern, cited by just 6 percent. (Three percent cited all three.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 80 percent of respondents said financial news and
information available on the Web was as reliable or more reliable
than that available from traditional sources. &QL;

<P>
   Betting on a Rebound in Japan &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fund investors, battered as they have been by Asian and some
other international markets, have ponied up when it comes to one
long-suffering country: Japan.
</P>
<P>
   According to net-flow estimates by Lipper Inc., a research firm
in Summit, N.J., investors poured $252.5 million into Japanese
funds in 1998. Lipper tracks 42 Japan funds, which had a total of
$2.01 billion in assets as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, they yanked money out of a host of other
Asian-centered fund categories. Lipper estimated net outflows for
1998 of $118.4 million for China regional funds, $302.1 million for
Pacific funds excluding Japan, $907.3 million for Pacific regional
funds and $1.39 billion for emerging-markets funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bargain hunters and where else can you buy things
that are down two-thirds in an economy that is poor _ poor in terms
of numbers but rich in terms of assets?'' asked A. Michael Lipper,
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Not that investors have been well rewarded for their
bottom-fishing exploits. For the 52 weeks ended Feb. 4, the
Japanese funds turned in a razor-thin loss of 0.7 percent. (year to
date through Feb. 11, the loss is 0.3 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is far better than the shellacking that other fund
categories have endured over the 52 weeks. Losses were 11.2 percent
for Pacific regional funds, 15.5 percent for Pacific funds
excluding Japan, 26.1 percent for emerging-markets funds and 26.5
percent for China regional funds. &QL;

BIPARTISAN CENSURE EFFORT APPEARS DEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan effort to censure the president
appeared dead Friday as Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm used a
procedural maneuver to block his colleagues from voting on the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats and a number of Republicans had backed a censure
resolution drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that would
have harshly condemned the president's actions in the sex-and-lies
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate acquitted the president on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice, these senators hoped a censure resolution
would still let their constituents know they disapproved of his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it so important that anyone who looks at this shabby
episode of American history understands that while one may not vote
to convict and remove a president, one can have profound dismay and
concern about the misconduct that was inherent in the articles of
impeachment,'' Feinstein said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   She called it ``regrettable'' that a small number of senators
``with a lot of power over our deliberations have forestalled our
ability to bring such a resolution to the floor of the Senate for a
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm and other conservatives held that the Constitution did
not provide for any punishment other than conviction and removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm argued that the censure ``erodes the separation of powers
that is the genius of the American experiment.'' The senator said
he was afraid of setting a precedent whereby future Congresses
could try to use censure to punish presidents over a host of
matters such as firing generals.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and other conservatives also suggested that some lawmakers
were trying to have it both ways by not voting to convict the
president and yet still acknowledging he may have committed those
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians love to vote yes and no,`` said Gramm, who voted
to convict the president on both charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm employed arcane Senate rules to block the censure motion.
After the vote on acquittal, Feinstein offered her resolution, only
to have Gramm object, arguing that such a vote had not been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein then asked her colleagues to suspend the rules to
allow consideration of censure, which would require a two-thirds
vote of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents garnered 56 votes, shy of the 67 necessary to proceed
with the censure debate.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was indefinitely tabled and both Democrats and
Republicans expressed skepticism that it would be raised when
senators return from a weeklong break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pessimistic of our ability to do it,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said, ``It would
have to gather a whole lot more steam than it has now.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's move to debate censure drew all but one Democrat,
Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and a dozen Republicans,
including Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   A Hutchison spokesman said that the senator was not necessarily
in favor of the Feinstein censure resolution but also did not agree
with Gramm that the debate should be delayed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of keeping the sentiment of censure alive, Feinstein
circulated a letter among her colleagues that contains the censure
language. Proponents hoped the letter could garner the signatures
of a majority of senators and anticipated inserting it into the
congressional record.
</P>
<P>
   The Feinstein resolution stated that Clinton ``engaged in an
inappropriate relationship with a subordinate employee in the White
House, which was shameful, reckless and indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   It further stated that he ``deliberately misled and deceived the
American people and people in all branches of the U.S.
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also stressed that Clinton remains subject to
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   It concluded that the Senate ``condemns his wrongful conduct in
the strongest terms ... and urges that future Congresses will
recognize the importance of allowing this bipartisan statement of
censure and condemnation to remain intact for all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The section requesting that censure remain ``intact for all
time'' was an attempt to address complaints that censure could
easily be rescinded in the future. It has been frequently noted
that the last president to be censured by Congress, Andrew Jackson
in 1834, over his banking policy, had the sanction removed by
another Congress.

TRIPP FRIEND CONFIRMS ROLE IN PUBLICIZING LEWINSKY-CLINTON AFFAIR

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda Tripp now portrays her friend Lucianne Goldberg
as a master puppeteer who not only urged Mrs. Tripp to turn over
her tapes of Monica Lewinsky to Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, but who told Mrs. Tripp to reveal Ms. Lewinsky's affair
with President Clinton to lawyers for Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg, a New York literary agent and a self-described
Clinton hater, said Friday that everything Mrs. Tripp says is true,
and that Ms. Goldberg is proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I took her to Starr,'' Ms. Goldberg said in a
telephone interview from her home and office on Manhattan's Upper
West Side. ``And I gave the Paula Jones lawyers her phone number.
Of course I did. How else would they have gotten it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg was reacting to two interviews of Mrs. Tripp that
appeared Friday, one in The New York Times and the other on NBC's
``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC, Mrs. Tripp said she told agents from Starr's office that
she would soon be seeing lawyers for Paula Jones. Later in the day,
however, she amended her recollections and said that she had told
the agents she had a legal appointment but had not elaborated.
Critics have long charged that there was collusion between lawyers
for Starr and Mrs. Jones, who was suing Clinton for sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Goldberg scoffed at giving any such significance to Mrs.
Tripp's information. ``They're trying to make a vast right-wing
conspiracy out of this,'' she said. ``To me, it's `So what?'
Starr's big people didn't know.'' Ms. Goldberg added that ``there
were always these little outriders'' from Starr's office who drove
Mrs. Tripp around. ``And saying it to them,'' Ms. Goldberg said,
``doesn't mean they run back and call Starr and get him up from
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, who many Americans consider a villain who secretly
tape-recorded a friend, portrayed herself in both interviews as a
concerned surrogate mother trying to save a daughter in over her
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly a young girl in love with Elvis,'' Mrs. Tripp
said on NBC. ``She's still in love. She has a great big heart.''
Mrs. Tripp added that ``the public has no clue'' about what Ms.
Lewinsky endured in the relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The histrionics, the hysteria, the throwing of lamps, the
damage to herself _ these things are not out there,'' she said.
``People think this was consensual, and yet I inserted myself
somehow. It was not.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp also said in the ``Today'' interview that she had
received death threats for herself and her children, and that
``Monica made those threats and passed them along to me, I
believed, from the president. I believed I was in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Gangel, the NBC correspondent conducting the interview,
then asked Mrs. Tripp if she believed the president had threatened
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that was the message I was supposed to receive,''
Mrs. Tripp said. ```Be a team player or else.' Here's what I got:
`I'm going to lie, he's going to lie, we are all going to lie. If
you don't lie, you are being set up for perjury and jail, and who's
going to believe you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said she believes Ms. Lewinsky lied in her testimony
about the president. ``Monica has always said, or had always said
until the last time I spoke with her, that she would always protect
him on anything that might threaten his political viability,'' Mrs.
Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. Goldberg called Mrs. Tripp's NBC interview
``brilliant'' and said she was ``calm and intelligent and strong
and said precisely what I have been saying for a solid year now.''
She added that ``there wasn't a word that came out of that woman's
mouth this morning that wasn't God's honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg said she didn't feel any strong emotions on the day
of the president's acquittal by the Senate because she has been in
a ``sort of fugue-state'' since the president's August 17 testimony
and his December impeachment by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll never be enough,'' she said, ``but it was satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg had no complaints about Starr's handling of the
investigation of Clinton, although she did say, ``I think he could
have been far more aggressive about the propaganda that was put out
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg is considering a job as a host for a national
network radio show. ``Trust me, it's real,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PERJURY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Friday failed to convict President Clinton on
charges of perjury. Voting 45-55, the supporters of conviction
failed to garner the two-thirds vote necessary to convict and
remove the president from office. Supporters said the president
lied in his Grand Jury testimony regarding his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and should therefore be
convicted and removed from office. Opponents said there was no
proof that Clinton committed perjury, and that the charges were not
worthy of removal from office. A ``yes'' vote favors removing
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OBSTRUCT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Friday failed to convict President Clinton on
charges of obstruction of justice. Voting 50-50, supporters of
conviction failed to garner the two-thirds vote necessary to
convict and remove Clinton from office. Supporters said Clinton
tried to influence the testimony of witnesses he knew would be
testifying about his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. Opponents said there was no proof that Clinton
obstructed justice, and that the charges were not worthy of removal
from office. A ``yes'' vote favors removing Clinton from office.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PRIVATE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 274-149, a bill that will make
it easier for members to defeat legislation they think will cost
the private sector at least $100 million. When a bill containing a
$100 million mandate on industry comes up for consideration, a
member can request an immediate 20-minute debate which would be
followed by a vote to remove the bill from consideration.
Supporters said the bill would make members accountable for
imposing such a significant cost. Opponents said the measure would
make it hard to enact environmental legislation. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SMALL BUS.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 274-151, a measure that would
grant small businesses a six-month waiver for inadvertently
violating federal paperwork requirements, unless a federal agency
determines that the violation poses a threat to public health or
safety. Supporters said the bill would make it easier for small
businesses to cope with federal red tape. Opponents, including the
White House, said the measure puts the public health and safety at
risk. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lead prosecutor of the impeachment trial,
Rep. &UR;  &LR; Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said on Friday that he believed Kenneth
Starr should not indict President Clinton now that the Senate has
acquitted him.
</P>
<P>
   With two articles of impeachment lying in a heap at his feet,
Hyde said that Starr, the independent counsel, should ``put to
bed'' the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think indicting and criminally trying him, after what
we have all been through, is going to be helpful to the country,''
Hyde said. ``I think we should try to find areas we can agree on
and get some legislation passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other House Republicans also expressed a need to move on, while
reaffirming the legitimacy of their decision to impeach the
president in December. The speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
in a statement that ``Republicans in the Congress can be proud that
they stood by the principles that have made this nation strong: a
respect for the rule of law and an abiding faith in the strength of
our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people expect us to move this nation forward, and
that is exactly what we plan to do in the 106th Congress,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmortem on the impeachment case, Hyde, chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, reflected more broadly on his
stewardship of the prosecution and the decisions made by his team
of prosecutors since the very first days in September, when Starr
referred the case to the House.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old lawmaker, who entered the fray to accolades from
Republicans and Democrats as a judicious, fair &UR; - &LR; minded leader,
only to see his standing in the country plummet. There is a trace
of bitterness about the way he has been treated and also a sense of
astonishment at his own rose-colored expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt if the story were told coherently, chronologically,
that maybe the public would focus on it and move from its total
indifference to concern,'' Hyde said. ``That hope was unrequited.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he should have insisted on questioning witnesses in
his own committee, when he, and not the Senate, was in control.
</P>
<P>
   Boomeranging at times between anger and pride, disappointment
and relief, Hyde joked that he wished he had been ``good at math
and numbers,'' which would have landed him on the Ways and Means
Committee rather than the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He did not expect to win conviction on Friday on the two
articles of impeachment, he said. But he certainly did not expect,
at the start of the process, to feel as dispirited and saddened as
he does over the process of impeaching and trying to remove
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this: I used to enjoy getting up and going to work
every day,'' Hyde said. ``I don't enjoy it anymore. That isn't to
say I don't want to do it _and I hope I will get back to where I
used to be in terms of enjoying this _ but this was so
fractionalizing, so, so, well, polarizing, there has to be another
word. This was a downer from A to Z. There was nothing noble or
high.''
</P>
<P>
   During a session with reporters on Thursday and at an appearance
with his fellow House prosecutors on Friday after the Senate vote
to acquit the president, Hyde emphasized that the country would
suffer if Starr indicted Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a breakfast he had with former President Reagan, Hyde
said they had discussed the pardon of President Nixon after
Watergate. Hyde said that Reagan said he assumed Nixon ``got up
every morning with a ball of lead in his stomach, knowing he had
been leader of the free world and now was disgraced. And he thought
it would not be good to have a president, former president, in
jail, in prison. And I must say that prospect is off-putting to me,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and the other House managers pronounced themselves
generally satisifed with their performance, given the constraints
placed upon them by the Senate, and emphasized that they had
completed their constitutional duty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It was our job simply to present the case to the Senate and
let them make the decision as to whether or not the president
should be removed from office,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said: ``The president has been
cleansed. The cloud from the White House constitutionally has been
blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   But others struck a darker note. ``My great fear is that future
presidents will now flout the law in a more egregious manner,''
said Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House impeachment managers stood in the well of the United
States Senate with honor and justice on their side,'' said Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip. ``This trial provided no
political advantage to the managers. It took them away from their
families and it occupied every waking moment of their lives for the
past two months. Were they successful? The answer is indisputably
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hyde said he had ``no regrets,'' he did second-guess a
few decisions. One was to hurry the impeachment proceedings through
the House without calling witnesses. He said he had unwisely bowed
to the desires of Republican colleagues still jittery about their
November election losses.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he perhaps should ``have put up more of a fight''
when both Democrats and Republicans pressured him to make the Starr
report public. At the time, he said, he did not know exactly what
was in the report. The public was angered by having the report's
graphic sex broadcast on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of his own adulterous affair 30 years ago, which he
characterized as a ``youthful indiscretion,'' hurt him deeply, Hyde
said. His mail brimmed with death threats and insults, as well as
glowing reviews. He was assigned bodyguards. He was called a zealot
and a Clinton hater. To inure himself, he stopped watching
television, and he reads a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Hyde strived for bipartisanship. But, he said, he
had underestimated the loyalty that Democrats in the House would
feel toward Clinton. Hyde said he and the other Republicans got
most of the blame for the breakdown in cooperation, but it was the
Democrats who chose not to budge an inch, a characterization
Democrats dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, he said, the prosecutors were hindered by the
institutional emphasis on bipartisanship. ``If I have to criticize
the senators, or at least the Republican senators, and I'm loathe
to do that, it is that they do make bipartisanship the ultimate
ethic over there,'' he said, ``And that oftentimes, in practical
terms, means yielding to the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment last year, Hyde said he considered coming up with
an alternative to impeachment, his own exit strategy. He talked to
only a handful of people about the notion, which he would not
elaborate on, but he quickly realized it would be unrealistic. Too
many people wanted the House to proceed with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was naive thinking that this could be bipartisan,'' Hyde
said. ``This is about as hardball as you can get. This is about
deposing a president in his sixth year. And the Democrats are
tenacious in refusing to let that happpen.''

INSURERS PAY THE BROKERS, MAKING CUSTOMERS WARY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill., Nev., Va., Canada)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whose interests are commercial insurance brokers paid to serve?
</P>
<P>
   Big corporate customers, whose spending on insurance premiums
can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, pay the
brokers hefty commissions and fees on the assumption that the
brokers work objectively for them, assembling the best coverage at
the best prices with no interest in choosing one carrier over
another.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that for years, the brokers have also been
quietly receiving incentive payments on the other end of the deal,
from some of the very insurance companies that, according to custom
and law, they are supposed to be dispassionately scrutinizing on
their customers' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of these payments, called contingency fees, and
the extent to which they should be disclosed, have become hot
topics in the commercial insurance business in the United States,
Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid consolidation of the brokerage industry is making
contingency fees even more controversial. Two giant brokers, the
Marsh &AMP; McLennan Companies in New York and Aon in Chicago, now
dominate the field. And risk managers _ the executives who buy
coverage for corporations _ have become increasingly concerned that
brokers, less restrained by competition, could concentrate their
business with insurers that offer the biggest incentives rather
than those that provide the best service and lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broker says, `Here's the fee for the service we're
rendering,' and then you turn around and the broker has a
sweetheart arrangement for shifting business to certain insurance
companies,'' said Lance J. Ewing, who is in charge of buying
coverage for GES Exposition Services in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense,'' Ewing said, ``the broker is double-dipping by
getting the premium from me and getting money back from the
insurance company.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies pay brokers fees based on volume and
profitability. Brokers are paid more, for example, if claims on the
coverage they arrange are low.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate executives said they had been unaware of
contingency fees until recently. New York state regulators say
they, too, were in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers acknowledge that they have not called attention to
contingency fees but say they have always been willing to discuss
them in general terms, if asked. They say that the payments from
the insurers are a small part of their total revenue _ no more than
5 percent _ and that the fees do not influence their choice of
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurance companies that pay the fees see them
differently. Though some of the biggest companies refuse to pay,
many others consider contingency fees a necessary tool for making
sure they get a slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Risk and Insurance Management Society, an
association mainly of American and Canadian risk managers, has been
calling for full disclosure of the fees. And last summer, after
becoming aware of the controversy, the New York State Department of
Insurance issued a formal reminder that state law requires that
insurance buyers be informed of all compensation arrangements
between insurer and broker so they can ``understand the costs of
coverage and the motivation of their broker.'' Department officials
are meeting with brokers on the issue later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Marsh &AMP; McLennan, the world's largest insurance
broker, said in a joint statement with the risk managers
association that if asked, it would tell customers which of their
insurers were paying incentives. And it agreed to help customers
work out a ``reasonable estimate'' of how much Marsh was deriving
in contingency fees from each customer's total insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert J. Newhouse, a senior Marsh executive, said in an
interview that the broker would not specify how much it was
receiving from individual insurers. To do so, he said, would be
handing ``sensitive information'' to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The joint statement referred to Marsh's new disclosure plans as
``mutually agreeable.'' But the debate is far from over. The
statement falls far short of the requirements of New York State law
as well as an earlier policy statement by the association calling
for disclosure of all broker compensation by each carrier on each
line of business. Moreover, Newhouse said Marsh planned to apply
the new policy to only its largest customers.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Meltzer, who buys property and casualty insurance for Sun
Life Assurance Co. in Toronto and helped work out the joint
statement, said the new policy was ``a first step.'' She said she
had not heard that Marsh planned to limit disclosure to its largest
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Wolfson buys insurance for Domtar Inc., a pulp and paper
company in Montreal. She said she ``would have loved'' to have
Marsh simply open its books, as New York law requires, and disclose
its contingency fees to all customers without being asked. But she
said she and other association executives who approved the joint
statement ``wanted to work with them, wanted to encourage them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How they will implement it, and how they make information
available, and to what extent it is going to be difficult to get
specifics _ well, we'll have to test it to see to what extent we
can be satisfied with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert M. Harrell, an Alexandria, Va., consultant to risk
managers, called Marsh's new policy a step in the right direction
but said, ``It is not equivalent to revealing their total financial
interest.'' Contingency fees, he said, are not the only issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different ways for income to come to brokers
and influence them other than contingency fees,'' Harrell said.
``Examples would be for servicing an account and reimbursement for
expenses such as advertising. Although brokers may try hard to put
their clients' interests first, being only human, they may not
always do so. It's less likely that a broker will succumb to
temptation if his financial interests are known.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth H. Pinkston, the chief executive in North America for
the Willis Corroon Corp. of Britain, the third-largest broker, said
that, in a departure from the past, his company plans to begin
including notices along with billings, telling customers which of
their insurers pay contingency fees.
</P>
<P>
   Aon, the second-largest broker, said its policy was to identify
carriers from which it receives contingency fees when it is asked
to do so. It will tell customers the total amount it receives in
contingency fees from a particular carrier, but says it cannot
break down a single corporate client's contribution to the total.
</P>
<P>
   The New York regulators and the risk managers were unable to
cite cases in which brokers had arranged coverage that might have
been bought for less or had steered customers to insurers that
failed to meet clients' needs in other ways. But the risk managers
said that is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``No risk manager wants to come forward and say, `Yeah, my
broker didn't get the best deal for my company,' '' Ewing said.
``Nobody wants that information out there. That would be almost job
suicide.''

SHORT ITEMS ON PERSONAL BUSINESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14)

   Charity May Begin At the State Comptroller &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who looks in their mailbox knows, charities know how
to find donors. But some charities have a hard time hanging onto
all the money they get, if the unclaimed-property lists compiled by
the state comptrollers for New York and California are any
indication.
</P>
<P>
   The lists track cash, stocks, bonds and other assets that have
been turned over to the states because the owners could not be
found. Most owners are individuals who forgot items like a small
bank account or dividend check.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Wide Web sites run by the comptrollers _
www.osc.state.ny.us for New York, www.sco.ca.gov for California _
also show that many big charities have not claimed property the
states are holding for them, despite publicity campaigns by both
states about unclaimed assets.
</P>
<P>
   Local United Ways, for example, have not claimed 34 accounts in
New York and 31 in California. The property's value is confidential
under New York law, but the California property is worth
$17,714.27.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society has 14 unclaimed accounts totaling
$1,820.13 in California and 30 accounts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Hope, a hospital in Duarte, Calif., has $3,500 due
from the state of Illinois, while Cedars Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles has $74.17 due from Wellpoint Networks, a managed
health care company. In New York, Mount Sinai Hospital has 112
unclaimed property accounts and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center has eight.
</P>
<P>
   Some funds were turned over to the states by companies, who told
the comptrollers they could not find the charities. These included
a wide range of major corporations including AT&AMP;T, Bank of America,
Hershey Foods, IBM, Kaiser Health Foundation, Times Mirror, Wells
Fargo and Sears, Roebuck.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PERJURY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Friday failed to convict President Clinton on
charges of perjury. Voting 45-55, the supporters of conviction
failed to garner the two-thirds vote necessary to convict and
remove the president from office. Supporters said the president
lied in his Grand Jury testimony regarding his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and should therefore be
convicted and removed from office. Opponents said there was no
proof that Clinton committed perjury, and that the charges were not
worthy of removal from office. A ``yes'' vote favors removing
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OBSTRUCT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Friday failed to convict President Clinton on
charges of obstruction of justice. Voting 50-50, supporters of
conviction failed to garner the two-thirds vote necessary to
convict and remove Clinton from office. Supporters said Clinton
tried to influence the testimony of witnesses he knew would be
testifying about his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. Opponents said there was no proof that Clinton
obstructed justice, and that the charges were not worthy of removal
from office. A ``yes'' vote favors removing Clinton from office.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PRIVATE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 274-149, a bill that will make
it easier for members to defeat legislation they think will cost
the private sector at least $100 million. When a bill containing a
$100 million mandate on industry comes up for consideration, a
member can request an immediate 20-minute debate which would be
followed by a vote to remove the bill from consideration.
Supporters said the bill would make members accountable for
imposing such a significant cost. Opponents said the measure would
make it hard to enact environmental legislation. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SMALL BUS.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 274-151, a measure that would
grant small businesses a six-month waiver for inadvertently
violating federal paperwork requirements, unless a federal agency
determines that the violation poses a threat to public health or
safety. Supporters said the bill would make it easier for small
businesses to cope with federal red tape. Opponents, including the
White House, said the measure puts the public health and safety at
risk. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a perfect screen moment: the senators rose
at their desks in turn, the camera closing in on each face as he or
she pronounced the weighty words ``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' And
there you have the difference between movies and real life.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to play out such a scene in the imagination Friday,
but that was the only place it existed. In reality, it was
impossible to look into the senators' eyes as they voted.
</P>
<P>
   The stationary Senate-controlled cameras offered distant wide
shots of the floor, and a viewer could only strain to glimpse a
far-off figure briefly standing. (Thank goodness for Christopher
Dodd's white hair; it made him easy to spot as he rose.) It was a
frustrating position to be in after weeks of watching close-up,
in-your-face pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, though, that empyrean view fostered Friday's
brief but surprisingly dramatic aura. A sense of gravity and
historical import, so conspicuously missing during in the
president's trial, even made its way through the visual clutter on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   On every network and cable channel, the image of the Senate
floor was placed in a small box; as they voted, each senator's
photograph and party affiliation was flashed on screen along with
running tallies that kept track of how many Republicans were
defecting and voting to acquit (the only suspense left, though one
largely limited to political junkies).
</P>
<P>
   The day's grave tone came partly from the language of guilt or
acquittal, partly from the sense of (at long, exhausted last)
finality, and partly from diminished expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For, this eerie combination of sober drama and frustrating
distance from events was in keeping with a television day marked by
unusual caution. From anchors to President Clinton himself,
everyone suddenly seemed gun shy around the cameras, wary after so
many previously botched television moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Frank Sesno asked a pertinent question on CNN:
``Is there a sense of history here or a sense of something to get
through?''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago, when the trial began, commentators were assuming
history happened every minute. By Friday, they had abandoned any
reckless or overblown assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Cokie Roberts of ABC said, in what turned out to be an accurate
prediction about the voting, ``It's not suspenseful, but it is
dramatic.'' And after it was over, Brian Williams of NBC
emphatically captured its feeling when he said, ``it was chilling,
unexpectedly chilling, to hear the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Peter Jennings signed off ABC's coverage of the
president's brief speech in the afternoon, he hedged his bets,
calling the day ``a little anticlimactic for some, but a great,
historic civics lesson for others.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dan Rather wryly pointed out on CBS, commentators have been
making wrong predictions about this crisis for a year; they will
probably spend the next year assessing what it all meant, with no
greater success.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's Rose Garden speech that qualified as the
television anticlimax of the day. Despite his opening reference,
``Now that the Senate has fulfilled its constitutional
responsibility bringing this process to a conclusion,'' he did not
grapple with the import of what had finally happened.
</P>
<P>
   Offering one more apology and looking forward to
``reconciliation,'' Clinton safely fulfilled the minimum
requirements senators and pundits had laid out for the speech: it
had to be short (it came in at two minutes) and non-gloating (he
called himself ``humbled'').
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton seemed uncharacteristically shy in front of the
cameras, the senate's relationship to television was true to form.
So camera-greedy everywhere else, in the chamber senators sometimes
protect their decorum and secrecy with such passion it seems
startling cameras are allowed at all.
</P>
<P>
   Their dilemma is genuine. The alternative to Congress' bland,
stationary cameras would create a scene unthinkable anytime soon: a
half-dozen people with hand-held cameras traipsing the floor of the
Senate as if at a political convention. Yet the staid, C-SPAN-style
reality of Senate television coverage is archaically out of touch
with this media-driven story.
</P>
<P>
   As if offering a reminder of the tawdry betrayals at the heart
of this scandal, the television day was bookended by none other
than Linda Tripp, in a 20-minute interview on NBC's ``Today''
program that was excerpted everywhere all day and replayed on NBC's
``Dateline'' at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp's most inflammatory statement was that she felt her
life and her children's lives had been threatened by the president
through Monica Lewinsky; her mantra was that she had just been
trying to help Ms. Lewinsky, the friend she still cares about. Ms.
Tripp sent the impression of a woman seriously detached from
reality, and the message that any visceral sense of dignity
attached to this story is fleeting.

HEY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS WORKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Analysis logo needed) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ And the winner is: our remarkably resilient
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The 210-year-old constitutional process allowed the House to
document the antics of a president caught out in pubescent
randiness. Then it permitted the Senate, mirroring the popular
will, to decide that the indiscretions and succeeding actions,
however tawdry, did not imperil the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the process is supposed to work. A little too
revelatory, like sausage-making, perhaps. But still it was a grand,
even though tedious, workout for a procedure that must retain its
muscle tone if it is to have meaning and functionality.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the dire predictions, from both sides throughout the
ordeal, the procedural train stayed on track. All the slick deals
and shortcuts mooted along the way were properly rejected and there
were final votes on the only real question: Should President
Clinton be removed from office?
</P>
<P>
   It was a grand moment _ historic but yet very much of the
present _ when senators stood at their desks, some of the men
ceremoniously buttoning their coats, and called out in the quiet
but overflowing chamber ``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Constitution, as is so often the case even in
less dramatic moments, was wondrously redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Senate can thrash around all it likes on the sideline,
extra-constitutional question of censure, with the initial signal
Friday being that a formal condemnatory vote is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Censure is, at best, a cost-free move for political cover from a
body that regularly waxes eloquently _ and often ineffectually _
about everything from genocide to the winner of a Little League
competition. President Clinton is not holding his breath.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process over the past few months has not always
been pretty, but that's not a constitutional requirement.
Contemplation by Congress of overturning the electoral will of the
people should rouse a passionate response as well as an inordinate
measure of caution.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much tsk-tsking about the partisan tint of the
proceedings, the hell-bent nature of the Republicans' prosecution
and the generally lock-step opposition of Democrats. At least each
side stood for something, rather than fudging differences as so
often happens in U.S. politics. And now it is up to the electorate
to decide if it will exact vengeance on either party.
</P>
<P>
   From the current polling, it does not look good for the
Republicans. Americans, twice having decided they could live with
Clinton's many demonstrated foibles, were not happy to have
Congress attempt to set a more exacting standard.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, chief House manager of the case
against Clinton, recalled Friday how the Republican
legislator-prosecutors kept hoping the public would move from what
he described as ``indifference'' toward Clinton's action toward
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hope was unrequited,'' Hyde conceded.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, one salient point is not likely to be
forgotten and will redound to Clinton's historic discredit. He
brought all this on himself, and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a messy sexual harassment lawsuit from his days
as governor of Arkansas, Clinton recklessly engaged in a prolonged
sexual affair with a White House intern-groupie who was barely
older than his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief Rose Garden appearance Friday after the Senate
votes, Clinton came closer than in the whole sorry 13 months of the
scandal to making a simple, even perhaps believable, apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American
people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the simple directness of that statement in January
1998 when Clinton instead was finger-wagging and dancing on the
head of semantic pins? Of course, it's always easier to be humble,
direct and magnanimous in victory.
</P>
<P>
   There are several loose ends to the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   One is the future of the independent counsel statute, the
procedure that allowed Kenneth Starr, after hitting dead ends on a
handful of other Clinton scandalets, to plow into the president's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it was Clinton and congressional Democrats who were so
strenuous in their insistence that the law be renewed _ over the
strong opposition of Republicans. It will be interesting if Clinton
can adopt his favored ``mend it, don't end it'' attitude the next
time the law expires.
</P>
<P>
   On another point, the Senate may want to re-examine the rule
that required its final deliberations to be in closed sessions.
</P>
<P>
   From all ideological sides, senators said what a wonderful
moment it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``People let down their hair and spoke about their feelings,''
said Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Michigan Democrat. ``There's a
feeling of accomplishment and hope,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, a
conservative Utah Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the closed deliberations contend that the presence
of reporters and especially television would have fatally changed
the atmosphere. That's a thin argument for conducting such
important governmental business in private.

FEINSTEIN'S CENSURE MOVE DIES AS SENATE ENDS THE CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three weeks of lobbying and 25 different
versions of a censure resolution condemning President Clinton but
not convicting him, Sen. Dianne Feinstein still couldn't find the
magic language.
</P>
<P>
   Every time she used tougher words to win Republican support, she
would lose Democrats. When she softened the language, she would
lose Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she couldn't muster the 67 votes needed to allow a
floor vote on her resolution. Censure was as dead as the House
campaign to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything caused problems, every preposition, every
adjective, every adverb,'' Feinstein said Friday. ``We tried to
incorporate every suggestion everybody made but it seemed we lost
support on one side every time we picked it up on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, Feinstein tried to
bring up her censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposed censure because he
thought it was unconstitutional, blocked her with a parliamentary
tactic. She needed 67 votes to overcome Gramm and allow a vote on
the resolution. But she only received 56 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Feinstein's resolution was placed into the
Congressional Record but not adopted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not come up again,'' Feinstein said later,
acknowledging that ``people want to get past this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a point, because we got the resolution into the Record
signed by one-third'' of the Senate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated that, as
far as he was concerned, the matter was closed and the Senate would
not take up censure again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the censure resolution right now is that, I
think, the Senate is tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that since a vote on censure
wasn't allowed Friday, ``Now is the time to stop. Let the
recriminations stop. It's going to take a while to put some of
these pieces back together.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final form, her three-page censure resolution, signed by
38 senators, condemned Clinton for ``shameful, reckless and
indefensible'' behavior in connection with his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It said Clinton ``deliberately misled and deceived the American
people,'' ``gave false or misleading testimony'' which ``had the
effect of impeding discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Clinton's conduct demeaned the office of the
president and ``creates disrespect for the laws of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign for censure was aided by Sens. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., Robert Bennett, R-Utah and Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who didn't sign Feinstein's
censure resolution but voted Friday to allow it to come up for
debate, praised her colleague's efforts in tackling such a
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Feinstein deserves a lot of credit,'' Boxer said. ``It
shows that Sen. Feinstein is a person who really likes to work both
sides of the aisle. She did a remarkable job.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she signed an early version of the censure resolution
but didn't support later, tougher versions.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman praised Feinstein for being ``very persistent and very
principled'' in her fight to bring a censure resolution to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Feinstein has sided with Clinton on many issues,
including the 1994 legislation that banned 19 types of assault
weapons, she became the first Senate Democrat to publicly scold
Clinton for lying about his relationship to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   A day after President Clinton addressed the nation Aug. 17 and
admitted an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky, Feinstein
shocked many of her supporters and colleagues by publicly
denouncing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trust in his credibility has been badly shattered,'' she
said. ``I was present in the Roosevelt room in January when the
president categorically denied any sexual involvement with Monica
Lewinsky. I believed him.'' She was referring to the now-famous
finger-wagging denial by the president that he had ever ``had
sexual relations with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Lieberman, another influential Democrat made
a floor speech harshly condemning Clinton's conduct. That was
followed by an increasing chorus of Democrats who expressed their
disillusionment with Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has since rebuffed attempts by Clinton to discuss the
Lewinsky affair with her, although she has corresponded with him on
other matters, such as getting federal aid for citrus crops in
California's central valley that were damaged in December by a
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration responded by approving federal aid
for victims of that freeze disaster, including $1.7 million for
farm workers who lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate vote to acquit Clinton, Feinstein scheduled a
news conference at 1:30 p.m. to discuss censure. But a bomb threat
caused Capitol police to order an emergency evacuation, forcing
Feinstein to cancel the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her future relations with the president, Feinstein
said the ball now is in his court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been through a year of trauma,'' Feinstein said.
``''He's been our leader _ he is our leader and we have to come to
terms with this... The president is speaking about reconciliation.
The president is the one who brought this on and reconciliation is
up to him.''

 &HT;    Relief quickly gives way to gloom after vote
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An almost giddy sense of relief could be felt at
the Capitol on the last day of President Bill Clinton's impeachment
trial. But as Sen. Max Cleland and an aide waited for an elevator
Friday morning, the Georgia Democrat held fast to the grave
demeanor that most of his colleagues have assumed over the past
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``God help us,'' Cleland said soberly, as he prepared to cast
two ``not guilty'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day these contrasting moods _ the weightiness of
impeachment and the lightness of closure _ played counterpoint with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   When the last two senators _ Majority Leader Trent Lott and
Minority Leader Tom Daschle _ had their say in the closed
deliberations, the doors were thrown open and the Senate chamber
soon was packed with the largest audience seen during this trial.
</P>
<P>
   Beside a host of journalists, some senators found seats for
family and staff. The only Democratic House member on the floor
during most of the trial has been Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston,
but on Friday she was joined by several others, including John
Lewis of Atlanta and Maxine Waters of Los Angeles. They were there
to witness a culmination that did not have many surprises left.
</P>
<P>
   If historical events were still captured in group portraits
rather than on video, the depiction of the Senate vote might have
near its center the ancient Strom Thurmond of South Carolina,
recording each vote on a long roll call sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the painting would show Georgia's Paul Coverdell peering
up curiously as his seatmate, Richard Shelby of Alabama, rose to
cast a vote that was still in doubt (Shelby voted not guilty on the
charge of perjury, guilty on obstruction of justice). Or maybe
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, staring straight ahead as his
seatmate, John Chafee of Rhode Island, rose to vote against
impeachment on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the effect of the moment was like a cross between the
College of Cardinals and a Rotary Club luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   After the senators had divested themselves of their
constitutional responsibility _ which didn't take long, considering
all that came before it _ Lott rose to present Chief Justice
William Rehnquist with a plaque, the ``Golden Gavel Award,'' for
his many hours of service.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on censure, which had been discussed so much in recent
weeks, was still to come, but most of the senators were already
rising, with much joshing and handshaking, to get out to the halls
where much of the press corps was waiting for their statements.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, with only a dozen or so senators left on the
floor, an interesting transformation took place. Coverdell, who was
among the most circumspect senators during the trial, was suddenly
at the majority leader's side as they worked their way through a
tricky parliamentary maneuver that essentially left the censure
motion dead in the water. A consummate inside player, the Georgia
Republican was at last back in his element.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chaos was descending on the senators who had rushed
to the halls for their valedictory sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb threat prompted Capitol police to clear first the Senate
chamber and the press gallery, and then the entire second and third
floors of the building. At the very moment some senators were going
before the television lights for their last word on impeachment,
police began chasing the press away from its stakeout positions.
</P>
<P>
   The early afternoon was unseasonably balmy, and before too long
a large crowd of the quoting and the quoted gathered on the Swamp,
as the big lawn behind the Capitol is called. The senators still
extemporized and the reporters still took notes, but by now the end
of impeachment had something of a spring break atmosphere, the
impact of sunshine on those who have been toiling away indoors for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then somberness, in the form of massive brooding clouds and an
approaching cold front, swept in again and the festive mood
vanished. Down at the White House, a stiff breeze was already
blowing when Clinton stepped into the Rose Garden to make his brief
comment on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, that's how fast the weather can change.

AIR FORCE AWARDS CONTRACT TO TEXAS, OKLAHOMA BASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $10.1 billion Air Force contract was awarded
Friday to the Lockheed Martin Corp. that will divide jet engine
repair work between Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The contract means Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio will lose
half the jet engine repair work and about 1,500 of the current
2,900 jobs to Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,400 workers who will remain in San Antonio will continue
to perform aircraft engine at the base, which the city is
redeveloping into an industrial park when it closes as a military
base in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the 15-year contract, Lockheed Martin beat a
consortium headed by Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the job losses at Kelly, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, said the contract was ``a huge victory for San Antonio and
the beginning of a new era at Kelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma lawmakers also were pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news for Tinker and the state of Oklahoma,''
said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. ``This contract could bring 1,500
jobs to Tinker.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio leaders say the long-awaited Air Force announcement
is a bittersweet victory for their efforts to redevelop Kelly,
which was ordered shuttered by a 1995 base closure commission.
</P>
<P>
   All the jobs at Kelly could have been lost under the original
base closure decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is the nation's largest defense contractor,
receiving $12.3 billion in contracts last year, followed by the
Boeing Co. of Seattle with $10.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has built its Aerospace Support Center on Kelly grounds
and is expected to employ 2,000 workers within two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these new powerhouses on site, I hope and expect to see
additional private and public workloads for San Antonio,'' said
Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well on our way to our goal of creating 21,000
private-sector jobs by the year 2006,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Awarding the jet engine work to Lockheed Martin and Tinker will
save the Air Force $1.8 billion over 15 years, said Darleen Druyun,
an Air Force deputy assistant secretary for acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Druyun called the two bids the ``most challenging as any I have
ever had in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon expects to save money by moving some of the Air
Force jet aircraft repair work to the Oklahoma City Air Logistics
Center at Tinker.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has been an Air Force repair center for the F-100 engines
used in F-16 and F-15 warplanes. That workload will be immediately
transferred to Tinker.
</P>
<P>
   The center also maintains the TF-39 engines used in the giant
C-5A Galaxy cargo planes and the T-56 propulsion systems that power
the C-130 cargo transporters, P-3 Navy patrol jets and E-2C
Hawkeye, a carrier-based surveillance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin will continue to repair those engines at
facilities leased at Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,900 Kelly workers are currently involved with the engine
repair, Air Force Col. Darryl Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Druyun said the Air Force will assist workers who want to
transfer to Tinker or seek employment in the private sector.

</P>
<P>
   ``Today's announcement is bittersweet,'' said Rep. Henry
Bonilla, a Republican who represents the San Antonio area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that 1,400 jobs will remain in San Antonio because
of this decision, but I'm disappointed that even more jobs will be
lost to Oklahoma City,'' Bonilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, a Democrat who also represents San
Antonio, said Lockheed would be a ``building block'' with future
job opportunities for those who may lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma lawmakers cried foul after the 1995 base closure round
when President Clinton stepped in and asked the Air Force to
privatize aircraft repair jobs at Kelly and McClellan Air Force
Base in Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., charged that Clinton politicized the
process to gain re-election support in the vote-rich states of
Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe said the shift of jet engine repair at Kelly to Tinker
rights that wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now move forward with greater confidence that the
critical resources needed to rebuild our armed forces will be
effectively and efficiently allocated without the influence of
political favoritism,'' Inhofe said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, lawmakers accused the Clinton administration of
meddling with a workload competition at McClellan, which will also
close in 2001. Air Force officials denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen said he would appoint an
independent review board to oversee contracts awarded for work at
Kelly and McClellan.

 &HT;    Mr. Intensity calm about backlash
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If anyone thinks President Clinton's acquittal will
chasten Rep. Bob Barr, they had better think again.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, just one day after the House prosecutors wrapped
up their case against the president, casting the lone vote in the
House against a measure to suspend taxes on imported drugs for
cancer and AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   And before the Senate had even rendered a verdict, there he was
declaring that history would not look ``kindly'' on the Senate for
the way it conducted the nation's second presidential impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the CNN cameras. The Georgia Republican did not
hesitate to unleash his views about the Justice Department's
decision to investigate independent counsel Kenneth Starr. ``It's
politically motivated,'' said Barr, practically screeching into the
microphones. ``I think it's very suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he left the Senate chamber Friday following the
acquittal, he was still defiant, joking that he and the other
managers better leave quickly before impatient senators eject them
``at the end of a bayonet.'' He said he half-expected to find ``a
sign tied to our backs saying, `... and don't come back!'''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 18 months, Barr has worked to remove Clinton from
office with what some have described as an unparalleled intensity.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first to call for the president's removal in the fall
of 1997, several months before the nation heard about the saga of
the president's concealment of his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his life in Washington is a study in intensity.
</P>
<P>
   He sleeps on a leather couch (that does not pull out) in his
square office in the Longworth Office Building. Inside his office,
the walls and shelves are crammed with impeachment paraphernalia
and well-wishes from constituents who write things such as ``I feel
your pain.''
</P>
<P>
   On one wall is a Harper's Weekly magazine depiction of the
Senate impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868. A fan sent him
a can of ``impeaches'' with Bill Clinton's photo on the front and a
ditty on the side entitled ``Impeachment Time in Washington,''
which is sung to the tune of ``Peach Pick'n Time in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr showers and shaves in the House gym. He rarely eats lunch.
Instead of milk before bedtime, Barr prefers a mug of Starbucks
with a shot of espresso. On good nights, he gets five hours sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He has made his mark attacking the president and now it seems
that the Democrats are equally ``obsessed'' with his removal, Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told aides recently that he wants to target Republican
districts to win back the House for the Democratic Party, according
to the New York Times. And Barr says he would not be surprised to
find his name at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, run by
Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), has singled out Barr as well. Though
Kennedy admits it is a long shot, he wants to run a candidate
against him in the next congressional election.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's response?
</P>
<P>
   In his best, ``Bring 'em on down'' tone of voice, Barr said he
is hardly concerned. When asked about being targeted by the
Democratic committee, Barr barely concealed his bemusement, heaving
a long ``oooow.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7th District voters have spoken, Barr said. Nearly 70
percent of the e-mail, phone calls and letters favor his pursuit of
the president on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a backlash,'' Barr said. ``I do know that some
of the Democrats are obsessed.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of voters support forcing the president to
abide by the rule of law, Barr said. It is a matter of distributing
equal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats are going to go back and say you need to
remove Bob Barr from office, I don't think it will resonate,'' said
Barr. Indeed, Barr's district is historically conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he is not bitter or angry about the outcome of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, he is somewhat at peace with the verdict _ or
as much at peace as someone like Barr can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a tremendous sense of frustration and sorrow, but I
don't feel anger,'' Barr said. ``Maybe we've become so cynical, so
calloused that we've come to expect double standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he is well aware that some may be skeptical of his
outlook because of his ``reputation for being a mean SOB.'' Still,
that is how it is, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The long impeachment drama has left its scars, though.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was taken to task in December for speaking to a group best
known for its support of white supremacist views. He was called a
``hypocrite'' by Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who said
Barr had an affair with his third wife while he was married to his
second wife. Flynt also charged that Barr paid his second wife's
abortion, despite being a staunch opponent to abortion. Barr has
denied both allegations.
</P>
<P>
   After the attacks, Barr's role on the prosecution team was
reduced, something he acknowledges but won't comment on.
</P>
<P>
   Barr is still upset about the attacks, particularly being called
a racist for speaking to the national convention of the
Conservative Citizens Council, a group that he contends he did not
know about until he arrived at the convention. (A point the group
disagrees with. They say he knew well in advance about the nature
of their beliefs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so abhorrent,'' Barr said. ``It's hard to find the
words to describe how that hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   It hurt, Barr said, because his reputation as a U.S. attorney in
Atlanta was based on fighting police officers who abused the civil
rights of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Where other prosecutors kept a tight lip on what they think
about the Senate's handling of the case, Barr said he felt as if he
had been denied a ``fair opportunity'' to present the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration is we were denied a fair opportunity to
present evidence,'' Barr said. ``That makes the defeat of this
process hard to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Senate voted to acquit the president after the House
prosecutors had presented the evidence and called witnesses to the
stand, then it would have been a fair loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all learned to live with that,'' Barr said. ``You don't
belly ache about losing a business deal as long as the playing
field has been level and everyone operates fairly. You don't whine
about losing as long as the process has been fair and open.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr doesn't blame it all on the Senate. He thinks Rep. Henry
Hyde (R-Ill.) and the House prosecutors should have been more
insistent on calling witnesses to the stand and presenting
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can put all the blame on the Senate,'' Barr
said. ``I think we really should have held out for witnesses early
on.''
</P>
<P>
   After being told by Senate leaders that they did not want to
call witnesses to the stand, Barr said they succumbed to limit it
to just three depositions. That was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The other mistake, he said, was trying to establish a rapport
with an adverse witness such as Lewinsky. Had she been his witness,
he would have been much firmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different approaches to dealing with witnesses,''
Barr said. ``If you know a witness is adverse, I don't think you
necessarily have to worry about establishing a nice rapport with
that witness.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Barr said the prosecutors should have been
allowed to introduce new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But that is hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   And after it all ended, Barr was able to find some solace in his
first contact with the public after the acquittal. As he and the
other House mangers walked through the Capitol to the House side
Friday, about 20 tourists burst into applause as the prosecutors
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That to me, more than anything that happened in the Senate
Chamber over the last month, including today, tells me that we did
the right thing,'' Barr said.

A DAY OF GRAVE SIMPLICITY OFFERS RELIEF AFTER A 13-MONTH ORDEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was only eight minutes after the court of last
resort delivered salvation to President Clinton that the order rang
forth: ``The Sergeant at Arms will escort the House managers out of
the Senate chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   With that order as much as the firm acquittal votes for the
president, the Senate secured its dignity and rebuffed the
constitutional assault on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A great sense of relief, as of a general exhalation 13 months in
the making, swept the chamber at the verdict. Obediently, the House
Republican prosecutors retreated to the far side of the Capitol
with a bare minimum of ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the chief prosecutor, offered a smile at
parting as he trudged due south from the Senate, leading his band
of accusers. Minutes earlier, he looked openly crestfallen as he
sat listening to vote after vote, realizing the prosecutors had
failed to stir even a bare majority in their eager mission to
banish Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   With each individual verdict, the fateful process of acquittal _
so clipped, so formal _ gripped the Senate scene for the Spartan
manner in which a moment of deliverance was extended to the
president and his suffering constituents as well.
</P>
<P>
   Something sorely missing across the ordeal of the presidential
scandal _ a basic sense of grace in self-government as much as
constitutional solemnity _ seemed to seize the proceeding the
instant Chief Justice William Rehnquist rapped his gavel.
</P>
<P>
   His demand for undemonstrative silence locked the gallery into
focus upon the mesmerizing scene below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators, how say you?'' Rehnquist asked in behalf of an
exhausted nation waiting beyond for the verdict on its president.
</P>
<P>
   At this, the lawmakers became the ultimate judges of the
president's misbehavior in the sex-and-mendacity tale that has
haunted the country so relentlessly. In rising to the task, the
senators took a total of 31 minutes to provide a stunning tableau:
a deliberative body gravely aware of how close to the
constitutional edge the nation had reeled, setting a restorative
course.
</P>
<P>
   In the chamber, even with the verdict accurately foretold, the
vote casting came with an excruciating edge of emotion. No one
watching could be quite certain of anything until the redemptive
tallies. And even then, all in attendance seemed drained of any
conventional inclination to exult or despair.
</P>
<P>
   As the individual verdicts came forth, member by member, the
simplicity of such a constitutional remedy seemed mercy itself
after the endless welter of scandal noise that ragged the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a deep breath to steady his composure, Sen. Rod Grams of
Minnesota stood up in the Republican midst, occupied his hands with
buttoning his jacket and rather gently declared, ``Guilty.'' His
nervousness seemed palpable as he sat down, a witnessed fact as
important for history as his verdict. The senator's grim expression
of duty done exemplified the chamber mood. He seemed to truly
realize in his simple utterance the truth in what one and all
predicted across the five-week trial: In sparing or removing the
president, the assembled senators were casting the most important
votes of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was at the White House, far from the judgment well. But
his close confidant, Bruce Lindsey, the presidential alter ego who
bucks up Clinton in the worst of times, clasped his empty hands
tightly at the defense table as if the final cards had been played
and the pot was awaiting the winner. But there was no exultation to
be found at the vote as the Senate offered the antidote to 13
months of national agony.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate hubbub, when the voting was finally over, included a
tinge of plain hangover. But this was relieved, it soon turned out,
by the court's return to its legislative mode and its familiar
indulgence of the mother tongue for something lengthier than the
spare ``guilty'' and ``not guilty'' applied to the case of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the the needs of history had no sooner been served then the
pathology of the scandal story seemed to creep back to life in the
form of a bomb threat, of all things, suddenly phoned into the
Capitol. The building was cleared of senators, staffers and
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's retribution is starting in a hurry,'' joked
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, as he wended his way out of the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Minority leader Tom Daschle, the Democrat who most seemed to
suffer as he mutely absorbed weeks of sordid accusations about the
president, knew exactly what he would do. He went to the Air and
Space Museum down the Mall. He wandered around as impeachment
jurist turned tourist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little sandwich,'' the senator related later. ``I was
the only one with a tie walking around,'' he said smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the chamber, when the vote was done, Daschle had reached
across to warmly shake the hand of majority leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it,'' he told the Republican, recalling Lott's instant
reply: ``We sure did.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bomb threat finally discounted, Daschle returned from
the space museum with his first post-impeachment question: ``Is
this a weird day or what?''

BIG STAKES IN ON-LINE JOB LISTINGS

being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make

 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An online help-wanted service, Hotjobs.com, had revenue of $4
million in all of 1998. Two weeks ago, the company managed to spend
fully half of that in just 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   That $2 million, spent on a Super Bowl commercial, was the
company's attempt to add its name to the list of better-known
online employment sites. But the gamble says as much about the
industry as it does about Hotjobs itself: On-line recruiters are
racing to become the Yahoo or Amazon.com of their field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for Internet recruiting is here and now,'' said
Richard S. Johnson, chief executive and founder of Hotjobs. ``This
is our time to stand up and be counted.''
</P>
<P>
   The competitors are inspired by the high stakes. Forrester
Research of Cambridge, Mass., says help-wanted advertising on the
Internet will rise from $105 million, or 1.3 percent of the print
share, last year to $1.7 billion, or 19.8 percent, by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The leader is Monster.com, which in 1994 became one of the first
online recruiting agencies. But two other services, Career Mosaic
(www.careermosaic.com) and Career Path (careerpath.com) are close
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other sites list jobs, too, including some devoted
to specific careers. Web portals like Yahoo and content providers
like C-Net are crowding into the business.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper classifieds provide the model, but with many added
twists. On the Internet, employers generally pay the sites to list
their openings, which candidates can search free. Job seekers can
also post resumes for potential employers to peruse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advantages of Internet recruiting is global scope
(though applicants can search by city or region). Job and resume
listings can be updated almost instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers say the Internet also gives them the best picture of
the market for their skills. Steve Garcia, 37, of Medina, Ohio,
decided last October to scan Monster.com, Headhunter.net and
Salesseek.com. He plugged in his desired income, his skills and his
preferred job locations.
</P>
<P>
   He soon zeroed in on a job posted at Monster.com. Within two
weeks, he came to terms with a real estate company called Real
Select, where he now is a district sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   Although online sites would not give success rates for placing
job seekers, they point to their huge resume files as evidence of
their popularity. And no longer are most of the job openings and
candidates in high-technology areas. The larger sites offer jobs
ranging from corporate management to entry-level positions at
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com said that three years ago, 97 percent of its
listings were in technology, compared with about half today. Its
users are now split evenly between men and women, typically in
their mid-30s and in mid-career, but fairly new to the Internet.
``We're seeing newbie users come on like never before,'' said Jeff
Taylor, chief executive of Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper companies do not plan to concede defeat. Career Path
is backed by eight of them, including the New York Times Co., the
Washington Post Co., the Tribune Co.y, Knight-Ridder and Hearst. It
gathers 300,000 job listings, primarily from its 83 member
newspapers, and solicits online-only ads as well.
</P>
<P>
   Career Path, in Los Angeles, has begun its own marketing
campaign, led by full-page newspaper advertisements on Super Bowl
Sunday and the following Monday. Stephen Ste. Marie, the company's
chief executive, said it would spend $15 to $20 million in
marketing this year, up from almost nothing during 1998. ``This
really is a watershed year,'' he said. ``The stakes have gotten
pretty high, pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com, of Maynard, Mass., owned by the recruiting agency
TMP Worldwide, lists 175,000 jobs. Taylor said that in the two
weeks after its own Super Bowl ad, the company received as many as
2,900 job searches a minute, up from a previous peak of 800.
</P>
<P>
   He said that more than 20 newspapers have rejected print ads for
Monster.com because it is competing with their help-wanted
business. But even with the help of their Career Path site, Taylor
said, the newspapers represent the past and his company the future.
``This is not a re-purposed help-wanted ad being moved from place
to place in the newspaper system,'' he said of Monster.com. ``This
is a new way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of urgency among the sites is well-founded. Internet
Profiles, a market research firm in Redwood City, Calif., reported
that a 75 percent increase in traffic from 1997 to 1998 at the
online help-wanted sites went mostly to the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A fear of being left behind motivated Hotjobs to place its Super
Bowl ad, Johnson said. After the game, the site _ which lists about
17,000 jobs _ was so overwhelmed that many visitors were unable to
enter it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Johnson deemed the ad expense only a qualified
success. ``We disappointed a lot of people,'' he said. ``But the
traffic isn't tapering off.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Dow Jones industrial average confined to a
fairly tight trading range for the last 30 days, investors may be
starting to wonder where their bull market has gone. It hasn't
helped that yields on Treasury bonds have jumped from 5.1 percent
in mid-January to 5.42 percent on Friday. Since the Federal Reserve
Board has let the bond market take the lead on interest rate policy
in recent years, the move in yields may be a sign of higher
interest rates in the months ahead _ never a plus for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a month of lackluster stock prices does not mean the
end of the bull run. And bond traders could be wrong about rates.
Nevertheless, it may be a good time for investors to look at their
expectations for stock returns.
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations remain sky-high, thanks to years of outsized
returns. A survey conducted by the IAI mutual fund group in 1995
asked 1,600 of its customers what they expected to reap annually on
their holdings. Some 55 percent said they anticipated stocks to
gain 15 percent or more each year.
</P>
<P>
   Such pleasant fantasies have been reality for stocks during the
four years since the survey. But historically speaking, those
returns are high. According to Ibbotson Associates, stocks have
returned 11.2 percent a year, on average, since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Yet expectations may now be even higher, given four years of
20-percent-plus stock gains. Does that mean investors are crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Christopher Orndorff, principal at Payden &AMP; Rygel, an
investment firm in Los Angeles, has done some math to show why.
</P>
<P>
   Orndorff did two analyses of where stocks might be 10 years from
now. For the best case, he took the average annual return on stocks
during the past 10 years _ 18 percent, including dividends _ and
reprised it over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed that earnings would grow 6 percent a year (on the
high side of performance during the recent past), and that
inflation would stay low, at 2 percent. For the worst case he
plugged a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6 for the S&AMP;P 500 into his
equations, the average during periods of low inflation. He also
assumed a much lower, but not outlandish, earnings growth rate of 2
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion? If stocks returned what they have for the past
decade, the S&AMP;P would be trading at 48 times earnings in 2009, or
50 percent higher than the 32 times earnings for the index today.
But if the p/e ratio reverted to normal levels in a low-inflation
economy, stocks would return just 1.9 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this because we would occasionally hear clients make
projections for the next 10 years,'' Orndorff said. ``They didn't
fully appreciate how truly extraordinary the last 10 years have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows where stocks will be in 2009, of course. But
looking in the rear-view mirror rarely reveals what lies ahead.
After all, who would have guessed in 1989 that the Dow industrials
would be more than 6,000 points higher in 10 years? Investors who
now believe the decade's high stock returns will continue may be
proven just as wrong.

   ``No sensible person can honestly say they expect the S&AMP;P to
sell at 48 times earnings,'' said Peter J. Tanous, the president of
Lynx Investment Advisory Inc. in Washington. ``If they do, there's
only one word for them _ and the word is delusional.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soon after the Senate failed to convict President
Clinton on Friday, the alternative of censure died as well. The
Senate in the end passed no negative judgment at all on the
president.
</P>
<P>
   There were 82 senators voting for one form of denunciation or
the other, but they could not agree on either one.
</P>
<P>
   After the acquittal ended the Senate's role as a court of
impeachment, a bipartisan censure resolution fell victim to
Republican parliamentary roadblocks, thrown up by Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, and to universal weariness with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis will be coming back before censure does,'' Gramm said
gleefully after the trial was gaveled to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Censure supporters, led by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, tried to bring their resolution to the
floor on Friday, but it would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate
to do that. When it became clear the procedural motion was doomed _
failing 43-56 _ Ms. Feinstein agreed to drop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far right did not want this censure to come up,''
Feinstein said afterward. ``All we were asking for was a vote. Let
it come to the floor, vote on it, have the debate, let people vote
yes, let people vote no. That's our system.''
</P>
<P>
   After the test vote succumbed, the best Feinstein could wring
from Republican leaders was a promise for two hours of time to
debate her statement. But in one final insult, a bomb threat forced
the evacuation of the Capitol's Senate wing and, after a 80-minute
delay, the post-acquittal debate on censure was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein entered the censure statement signed by 29 Democrats
and nine Republicans _ more than one-third of the Senate _ into the
Congressional Record and declared, ``It will stand on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-page statement declared that the president's affair
with Monica Lewinsky was ``shameful, reckless and indefensible''
and asserted that Clinton ``gave false or misleading testimony and
his actions have had the effect of impeding discovery of evidence
in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, censure died on Friday because most Republicans
and a handful of Democrats said such a censure would violate the
separation of powers between the executive and legislative
branches, set a bad precedent for future Congresses, have no
lasting impact and prolong the unpopular scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure will drag this issue on,'' said Sen. John Warner,
R-Va. ``We've got to end the pain, heal the nation and get back to
our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had a clear incentive to vent their anger at the
president's misconduct, lest their acquittal votes be construed as
condoning his behavior. Indeed, Republicans accused Democrats of
using censure as a political cover.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans would also seem to have strong reason to support
censure, since few of them want Clinton to revel in acquittal as
the Senate's last word on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Republican minds, however, were deeper political motivations.
Many Republicans believe that the politics of impeachment will
shift, and by next year or certainly by the 2000 elections, Clinton
will be less popular and a vote to convict will actually look
reasonable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morever, senators said Gramm had privately voiced concerns that
passing a censure resolution in the Senate could ignite a like
effort by House Democrats and undermine the House's near-party line
impeachment vote, both for posterity and for use in the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense among many Republicans that we have to stand
shoulder to shoulder with the House Republicans and not look like
we're trying to cut and run from that vote,'' one senior Republican
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to confirm Gramm's suspicions, Rep. Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., the minority leader, suggested a faint hope on Friday of
bringing up censure later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure appears to be a fading option,'' Gephardt said in a
statement. ``I still hold out a glimmer of belief that common sense
may reassert itself, and this may still happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most Americans support censuring the president. In a New
York Times/CBS News Poll conducted earlier this month, 55 percent
of those surveyed said they favored a Senate censure, while 38
percent opposed it. The rest were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a popular political remedy suffer such a decisive
demise? The death of censure, while officially tolled on Friday,
started last November, when Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority
whip, fought ferociously to block censure as an alternative to
impeachment in the House.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's efforts steeled wavering House Republicans and helped
propel the successful vote on two of the four articles brought to
the House floor by the House Judiciary Committee, headed by Rep.
Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill. In the Senate, Republicans led by Trent Lott,
R-Miss., the majority leader, walked a tightrope in trying to keep
the trial focused and moving ahead and still give the House
Republican prosecutors a fair opportunity to make their best case.
</P>
<P>
   Lott encouraged a Republican plan, a ``findings of fact,'' that
essentially convicted Clinton of the two allegations, but did not
remove him. When Democrats balked, that idea collapsed, and censure
was resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said in an interview on Friday that late last week ``there
was substantial interest'' among Republicans in a bipartisan
censure. Conservatives, like Bennett and Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., joined moderates, like Sens. John Chafee, R-R.I., and
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, to back it.
</P>
<P>
   But then Gramm dug in his formidable heels. No censure, no way,
declared Gramm, threatening a filibuster. Under Senate rules, it
takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. Tougher yet was doing that
before a weeklong holiday that starts on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language never was strong enough for us,'' Lott said,
``and then there was the time problem. Senators were tired of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the formal censure resolution died, the censure statement
lost steam, even among Democrats. ``I'll vote for a censure
motion,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. ``If not, I'll write my
own letter.''

 &HT;    Barr's role alienated some voters
 &HT;    By D.L. Bennett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rep. Bob Barr's role in the failed Republican effort
to impeach President Clinton may have alienated the staunchly
conservative third-term congressman from moderate voters in the 11
northwest Georgia counties that comprise the 7th District.
</P>
<P>
   David Bailey, an independent voter, said Barr and the
Republicans were wrong to try to impeach the president. The market
manager at Brunos in Carrollton said censure would have been the
right move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's wasted our time and our money instead of taking care of
business. We've got more important matters for our Congress to be
taking care of,'' Bailey said. ``They could have spent this time
working on Social Security or health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Crenshaw, a Republican from Douglas County, said he sees
Barr as a ``Don Quixote'' and predicted his impractical effort to
gain impeachment will erode Barr's support back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hitched his wagon to a falling star,'' Crenshaw said.
``He had very noble intentions, but he misread the mood of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who lives in Smyrna, burst on the national scene and
gained considerable exposure on national talk shows, nightly news
and C-SPAN in 1997 as the first in Congress to call for Clinton's
ouster. But much of Barr's message was blurred by his pit bull
demeanor that he has unsuccessfully tried to shed since taking
office in 1994. At appearances, the former federal prosecutor often
jokes that his wife, Jeri, has been pressing him to smile and act
friendlier.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Magar and Lloyd Hoskins of Austell, both shopping for
steaks at a Winn Dixie near Douglasville, said their opinions of
Barr had slipped since the impeachment saga began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to worry about people in his own district instead of
lynchmobbing people,'' Magar said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins said he is tired of the battle between Clinton and the
Republicans and believes Barr is ``just as guilty of doing things
as the rest of them in Washington. He just hasn't gotten caught
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some erosion in Barr's support was evident in last fall's
election.
</P>
<P>
   Facing unknown, unfunded Democrat Jim Williams, Barr managed to
win a third term with just 55 percent of the vote. The district,
that stretches from LaGrange to Summerville, had been in Democratic
hands for decades. Barr seized it for the Republican column in 1994
by tying incumbent Buddy Darden to Clinton, whose popularity was at
an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   National Democratic leaders have targeted Barr's district in
next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Binford, professor of political science at Georgia State
University, said Barr's harsh image and slipping support among
moderates could make him vulnerable in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a vulnerable position before. Now, he's more
vulnerable,'' Binford said. ``Democrats are angry. It will probably
encourage some high-profile Democrat to run against him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kirincich, executive director of the Georgia Democratic
Party, said former state Rep. Tim Perry and longtime Democratic
contributor Roger Kahn are two potential 7th District candidates.
Barr's efforts to impeach the president are likely to have little
or no impact on two groups already poles apart _ conservatives who
love him and staunch Democrats who loath the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel Morries, a former pastor for the Assembly of God who now
runs an antique shop in Douglasville, supports Barr unflinchingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a high opinion of him,'' said Morries. ``My opinion has
strengthened. He's a man of ethics. I'd have liked to see Clinton
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``a shame'' that Republicans seemed to misplay
their hand and may have hurt their own cause.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats like Bill Haney of Bremen say they want to see
Barr gone as soon as possible. Barr's role in the impeachment only
strengthened Haney's distaste for Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never liked Barr,'' Haney said. ``This sure hasn't helped
him in any way. The president did wrong, but the economy is better
than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Haney also voiced opinions shared by a majority of Americans in
national polls. ``I'm living better than I ever have,'' Haney said.
``Barr should respect the will of the majority of the people. Most
people don't want the president impeached. He's not done that.

WOMEN'S PLACE AT ISLAMIC FUNERALS: CUSTOM, NOT LAW 
THE POPE'S PAEAN TO AGING WITH DIGNITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When King Hussein of Jordan was laid to rest in a state funeral
that attracted leaders from around the world on Monday, one aspect
of the ceremony often mentioned in news reports was the absence of
women from the funeral procession and the burial. The king's widow,
Queen Noor, and other female members of the royal household were
shown grieving at one of the palaces, far from the grave site.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation widely offered was that Islamic tradition
prohibits women from attending funerals.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out this view is by no means universally held among
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the funeral, the Muslim Public Affairs Council,
which distributes information about Islam and maintains offices in
Los Angeles and Washington, put out a statement saying the
prohibition of women from funerals was ``a cultural tradition
garbed in Islamic clothing that varies from one place to another.''
By way of an example, the council said that Iran had no official
rule against women at funerals.
</P>
<P>
   One person who has studied the issue is Aslam Abdullah, editor
of The Minaret, a Muslim magazine published in Los Angeles.
Exclusion of women, Abdullah said, ``is the general tendency of
Middle Eastern funerals,'' backed by opinions widely held by
Islamic scholars in that region.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, it is not necessarily the rule in other parts of
the Islamic world, for example sub-Saharan Africa, home to major
Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah said that there was nothing in the Koran, the Islamic
holy book, that specifically said women should be excluded from
funerals. He added that the Prophet Mohammed, considered by Muslims
to be God's messenger, communicated his funeral arrangements
directly to his wife Ayesha, and provided in those instructions
that women be allowed to be present, in a section behind his family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Interpretations of Islam rules that would prohibit women from
attending funerals, Abdullah said, arose among scholars several
decades after the prophet's death in 632.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in Jordan, or what happens in Saudi Arabia, or
other places, reflects those religious opinions,'' Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he planned to discuss the issue in a future
article in his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   THE POPE'S PAEAN TO AGING WITH DIGNITY
</P>
<P>
   Turning to another recent event that drew international
attention, the visit of Pope John Paul II to St. Louis two weeks
ago, an additional thought is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff visited that city on Jan. 26 and departed a little
more than 30 hours later, after having spent five days in Mexico
City. The visit was his fifth pastoral trip to the United States in
20 years and, given ongoing concerns about his health, it could
well be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Many news reports, particularly on television, picked up on that
theme, to such an extent that much coverage leading up to the
pope's visit dealt with his physical condition. (He will turn 79 in
May and has not led the easiest life, having twice survived
near-deadly encounters, the first as a young man when he was struck
by a military truck in Nazi-occupied Poland, the other as pope when
he was shot by a would-be assassin in St. Peter's Square in 1981.)
</P>
<P>
   Before he arrived in St. Louis, television reports showed
videotapes in which John Paul was seen moving slowly, slightly
stooped, his left hand trembling with the symptoms of what is
believed to be Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But in these characteristics, one leading churchman discerned a
note of grace. In an interview in St. Louis at the time of the
papal visit, Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, said
the pope, in continuing to travel abroad and speak before large
audiences, was providing ``a great witness'' to growing old as an
inescapable fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   In his visit to St. Louis, the cardinal said, the pope was
effectively making a countercultural statement against the American
obsession with youth and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this American ideal of perfect health,'' the cardinal
said, ``and if you're not there, uh-oh, it's really bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's teaching us: Live each day as fully as you can,'' Mahony
said. ``He's not afraid to be in public walking slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' the cardinal added, ``this is one of the most
eloquent chapters of the pope's life and witness, and it's a great
gift to all of us.''

 &HT;    CLINTON APOLOGIZES, SEEKS TRUCE
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acquitted but restrained, President Clinton said
Friday he was ''profoundly sorry'' for putting the country through
a year of scandal, deception and impeachment, and offered an olive
branch to those who voted to evict him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be
prepared to give it,'' Clinton said, speaking in somber tones hours
after the darkest chapter of his political career closed with his
Senate acquittal. ''This must be a time of reconciliation and
renewal for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the American people from the White House, Clinton was
careful to conceal whatever inner exhilaration he might have felt
about the end of the year-long inquiry into his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He made no claim of victory or vindication, but instead
apologized for conduct that has brought dishonor and distraction to
his office, caused his family public pain and split the country
along ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say again to the American people how profoundly
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American
people,'' Clinton said, speaking in the sun-splashed splendor of
the Rose Garden on a rare mid-winter's day of short-sleeves
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for milder political temperatures as well, Clinton made
clear that he would work with Republicans who control the House and
Senate _ all but a handful of whom voted to remove him from office
_ to try to address the long-term future of Social Security and a
host of other programs at the core of his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five 55 senators voted that Clinton was not guilty of
perjury, with 45 voting that he was guilty; and the Senate split
50-50 over whether he was guilty of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask all Americans,'' said Clinton, ''and I hope all
Americans, here in Washington and throughout our land, will
rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation and building
our future together.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart later told reporters that
Clinton would meet with the Republican and Democratic leaders from
the House and Senate soon after members return to Washington from
next week's recess.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they come back, we'll be ready to work with them,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   With Republican majorities controlling both houses of Congress,
Clinton will have to deal aggressively with his former inquisitors
and jurors on Social Security, Medicare, education and a raft of
other issues in order to leave a legacy of legislative achievement
that might transcend the stain of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are all issues that, because of the nature of our
government, we are going to have to reach out and get Republican
support for,'' Lockhart said. ''And I expect that, when they come
back, at the appropriate time, we'll all get together and start
working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had expected for weeks that the Senate would
vote to acquit Clinton. Still, when the votes were cast, falling
far short of the two-thirds majority required to remove him from
office, the entire administration was swept with relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a good bit of suspense in the room,'' said White
House political counselor Paul Begala, who watched the Senate votes
with a dozen other senior aides clustered around a television in
the office of chief of staff John Podesta. ''The outcome was not
really in doubt, but you never know until you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his staff went to pains to avoid any appearance of a
celebration, wanting to avert the backlash that followed the
assembly of more than 100 of his supporters on the South Lawn after
the House voted to impeach him in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, given the circumstances of this matter that's gone on
for this long, we can be relieved it's over,'' Lockhart said. ''But
there's really nothing to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word from Clinton's legal team, the core
members of which left the West Wing of the White House shortly
after the Senate votes were cast, and received a smattering of
applause from onlookers gathered near the northwest gate along
Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well done, well done, well done,'' called out One (cq) Brooks,
a 49-year-old Washington social worker, as the black iron gate
swung open and White House Counsel Charles Ruff rolled out in his
wheelchair, leading a group that included Cheryl Mills of his
office and Clinton's personal attorneys, David Kendall and Nicole
Seligman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to lunch,'' was all a smiling Kendall would say
to reporters. ''We will enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton would work hard to regain the trust of
Americans _ a majority of whom support Clinton but believe he is
guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice, according to a recent
poll by the Gallup Organization of Princeton, N.J. Clinton also
will not make an effort to ``demonize'' his detractors, Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that's hard, when the public believes that you
have done something that you don't believe you have done,''
Lockhart said. ''But no one in the next 23 months is going to spend
time trying to demonize those who did it. We are going to get on
with the business that is at hand because that's good policy. It's
good for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has at other critical junctures during the investigation
about his relationship with Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal
their partnership from federal investigators, Clinton pointedly
avoided watching Friday's historic vote.
</P>
<P>
   During at least part of the time, Lockhart said, Clinton was in
his private gym working out, preparing his brief statement, or
chatting with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her mother, who
was visiting in the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   Mentally, though, Clinton stayed close to the vote, with
minute-by-minute updates by phone from Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed that when the dust settled on this, that the
Senate would come out the way it did today,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In a message Clinton broadcast by e-mail to the White House
staff, he pledged to ''redouble'' his efforts as president, thanked
them for standing by him throughout the past year's difficulties
and urged all personnel to put the scandal behind them and ''keep
working hard,'' for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that my actions and the events they triggered have made
your work even harder. For that, I am profoundly sorry,'' the
message to staff read in part.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the months to come, we can move beyond the divisions of the
past year to build a nation that is stronger and more united as it
enters the 21st Century,'' Clinton wrote. ''Your dedication and
loyalty have meant more to me than you can ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   After his Rose Garden remarks, Clinton went into the Cabinet
Room for an hour-long meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, National Security Adviser Samuel Berger, Attorney General
Janet Reno and other senior aides to discuss his upcoming trip to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One aide who attended said Clinton was focused on the economic,
trade and anti-narcotics issues expected to dominate the summit
talks, and that the subject of Friday's Senate vote did not come
up, at least not during the official portion of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the First Lady travel to Merida, Mexico, on Sunday
for a dinner with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and his wife.
Clinton will meet with Zedillo on Monday and return to Washington
that night.

<P>
   MADISON, N.J. _ Caroline Smith and Julie Yancy, both
stay-at-home moms in this affluent, sturdily Republican town, had
just dropped off their children at school and were grabbing a quick
cup of coffee when they discovered they held distinctly different
views on the effort to oust President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have gotten off,'' Ms. Yancy, 36, said. ``He
should have been impeached because he lied. It had nothing to do
with sex, as far I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith saw it differently. ``It was a waste of time, a waste
of energy, a waste of focus away from the issues of the world, of
the country, that I think are more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both women seemed to agree, as did almost all of four dozen
people who were randomly interviewed in this town of 15,800, that
they were exhausted from the year-long melodrama of sex in the Oval
Office and congressional retribution, and relieved that it had come
to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jones, 46, a consultant who runs his own
telecommunications business, put the matter bluntly as he stopped
by the YMCA to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sick of this,'' he said. ``Let's get on with it. Get
back to doing things that are important, like education. Do
something about the surplus. Protect my social security. Do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a rough consensus among those interviewed that the
impeachment episode had soiled practically everyone who had touched
it, and had left the public with a deepened cynicism about
government, politics, the media, even society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Congress looked foolish for being so against each
other and the media looked foolish,'' said Laura Patterson, 23, the
owner of a shop on Main Street where children learn computer
skills. ``But I hope the American public will be brought closer
together because we all feel, Enough already. Let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, even those who reviled Clinton for his behavior,
expressed contempt for the partisan way that they felt Congress had
handled the proceedings. ``The fact that these people were voting,
strictly along party lines, is an absolute disgrace,'' said Andrew
Abels, 41, a hotel manager who was also at the YMCA. ``You have to
vote with your conscience and that didn't happen. I am disgusted
with our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Bennett, 33, a registered Republican who stays at home
with her two young boys, said she was disillusioned and frustrated
that her party had allowed the proceedings to turn into such a
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just disgusted at the whole process,'' she said, as she
watched her sons clamber up a slide at a playground in the
springlike weather. ``They brought these charges against him. I
felt that they were valid. They should have been taken seriously,
and it just turned into a circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison, about 25 miles west of midtown Manhattan, is a commuter
town where houses sell for an average of $300,000. It is the home
of three colleges, including Drew University, whose president,
former Gov. Thomas Kean, a moderate Republican, was one of the
state's most popular politicians. Registered Republicans outnumber
Democrats more than 2-1, and Republicans hold almost every elective
office, though Bob Dole won here by only 100 votes in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, people offered views that mirror the findings
of recent polls: They said they believed that Clinton's behavior
was reprehensible, but they did not think a private matter should
have led to a widely broadcast investigation and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If Madison is any bellwether, Republicans could suffer some
damaging fallout. Several Republicans interviewed here said they
had become particularly disenchanted with the Republicans who
represented the party on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the Republicans were so strong on the case that it
turned me off to the point that I don't know whether I want to call
myself a Republican,'' said Ms. Patterson, who grew up in a
Republican household in Bergen County.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Emily McGrath, a school crossing guard who was stopping traffic
with her stop sign outside St. Vincent Roman Catholic elementary
school, said the move against the president was ''ridiculous'' and
soured her on the Republican Party to which she had long belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do anything that was impeachable,'' she said. ``It
is an embarrassment for his family. I am certainly not going to
vote for the Republicans. The Republicans hate him. And they have
this vendetta against him.''
</P>
<P>
   At Drew University, Kean, the former governor, sat in a
wing-backed chair in his spacious office and expressed concern that
the impeachment proceedings could cost state Republican lawmakers
control of the General Assembly when they come up for re-election
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jerseyans did that when I was in the Legislature during
Watergate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kean said the Republicans in Congress made a big mistake by
arguing with the American people over impeachment for the last six
months. ``You don't win those arguments,'' he said. ``The American
people have expressed themselves very clearly, and I think very
sensibly, very early on. They thought that Clinton had done
something very bad but that it did not rise to the level of
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the town's Democrats said they
believed that Clinton deserved his disrepute. ``The office has been
scarred,'' said Stephanie Horman, a stockbroker, as she dropped her
4-year-old son off at a computer class. ``I wonder if it is ever
going to recoup that pedestal status.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pietrowski, artistic director of the Playwrights Theater of
New Jersey here, who voted for Ronald Reagan, George Bush and
Robert Dole, held his own quirky evaluation of the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is key is the total lack of imagination of everybody
involved in this,'' he said. ``What Clinton did totally lacked
imagination. A powerful man gets into a consensual relationship
with a 23-year-old girl. You'd think someone who had the wisdom and
profundity to become the leader of the free world would be able to
imagine himself a scenario better than this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you listen to the house managers in the well of the
Senate,'' he continued. ``They're so literal, they're so obvious
and there's no depth of thought, no profound, poetic use of
language, no thinking into this situation in some way where we
could come out with some wisdom from it. That's really scary that
the people who are supposed to be the leaders of this country have
no imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The only silver lining, he said, was that the ordeal may teach
us to recognize that our presidents are flawed. Clinton, he
explained, ``is someone who has this very immature, dark side and
like most of us is trying to figure out how to balance those two
things.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, some people in this town who are genuinely
disheartened that the president has been able to emerge from an
ethical morass without the punishment they would have liked to see.

<P>
   Judith Falco, a young grandmother who cuts hair at Sandy's
salon, put her disappointment bluntly:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like O.J. Simpson. He killed two people and he's
free,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the potential political reverberations, Ms. Smith and
other parents interviewed said they were most concerned about the
lasting effects the scandal might have on young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is four and he said to me, `The president is a liar,'''
said Mary Luncy DeTizio, 31, as she enjoyed the warm sunshine at
the toddler playground. ``It took me aback. I would like him to
have some heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith says that she wonders if Clinton, himself, understands
the negative impact his behavior may have had on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach a Sunday school class, and last week, one of the kids
insulted another kid by saying, `You're just like Bill Clinton.'
The whole class started tittering and laughing. And I thought, it
has come to this. To be called Bill Clinton is an insult. I think
that is very sad. And I don't think that Clinton even realizes
it.''

HYDE URGES STARR TO WRAP UP CLINTON INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's chief prosecutor cautioned
independent counsel Kenneth Starr on Friday to let the impeachment
saga end without pursuing criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think indicting and criminally trying him after what
we have all been through is going be helpful to the country,''
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said as he
offered his own post-mortem on the Senate's decision to acquit
Clinton of both perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to stories that Starr intends to seek an indictment
against Clinton for trying to cover up his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Hyde suggested that Clinton had
already been disgraced enough and that the prospect of having a
president ``in jail ... is off-putting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't tell Mr. Starr what to do ... . But I think we
ought to put something to bed or put it on the shelf _ and as much
of this as we can, would be good,'' Hyde added, suggesting that it
might be time for Starr to wrap up his five-year, $40 million
investigation of Clinton that began with the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who took the lead in the House in bringing impeachment
charges against Clinton, said he had no regrets about the outcome
even though he and the 12 other Republican prosecutors complained
bitterly about the Senate's decision not to allow live witness
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hyde said the Constitution had worked and had even been
``strengthened'' by the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   But while the process may have worked as intended by the
Constitution, Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., said it was ``not for the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My great fear is that future presidents will now flaunt the
law in a more egregious manner ... and that's how they'll defend
impeachments in the future,'' said Buyer. ``Damage was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Although other prosecutors provided different spins on Clinton's
acquittal and its impact on future presidencies, they all seemed to
agree that it's time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been cleansed, the cloud (over) the White
House constitutionally has been blown away,'' observed Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans didn't see it quite that way. House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, for instance, suggested in a
statement that Clinton had gotten away with breaking laws that
other people would have been jailed for. He said most Americans
agree with Republicans that Clinton ``is still guilty of the
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot reach any other conclusion,'' DeLay asserted,
adding that ``a reckless, reprehensible and irresponsible man will
remain our president for the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, who worked to block a censure resolution from
being brought up in the House that could have prevented impeachment
articles from being sent on to the Senate, also predicted that
historians would ``undoubtedly'' judge Republicans well for
pursuing the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said that history would more
likely record Republicans as the party of impeachment intent on
bringing down Clinton at all costs, including putting the country
through an unnecessary ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to test our democracy, this has done it,'' Green
said. ``There wasn't enough there to begin with ... to make an
impeachable offense. And in the end all they did was attack Bill
Clinton as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the lesson has been learned. You can't remove an
elected president on a partisan basis.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee who argued that
the charges against Clinton did not meet the constitutional test of
an impeachable offense, the Senate verdict confirmed ``the high
bar'' they said the founding fathers had intended for the removal
of a president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate acted as the framers intended, and they acted in a
bipartisan fashion,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a
committee member who attended most of the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, author of a censure resolution that she was never
allowed to offer in the House, noted that if Republicans had joined
with Democrats to promote censure over impeachment, it would have
provided Americans with the bipartisan solution they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have ended it in the House,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri expressed a
similar view, saying that Republicans have lost an opportunity to
deliver a conclusive, bipartisan verdict on the president's conduct
by not embracing a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped that the House could have spoken out, united, to
condemn his actions across party lines, and avoided this
time-consuming, divisive and inconclusive impeachment trial,''
Gephardt said, adding that ``censure appears to be a fading
option.''

VENTURA WARNING: POLITICIANS BETTER WRESTLE WITH ISSUES WE CARE
ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By P.J. ERICKSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Republicans and Democrats and their minions and
managers seem puzzled and confused about what happened last autumn
in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   How in the name of P.T. Barnum did a professional wrestler get
elected governor? A fluke? A blip? The first volley in a voter
revolution? Or simply one more sign that the Apocalypse is upon us,
that phony entertainment and phony politics have become
indistinguishable?
</P>
<P>
   Woe is us, cried the Donkeys and the Elephants; we don't know
what this means.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple, you political wizards: Jesse Ventura got elected
'cuz he ain't one of you.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of you. We're sick of your spin doctors, your
campaign managers, your PR specialists, your trial balloons, your
mindless babbling, and the media advisers who dress you in your TV
shirts and power ties.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of your photo opportunities, your sound bites, your
campaign financing schemes, your junkets and your pork barrels,
your chest-pounding righteousness, and your weaselly, squirming
rationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of your pollsters telling you how we're going to vote
before we've decided. And when your pollsters do tell you something
that we apparently consider ``important'' _ for instance, that a
vast majority wants better gun-control laws, and that we wish you'd
pay much, much, much more attention to issues such as violence, the
environment and education _ you ignore, dismiss, evaluate, review
and appoint committees, until the lobbyists tell you what to do.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of watching you assign independent counsels to
investigate each other and everyone else in sight. At last count,
some half-dozen of these unaccountable hangmen were running around
investigating stuff on the taxpayers' dime. It's damn near an
industry onto itself. Harvard Law should offer Independent Counsel
101. There was even that lunatic proposal a month ago to have an
independent counsel appointed to investigate the actions of another
independent counsel. Absolute farce. Too bad Peter Sellers is dead.
</P>
<P>
   You anointed Ken Starr to investigate a land deal called
Whitewater. We know you really didn't care about some pipsqueak
real estate scam in Arkansas. If you did, you'd have 50 Ken Starrs,
one for every state, investigating land deals. But in Arkansas _
``right there in his home state'' _ was a chance to implicate a
sitting president in a little bitty land scam, so WHAMMO!
Independent counsel appointed!
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Starr and a cast of thousands investigated Whitewater,
some $40 million worth. Nailed some loan officers and turned a
good-sized forest into a Whitewater Report that hardly mentioned
Whitewater. But no Whitewater charges were filed against the
president, the first lady, the first daughter, Socks the cat or
Buddy the dog.
</P>
<P>
   So the ever-vigilant independent counsel went after the
president's personal life. What, exactly, did Paula Jones and
Monica Lewinsky have to do with Whitewater?
</P>
<P>
   Starr began by investigating a land scam and wound up digging in
a sexual garbage dump. The Republicans waded in with shovels of
their own, then couldn't figure out why they came out covered with
muck. The Democrats ended up having to defend a president awash in
sexual stupidity and perfidy.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins here? And, please, please, don't tell me the winners
are ``The American People.''
</P>
<P>
   We know Bill Clinton lied. We know you lied, too. You said you
would pursue the truth on a bipartisan basis. Sure. We are
``unbelievably'' weary of your constant bleating about
bipartisanship _ from both sides of the aisle _ when you make it
clear by your every yea and nay that blatant partisanship is all
you really intend to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   What you just don't seem to get is this: We don't care about
your partisan agenda. We don't care if one liar calls another liar
a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Your childish insistence on accusing each other, investigating
each other, forcing independent counsels on each other, demeaning
each other, vilifying each other, threatening each other _ and
ignoring us _ makes us want to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   And we're also sick of hearing you tell us what ``The American
People'' want, need, deserve, respect, believe, and/or are entitled
to. If you Beltway bourgeois had a collective clue as to what the
American people want, need and deserve, you wouldn't be confused
and bewildered about the adventures of Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   We need answers to crime, homelessness, domestic abuse, violence
in our streets, drugs in our schools, pollutants in our air,
poisons in our drinking water, inequality and bias and bigotry in
our communities, a decaying infrastructure, AIDS, farm failures,
job flight to foreign shores . . . the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   So enough with the fratricidal back-stabbing and shooting
yourselves in the foot. Our forebears provided us with as good a
system for governing as ever existed. You've turned it into a dirty
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Stop the circus. Start the statesmanship. DO something! &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Teetering between remorse and anticipation,
President Clinton said Friday that he felt humbled and ``profoundly
sorry,'' as he pledged to make the most of his latest second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has survived, again. After the Senate found him not
guilty on two articles of impeachment, he tried Friday to contend
with two inescapable questions: At what cost, and for what purpose?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American
people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the outcome of his trial presented an opportunity:
``This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and renewal
for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to betray no hint of smugness, the president spent part
of Thursday evening in the White House residence working on his
five-sentence statement, his aides said. He revised it Friday
morning in th White House residence, where he remained until early
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As a strong southerly wind rustled the magnolia trees and puffed
into the microphone, Clinton walked alone from the Oval Office two
hours after the Senate finished voting. Speaking slowly and shaking
his head for emphasis, he kept his statement short and bittersweet;
its essential elements reflected those in a statement of regret he
made on December 11, before the House impeached him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took one shouted question, pausing to consider it after
he had started walking away: Could he forgive and forget?
</P>
<P>
   He smiled slightly after he turned back to the crowd of
reporters, jostling on a springlike day that would later turn
stormy and cold. ``I believe any person who asks for forgiveness
has to be prepared to give it,'' he said. Then he left.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to mold history's judgment, Clinton is bent on remaking
his protean presidency once again, his friends and advisers say. As
of Friday, it had become something no one could have imagined at
his second inaugural two years ago, when he laid his hand on a
Biblical passage declaring, ``Thou shalt be called the repairer of
the breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 13 months of investigations, revelations, and political
venom, the president has put his family through misery; taxed the
loyalty of his cabinet and his aides, and admitted to outright lies
to the nation about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The political
breach in Washington is gaping.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the personal damage done, Clinton has prospered
politically and his Republican foes have suffered. The president
remains firmly in office and resoundingly popular, while Speaker
Newt Gingrich and the man who was to succeed him, Bob Livingston,
are departing for private life.
</P>
<P>
   Besides apologizing again to the country, Clinton expressed
remorse and gratitude Friday to his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Via electronic mail, John Podesta, the chief-of-staff, forwarded
to the White House staff an apology from Clinton, who for all his
praise of information technology does not use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your dedication and loyalty have meant more to me than you can
ever know,'' the message read, in part. ``The best way I can repay
you is to redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideals we share,
and to make the most of every day we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Rose Garden, Clinton telephoned several
Democratic senators to thank them. Then, in a display of the
business-as-usual briskness that carried him through his yearlong
crisis, he met with his foreign policy team to begin preparing for
an overnight trip to Mexico on Sunday.

 WASHINGTON: on Sunday.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later, Clinton met in the Oval Office with his public and
private lawyers to thank them, and then received a visit from Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who has counseled him and supported him politically
during his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   As he told House Democrats at a retreat this week, Clinton wants
to score legislative gains on Social Security, health care and
education _ even as he fights to win back Congress for the
Democrats in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to work with the Republicans who voted to eject him
from office, while he tries to eject some of them from office.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his allies believe that Clinton has gained the upper
hand and will be able to do both. ``This thing has empowered him,''
said James Carville, the president's former campaign manager and
informal adviser. ``His own party is unified, and the opposition
party desperately needs him to get some things done before the
election. He's become stronger and his opponents have become
weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Clinton advisers worry that his approval ratings may slide
once a public urge to rally around him subsides. They fret that the
current unity might crumble if House Democrats prove less
interested in agreement than in fighting Republicans on issues like
raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's history _ as college politician, Arkansas governor,
presidential campaigner, and president _ is a stuttering series of
reversals and political fresh starts. Some of his aides divide his
presidential terms into as many as five distinct periods of
governance and politics, since the Clintons arrived here six years
ago as bright-eyed outsiders promising intelligence, integrity and
compassion. That was only six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   First came a burst of energy and innovation, culminating in the
Clintons' politically disastrous health care proposal and the first
Republican Congress in 40 years. There followed a period of drift
and despondency, as Clinton publicly insisted on his relevance and
privately wondered what to do.
</P>
<P>
   By standing up to the Republicans during the government shutdown
and then appearing firm and compassionate in the wake of the
Oklahoma City bombing, Clinton regained his political footing.
Under the influence of his sometime adviser, Dick Morris, he took
the initiative again, this time with smaller proposals tested to
insure their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas carried him to re-election in 1996, but the
administration seemed to run out of gas after his second inaugural.
Then, as it was beginning to regain its bearings, came the
disclosures about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers say there is no mystery about what comes
next. Clinton unrolled his policy wish list in his State of the
Union Message, and he is hoping that success in shoring up the
retirement security system will counterbalance the weight of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his aides suspect that the Republicans who tried to
remove him will be more scarred by their votes than he.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their votes on impeachment will be in the first paragraph of
their obituaries,'' said one senior White House official. Clinton,
he said, ``will try to get impeachment erased from the first
paragraph of his _ or at least make it a very, very long
paragraph.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton did not watch the Senate vote Friday, his aides said.
Instead, Podesta telephoned him after each ballot to report the
outcome. A group of senior aides had gathered in the chief of
staff's office, confident of acquittal but worried that the second
charge, obstruction of justice, might draw a majority. ``There was
a good bit of suspense,'' said one who was present.
</P>
<P>
   But, cautioned by Podesta at the senior staff meeting Friday
morning, Clinton's aides avoided any celebration. Only his legal
team permitted themselves public grins, as they strolled from the
White House to an Indian restaurant for lunch in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, given the circumstances of this matter that's gone on
for this long, we can be relieved it's over,'' said Joe Lockhart,
the White House press secretary. ``But there's really nothing to
celebrate.''

INCOME DISTRIBUTION IS A TRICKY SUBJECT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Writing about an economy is like writing about a river,'' says
Frank Levy, the Daniel Rose Professor of Urban Economics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``The backdrop is the
motion, a constant evolution with no beginning or end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories mix human effort and impersonal forces, sometimes
working together, sometimes in opposition,'' writes Levy in the
introduction to a heavily revised edition of his 1987 book, now
called ``The New Dollars and Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   To which he could have added, that sometimes human dreams cause
the river to change its course, sometimes abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   Those who write about the distribution of income in the United
States and the world _ they include journalists, economists, and
reformers _ are a little bit like steamboat captains, tossed on the
very stream they navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Once you go past the snapshot approach of Parade magazine _ What
People Earn _ these matters become very complicated indeed. The way
ahead may seem crystal-clear one moment, only to change the next.
The perils of this undertaking are nowhere better illustrated than
in the career of Richard Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is a zesty, much-beloved Harvard economics professor, a
respected scientist, a partisan of equality and a frequent
consultant to unions. In 1976 he wrote a book called ``The
Over-Educated American'' in which he argued that for many people
going to college was a waste of time and money. The wage premium
for college grads was 40 percent, down from 50 percent in the early
1970s, and dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck. The next year, the returns on higher education turned
around, and have been increasing ever since _ an 80 percent wage
premium by the mid-1990s. Kevin Murphy, a young University of
Chicago labor economist, discovered the sharp U-turn, as abrupt as
any ever recorded; many others have confirmed it. Few now doubt
that the wage gap widened dramatically in the United States during
the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's latest book, ``The New Inequality,'' argues for a
five-pronged program to improve the position of low-wage Americans.
The book is as confident as was ``The Over-Educated American,'' and
as forceful in its slimmed-down way.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question is: Who's to say that the latest trend in
inequality itself isn't also about to turn around? Many researchers
believe the disparity at least has leveled off, and may have turned
around.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Frank Levy comes in. Levy, 57, is a Yale-trained
economist who for a time was in the forefront of research on the
intricate ins-and outs of the labor market. As the quest became
more high tech, he retooled as an interpreter of the work of other
scholars, and moved from the University of Maryland to the
action-oriented Deparment of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Today Levy fills an important niche, listening to all parties to
the debate and puzzling matters through himself, consulting to
economic journalists such as Nicholas Lemann, Robert Samuelson,
Louis Uchitelle, and Thomas B. Edsall. Indeed, I have described
Levy himself as a rare cross between an economist and a journalist
_ economist because he's among the leading experts on the changing
distribution of incomes in the United States; journalist because
for 20 years he has been committed to seeing this difficult topic
whole. On balance, I'd have say that he is more an economist than
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Take his title ``Dollars and Dreams.'' Nothing polemical here.
New Economy? Polarized Economy? Information Economy? Downsized
Economy? Economy as Good as It Gets? All true, and none quite true
enough to capture the underlying reality, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The inflationary jolts of the 1970s, the downsizings of the
1980s (stemming from deregulation and globalization,) the massive
entry of women into the work force, the migration of jobs to the
suburbs, the computerization of work, the emergence of various
``winner-take-all'' markets, especially in services: each of these
impinged on the wage structure in some degree. Levy is at pains to
disentangle their effects.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1987 edition of ``Dollars and Dreams'' scrutinized
the period of stagnant wages that had begun in the 1970s, which
Levy labeled a ``quiet depression.'' In the mid-1980s, the rising
trend to inequality had not yet become clear. So the book
concentrated on the question of whether the middle class was
disappearing. (It wasn't.)
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the trend to inequality has become
unmistakable _ more and higher incomes at the very top, a general
falling behind at the bottom. So has the improvement in economic
performance. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 25 years. Asset
prices are sky high. Inflation is low. But because productivity
growth has not regained its post-World War II average of 2 to 3
percent, average wages adjusted for inflation have continued to
lag.
</P>
<P>
   At every juncture, Levy concentrates on the crucial role that
expectations play in our interpretations of performance over time.
He recounts the Sam Levinson joke of the two young mothers who
meet. One has a double stroller. How old are your children? asks
the other. The doctor is one and a half, and the lawyer is six
months, she says.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy certainly favors the better educated over the
less educated. What Levy cannot tell, however, is much about what
lies ahead _ nor can any of the other labor economists whose work
the scholar sifts. That is because there is no generally accepted
theory about any of the three abstract factors that Levy isolates
to explain most of the changing distribution of income:
productivity growth, the skill mix demanded by technical change,
and equalizing institutions, including unions and the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   The day is coming when economics will have something concrete to
say about industrial organization, technical change, and
preferences _ in effect, the factors that determine the flow and
force of the economic river. But not yet. What there is now is
journalism, some of it quite high-toned.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, James K. Galbraith's new book, ``Created Unequal:
The Crisis in American Pay,'' suggests some intriguing connections
between the decline of monopoly power and the acceleration of
technical change. Could it be that the broad increase in American
equality during the 1950s and 1960s was directly connected to the
dominance of the oligopolistic corporations (a.k.a. the Fortune
500) in those days?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly _ but far from proven. Might not those days come again?
Possibly _ but far from certain. In the meantime, you can't do
better than rely on hope, and the short measured judgments of
``Dollars and Dreams.''

HILLARY CLINTON WILL CONSIDER WHETHER TO RUN FOR SENATE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton will carefully consider
whether to run for the Senate from New York state now that
President Clinton has been acquitted, the first lady's chief
spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll have a chance to put some thought into this,'' Mrs.
Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said. ``The kind of people who
have talked to her about it are people she respects, and I'm sure
she'll give it very careful consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has given no hint that she will run in 2000 for the
seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Nor has she
discouraged such speculation, although people close to her have
emphasized that she has had other things on her mind lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances have changed now,'' Ms. Berry said. ``We
just have to give it time.'' But she said no one should infer from
her remarks that the first lady has mentioned a timetable for
making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-ranking Democrats from New York state have talked
enthusiastically about a Hillary Clinton candidacy. She has
extensive campaign experience; Republicans and Democrats alike have
said her four visits to the state last year helped Charles Schumer
defeat Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Clinton has instant name recognition, unlike several
other possible Democratic candidates, like Rep. Nita Lowey, who is
not widely known outside her Westchester County district.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has never lived in New York state, but that need
not be an obstacle: the requirements for establishing a residency
in New York are not strict.
</P>
<P>
   She might, of course, have to counter charges that she was a
political ``carpetbagger,'' but she could look to history for
encouragement. Some people called Robert Kennedy a carpetbagger
when he ran for the Senate in New York in 1964, but he won anyhow.

ALBRIGHT DUE AT KOSOVO TALKS TO PUSH PACTS ON FORCES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit the
Kosovo peace conference on Sunday in an effort to push the
delegates into forging specific military agreements to end the
fighting, a senior Clinton administration official said here
Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albright will present the two sides with the proposed internal
security arrangements for Kosovo, including the reduction of
Serbian troops and police forces, the dissolution of the ethnic
Albanian rebel army and the creation of a new Kosovo police force,
the official said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These military arrangements are the most sensitive questions of
the negotiations and are likely to anger both the ethnic Albanians
on one side and the Serbs on the other.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The secretary is likely to receive a fairly frosty reception
from the 13 Serbian delegates who were fired up by a visit from the
Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, to the conference at
Rambouillet, 30 miles outside Paris.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Friday, Milutinovic, after visiting
his delegates, warned that a Vietnam-style guerrilla war would
break out in Yugoslavia if NATO carried out its threat to bomb
Serbia for failure to sign a peace agreement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe that they want to have a Vietnam in Europe,''
he said. ``That would literally mean blood up to the knees. He
added: ``We have never given into pressure in our history. Whatever
has happened, we have always fought.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian president was sent to the peace talks by the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, who is the sole decision
maker for the Serbian delegation but who remained at home in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the more important of the two republics that make up
Yugoslavia, and Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian separatists are
fighting Serbs, is a province of Serbia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian delegation was accused of stalling tactics by
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is co-chairman of the
talks with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albright was planning to explain the security arrangements and
to exhort the participants to accept the overall package, the
official said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She will get the Kosovars to focus on the fact that they'll
get what they want: The Serbs out and NATO in,'' the official said,
referring to the ethnic Albanian delegation. They represent 90
percent of the population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the incentive of a NATO ground force to enforce
the peace, the ethnic Albanians are being asked to drop their
demand for independence from Serbia and accept autonomy, the
official said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When she speaks to the Serbian delegates on Sunday, Albright
will try to get them to accept the fact that ``NATO will be in
charge of the real estate in Kosovo, just as they are in Bosnia.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A NATO-led force was sent to Bosnia after a peace agreement was
drawn up in Dayton, Ohio. The force, which is commanded by
Americans and includes American troops, remains in Bosnia, although
in smaller numbers than at first.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have repeatedly said they will not accept foreign
troops in Kosovo because that would be an infringement on their
sovereignty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Serbian delegation is regarded as the most
difficult and that Milosevic would need to be dealt with directly
and probably last, it appeared that Albright planned to focus on
persuading the ethnic Albanians to accept the peace deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once the ethnic Albanians accepted the agreement, then the
United States would have more leverage with Milosevic, the Clinton
administration official suggested.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Serbian security police would have to reduce
the level of forces in Kosovo from about 11,000 to 2,500, the
official said. The anti-terrorist and special units of the Serbian
police, some of which have been responsible for the killings of
ethnic Albanian civilians, would be required to leave Kosovo
immediately after a peace agreement, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 2,500 Serbian policemen would be required to leave
Kosovo after one year, he said. The Yugoslav Army, which now has
about 15,000 soldiers in Kosovo, would be reduced to 1,500 soldiers
guarding the borders.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the ethnic Albanian rebel force, the Kosovo
Liberation Army, would be required to disband, but some members
could be become part of a new Kosovo police force that would be
organized at the village level over a yearlong period. The
guerrilla leaders ``are going to have to morph into a new role,''
the official said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American advisers to the ethnic Albanian delegation have said
that even with the reduction of the Serbian forces and the presence
of NATO as an overall security blanket in Kosovo, the measures that
will be laid out by Albright were not as inviting as the
administration had described them to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for the guerrillas to dissolve completely
after having formed only a year ago to fight for independence, said
Paul Williams, a lawyer for the delegation.

 &HT;    Clinton cleared of perjury, obstruction of justice
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett, Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate acquitted President Clinton of perjury
and obstruction of justice Friday, ending a constitutional crisis
that dogged Clinton's presidency for more than a year and plunged
Congress into feuding partisan camps.
</P>
<P>
   Both articles failed to win even a simple majority, far short of
the 67 votes that were needed to convict Clinton and remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Following the historic votes, Congressional leaders and Clinton
all pledged to bind up the wounds inflicted during the 13-month
crisis and return to their mutual obligation to lead and to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American
people,'' Clinton said at the White House two hours after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the lead House prosecutor, said
he had had enough, urging independent counsel Kenneth Starr not to
pursue criminal charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all now look forward to the many challenges facing our
great nation in a spirit of reconciliation, not revenge,'' Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who voted to
convict Clinton on both articles, conceded that it ``won't be
easy'' to put impeachment aside and begin working with the
Democratic president he thought should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will have to be a time when ... everybody goes off and
thinks about what has happened here,'' Lott said. ``But I'm not
going to let it cloud my idea of what we should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly installed House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) also
called for a return to legislative business when Congress returns
from a weeklong break, even as he defended the House vote to
impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans in the Congress can be proud that they stood by
the principles that have made this nation strong, a respect for the
rule of law and an abiding faith in the strength of our
Constitution,'' said Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   After five weeks of the Senate impeachment trial, months of
investigation and countless hours of speeches about Clinton's
behavior, the final Senate vote on the two impeachment articles
took less than 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, senators took their seats and the clerk read
the article alleging perjury. Chief Justice William Rehnquist asked
the senators to vote guilty or not guilty, and the clerk called the
roll.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, senators rose from their seats and pronounced their
judgment. A momentary stir swept through the chamber as Sen. Arlen
Specter (R-Penn.), in the only departure from the required
response, announced ``Not proven, therefore not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was acquitted of perjury by a vote of 55 to 45, with 10
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats to vote not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk then read the second article, alleging Clinton
obstructed justice in his efforts to conceal his relationship with
Monica Lewinksy, and Rehnquist again called for the votes.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction charge also failed to win a majority, falling by
a vote of 50 to 50. Five Republicans _ all northeast moderates _
joined all 45 Democrats to vote not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the roll, Rehnquist said, ``The Senate
having tried William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United
States, upon two articles of impeachment exhibited against him by
the House of Representatives, and two-thirds of the Senate present
having found him not guilty of the charges therein: it is therefore
ordered and adjudged that the said William Jefferson Clinton be,
and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who did not watch the proceedings, was notified of the
votes by telephone by his chief of staff, John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, who was called on only rarely to speak during the
trial, told senators he underwent culture shock going from the
structured environment of the Supreme Court to the ``more free-form
environment of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave you a wiser but not a sadder man,'' Rehnquist said.
``I have been impressed by the quality of the debate in closed
session on the entire question of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist praised Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and
minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) for their ability to work out
trial procedures, despite their partisan differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agreed-upon procedures for airing substantive divisions must
be the hallmark of any great deliberative body,'' the chief justice
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, frequently referred to as the most exclusive club in
America, lived up to its reputation and presented Rehnquist with a
golden gavel plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was giving the gift in appreciation of Rehnquist's
service, even as he noted that Rehnquist may not have served the
100 hours normally required to get the gavel as a presiding officer
of the Senate. ``It seemed like that,'' Rehnquist quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Lott motioned to adjourn the impeachment trial at 12:45 p.m.,
following which Republicans prevailed on a procedural motion that
prevented Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) from bringing a censure
motion to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The censure motion is over, dead,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's acquittal was a foregone conclusion, suspense
continued through the final votes as to whether both articles would
win a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the vote, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced
she would vote against both articles, ensuring the obstruction
charge would get no more than 50 votes if all Democrats stuck
together.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) said Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) kept
his votes secret up until the moment he was called to declare his
judgment, declining in closed session earlier in the day to
announce his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never told us what he was going to do,'' said Breaux.
``Everyone was holding their breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired but happy to be leaving Washington after their five-week
ordeal, senators described emotions ranging from relief to
stomach-churning anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're finished and thank goodness,'' said Sen. John Chafee
(R-R.I.).
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said there weren't adjectives to
describe the feeling of voting to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were sad, either way they cast their vote,''
said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.).
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) said he came close to voting to convict
the president on obstruction of justice. Clinton was willing to let
Monica Lewinsky ``go to jail'' over filing a false affidavit in
order to save his skin, Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's getting off,'' said Kerrey. ``He has
suffered a considerable deterioration of respect from members of
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats disagreed sharply about the
significance of the two impeachment votes, particularly the fact
that neither article won a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that neither count got a majority of votes shows it
never should have come to the Senate in the first place,'' said
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an indictment of the blatant partisanship of the
House of Representatives,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).
</P>
<P>
   Lott attempted to turn the votes into a statement that Senate
Republicans had been more bipartisan than Democrats, noting that no
Democrats broke with their party while Republicans broke from
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a 50-50 vote, that's an indication that, you
know, a major portion of the United States Senate thinks that the
case was proven, at least on the ... obstruction of justice
article,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors searched for some solace in the votes, but
found little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury has spoken,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.).
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been cleansed, the cloud from the White
House, constitutionally, has been blown away,'' said Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.).

<TEXT>
<P>
   TERNI, Italy _ Terni, an ailing, unromantic town of steel mills
and chemical plants, has one claim to fame: the shrine of St.
Valentine. For the last few years, Terni has labored to recast
itself as the international city of love.
</P>
<P>
   But this St. Valentine's day, Terni is mainly becoming known as
the city of hate.
</P>
<P>
   In what can best be described as a St. Valentine's Day massacre,
the conservative mayor and the entire city government were forced
to resign on Tuesday after the center-left majority in the city
council _ with some behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the mayor's
own party _ withdrew its support.
</P>
<P>
   As the city government fell, so did most of the St. Valentine's
Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I put hearts in the store window, but this year I
just didn't feel like it,'' Mafalda Minicocci, owner of Valentina,
a lingerie boutique where frilly camisoles and red silk panties are
marked 50 percent off, said wearily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terni is a dying city,'' she said, ``and especially after the
government fell, there is no enthusiasm. Nobody has organized
anything. We are a depressed blue-collar town, and nobody feels
like celebrating St. Valentine's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 17 St. Valentines in the Vatican's encyclopedia of
saints, and none are officially recognized by the Roman Catholic
Church as a patron saint of lovers. But Terni's St. Valentine, a
third-century bishop and Christian martyr, is the city's patron
saint. The local legend is that this St. Valentine gave young
lovers a flower from his garden, which assured them eternal love.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Terni and some historians believe that he could have
been the very St. Valentine who spawned the modern and highly
lucrative commercial cult of Valentine's Day. The local church
stakes its claim quite openly: the words ``patron saint of love''
are inscribed in gold on his tomb.
</P>
<P>
   By sponsoring monthlong festivals of romance, with honeymoon
packages, parades, concerts, film series, art exhibits and culinary
shows, as well as traditional religious devotions, Terni's civic
leaders hoped they could broaden Terni's tourism appeal _ making it
a little less Lourdes and a little more Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   This year, unlike the last two, there are no floats, no
all-night Latin American dance festivals and few concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year they displayed a block-long Valentine's Day cake on
Corso Tacito,'' Ms. Minicocci recalled fondly. ``This year there is
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Valentino, which offers romantic champagne-and-oysters
weekends for betrothed couples, has only six reservations. The St.
Valentine Foundation, which sponsors theme events, received no city
financing, and many of its pared-down plans fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   Romance does not flourish in Terni naturally. Though it is in
Umbria, a historic region that boasts jewels like Assisi, Perugia
and Todi, Terni is the odd town out.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its old palaces were destroyed in World War II, and its
landscape of steel factories and 60s modernist buildings give it a
slightly Soviet look.
</P>
<P>
   Terni sought to diversify a few years ago by converting idle
factories into movie studios. Roberto Benigni shot his acclaimed
film ``Life Is Beautiful'' there. The lush scenes of Arezzo were
filmed in Arezzo itself. The concentration camp scenes were shot in
Terni studios.
</P>
<P>
   The city of 110,000 people has a few treasures: the highest
waterfall in Europe and Carsulae, ruins of an ancient Roman town,
but the shrine of St. Valentine is its main hope for increasing
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Luigi Paoletti, the rector of the Basilica of St.
Valentine, where the saint's relics are buried and where pilgrims
write or come to pray for help in their love lives, has a full
schedule of events. They began with a special ceremony to bless 150
engaged couples last Sunday and include special Masses, prayer
services and church choir concerts. One heavily promoted highlight
is a public discussion of Pope John Paul II's recent encyclical,
``Faith and Reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the ballerina Carla Fracci performed a dance inside
his basilica. ``This year,'' noted Paoletti, ``I may have to do the
dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle in City Hall that killed Terni's Valentine's Day
spirit was a budget dispute between Mayor Gianfranco Ciaurro and
his council, most of whom were in the center-left opposition. But
St. Valentine's Day was also at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``My complaint is that the previous administration was too
traditional in its handling of this opportunity,'' said Jose Kenny,
a councilman from the Democrats of the Left. ``We could use this
feast to transcend Terni and appeal to the world. Look at what
Juliet has done for Verona.''
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism infuriates Cristina Cecconi, the deposed council
member in charge of culture and tourism, who heavily promoted St.
Valentine's Day in years past and who complained that her fellow
council members had refused to budget any money this year for
tourism _ or St. Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a horrible mistake,'' she said. ``Without St.
Valentine we slide back into being the city of steel and
blue-collar workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cecconi said she would spend Feb. 14, a Sunday, clearing
boxes out of her office. ``It's the end of a great love affair,''
she said.

LOCK YOUR DOORS. `STORM' IS COMING

<P>
   Nowadays, all characters have to do is look cute, thin and
young, and have a smidgen of TV familiarity, for modern horror
audiences to get the telegraph: She/he is a goner, chopped to
pieces by some shadowy lunatic.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for Stephen King and his old-school ways. Here's
a horror writer who still believes that suspense is more
psychological than visual, and that one can't possibly feel
frightened unless there's an undercurrent of moral accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes into the six-hour ``Storm of the Century'' (8 p.m.
CST Sunday on ABC), which I viewed without so much as a pause,
getting up only to reload the VCR and double-check the locks,
there's a feeling of nagging anticipation. It comes from the
knowledge that the lunatic whom King has conjured up is the worst
of beasts: direct, adamant and articulate about what he wants and
needs.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not an ax to some poor slob's face, although that
happens before Sunday night's installment is done.
</P>
<P>
   We first meet Andre Linoge (Colm Feore), dressed in a navy pea
coat, black watchman's cap and workman's boots, when he snatches a
walker from an elderly woman, tosses it in the snow, and proceeds
to beat her to death with a cane topped off by a silver wolf's
head.
</P>
<P>
   That Linoge can turn on a busted TV set by pointing to it is
evidence enough that we're well into King's supernatural psyche,
and as the townsfolk get wind of what has happened and take a look
at the man who made it so, it's clear that evil has made its way
onto an usually uneventful island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storm of the Century'' is set in Little Tall Island, a quaint
town off the coast of Maine. Tim Daly is Mike Anderson, the local
butcher who doubles as the island constable for an extra $6,000 a
year, and Debrah Farentino portrays his wife, but as is the case
with King productions, the others are virtual unknowns perfectly
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and a few of the locals capture Linoge, who goes along
gleefully, and put him in a jail cell. But soon Linoge is
controlling the minds of everyone he comes in contact with, forcing
suicides and murder and creating general paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   As is frequently the case in King's tales, these are seemingly
ordinary folk, stuck in predicaments partly of their doing, their
payment due for past sins. When a storm crashes into the island,
for instance, residents are cut off from the mainland, isolated
like trapped rats. With phones down and electricity out, they don't
seem to have much in the way of bargaining chips against an evil
that appears unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, King has made Linoge a precise,
unyielding killer. Each time he kills, he leaves a message, either
by a note attached to victim or scrolled somewhere nearby: ``Give
me what I want and I'll go away.'' (Be patient. You won't find out
what he wants until the third night, but it's worth the wait.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Linoge requests a town meeting to ask for an unusual
sacrifice, the townsfolk are frightened, disoriented and bitterly
divided, ready to barter their own lives and those of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storm of the Century,'' directed by Craig Baxley, works by
teasing us into a state of what I could would call ``queasy
uncertainty.'' The script, written by King, is true to his
sometimes-annoying form of not tipping his hand until the very last
minute, of pulling us in slowly and seductively with the simmering
warmth and confusion that comes from a long-awaited first kiss.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an injustice to delve further into the plot line.
I'll say only that one reason King's voice has remained fresh is
that, unlike most genre writers who have followed him, he is rarely
content to see horror in black and white. King revels in the gray
area, tossing in prickly topics like personal responsibility, God
and ethics, all while playing off our secret fear that we never
really know the people we're closest to.
</P>
<P>
   Much as ``The Shining'' wasn't about a haunted house as much as
a haunted marriage, ``Storm of the Century'' uses Linoge as a prop,
a kind of demon with a mirror. He knows the sins of every islander,
and in one scene he walks down the aisle of the meeting room airing
dirty laundry from arson to infidelity to abortion. Hearing him,
you'll be ready to condemn them all to the hell they're facing _
until it becomes apparent that your own closet is crowded with
skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   In King's world, the potential for evil lurks within us all.

JAPAN'S REDUCTION OF KEY INTEREST RATE HAS REVERSE EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO &UR;  &LR; _ Responding to escalating pressures at home and abroad,
Japan's central bank Friday reduced an important interest rate from
what had already been its lowest level ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision by the Bank of Japan also sent a clear message
that it would not take more aggressive steps to help reverse a
sharp rise in long-term Japanese interest rates, which has
threatened to choke Japan's economic recovery and has put upward
pressure on rates around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pushing long-term rates down, the Bank of Japan's
move had the opposite effect. Long-term bond prices in Japan fell,
and their yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices,
pushed higher.
</P>
<P>
   The ripple effects of the central bank's move extended to the
United States, where long-term Treasury bond prices tumbled and
pushed yields to the highest level since August. The bond selloff
spread to stocks, which lost most of their gains from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan's announcement concerned an interest rate
charged on overnight bank loans, which was reduced to a record low
0.15 percent from the previous record low of 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the move was seen as little more than a modest attempt to
allay widespread fears that long-term interest rates, which have
tripled in the last few months to 2.4 percent and driven up the
yen's value, could squelch Japan's recovery from the worst
recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although still low by world standards, Japan's rising long-term
interest rates are harmful to its economy because they raise
borrowing costs and discourage consumers from spending. The rising
yen is harmful as well because it hurts Japanese exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very weak move,'' said Xinyi Lu, a fixed income
strategist at Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. in Tokyo, referring to
the Bank of Japan's announcement Friday. ``The BOJ tried hard to
show people it is paying attention to the market and that it is
listening to the politicians a little bit. But it's losing face.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have been saying that the economy will pick
up in the summer. Yet, economists and policy &UR; - &LR; makers from around
the world have been calling on Japanese policymakers to take
increasingly drastic measures to pull Japan out of a deflationary
spiral. They have urged Japan to pour more money into the financial
system and to calm the recent turmoil in the bond markets, one of
the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's move by the Bank of Japan will probably not cure any of
these ills in the long term, financial experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The market jitteriness has increased anxiety among Japan's
members of Parliament, who have jumped into a debate over what the
Bank of Japan should do with monetary policy. Even Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, who has essentially promised to deliver an economic
recovery to the nation this year, is expressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's looming budget deficit, its swelling government debt and
the giant spending packages the government is carrying out to
stimulate the economy have cast a dark shadow over the markets,
leading investors to dump bonds in recent weeks, a main reason why
the yields have risen so much.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Japan is set to be the world's largest issuer of
national bonds, issuing nine of every 10 bonds, according to J.P.
Morgan. In contrast, the United States is enjoying a budget surplus
and is shaving the volume of Treasury bonds it plans to issue.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of bonds the Japanese government will have to issue
domestically is startling and has Japanese bond investors worried
that there will not be enough buyers for those bonds. Throughout
the world, Japan is typically thought of as a source, rather than
an absorber, of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many market strategists have said the government should promise
to buy some of those bonds to reduce the supply, which would raise
bond prices, lower yields and lead to falling interest rates and a
cheaper yen. But the Bank of Japan's move indicated that the
government had no such intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians have begun to call for more extreme measures,
such as printing money to buy national bonds. But the Bank of Japan
has ruled out such a strategy because it would cause inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The direct impact of Friday's rate reduction may save only about
$250 million to $350 million in lower interest costs in the
overnight market over the course of a year. The Bank of Japan,
however, seems to be aiming for a broader spillover effect that is
probably more psychological than direct.
</P>
<P>
   So Japan finds itself in a quandary. Short-term interest rates
are already so low that further lowering them is likely to have
minimal effect, and yet policy-makers still need to ease monetary
policy to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test case for the world,'' said Lu at Paribas
Capital Markets. ``We have never seen so many different measures
come together in an advanced country _ and not work.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Bank of Japan lowered the overnight rate to
0.25 percent, from 0.50 percent. In November, it stepped up open
market operations, a means of adding money to the market, and then
set up a mechanism to encourage banks to lend more to corporations
on an emergency basis. Friday, it said it would cut that rate in
half, to 0.25 percent, mainly to complement the reduction in the
overnight rate.

BUSINESSMAN CHALLENGES LORDS OF THE RINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David D'Alessandro is trying to do for the worldwide Olympic
movement what he once did on a far smaller scale for the Boston
Marathon:
</P>
<P>
   Save a precious and unique sporting tradition from a stinkeroo
of a financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   If the autocratic Juan Antonio Samaranche, dictator of the
International Olympic Committee, falls on his sword next month when
the tottering IOC weighs its bribery habits, it will have been
D'Alessandro who furnished the blade.
</P>
<P>
   By daring to go public with his threat to withhold $20 million
of John Hancock's Olympic advertising investment unless the Lords
of the Rings clean up their act, D'Alessandro has forced
long-simmering corruption issues to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As president and chief operations officer of John Hancock, one
of the top 15 life insurance companies in the nation, he has
supervised the forking over of $100 million in Hancock cash to the
Olympics over more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other 10 big corporate sponsors, whose ranks
include the likes of Coca Cola, VISA, and Xerox, D'Alessandro would
not settle for the brushoff from the IOC when he demanded rigorous
airing of the systemic bribery that has reached not only into the
Salt Lake City award, but into Sydney and Atlanta too.
</P>
<P>
   By going public several weeks ago with his threat to withhold
Hancock's advertising sponsorship, D'Alessandro is taking on the
Spanish Samaranche, the wily one-time Franco regime Fascist who
established a stranglehold on the Olympic movement in the vacuum
existing after President Carter kept the United States and some
other nations out of the 1980 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did I do it?'' D'Alessandro asked Friday in a phone
interview. ``I did it because these guys lied to us. Excuse me; we
give you $100 million? And you lied to us? And you continue to lie
to us?''
</P>
<P>
   The Hancock chief said his efforts to force more accountability
into the Samaranche-dominated IOC were meeting with nothing but
stalls, delays, evasions and misrepresentations. ``Everyone wants
to believe this isn't true. No one would want to believe this,''
that the beloved Olympic ideal has been compromised to its core by
corrupt officials trading votes for cash and other considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Boston businessman Mitt Romney, a Morman with
impeccable Utah connections and a squeaky-clean reputation, was
named to oversee a rehabilitation of the Salt Lake City 2002 games,
after a raft of resignations and reports of corruption in the way
the city got the games. But D'Alessandro points to gamy allegations
coming out of Sydney and Atlanta, and argues that the whole system
is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades D'Alessandro has led Hancock's growing involving
in international sports marketing. The insurance giant sponsors
gymnastics in the United States, has supported bowl games, and
D'Alessandro knows as much about sports marketing as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have $40 million involved here, $100 million over the last
four years. I told them'' in the IOC that ``our logo is married to
your logo.'' But he got the runaround from the IOC, whose 122
individual members from 102 different countries are all appointed
by Samaranche, and are therefore loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   But with $700 million in sponsorship money going to the IOC, and
with very little in the way of financial accountability in the
organization's structure, corruption was practically inevitable,
D'Alessandro suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The 1956 Olympics sold TV rights for a paltry $56,000. But after
the Los Angeles Games of 1984 showed how money could be made by
commercializing the event, the awarding of sites by secret vote of
the IOC meant hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts could be
swung by a little grease laid in the hands of IOC members, many of
them from tiny, impoverished countries.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC members were treated ``like royals,'' he said. ``It was
a real curious culture,'' and bribery became an apparent route to
riches. Eight out of 10 IOC members are chosen by Samaranche, serve
until age 80, and ``there's a combination of secret ballots for
what sites are picked, secret books, and billions of dollars
running into an organization that used to have to beg to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   No large US corporation, nor most nonprofit outfits, could
function without any serious oversight or accountability, he said.
``This is a real secret society that's come into so much cash, and
some of the members are from very poor countries. So what happened
is that, little by little, there was this deterioration. So when
the revelations came that Salt Lake City had given extravagant
favors, on one hand you say to yourself that it's a surprise, but
then you think, after 15 years with all this money, why should this
be a surprise?''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``Our ire is up not because the organization got
into trouble. All organizations get into trouble, this one
(Hancock), the Globe, every one. Sometimes incredibly smart people
under pressure hear only what they want to hear. But what has been
remarkable to me is how badly they'' in the IOC ``have handled it.
With these kinds of improprieties, people are willing to give you
some room,'' as a rule. But that freedom to clean up one's act is
dependent on making substantial reforms _ and that is where the IOC
has dug in its heels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His private diplomacy went nowhere, he added. ``They only pay
attention to public statements.'' When an Australian confessed to
handing over letters of commitment worth $70,000 to two African IOC
members on condition that Syndey win the games, he said, Sydney won
the contract by two votes. When Samaranche failed to honor a pledge
to investigate that, said D'Alessandro, the Hancock chief demanded
to know if bribery was part of the IOC's regular tool kit. ``This
is clearly a coverup.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is no pushover, that is clear. He did not take
lightly to getting the brushoff from the IOC. ``You give somebody
$100 million _ with the exception of the Congress _ they take your
phone calls,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   They picked the wrong sponsor to tick off. ``Basically, I said
we are not advertising. We're pulling the rings off other
activities too.'' The IOC meets in March, with pressure mounting
for Samaranche's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, other sponsors have been mealy-mouthed, and NBC, which
is on the hook for $3.5 billion in Olympic ad sales, is trembling
with fear. ``We bought something when we bought these rings. What
did we buy?'' D'Alessandro asked. ``Do we want to marry our logo to
scandal, bribery, the royals, their cult of entitlement? We thought
the product they sold us is not the product that exists  &UR; today &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   He said the real shame of it all is that the IOC's stubbornness
could wind up costing a lot of smaller, poorer countries the money
they need to support their athletes. But he is not the type to get
pushed around, or shushed up, because some bigshot tells him to
mind his own business.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For three weeks, doctors, corrections officials
and inmates have been describing to a federal judge here the
conditions in Texas' vast network of prisons, and much of the
testimony from the prisoners has been a grim litany of abuses and
humiliations.
</P>
<P>
   One man described being locked in a cage for five days. Another
suffered a stroke, but his guards, failing to recognize it, simply
ridiculed his stumbling gait rather than immediately summoning
medical help. Yet another, driven to despair by abuse, tried to
kill himself by biting into his arm until he hit a vein. Prisoners
told of being raped by other inmates, beaten by guards, covered in
pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   One prisoner, who said he had been locked naked in a cell while
still coated with pepper spray, recalled his solution:
``Shamefully, I went over to the commode and spread out the water
on the floor and rolled around on it and cleansed myself off as
best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of such accounts, backed by the testimony of
medical and out-of-state corrections experts, lawyers for the
prisoners of Texas have argued in the proceeding here that the
federal court supervision to which the state's prison system has
been at least partly subject since 1980 should continue.
</P>
<P>
   The state, on the other hand, maintains that the experiences of
abused inmates, though regrettable, are little more than anecdotes
that do not provide a thorough picture of the prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for our prison system to stand on its own two
feet,'' Gregory Coleman, a lawyer for the state, said in closing
arguments Friday. ``We have come a long ways, thanks in large part
to the courts, but we believe we have now arrived. It is time for
us to move into the future on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, state prison administrators testified to the
improvements made in the system in the last two decades, including
better training for guards, a more stringent policy on their use of
force and closer attention to prisoners' medical needs. Medical
experts testifying for the state argued that the prisoners' lawyers
had relied too heavily on the misfortunes of a handful of inmates
instead of looking at the system as a whole, which, with 73 prisons
and more than 140,000 prisoners, is second in size only to
California's.
</P>
<P>
   The case argued here has roots dating from 1979, when, after
trial of a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Texas prisoners,
U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice ruled the prison system
unconstitutional because of horrific overcrowding, abuse by guards,
poor medical care and other cruel conditions. The next year Justice
demanded a raft of reforms and imposed day-to-day oversight of the
system by the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after the gradual introduction of policies aimed at
easing crowding and safeguarding prisoners, the judge issued a
final ruling. He returned day-to-day control of the system to the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice but left in force injunctions
requiring the state to take specific steps dealing with matters
like abuse of prisoners and any inadequate medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing that began in Austin on Jan. 21 before Justice _ 78
years old now _ resulted from a request in 1996 by Dan Morales,
then the Texas attorney general, that even those final injunctions
be lifted and full control of the prisons be given back to the
state. (Newly elected Attorney General John Cornyn made ending the
federal oversight a part of his campaign platform.)
</P>
<P>
   Each side was allowed 50 hours of testimony and one hour to sum
up, and after final arguments had ended Friday, Justice said he
would decide by March 1 whether the state's prisons should be free
of federal supervision for the first time since Jimmy Carter was
president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Overcrowding, the main failing that emerged from the 1979 trial,
was corrected long ago, said Coleman, the state lawyer. What this
hearing focused on were prisoners' preying on one another, being
physically abused by guards and being denied proper medical and
psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   In closing Friday, Donna Brorby, appointed by the court to argue
on behalf of the prisoners, as she did in 1992, said the evidence
clearly showed that Texas was denying inmates ``the minimal
civilized necessities of life'' and that only with the
``inducement'' of continued federal injunctions was the state
likely to continue improving its prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easily forgotten bottom line is that prisoners are human
beings,'' she said. ``They have human feelings and human needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman responded by saying none of the testimony had been
sufficient to show that abuses were prevalent or frequent enough to
warrant continued federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What constitutional problems that may have existed in the
Texas prison system,'' he said, ``they are but a memory of an era
which has now long since passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brorby said the state was relying on volumes of new policies
it had developed under court supervision but had not determined
whether the prisons were actually complying with them. In fact, she
said, some conditions are as grim as ever, with the powerful
preying on the weak and corrections officials either joining in or
looking the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to deceive themselves,'' Ms. Brorby said, ``by
looking at their accomplishments.''

   Iacocca Mourns Loss of Big Three &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what does Lee A. Iacocca, the former Chrysler chairman
credited with saving the company from oblivion, think of its merger
with Daimler-Benz of Germany? Not much. ``I worked 20 years to make
it a Big Three,'' he said. ``If I thought it was going to be a Big
Two, I wouldn't have worked so hard.'' Still, he predicted that the
venture would succeed and described its authors as visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca has scaled back his ambitions _ to two wheels from four.
He was making the rounds recently at the National Automobile
Dealers Association convention in San Francisco, trying to sell
dealers franchises for the electric bicycle that his EV Global
Motors Co. of Los Angeles will market in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   While he was at it, he bemoaned the incursions of auto giants
and corporations like Republic Industries into selling cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dealer franchise system set up by Henry Ford is a damn
good one,'' he said. ``You want to buy from the guy who goes to the
Kiwanis meeting and is part of the community.''

   Singing Their Praises &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Naomi Judd, the country-and-western crooner, probably had the
funniest line of the evening. ``You are my favorite living male
singer,'' Ms. Judd told Michael Bolton on Monday at the Red Ball at
the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the annual charity event organized by
the producer Martin Richards as a memorial to his wife, Mary Lea
Johnson Richards. ``Of course Wynonna is my favorite singer,'' she
added, referring to her daughter, ``and Elvis is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jeffrey Sherman, the president of Bloomingdale's, a part
of Federated Department Stores, who stole the show for romance. ``I
could have danced all night, especially since I was with the most
beautiful woman in the room,'' he declared, speaking of his wife,
Karin. The winner of the stiff-upper-lip award had to be Michael P.
Schulhof, the former chief executive of the Sony Corp. of America.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he was dismissed from his job as chairman of World
Online International, which accused him of using a company credit
card to pay for a prostitute. Putting the ordeal behind him, he
danced merrily away with his wife, Paola.

   A New Harvard Classic? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today's college students, horrified by the corporate
bloodletting of the 1980s and early 90s, have set their ambitions
higher than working for a good company: They now want to own the
company. That is the premise of the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club's
``Guide to Starting Your Own Business,'' edited by Poonam Sharma,
that is just now hitting the bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid of being replaceable,'' said Ms. Sharma, a
Harvard senior. She is not above chiding her generation for
impatience _ saying too many young people yearn to be overnight
millionaires _ but she believes that those willing to put in 5 to
10 years in the trenches will be the corporate chiefs of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Who does she admire most in the business world? She names
Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and author of her book's
foreword, ``because of his ability to bounce back'' after a setback
in investment banking; Bill Gates, because he admonishes college
students not to drop out, and, most of all, her father, Amba P.
Sharma, owner of Brothers Mechanical Inc., a Long Island
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The proverbial penniless immigrant who made it in America,
Sharma and his wife used to make their business affairs the focus
of dinner conversations. As a teen-ager, Ms. Sharma remembers
asking him questions like, ``Did you get that in writing, Daddy?''
and ``Why can't you take 51 percent instead of 49?'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Deal Maker's Holiday &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is leaving the law firm where he has worked for more
than three decades helping to cobble together Wall Street deals,
you'd think that Robert L. Friedman would be devoting himself full
time to cherished pastimes like biking around Nantucket or playing
chess by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Friedman, who in 32 years at Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett
has advised the likes of Northwest Airlines and Harcourt General
and has worked on more than 700 mergers and 200 leveraged buyouts,
is joining the Blackstone Group, a merchant bank in Manhattan, as
senior managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman has been an adviser to Blackstone since it was founded
in 1985 by Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman. He expects
to work long hours in his new job, he said, but there is one thing
he will always make time for: ``My two grandchildren, of course.'' &QL;

David Leibowitz 
PHOENIX _ The story left me in shock. I can't believe I missed the
signs _ me, a real sophisticated man. And it's all there, sure
enough: The penchant for wearing purple, the antenna in the shape
of a gay-pride triangle. And, oh, that ``magic bag''!
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be real. A giant puppet who knows how to accessorize?
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell has it pegged: Tinky Winky, the purple
Teletubby, absolutely must be gay!
</P>
<P>
   I was attempting to recalibrate my ``gaydar'' when the phone
rang.
</P>
<P>
   It was Underdog, the cartoon hero of my youth. &QL; 
CARTOON CONFESSIONS &QL; 
He _ that ``champion of champi ons,'' the heroic alter-ego of Shoe
shine Boy, the canine vanquisher of the nefarious Simon Barsinister
_ had a confession to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this thing I have to say, and that, my friend, is that
I am gay.''
</P>
<P>
   No way! Wow. Not that there's anything wrong with that! Hey,
that explains the cape, and all those years of speaking in rhyme.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second. What about Sweet Polly PureBread,
Underdog? I thought she was your gal?
</P>
<P>
   ``David, even now this may sound weird, but Sweet Polly, the TV
reporter, was merely a beard.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course _ like Doris Day and Rock Hudson! It makes perfect
sense!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I mention it only so you'll know how I scooped Falwell
on a national exclusive: ``Underdog Comes Out Of Phone Booth, De
clares He's Gay!''
</P>
<P>
   I was putting the finishing touches on that Pulitzer Prize opus
when the following story moved over the newswire:
</P>
<P>
   MEGALOPOLIS ZOO _ It was a love that dare not speak its name.
Until now.
</P>
<P>
   After years of silence, wise-cracking penguin Tennessee Tuxedo
and his bumbling walrus pal Chum ley have decided to speak openly
about their interspecies relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here,'' said Tuxedo, ``and we're queer. Get used to it.
This isn't the '60s anymore. There's no reason for us to live in
the closet, beside our friend Phineas J. Whoo pie's
three-dimensional blackboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding his partner's hand, Chumley acknowledged a debt _ to
Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made this all possible by outing Tinky Winky,'' said the
tie-wearing walrus. ``We never knew America was ready for gay
cartoon characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Zookeeper Stanley Livingston _ vacationing in San Francisco with
longtime assistant Flunky _ could not be reached for comment.
BREAKDOWN OF FAMILY I'd barely finished reading when my editor
yelled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big story breaking in Family Court!'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   There it was, atop the docket: Flintstone vs. Flintstone.
</P>
<P>
   Fred was on a bench in the hallway, reading a biography of Judy
Garland. That orange suit, the blue tie! The bizarre episode where
he befriends ``Spartacus''co-star Stony Curtis! Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years Barney and I denied it,'' said Fred. ``But now I'm
divorcing Wilma. We're giving it a go.''
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, you heard it here first. Along with revelations
about Superman _ those tights! that commitment problem with Lois
Lane! _ Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street _ you doubted it? _ and
1970s animated superhero Hong Kong Phooey _ who, you will recall,
had ``style and a groovy smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Need I say more?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes, I should. See, I was watching the Teletubbies
yesterday afternoon when I got a call from Jughead from the Archie
comics.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't another problem with Reggie Mantle, his archenemy.
Jug was worried about his continued lack of interest in girls, his
choles terol from all those burgers at Pops', and about still
attending Riverdale High School while wearing a crown at the ripe
old age of 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't seem like I have a life,'' said Jughead.
``Sometimes, David, I swear, I feel exactly like a character in a
comic book.''
</P>
<P>
   I told him not to worry. Having no life doesn't stop Jerry
Falwell, does it? David Leibowitz can be reached at 444-8515, or at
david.leibow itz &LR; pni.com. Watch Channel 12 (KPNX) for his

<TEXT>
<P>
   Investing in medical biotechnology usually entails a large risk:
the chance that the promising new therapy the company is developing
will not work. Investors in Genentech Inc. lose little sleep over
that kind of risk, as the company has been remarkably consistent in
turning novel molecules into breakthrough drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Genentech shareholders face a very different sort of risk.
Two-thirds of the company is owned by Roche Holdings of
Switzerland, which has until June 30 to exercise an option to buy
the balance. Should Roche exercise its option by March 31, it can
do so at $80 a share; after that, it must pay $82.50.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech shares closed on Friday at $80.75 and have been as
high as $84.75 in recent weeks. Since few people buy a stock for
$84.75 to sell it for $82.50, much less $80, some investors are
clearly betting that Roche will leave Genentech alone.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects of two other pioneering biotechnology companies _
Chiron and Immunex _ are also complicated by relationships with
pharmaceutical giants: Novartis PLC of Switzerland owns slightly
less than half of Chiron, while American Home Products owns 54
percent of Immunex.
</P>
<P>
   For Chiron, a so-called standstill agreement with Novartis
expires on Dec. 31; after that, Novartis may raise its stake to 55
percent. A similar standstill agreement between Immunex and
American Home expired last year and the latter has not increased
its position.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Genentech is where the action is. Last year, the
company received approval for Herceptin, the first biological
therapy for metastatic breast cancer; the year before it received
approval for a similar drug, Rituxan, for non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   These drugs form the basis of a new oncology franchise for
Genentech. Together with Activase for heart attack and stroke,
Pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis, and the Protropin growth hormone
therapy, they helped propel 1998 earnings to $181.9 million, or
$1.40 a diluted share, up 41 percent from $129 million, or $1.02 a
share, in 1997. Revenues rose 13 percent, to $1.15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What is not clear is whether such success will prompt Roche to
buy the remainder of Genentech or to leave well enough alone. Four
years ago, when the company was stumbling, Roche passed on a
previous option to buy the remaining stake for $60 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Under Arthur Levinson, who took over as chief executive in 1995,
Genentech has pursued a strategy of increasing profits so that the
shares will rise above Roche's option price, perhaps prompting
Roche to leave Genentech semi-independent.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts expect the opposite effect. ``I think
Genentech is the most powerful drug development engine in all of
pharmaceuticals, including big pharma,'' said Richard A. van den
Broek, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. He expects Roche to
exercise its option. ``They are in the drug development business,
not the fund management business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Levinson would like to continue as
head of a semi-independent Genentech. Previously Genentech's chief
scientist, he has flourished as the company's chief executive. ``If
we didn't have the Roche deal, I wouldn't be losing a minute of
sleep on whether we could survive as an independent company,'' he
said in an interview. ``We expect to increase earnings 20 percent a
year for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's future growth will come from a broad and deep
pipeline of new drugs. Genentech is filing for approval of a
sustained-delivery version of its human growth hormone and has six
drugs in the final phase of clinical trials alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are betting that if Roche does step out of the way,
the stock is going to $100,'' said Robert Toth, an analyst with
Vector Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex provides a glimpse at what happens to successful
biotechnology companies that are allowed to go their own way. In
November 1995, American Home offered $14.50 a share for the 46
percent of the company that it did not already own, an offer that
Immunex's board rejected as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, with the launch of a promising new drug for
rheumatoid arthritis, Immunex shares have traded as high as
$163.125; they closed on Friday at $136.625, still almost three
times the 52-week low of $47.875 on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron remains the laggard, with no new drugs on the horizon and
its shares in the low $20s, about half of what Novartis paid. But
new management and the sale of its diagnostic business to Bayer for
$1.2 billion cash give some analysts hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Chiron, as they are going through a low cycle,
they are still cheaper than Genentech,'' said Viren Mehta, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, who rates Chiron a near-term buy. ``On
a cash-flow basis they are less than half the price of Genentech.
Now that they have divested diagnostics, it gives them both cash
and more focus.''

A DISASTER WAITING FOR CUSTOMERS   TO HAPPEN ALONG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The spectacle of thousands watching city officials
implode a decrepit high-rise public housing building, as they did
here a few years ago, fascinated Patrick Turner. So does the notion
that drivers routinely slow down to see a grisly accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like dramatic themes,'' Turner said Friday, standing in
the cavernous hulk of a failed bar in south Baltimore that he
intends to convert into the Crash Cafe, a culinary monument to
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   With plans for cars and motorcycles to be wrapped around poles,
video screens showing train collisions and an old DC-3 airplane
positioned halfway through the front wall, simulating a horrible
error in pilot judgment, the Crash Cafe promises to be ``born from
destruction,'' as its promotional brochure says.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a 47-year-old Vietnam veteran who became a real estate
developer, predicted that patrons would find the restaurant ``a fun
place to be entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of honoring chaos and carnage does not sit well
with everyone on Federal Hill and Locust Point, the nearby
harbor-view neighborhoods that are some of Baltimore's oldest, with
150-year-old row houses and narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Gail A. Dunham of Philadelphia find it appealing. She
is president of the National Air Disaster Alliance, an air safety
advocacy group that represents more than 1,500 relatives of people
killed in plane crashes. Her former husband, Harold Green, was
captain of a United Airlines jet that crashed eight years ago in
Colorado Springs, killing 25 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible,'' she said. ``This is worse than the dark
side of humor. He has no idea what an air crash endures on people.
To turn it into some entertainment eatery, he is morally
bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner commissioned a door-to-door survey of nearby streets to
learn how receptive neighbors might be to his latest venture. He
was happily surprised, he said, when pollsters found people at home
in 215 of 445 houses, and nearly 90 percent of them approved of the
restaurant and its theme.
</P>
<P>
   But, apparently, Turner's pollsters did not talk to any of a
half-dozen local residents interviewed at random Friday. Not one
had anything positive to say about the Crash Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the idea repugnant,'' said Thomas E. Kramer, a car
salesman whose row house on Clement Street faces the restaurant.
``It will introduce a recreational element that is inappropriate
for this kind of venue.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Kramer also was worried about losing the quiet of
local streets to patrons looking for convenient parking and
returning noisily to their cars late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Dugger, a waitress who lives several blocks from the
Crash Cafe, said that when its predecessor, the Globe Brewing
Company, a bar and microbrewery, was open, drunken people often
left their cars and came back for them the next day, adding to the
parking problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other old neighborhoods near downtown Baltimore that have
gentrified in recent years, including Fells Point and Hampden,
those adjacent to the Crash Cafe have resisted wholesale upscaling
through trendy bars and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, young professionals are moving in and renovating, and
property values are pushing sale prices up, to $150,000 and more.
But generally, the neighborhoods have remained relatively
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   A group of community leaders wants to keep them that way. When
Turner first tried opening the Crash Cafe at a different site, they
fought his application for a liquor license and won. Searching for
an alternative location, Turner found the Globe, and the sale price
included the liquor license. A summer opening is planned.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Della Jr., who represents the Fells Point area in the
Maryland Senate, led the previous attack, along with officials from
several neighborhood associations. He conceded that they were
virtually powerless to do anything again until the license comes up
for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than wait for community opposition to close the Crash
Cafe, Della said its ``more than bizarre'' nature might do the
trick first. At least, he hoped it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one can believe something like this can be successful,'' he
said, ``then you really have a problem.''

PALESTINIANS IN DISPUTE: WHO ARE THEIR FRIENDS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PATRICIA COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Arab world's leaders bowed their heads before King
Hussein's draped coffin in Amman this week, Palestinians in the
West Bank could be heard grumbling about how the king had crushed
the guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization and
abandoned the dream of a Palestinian state. The divided emotions
reflect the divided view of the Hashemite dynasty's legacy of
accommodation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a region where the past bleeds into the present, the question
of whether Jordan's rulers betrayed or championed the Palestinians
is at the heart of a bitter dispute _ among Israeli historians who
reject the traditionally glorified story of their nation's
founding; among Arab experts who are just beginning to cast a
critical eye on the Arabs' role; among people who are as interested
in the Middle East's future as in its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a clinical debate in academic circles,'' said
Benny Kraut, who is organizing a conference on Israeli revisionism
at Queens College in March. ``It can serve as a blueprint for
pragmatic political activities in the present. That's why it's not
only debated in academic journals and books but in the press and
among opinion molders in Israeli society.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Hashemites
have been at its center, and the question of whether Jordan's kings
conspired with the West and sold out the Palestinians or made the
best of a bad deal keeps bubbling up. In addition to the Queens
College conference, the Middle East Studies Association is
sponsoring a panel on ``Revising the 1948 War'' in November. And
Avi Shlaim, one of the first Israeli revisionists or ``New
Historians,'' has been holding seminars at Oxford University and is
publishing a book, one of a raft of new works in the field due out
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to control the history began before the 1948-49
Arab-Israeli war ended, with each side putting out its authorized
version of events. The Israelis cast themselves in the role of a
struggling David reluctantly driven to war against a bullying Arab
Goliath. In this version, the roughly 700,000 Palestinians living
in the disputed territory fled at the urging of Arab broadcasters
who assured them they could triumphantly return after the Arab
League armies wiped out the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   To the Israelis, as well as the Americans and British, Jordan's
first King Abdullah, like his grandson Hussein, was incontestably a
visionary peacemaker. But in the Arab world the prevailing opinion
about Abdullah is that he was a greedy villain whose collaboration
with the Jews and the British robbed the Palestinians of their
land. An enraged Palestinian cut down Abdullah in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy relationship between Jordan's kings and the
Palestinians, who make up 70 percent of Jordan's population, has
continued. ``Black September'' is how the Palestinians refer to the
fighting that led to Hussein's expulsion of the PLO from Jordan in
1970. And now everyone is scrutinizing the new King Abdullah to see
if he exhibits the diplomatic sensibility of his namesake and
great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of Israeli, American and British archives in 1978
after a 30-year moratorium finally allowed historians to test the
Israeli version of events against the factual record. By the late
'80s, as the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, was ripping across
the West Bank, the first books questioning the ``founding myths''
were published. Shlaim's ``Collusion Across the Jordan'' (Columbia
University Press, 1988) was one of the early revisionist texts. It
disputed Israel's claim that it ever sincerely intended to share
land with the Palestinians as laid out in the U.N. 1947 partition
plan. In ``The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,
1947-1949'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987), Benny Morris
undertook a village-by-village analysis of the Palestinian flight.
He concluded that military pressure and organized expulsions by the
Israelis in addition to panic, chaos and the danger of living in a
war zone had all been factors.

   Although many of the revisionist theories are still contested,
there is no doubt they have a comfortable berth in the Israeli
mainstream. Re-evaluating the Arab side, however, is a much newer
and much more fragile undertaking. The publication of diaries by a
handful of Arab military figures has provided some new sources.
Still, there are no collected Palestinian archives, and none of the
Arab archives from the period are open. The scarcity of democracies
in the Arab world has also stifled independent research. And then
there's the legacy of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Israeli side, this is a movement in the wake of
victory,'' said Rashid Khalidi, who teaches at the University of
Chicago and was an adviser to the Palestinian delegation during
peace talks from 1991 to 1993. But the defeated Palestinians, who
refer to 1948 as al nakba, or the catastrophe, don't have the sense
of confidence or largess supplied by success. ``I've said to
people, `Don't you think it's time we can talk openly about the
mistakes of this Arab leader or that one?''' he added, ``but some
people don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Mattar, editor of the forthcoming Encyclopedia of the
Palestinians (Facts on File Inc.) and the author of ``The Mufti of
Jerusalem'' (Columbia University Press, 1995), went further.
Although a handful of searching works like Khalidi's have begun to
crack the wall of silence, he said, ``I don't think there's a
single Palestinian revisionist and I don't think there will be
until this conflict is resolved and they don't feel they are
revealing too much about their weaknesses and mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enormous gaps in the history of Palestine that
Palestinians and other Arabs have not faced,'' Mattar explained,
for example, the Palestinians' rejection of even favorable
compromises that would have created a state of Palestine or the
sale of land to Jewish settlers. ``The history has to be far more
forthright and detailed,'' he said. ``It has to based on the
archives, it has to totally ignore public perceptions and official
narratives and stick to the facts as they emerge without being
mindful of the political, social and economic consequences. That's
a tall order and I don't think any Palestinian is willing to do
it.''

<P>
   Khalidi, who traced the roots of Palestinian nationalism to the
last century in his book ``Palestinian Identity,'' (Columbia
University Press, 1997), said that overwhelming military force
routed the Palestinians in 1948. But they were also hobbled by
internal weaknesses and blunders. Despite a well-developed national
identity, he said, they seemed incapable of unifying to create the
state institutions necessary to fight back. ``A lot of Palestinian
historians were reluctant to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Landis, an American expert on Syria who teaches at
Princeton University and is co-editor of a coming book on the 1948
war, said the inter-Arab conflict remained ``the untold story.''
The Egyptians, Syrians, Iraqis and Jordanians would have liked to
destroy Israel, but they knew their armies were too weak to prevent
the creation of a Jewish state, he said. ``They were fighting over
the parts of Palestine which the UN had designated for an Arab
state. The Arab coalition was a ramshackle bunch of squabbling
states and militias which spent as much energy trying to undermine
rival Arab states as to thwart Jewish claims in Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   That inter-Arab rivalry continues to define the region today,
which is why the awkward handshake between President Hafez al-Assad
of Syria and Hussein's son, the new King Abdullah, during Hussein's
funeral piqued such interest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the first King Abdullah, the only winner among the
Arabs in 1948, who continues to intrigue and impassion both
Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Shlaim argued that in the 1920s, an aggressive Jewish agency
began colluding with Abdullah to divvy up the Palestinians' lands.
David Ben-Gurion, who became Israel's first prime minister, agreed
in 1946 to support Abdullah's rule over the Arab parts of Palestine
in exchange for support of a Jewish state. He even nicknamed the
two nations Judaea and Abdallia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a theory that remains controversial. Yoav Gelber of Haifa
University says Abdullah's dealings with the Jewish agency were in
the open. When the Arab League realized it had lost to the new
Israeli nation, it ``came to Abdullah to save Palestine.'' Fearful
of a power vacuum, the British supported the plan that ended up
giving Jordan the West Bank and half of Jerusalem. ``Abdullah
didn't require the Jews anymore to annex the Arab part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians call Abdullah a traitor,'' Gelber continued,
``I think that but for Abdullah's intervention, all Palestine would
have been occupied by the Jews in 1948, and all Palestinians would
be refugees. In my opinion, he was the Palestinians' savior, not a
traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   On this point, Morris and Landis concur. ``Abdullah prevented
Ben-Gurion from overrunning the West Bank,'' Landis said. No doubt
Abdullah cooperated with the Jews and the British to protect his
fragile rump state from its hungry Arab neighbors, Landis said. But
``if the Palestinians have the West Bank to claim as Palestine
today, it is in large measure thanks to Abdullah's skillful
diplomacy in 1948.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Khalidi scorns the notion that the Jordanian kings were
heroes. The Hashemites have always served other people's interests,
he said, noting that the Arab Legion, Jordan's army during the war,
was supplied with British weapons, British ammunition and British
officers, including its leader, Glubb Pasha, who back home had the
more prosaic name of John Glubb. ``Abdullah preserved a part of
Palestine from being swallowed up by Israel in order to swallow it
up for Jordan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, what has given the debates over 50-year-old events
such immediacy and power is the current political turmoil and
cynicism in their country, the residue of the intifada, the
drawn-out invasion of Lebanon, the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and the fractured peace process. ``It is a result of
Israel maturing,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, ``Righteous Victims,'' will examine Jewish designs
on the land. ``The Zionist movement from the beginning wanted to
take over the whole land of Israel and wanted to displace the
Palestinian Arabs,'' he said from his home in Israel. ``They did it
first by purchase and then by military conquest. They did it by
what could be called a `creeping expulsion.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It will doubtless stir up heated debate. Morris, who believes
his work kept him from being hired by any Israeli university until
two years ago, says that Israel takes ``its historical truths very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're undermining things basic to identity and statehood,''
he continued. ``It goes to the heart of the nature of Zionism.''
What claims do the Palestinian refugees have? Has Israel done
enough to make peace?
</P>
<P>
   This is no less true for the Palestinians, whose struggles for
land, governance and resources are as much a subject of tomorrow's
negotiations as yesterday's history. ``Questions of restitution,
atonement, of someone taking responsibility for what was done to
the Palestinians, could be affected by critical history,'' Khalidi
said, ``This is not an abstract historical question for either the
Israelis or the Palestinians.''

A PLEASANT OUTING IN CARTOONLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The story left me in shock. I can't believe I missed
the signs _ me, a real sophisticated man. And it's all there, sure
enough: The penchant for wearing purple, the antenna in the shape
of a gay-pride triangle. And, oh, that ``magic bag''!
</P>
<P>
   Be real. A giant puppet who knows how to accessorize?
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell has it pegged: Tinky Winky, the purple
Teletubby, absolutely must be gay!
</P>
<P>
   I was attempting to recalibrate my ``gaydar'' when the phone
rang.
</P>
<P>
   It was Underdog, the cartoon hero of my youth. &QL; 
CARTOON CONFESSIONS &QL; 
He _ that ``champion of champions,'' the heroic alter-ego of
Shoeshine Boy, the canine vanquisher of the nefarious Simon
Barsinister _ had a confession to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this thing I have to say, and that, my friend, is that
I am gay.''
</P>
<P>
   No way! Wow. Not that there's anything wrong with that! Hey,
that explains the cape, and all those years of speaking in rhyme.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second. What about Sweet Polly PureBread,
Underdog? I thought she was your gal?
</P>
<P>
   ``David, even now this may sound weird, but Sweet Polly, the TV
reporter, was merely a beard.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course _ like Doris Day and Rock Hudson! It makes perfect
sense!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I mention it only so you'll know how I scooped Falwell
on a national exclusive: ``Underdog Comes Out Of Phone Booth,
Declares He's Gay!''
</P>
<P>
   I was putting the finishing touches on that Pulitzer Prize opus
when the following story moved over the newswire:
</P>
<P>
   MEGALOPOLIS ZOO _ It was a love that dare not speak its name.
Until now.
</P>
<P>
   After years of silence, wise-cracking penguin Tennessee Tuxedo
and his bumbling walrus pal Chumley have decided to speak openly
about their interspecies relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here,'' said Tuxedo, ``and we're queer. Get used to it.
This isn't the '60s anymore. There's no reason for us to live in
the closet, beside our friend Phineas J. Whoopie's
three-dimensional blackboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding his partner's hand, Chumley acknowledged a debt _ to
Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made this all possible by outing Tinky Winky,'' said the
tie-wearing walrus. ``We never knew America was ready for gay
cartoon characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Zookeeper Stanley Livingston _ vacationing in San Francisco with
longtime assistant Flunky _ could not be reached for comment. &QL; 
BREAKDOWN OF FAMILY &QL; 
I'd barely finished reading when my editor yelled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big story breaking in Family Court!'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   There it was, atop the docket: Flintstone vs. Flintstone.
</P>
<P>
   Fred was on a bench in the hallway, reading a biography of Judy
Garland. That orange suit, the blue tie! The bizarre episode where
he befriends ``Spartacus''co-star Stony Curtis! Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years Barney and I denied it,'' said Fred. ``But now I'm
divorcing Wilma. We're giving it a go.''
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, you heard it here first. Along with revelations
about Superman _ those tights! that commitment problem with Lois
Lane! _ Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street _ you doubted it? _ and
1970s animated superhero Hong Kong Phooey _ who, you will recall,
had ``style and a groovy smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Need I say more?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes, I should. See, I was watching the Teletubbies
yesterday afternoon when I got a call from Jughead from the Archie
comics.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't another problem with Reggie Mantle, his archenemy.
Jug was worried about his continued lack of interest in girls, his
cholesterol from all those burgers at Pops', and about still
attending Riverdale High School while wearing a crown at the ripe
old age of 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't seem like I have a life,'' said Jughead.
``Sometimes, David, I swear, I feel exactly like a character in a
comic book.''
</P>
<P>
   I told him not to worry. Having no life doesn't stop Jerry
Falwell, does it? &QL;

 JUDGE REBUKES DEFIANT PILOTS, BUT DELAYS CONTEMPT RULING  (See also(jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines urged a federal judge in Dallas to hold its
pilots union in contempt Friday as a continued sickout led to the
cancellation of nearly half the airline's flights and to spiraling
chaos on one of the year's busiest weekends for travel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall of North Texas announced he
would put off until Saturday morning his ruling on whether to cite
the union for contempt although he strongly warned its leaders to
press the 2,443 pilots who called in sick Friday to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   There were widespread expectations that Kendall would rule
against the union and its leaders, judging from the stern, often
sarcastic tone he took in a day when he quizzed them about their
salaries, the size of the union's assets and whether they had
wholeheartedly urged pilots to end their sickout.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a day of hearings, Kendall told the leaders of the
Allied Pilots Association, ``If you all want to spend a productive
evening, spend it on the telephone and try to get these people to
do what everyone in the world knows is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he did not issue a ruling Friday because he ``did
not want to shoot from the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Kendall ordered leaders of the pilots union to get
the airline's 9,200 pilots to end the sickout, but Friday he showed
clear irritation that so many pilots had defied his order.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for American, the nation's second-largest airline,
described a scene of growing chaos to Kendall, telling him that
angry passengers nearly rioted in Miami and that 450,000 passengers
had been affected since the sickout began last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union leaders have thumbed their noses at management and
the public,'' Dee Kelly, an airline lawyer, told the judge's
crowded courtroom. ``The airline has suffered enough, and it is
time that the pilots suffer along with us.''
</P>
<P>
   American, a unit of AMR Corp., announced that it had canceled
1,102 of its 2,250 scheduled flights and that the number of pilots
calling in sick had risen slightly for the second day in a row,
despite Kendall's order.
</P>
<P>
   The continued sickout ensured snarls for tens of thousands of
American passengers not just Friday but for Saturday and Sunday as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ahern, American's vice president for operations and
planning, said if all the pilots had returned to work Friday,
Monday was the soonest the airline could have been back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to avoid a contempt citation, Rich LaVoy, president of the
union, told Kendall that he had done his best to persuade
American's pilots to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done everything except go to their house and knock on
their doors,'' LaVoy said, adding that he would do more to get the
message out, even ``if I have to drive around with a loudspeaker on
top of my car.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Kendall learned that 12 of the union's 18 board members
had called in sick Friday, he scoffed at the union's assertions
that it was doing its utmost to persuade the pilots to return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pilots have staged their job action to protest the speed
with which American plans to integrate Reno Air, a small Western
carrier it bought in December, into the larger airline's network.
The pilots fear that American will rely increasingly on Reno's
lower-paid pilots, thus undercutting the American pilots. But the
airline insists it has no such intention, saying it plans to bring
the Reno pilots up to the American pay scale within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's hearing, Kendall showed little sympathy for the
pilots, who earn about $140,000 a year on average. ``When you call
in sick and get paid for it and you're really not, is that not
stealing?'' he asked, saying it was dishonorable for so many
pilots, many of them veterans of the armed services, to act in such
a way.
</P>
<P>
   Lavoy denied the pilots were stealing. He said that the union's
net assets were between $36 million and $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing ended, LaVoy said: ``We are trying our best to
comply with Kendall's order. We are urging our pilots to get back
in the cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials told the judge that the airline had lost
about $40 million as a result of the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The White House commented for the first time Friday about the
dispute, saying that it was closely monitoring the situation. In a
statement, President Clinton said: ``I am concerned about the
impact this labor dispute is having on our nation and the traveling
public. With the potential for enormous disruption over the
upcoming Presidents Day holiday weekend, I urge both parties to
think of the impact on the traveling public, set aside their
differences and work together to resolve the issues between them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the day-long hearing, which was attended by the
union's leaders, the two sides did not hold negotiations scheduled
for Friday afternoon.

COMBINE DANCE AND MARTIAL ARTS TO GET TAE-BO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALPOLE, Mass. _ By 6:15 on a rainy, rainy evening, the line
outside the aerobics studio at World Gym stretches deep into
treadmill territory, a haphazard column of spandex and shorts and
T-shirts queueing for the chance to kick and punch and perspire in
the ``taebox'' class that starts in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the studio door opens, 81 people file into the cavernous
room and stake their spots on the exercise floor. This same wet
night, in Swampscott, 135 people show up for a similar Tae-Bo class
at the East Coast Karate Academy. The night before, 50 people
filled a demonstration class at the Metropolitan Health Club in
Boston's South End.
</P>
<P>
   These classes are examples of the latest fitness phenom, part
tae kwon do, part boxing, part dance, part aerobics, propelled by a
30-minute Tae-Bo TV infomercial by former Bay Stater turned
Californian Billy Blanks, who owns the trademark for Tae-Bo
(pronounced ``tie bow''). What the karate champ videotapes for the
at-home workout set, teachers like Juan Velasquez and Louis Hopkins
are parlaying into exercise classes.
</P>
<P>
   Velasquez, clad in black nylon pants and a sleeveless white
undershirt that does nothing to conceal his musculature, steps onto
the platform in the front of the room. He's 33 years old, trained
in dance and martial arts, involved in his family's Roxbury
pizzeria when he's not teaching classes like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoulders roll. Just relax. Now double time.''
</P>
<P>
   The backbeat pulses. Dance music. Sweat music. Spice Girls.
Depeche Mode. Funk Boutique. Velasquez turns to lunge, and when he
does the class turns with him in a collective squeal of sneakers on
the glossy wood floor of a gym so new it still smells of
polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need to stop, stop. If you need to get water, get
water. I'm not stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Jab left. Jab right. Boom. Boom. Jab. Kick. Jab. Kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intense workout,'' says Robert Russo, a 33-year-old
computer technician from Walpole, one of more than 20 men in the
room, a grouping you'd never see in an aerobics class. ``You're
using muscles you didn't know you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Blanks first introduced his exercise regimen
in 1984, when he lived in Massachusetts; at that point he called
the classes ``kaerobics.'' Michelle Fallon ran a Braintree gym
where Blanks tried kaerobics and now (more irony) she's program
director of the World Gyms in Walpole and Dedham, where the generic
form of the exercise, taebox, which began in January, is off to one
of the hottest starts she's seen in 20 years in the business.
``What happened back then,'' she says, ``was step (aerobics) was
coming at the same time and people were (more) interested in step
and high-level aerobics.''
</P>
<P>
   So Blanks headed west, to Los Angeles (of course), refined his
gig, lured a few celebs like Paula Abdul into his studio and, with
the debut of the infomercial in August, another California trend
went national. It's all part of a broader rise in boxing-based
fitness classes, which the trade group IDEA reports are offered in
44 percent of clubs surveyed, up from 24 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Billboard lists the Tae-Bo video as the nation's ninth best
selling, behind ``Austin Powers'' and ``The Parent Trap,'' and it's
third on Amazon.com's list of top sellers, behind ``Mulan'' and
``Living Yoga.'' Come Feb. 15 and Oprah Winfrey, who claims she's
lost inches doing Tae-Bo, plans to offer a week of Tae-Bo segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation thinks Tae-Bo is six months old, but Tae-Bo is 15
years old,'' Blanks says in a telephone interview. ``I wanted to
find a better way for people to learn self-defense. In Korean `tae'
means foot. Because women have problems with their hip and leg
areas, I said let's get that involved. I wanted to get men involved
so I got the `bo' from boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the class is moving. Velasquez has everyone counting out
loud, very loud. Kick. ``One!'' Punch. ``Two!'' Kick. Punch.
``Three! Four! Kya! Kya!''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fabian, a 28-year-old TV producer from Hull, is taking her
first taebox class. No way can she see herself screaming, but then
moments later she is: ``I put more energy into every kick when I
scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Velasquez summons Fallon onstage. That move they're doing, he
says, of both hands coming down, is not some dance move pushing on
air. He demonstrates and puts his descending hands on Fallon's
head: She crumbles into herself. ``Fight for your life!'' he
commands. Velasquez gives a weak punch that would not deter the
meekest assailant. Then he throws a hard punch. ``Fight for your
life! Visualize! Visualize!''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Caswell, a 43-year-old homemaker and mother of eight
from Westwood, visualizes ``my children being in danger.'' Photios
Kim, a 35-year-old computer consultant from Norwood, visualizes
attacking his goal of finishing his PhD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'll never need it, but if I do I could probably
react and do it,'' says 36-year-old Donna Gillis, a student from
Easton. ``It gives you a sense of empowerment.''
</P>
<P>
   Velasquez calls his classes taebox because he's not a certified
Tae-Bo instructor, which he'd like to be, but Blanks says he's not
certifying any more teachers until he opens some franchises. So
Velasquez, who began studying martial arts at 14 and who performed
with the Dance Theater of Harlem, designed a class based on the
same concepts. ``It's a combination of everything I love,'' he
says. ``It's four punches and four kicks, put together in a way
that's simple to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In Swampscott, karate academy owner Hopkins is one of 16
certified Tae-Bo teachers in the nation, along with kaerobics
veteran Shawn Graham, who offers it in his small karate studio in
Holbrook and is seeking more space. Hopkins once trained in
Blanks's studio in Rockland, and has offered Tae-Bo since October.
``Now people are calling us from everywhere,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Walpole, Velasquez winds down. ``Breathe out. Breathe
in. Breathe deep breaths.'' Velasquez brings his hands together in
a martial arts sign of peace and bows to the class. The class bows
to him and applauds.
</P>
<P>
   Next in the room is a step aerobics class with six students.

A PENNY IN STOCKS SAVED MAY NOT BE A PENNY EARNED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Ohio, Calif.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE

<P>
   Stock prices, as everyone has heard, are too high, overvalued,
in bubble territory, vulnerable to a crash. Fair warning has been
abundantly served. But fair warnings came in similar abundance
before each of history's financial panics. And few people got out
of the way in time. This column is a fresh contribution to the
fair-warning literature _ a fresh appeal to beware of the growing
addiction to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 24 percent of the nation's household wealth is now
invested in stocks, up from 10 percent at the time of the 1987
crash. Rarely if ever has the Federal Reserve recorded a higher
percentage. And many Americans believe that the economy must weaken
for standard reasons _ rising unemployment, less consumption, a
spike in oil prices _ before the market will react and fall.
</P>
<P>
   They do not see that the causal chain can run in reverse: A
scare or panic collapses stock prices, and then the crash shrinks
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that scares to the market can't be sustained as
long as the economy holds up,'' said Richard Curtin, director of
consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. ``If prices drop,
as they did last fall, the belief is they'll come right back up.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than ever, Americans are using the stocks they own to
finance the spending that keeps the economy afloat. The harnessing
of stock portfolios to this task, diluting the market's role as a
repository of savings, is taking several forms, one of them evident
in Cincinnati, among many other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Drive out to the Fifth Third Bank's Madeira branch, near an
affluent suburb, and talk to Dianna L. Grubenhoff, the branch
manager, who has just been crowned by the bank as the ``queen of
loans'' for making $17.9 million in home equity loans last year,
more than at any other branch. The loans are going mainly to people
with ever richer stock portfolios, Ms. Grubenhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   These rich portfolios make the borrowers more creditworthy in
the eyes of the bank. Rather than sell their stock and pay a
capital gains tax, the borrowers prefer to take out home equity
loans to pay for new cars, vacations, second homes, college
tuition, new clothing. Wages that once went into savings now
service the loans, the thinking being that rich stock portfolios
already provide for a comfortable future retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big jump in this sort of lending has come only in the last
two years,'' Ms. Grubenhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   If stock prices were to plunge, Fifth Third Bank anticipates
that its borrowers would repay loans by selling stock and again put
aside money to replenish savings. Contrary to accepted wisdom, the
falling market, by extinguishing consumption, would definitely
weaken the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Visit, too, almost any Wall Street investment house, or the
hundreds of banks that now make loans to people who deposit stock
as collateral. These loans, once mainly a source of credit to buy
more stock, are now widely available for any sort of consumer
spending. The loans are often equal to a small enough percentage of
the collateral that stock prices would have to decline by more than
20 percent before the lenders demanded repayment or sold the stock.
</P>
<P>
   That almost happened last fall, when Russia's debt crisis
panicked the market and the Dow Jones industrial average fell by
nearly 20 percent before rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   In another growing practice, one that is hard to document,
people are borrowing on their credit cards to invest in stocks.
These gamblers count on rising stock prices to pay off the debt and
yield a profit. ``It is certainly a dangerous way to use credit
card debt,'' said David Eyles, chief credit policy officer of Fleet
Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   What no one has quantified is the role of the stock market in
supporting the loans that finance the spending that keeps the
economy strong. But government data hint at the market's growing
importance. With more than $500 billion in new home equity loans
issued over the last two years, only 56 percent of the value of all
household real estate is now unencumbered by debt, compared with 66
percent in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The national savings rate, as measured by the government, has
declined to zero, meaning people are spending beyond their income.
But that leaves out the stock market. Two new studies find that if
capital gains from the sale of stock in recent months were added to
family income _ a calculation the government does not make _ then
income would exceed expenditure by an ample amount.
</P>
<P>
   Huge sums from these stock sales are being channeled into down
payments to buy homes, driving up home prices in the process,
according to Kenneth Rosen, a business school economist at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   If stock prices collapse, he argues, housing will be hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, of course, can again head off damage to the
economy by lowering interest rates. The Fed did that last fall when
lending started to dry up, and the stock market rebounded in
response.
</P>
<P>
   But how often can the Fed go to the well? There is only so much
room between today's already fairly low interest rates and zero.
Counting on further rate cuts to sustain growth in an economy
increasingly dependent on high stock prices is a risky and
dangerous game.

CLINTON WILL COMMIT U.S. TROOPS TO PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-TALKS) 
(fe) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to announce on Saturday
that he will send U.S. troops to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping
force to be formed if an agreement is reached among the warring
parties, administration officials and diplomats said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With little progress in negotiations to persuade the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to accept a NATO-scripted settlement for the
troubled Serbian province of Kosovo, the United States has been
under pressure from its European allies to make a public
declaration of its commitment. Clinton's announcement is expected
in his Saturday radio address, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is now satisfied with the military section of the
proposed settlement, a document written in large part by the United
States this week, according to allied officials, and Pentagon
planners want to move quickly in preparation for an eventual
deployment of U.S. forces, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon as well as the allies believe there is an
urgency,`` said one official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``We want to avoid a big gap between signing an
agreement and getting our troops on the ground.``
</P>
<P>
   An announcement of U.S. plans in Kosovo one day after Clinton's
acquittal in the impeachment trial will allow the president to
demonstrate his resolve to get on with the nation's business and
shift attention to pressing foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   But another part of the push for an announcement on Saturday was
the desire to strengthen the hand of Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright as she travels to Paris to meet with the five other
foreign ministers of the Contact Group overseeing the negotiations
at Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs something to put in her handbag'' to use as leverage
with the Serbian and Kosovo Albanian delegations, said one
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   If the current military plan is accepted by all parties as part
of a peace settlement, the United States will send 4,000 troops to
oversee a separate U.S. zone within Kosovo as part of Joint
Guardian, the proposed name of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current plan, Kosovo will be divided into zones
overseen by a 28,000-person peacekeeping force, which is
predominantly European, in contrast to the NATO-led force now
maintaining the armistice in Bosnia, which is dominated by
Americans. In Kosovo the British will supply 8,000 soldiers, the
French will send 5,000 and the United States and Germany will each
provide 4,000. Their mission will be to disarm the warring parties,
oversee troop withdrawal, remove heavy weapons and patrol the
province's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The operation as a whole will be under the NATO chain of
command. The U.S. zone will be especially ``high profile'' to
reassure ethnic Albanians, who throughout the discussions leading
to the peace talks have stressed that they will not trust any
settlement that does not call for a serious U.S. military presence
in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a clear American flag planted there,`` the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. forces to arrive would be the 24th Marine
Expeditionary Force, an amphibious group of 2,200 marines and
sailors now on ships in the Mediterranean Sea, which can reach
Kosovo quickly and immediately take over peacekeeping duties.
</P>
<P>
   The British believe they can have their troops in Kosovo by the
first week of March if a peace settlement is reached by the end of
next week. Britain's defense minister, George Robertson, said in an
interview last week that the British would send ahead the necessary
heavy equipment by ship toward Kosovo even without a final peace
settlement. These ships could leave as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to bring back the heavy armor once it's on
the high seas than to start late to meet an impossible deadline,''
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the diplomats negotiating the settlement and the military
officials planning how to carry it out have emphasized in the last
several days that the violence and the volatility of the Kosovo
conflict require NATO to arrive as quickly as possible with a
strong mandate to ensure peace immediately.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's very clear we have the authority to strike back at anyone
who violates the peace settlement,`` said an administration
official familiar with the current military section of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the operation will be NATO's Allied Rapid
Reaction Corps, headed by a British general, who is the likely
candidate to head the new peacekeeping mission. The Europeans have
said in the past week that the Kosovo mission would allow them to
demonstrate that they are capable of carrying the major burden of a
peacekeeping mission and ``strengthen the European pillar`` of the
alliance, as German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But as Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has repeatedly pointed
out, most of the ships and air support for the mission will be
supplied by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean will provide the naval
power and the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force in Aviano, Italy,
will be the base for the air power.

SNOWSHOES ALLOW ONE TO SAVOR WINTER THE SLOW WAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, N.H. _ We were tromping deep in the Cardigan State
Forest on our snowshoes, thinking all those big-woods thoughts,
like how much splendor there is in nature, how glorious are the
slender yellow birch trees, what grandeur there is in winter
silence.
</P>
<P>
   So what if snowshoeing is a humble sport lacking the cachet or
risk of downhill skiing? So what if we wore no trendy lift tickets
on our zippers, if the most momentous happening of the day had been
stumbling across a line of deer tracks in the snow?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Scott Smalley, the seasoned Appalachian Mountain Club
instructor who was teaching that day's ``Winter Ecology on
Snowshoes'' course, stopped in his showshoe tracks. His eyes were
wide, very wide. He pointed to an opening under some trees where,
not 40 feet away, an imposing tawny brown moose was snoozing in the
sun. When she heard us, she staggered sleepily to her hooves, and
stared at us, hard.
</P>
<P>
   She took a couple of steps toward us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, moose,'' Smalley said tremulously. ``We're just people,
moose.''
</P>
<P>
   The moose, blessedly, vamoosed. And for the rest of the day we
basked in our glorious moose story _ an extraordinary winter moment
that could be experienced only on those flat things you strap on
your feet in winter, because they can take you into deep snow,
off-trail, around trees _ all those hard-to-access places where
skiers dare not go.
</P>
<P>
   This maneuverability and adaptability is part of why snowshoeing
is a fast-growing winter sport. The National Sporting Goods
Association _ a trade group of
</P>
<P>
   retailers and manufacturers _ reports that 700,000 Americans
went snowshoeing in 1997, up from 400,000 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   At Eastern Mountain Sports in Boston, snowshoe sales have
``definitely doubled'' over the last year, said Edward Crossland, a
store manager.
</P>
<P>
   It's a surprising trend, he acknowledged, given the lack of snow
this winter in Massachusetts. Snowshoers have been forced to head
to New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine if they want to kick up some
powder.
</P>
<P>
   But Crossland and other enthusiasts say most snowshoers consider
traveling out of state a small price to pay for the sport's many
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, snowshoeing is easy. Ten steps and you feel, at a
minimum, competent. ``It's an instant-gratification thing,'' said
Crossland. ``You take your foot and stick it in and tighten the
straps and start walking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can walk, you can snowshoe,'' concurred Sheila Turner,
44, of Douglas. Turner, a teacher who is attending graduate school,
put on snowshoes for the first time in January while on an AMC-led
hike in New Hampshire. The next day, she took to the woods alone
and stayed out happily for hours.
</P>
<P>
   True, it is helpful to learn a few tricks, such as how to
gracefully get up if you happen to fall, and how to do a smooth,
balletlike kick turn. Still, ``it was much easier than I thought it
was going to be,'' said Turner, who also enjoys downhill and
cross-country skiing. ``I'm athletic, so I like to work _ it's fun
for me. But I was looking for something a little more tranquil,
that doesn't demand as much of me. Snowshoeing requires a minimal
amount of athletic ability.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this easy _ not in the days before the late
'80s, when snowshoes were made of wood with cowhide webbing and
long tails extending behind them. Back then, people had to walk
with their feet wide apart so they wouldn't trip by stepping on one
snowshoe with the other. And the early bindings were a cumbersome
system of straps that tended to slip off heels or come undone.
</P>
<P>
   But the new snowshoes have solved a lot of these problems _ even
if they would look pretty silly hanging crisscrossed over a
fireplace. Most of the snowshoes in sporting goods stores bear
little resemblance to their aesthetically pleasing forebears. Most
of them are narrower, eliminating the walk-like-a-duck syndrome,
and the frames are usually made of lightweight aluminum. Instead of
webbing, the so-called ``decks'' are solid and made of space-age
plastic, rubberlike Hypalon, or polyurethane-coated nylon. The
bindings have been improved to keep feet securely in place, and a
set of metal teeth, or crampons, keep the snowshoes clinging to
slopes that are steep.
</P>
<P>
   To snowshoers' delight, the shoes are also less expensive than
many other kinds of winter sporting equipment. ``A pair of
middle-of-the-road snowshoes might cost you around $180,'' said
Crossland of EMS, although there are many less-expensive varieties.
``A middle-of-the-road ski package is about $250.'' You can use the
same poles that you use for skiing, and any waterproof winter boots
will fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   And once you are out there, there is that hard-to-come-by
serendipity that appealed to Turner. ``When I went out, there was
freshly fallen snow, so it was really peaceful,'' she recalled.
There were no moose that day, but ``plenty of animal tracks. In one
particular area, it was almost like something you'd see in a
storybook. The hemlocks were all full of snow. The scene was so
close, and intimate and comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Appalachian Mountain Club offers a workshop, ``Winter
Ecology on Snowshoes,'' every Wednesday through March 31, 9:30 a.m.
to 4 p.m., at Cardigan Lodge, Alexandria, N.H., 603-744-8011.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a family snowshoe event Sunday, Feb. 21, 11 a.m.
at the Stratton Mountain Resort Nordic Center in Stratton Mountain,
Vt. There will be a free daylong snowshoe demonstration with guided
snowshoe tours, a kids' obstacle course, moonlight hike, and
5-kilometer snowshoe race. 802-297-2200.

WHEATLEY AND GIANTS NEVER GAINED GROUND 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., Ga.)   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Giants career of Tyrone Wheatley, which ended with his trade
to the Miami Dolphins Friday, was four years of contradictions. Day
after day, one paradox begot another.
</P>
<P>
   Two Giants coaching staffs were confused by Wheatley. What
unfolded was a complex conflict played out in the rigid framework
of a National Football League locker room. For coach and player,
the clash often seemed generational and cultural _ a disharmony of
ideals and approaches to a game and a vocation. When the coaches
changed, the discord did not.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it left Wheatley like a spare part in an orderly,
standardized operation; he was a first-round draft pick who could
not even get his coach to let him wear his uniform for games.
</P>
<P>
   ``An enigma, that's what they say about me,'' Wheatley said in
an interview at his suburban New Jersey home last year. ``It's not
clear cut why I didn't fit in. That's why I'm the enigma. People
can't figure me out.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Wheatley drifted deeper into Fassel's doghouse _ deeper
even than he was in the former coach Dan Reeves' multiroom doghouse
_ many NFL personnel thought they had it figured out. They assumed
Wheatley must be some irresponsible knucklehead, or an attitude
problem, at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley, who was traded to Miami for a seventh-round draft pick
in this year's draft, helped create this impression in his earliest
days with the Giants. As a rookie, in a very public misstep, he
fell asleep during one of Reeves' meetings. Wheatley said it
happened only once.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he was late for the treatment of injuries. Another
demerit.
</P>
<P>
   There was a problem at his house when his dogs got loose and
killed some neighborhood pet rabbits. An apology followed.
</P>
<P>
   The blemishes on Wheatley's public resume were gathering. Plus,
he kept getting hurt, and in his second season, when buried on
Reeves' bench, Wheatley acknowledged that he gave up on the season
after five games.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in his first season under Fassel, Wheatley had his best
training camp. Fassel seemed to be in his corner, but their
relationship soured when Rodney Hampton's knee gave out for good
and the rookie Tiki Barber _ a Fassel draft pick _ was named the
starting running back. Wheatley was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Coach and player were not on the same page since.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel repeatedly conceded that there were no discipline
problems with Wheatley _ no missed meetings, no dozing off.
Wheatley even played a significant role in two Giants victories on
the team's path to a 1997 division title.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Wheatley's teammates came to know more about the
mysterious, quiet running back who largely kept to himself in the
locker room. They discovered, for example, that Wheatley had moved
his teen-age brother, Leslie Mongo, from Detroit to New Jersey so
Leslie could live with Wheatley and his wife, Kimberly, and their
two young children. Wheatley wanted Leslie to attend better
schools, to be exposed to a different life and to leave behind the
unsettled neighborhood that Wheatley knew well from his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of calling home and being told: `Remember
Freddie?' He's dead,' '' said Wheatley, whose father was shot on a
Detroit street corner when Tyrone was 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley also shepherds two younger cousins, who come to New
Jersey frequently. ``I've been watching over them all my life,''
Wheatley, 27, said.
</P>
<P>
   But this determined self-reliance may have somehow come to
undermine Wheatley's efforts in the regimented, follow-the-rules
world of pro football.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1998 that Wheatley admitted that his football
worth was measured by more than how he did in games. He
acknowledged that he needed to conform in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does matter if you smile in the locker room,'' he said.
``You do have to run back to the huddle after a play in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wheatley's attempts at making his coaches content failed.
Privately, coaches said Wheatley talked about changing, but still
approached too much of his job _ like the team's off-season
conditioning program _ halfheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be in the weight room,'' one Giants coach said last
season. ``But he'd be in there talking to people who were lifting
and running on the treadmill. Yes, he attended, for one set of
repetitions when he was supposed to do three.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency and concentration became the catch words for
Fassel's and Reeves' problems with Wheatley.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley would explode around the end of the line for 15 yards
on one practice play, then tiptoe through the same play a minute
later for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   In Wheatley's mind, that's a net gain of 7.5 yards a play. Not
bad. ``Show me the results,'' Wheatley said once in an interview.
``That's how I was raised.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mind of a football coach, one who unquestionably was
raised to embrace a different brotherhood of ideals _ give 100
percent all the time _ there was a wasted play in the equation.
Worse, a play wasted for lack of effort. Few coaches can tolerate
that.
</P>
<P>
   So Wheatley sat on the bench, often out of uniform, even as the
Giants' front-office executives tried to nudge the head coach into
using Wheatley, even as some of his teammates angrily resented that
Wheatley did not get playing time last season. These same
executives and players now fear that Wheatley will come back to
haunt them as a star with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Day 1, it was a negative situation with the Giants,''
Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson said Friday. ``So it never improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fassel: ``We just didn't get Tyrone to play to his ability,
and that's the thing I regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley eagerly waits to start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be out of a stifling situation,'' he said. ``I
have my chance now.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what went wrong the past four years, Wheatley said,
``I don't know, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   An unanswered question, fittingly, for that is how Tyrone
Wheatley left the Giants. &QL;

 &HT;    Price announces retirement where it al started: Georgia Tech
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would not be a reach to consider Georgia Tech the
program that Mark Price built. At the very least, his arrival in
1983 and subsequent success in the Yellow Jackets' first years in
the ACC laid the foundation for coach Bobby Cremins to construct a
national power. So it was only right that on Friday, Price
announced the end of his basketball career at the place he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit back and think about playing in the NBA for 12 years,
and I can't believe it,'' Price said. ``Most people never thought
I'd last that long. Heck, I never thought I would.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only lasted a dozen seasons, but he flourished,
particularly early. He spent the first nine years in the NBA with
the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he made the all-star team four times
and first-team All-NBA once.
</P>
<P>
   But as the injuries piled up, Price's production went down. He
played the last three years with three different teams _ Golden
State, Washington and Orlando. It was that lack of stability that
signaled the end for Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to play one more (year) for a couple of teams,
but my wife is tired of moving around,'' said Price, who was cut by
Orlando in June. ``And so am I.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Price, who turns 35 Monday, retires as the NBA's
all-time best foul-shooter at 90.4 percent and with career averages
of 15.2 points and 6.7 assists per game. ``The thing about Mark was
that he moved as fast while dribbling a basketball as most guys did
without the ball,'' said Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens, who coached
Price in Cleveland. ``And few guys were as quick sideways as Mark,
which is important when it comes to getting open.''
</P>
<P>
   Future Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas said, ``That little guy became
the mouse that roared.''
</P>
<P>
   But injuries beat down Price. There was a major reconstructive
surgery on a knee, foot surgery, a broken wrist, broken fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days,'' he said, ``I still ache.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said he has no immediate plans. He is working as an
assistant coach at Duluth High. He and Laura are expecting their
fourth child next month. Other than that, Price is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure what I'm going to do next,'' said Price,
who scored 2,193 points at Tech and who holds the career record for
steals with 240. ``I'm doing some radio for Georgia Tech. I've
saved some money. Right now, we plan to stay in Atlanta and see how
things work out.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A dwindling band of moderates joined with a few
mavericks Friday to block the Republicans from an important victory
_ a simple majority in a chamber they control on one of its
most-watched votes in history.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Republicans broke ranks with their party on the two
impeachment articles against President Clinton. Five Northeastern
moderates voted to acquit him on both perjury and obstruction of
justice, while five conservatives voted to acquit him on perjury
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The renegade votes affirmed what had been obvious in the Senate
for years _ that a moderate brand of Republican still prevails in
the industrial, union-based Northeast, while conservatives hold
sway over the party across much of the rest of the nation. ``We
represent the mainstream Republican Party,'' Sen. Olympia Snowe of
Maine said Friday, a claim clearly open to challenge as one surveys
the influx of conservatives into the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Including Ms. Snowe, the five moderate senators were Susan
Collins, also of Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords
of Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The other five, who have no discernible common link, were Sens.
John Warner of Virginia, Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Richard Shelby
of Alabama, Slade Gorton of Washington and Ted Stevens of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Collins, who like the other moderates said the president's
offensive behavior did not rise to the level of impeachment, said
she anguished over her vote and had not slept for a week. ``I made
up my mind by Tuesday, or maybe Wednesday,'' she said. ``The days
all blur together. What day is today?''
</P>
<P>
   But the breakaway move by the Northeasterners surprised few
others. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said
he could have predicted back on Jan. 7 when the Senate trial
started that these five would vote to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Because of the states they represent and the news media
they receive, and their voting patterns are pretty clear,'' Lott
said. By ``news media,'' he seemed to suggest that they received
favorable coverage from what many perceive to be the liberal media.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other five, even Lott had little inkling. ``I was
surprised that a few of my people voted against the perjury
article,'' he said, adding that the only link he saw was an
appreciation for the finer points of the law. ``You know, if you
are a lawyer, a very studious lawyer, you could argue, well _ you
get into all the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the defectors issued statements, others did not. Shelby,
for example, said in a statement that because a guilty verdict
would have required the president's removal from office, the Senate
had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt. He said
the House managers met this burden on the charge of obstruction of
justice but not on perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Warner had a similar response: ``The evidence in Count 1 did not
measure up to the high standard of proof that is beyond a
reasonable doubt,'' he said.

 &HT;    Annual Atlanta flower show reaps bumper crop of green stars with
Disney topiaries
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pat Tuff just knew someday her prince would come.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of next week's Southeastern Flower Show had been
trying last year to come up with a major new attraction for
Atlanta's 12th annual horticultural extravaganza. After learning
that Boston's New England Spring Flower Show had landed a visit
from Walt Disney World's giant topiaries _ living green sculptures
in the form of Mickey, Minnie, Dopey and the whole gang _ ``the
seed was planted in my mind,'' she said. But because the exhibit
travels only once a year, she knew it was a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues thought it was a goofy idea. ``I had a lot of
doubters,'' said Tuff, who had no connections inside the Magic
Kingdom. Knowing sometimes it makes no difference who you are, she
could only, well, wish upon a star.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, enter her prince: ``Someone from Epcot walks
into our office while visiting last year's show to get some
information,'' she said, and once again, old Walt proved it's a
small world after all.
</P>
<P>
   Tuff and other show officials snagged an invitation to Orlando
for a guided tour of the Epcot International Flower and Garden
Festival, where the topiaries take center stage each April. And, in
a coup for Atlanta, Disney finally agreed to loan its exhibit for
this year's show.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the 16-character chlorophyll zoo trucks into town
for several days of ``dressing.'' And until Wednesday's opening of
the five-day show at City Hall East Exhibition Center, it's heigh
ho, heigh ho, off to work we go for dozens of workers and
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be phenomenal,'' said Doug Moody, director of
the Southeast's largest juried gardening event, which benefits the
nonprofit Atlanta Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The green zoo
</P>
<P>
   The big stars _ Snow White towers 10 feet and Goofy weighs in at
a svelte 2,000 pounds _ include Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald
Duck, Pluto, Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Piglet and Dopey.
Each is made of thousands of plants and flowers stuffed and pinned
onto sculpted metal forms covered with sphagnum moss. These guys
are so big that mondo grass is used to make their curly eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned: A few of the topiaries are mechanized, including a
tail-wagging Eeyore and twirling Hyacinth hippo. (Four ostriches
were supposed to deliver kicks, Rockettes style, but the birds are
battling a weight problem and won't be in shape for a chorus line
until the Epcot festival opens April 16. ``Right now, they just
kind of jerk,'' said Dan Higgins, a Disney spokesman.)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, consisting of four topiary gardens installed in a
specially designed modular facility set up outside the Midtown
auditorium, is a marketing bonanza because Disney's on-the-road
show is a relative rarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step and very expensive for us,'' Tuff said of
the production, expected to cost about $100,000 to transport,
install, maintain and secure.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers have set their sights on the flower show becoming
a national event, and that means constantly offering new draws
aimed at boosting attendance, which last year hit about 35,000.
This year, they're hoping crowds will swell to 40,000 and even more
the next, when the show moves to the larger Atlanta Exposition
Center near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Other new attractions
</P>
<P>
   Besides Disney, other attractions will include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An exhibit from the Philadelphia Flower Show of jewelry made
from dried plants. Artist Jane Kilduff will demonstrate the
technique, popular in Europe, during the show Wednesday. ``It takes
patience, but with enough imagination, you can transform a dried
pea into a seemingly cultured pearl,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An exhibit from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington of
an award-winning re-creation of the early 20th-century Pillsbury
Estate garden, Southways, in Minnesota. Its fountain and
furnishings are housed in artifact collections at the museum, which
developed the exhibit to increase awareness of its garden design
archives.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  35 garden exhibits, including 12 by metro area landscape
companies, which are always a crowd pleaser. Participants have been
given the show theme ``Salute to the Century _ A Farewell With
Flowers,'' and many have come up with nostalgic interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens are found in two competitive divisions _ landscape
and educational, or the ``Discovery Gardens.'' They and five other
divisions make up the 4.5-acre show: amateur garden design,
horticulture, artistic, professional and junior (under age 18). In
all, thousands of garden, plant and floral arrangement entries in
500 categories will be scrutinized by 220 judges from across the
country before the coveted ribbons are awarded.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, nationally-acclaimed experts will present more than
100 seminars and demonstrations on everything from pruning
techniques and trellis construction to landscaping health-care
facilities and designing the Atlanta Botanical Garden's new
children's garden. And to capitalize on the spring fever, there
will be a marketplace with more than 100 vendors selling garden
products.
</P>
<P>
   But what has organizers most excited is Disney. The topiaries
first appeared at Disney Land in California in 1963, and about 100
of them are showcased annually at the Epcot festival, said Renee
Worrell, a Disney horticulturist who has worked with the topiary
collection 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the topiaries were woody shrubs pruned into
sculptures until Disney decided several years ago to take the show
on the road and had to make them lighter weight. Now the pieces are
crafted from steel forms made of 5/8-inch Reebar covered in a
plastic mesh. The mesh is stuffed with sphagnum moss, which can
last about three to four years, Worrell said. Inside, a hardware
cage houses irrigation and mechanical systems.
</P>
<P>
   Workers use a dibble to plug plants, including baby's breath,
Joseph's coat, dwarf mondo grass, ficus, begonias, verbena and
marigolds, into the forms.
</P>
<P>
   Snow White's dress requires thousands of yellow and blue
carnations. Blue carnations? ``Blue is very challenging for us,''
Worrell said, ``so we have spray paint the carnations.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the topiary contain live plants, the pieces are being
transported in a temperature-controlled truck, maintained at 50
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, crews will begin installing the topiary gardens
according to four themes _ Winnie the Pooh, Snow White, Disney
Classic Characters and Fantasia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, workers, aided by some of the show's 2,000
volunteers, will ``dress'' the characters with clothing made of
some 6,000 top-quality carnations. ``We pop the head off each
flower and pin it to the moss, one by one,'' Worrell said. ``That's
when it gets really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   While adults, especially gardeners, marvel at the craftmanship,
she said, it's the kids who are bowled over by the exhibit. And
that's what show organizers are banking on _ to appeal to more
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll always get the flower aficionados and the garden clubs
to come out,'' Tuff said. ``But we're trying to broaden the public
understanding that this is not just a judged flower show but an
event that offers something for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And nature lovers would agree: Anything that exposes both adults
and children to gardening can't be such a dopey idea.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Snow White, at 10 feet tall, 7 feet wide, 7 feet deep and
weighing 1,100 pounds, is the show's biggest visitor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At 2,000 pounds, Goofy is also quite a monster.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It takes two crew members 14 hours to load or unload the
refrigerated topiary truck.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Minnie Mouse's outfit requires 325 red and 250 white
carnations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Fantasia Garden's four ostriches are adorned with 1,200
hot-pink carnations and 15 bunches of hot-pink mini-carnations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hyacinth hippo is so fat it takes four people 12 hours to get
her dressed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Supplies include 40 flower buckets and 15 pounds of floral
preserve.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Drugs, light combat SAD symptoms
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Growing up in Pennsylvania, Tamara Alexander remembers
how bad she began to feel around September each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd become lethargic and moody and tearful, and I'd have a lot
of temper tantrums, starting from the time I was 10,'' says
Alexander, now 28 and a secretary at Emory University. ``I spent
much of my adolescence thinking I'm just an unhappy person.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until she turned 23 that Alexander's boyfriend
suggested she might be suffering from seasonal affective disorder _
depression caused by a shortage of sunlight during the fall and
winter months.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist confirmed the diagnosis, prescribing the
antidepressant Prozac. Alexander also tried light therapy, spending
several hours a day in front of a specially designed box that gives
off a powerful exposure of full spectrum light to mimic natural
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Both therapies helped Alexander significantly, and they are the
only methods routinely prescribed to treat the disorder, which
afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Winter blues _ milder
seasonal depression _ affects another 14 million people. For
reasons not entirely clear, four times as many women suffer from
SAD and winter blues as men.
</P>
<P>
   But many people who have SAD symptoms also try alternative
remedies, or use them to supplement light therapy and
antidepressants. Some of those treatments show promise _ St. John's
wort, for instance _ but doctors urge caution when trying
alternative methods.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander says she's been helped by changing her diet and by
using aromatherapy oils at her Grant Park home _ she finds the
scent lavender especially effective. Relocation to Atlanta in 1994
also proved beneficial. In fact, these alternative methods have
worked so well for her that she has not needed antidepressants for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   People who truly have SAD, and not other depressive disorders
that might mimic it, usually start treatment with antidepressants
such as Prozac or Paxil and light box therapy, says psychiatrist
Jeffrey Kelsey, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral
sciences at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Other treatments that might help: monitoring what you eat and
drink and taking brisk outdoor walks during sunlight hours. And if
you can swing a winter vacation, go to someplace sunny, Kelsey
advises.
</P>
<P>
   As for over-the-counter products or herbs, use caution, he says.
``Often medications that treat anxiety can worsen depression,''
Kelsey says.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis O'Shields-Jones, an Augusta-based nutritionist,
herbalist and homeopath, agrees. ``Natural herbs can block the
effects of other medicines,'' she says. ``It's the responsibility
of the public to be informed and dig deeper than what they hear on
a 30-second news flash.''
</P>
<P>
   And a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, especially when
it comes to melatonin. This hormone, produced by the pineal gland
and released into the bloodstream each night, is thought to help
set the body's internal clock or biorhythms, affecting our reaction
to light and dark. Naturally, people might think it would be useful
to treat SAD.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Jacobs, a chiropractor and applied kinesiologist at
the Wellness Learning Center, says melatonin tablets to combat SAD
might be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people do not have a melatonin imbalance,'' he says. ``It
is a potent hormone, and all hormones are interconnected. Taking a
hormone that is not needed can adversely affect another system of
the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the herb St. John's wort for SAD might not help. It has
been used successfully to alleviate mild to moderate depression,
Kelsey says, but tremendous variability in quality has been found
among different brands, and ``there's no real data as applies to
SAD.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be soon. Emory is involved in a study with the
National Institutes of Health about the effectiveness of research
grade quality St. John's wort in treating SAD. Volunteers are
needed: Call 404-727-8968.

 &HT;    Determined Georgians bring lost chapter of WWII history to light
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    Article by Bill Hendrick / Illustrations by Walter Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Srvice
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between January and May of 1942, 82 American vessels hauling
badly needed war supplies were sunk by German submarines, often
close to the U.S. coast _ including six off Georgia and Florida.
Killed were hundreds of merchant seamen, civilians who didn't get
veteran status until 1988. This is the story of the Georgians who
solved the mystery of the SS Oklahoma and its unnamed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. _ As never-ending waves splash softly
over St. Simons' thin white beach, Don Robertson, 76, zips up his
windbreaker, peers toward the dark sea and remembers how it feels
to be out there, on an unarmed munitions ship, knowing that at any
second, ``you can just go `poof' _ right up in smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-merchant mariner came awfully close, in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean one night in 1942. His ship, the SS Susana _ its
holds crammed with explosives _ was torpedoed by a German U-boat,
and ``she went down in flames like a funeral pyre,'' he says. ``I
was petrified. Just terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, gesturing toward the horizon: ``I guess they were,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   They were the 38 men of the SS Oklahoma, an oil tanker that was
torpedoed by German U-boat 123 just off the coast of this resort
island in the wee hours of April 8, 1942. Nineteen merchant
mariners were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Four of them, who were burned beyond recognition and buried in
Brunswick's Palmetto Cemetery in graves marked ``Unknown seamen
_1942,'' have just been identified. Robertson's chapter of the
Propeller Club of the United States has just matched names to the
men and is raising funds to honor them with proper gravestones, a
monument and a marker in downtown Brunswick honoring all merchant
seamen. The club hopes to unveil at least the monument by National
Maritime Day on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something,'' he marvels to Michael P. Higgins, who
spearheaded the club's dogged, yearlong investigation. ``Imagine.
After all these years. So many died, and (the merchant marine)
never got the recognition we deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins has identified the four as Osswald Ryder, 21, of Ville
Platte, La.; Joseph Geary, 37, of Boston; Alfredo Carmona, 46, of
Puerto Rico; and Arthur Genter, 42, of Evansville, Ind. But he is
still far from satisfied. Now Higgins is trying to find any living
relatives who ``might take comfort in knowing their sons, husbands
or brothers'' received a decent burial and didn't just vanish into
the deep.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by his father's World War II heroism and newscaster Tom
Brokaw's book, ``The Greatest Generation,'' Higgins has become
intent on ``righting the wrongs'' dealt to merchant sailors during
the fighting and after.
</P>
<P>
   So is Robertson, who was only 19 when his ship went down. ``We
got shortchanged,'' he declares, ``like some of the Vietnam
veterans. Unlike the others, we weren't eligible for veterans'
benefits, the GI Bill, even a flag to cover our coffins or a plot
in a national cemetery. We weren't seen as real sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchant mariners were civilians, employed by companies hired by
the government to haul badly needed war supplies: oil, gasoline,
guns, food. Those who weren't too old to be drafted, or classified
as physically unfit, were exempt from the draft only while sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Though they were relatively few in number, the merchant mariners
faced the worst odds, says Higgins _ one out of every 32 who served
died, compared with one in every 34 Marines or one in 48 GIs _ and
they are considered by many experts to be a prime reason the Allies
won the war.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1988 that Congress granted the merchant
seamen of WWII _ more than 10 percent of whom were
African-Americans, serving on integrated crews _ the status of
military veterans. And then it applied only to those who sailed
between Dec. 7, 1941, and Dec. 15, 1945. Last Veterans Day,
President Clinton signed a measure extending the cutoff date to
Dec. 31, 1946, the same as that for those in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, an intense, 47-year-old former merchant seaman with two
college degrees and his own maritime business, says he was
inspired, and a little angered, by all the hoopla last year
surrounding the D-Day movie ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The film
didn't point out that hundreds of merchant ships were there too,
under fire, hauling Allied supplies and men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Vietnam, Korea, the Persian Gulf, and nobody said
anything,'' Higgins says. ``But TV never interviews mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   Identifying and honoring the SS Oklahoma's four unknown sailors,
says U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), who represents coastal
Georgia in Congress, is at least a step in the right direction.
``Though it's a small gesture in comparison to their sacrifice,''
he says, ``we are hopeful that the loved ones they left behind and
the family members they never lived to meet are soon shown this
appreciation from a grateful nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The SS Oklahoma was one of two merchant vessels that were sunk
on the morning of April 8, even though they were hugging the St.
Simons coast. The other was the Esso Baton Rouge. Both went down in
shallow water, their bows sticking out of the sea. Soon after the
blasts that sank them, several Coast Guard vessels and a boat owned
by Coca-Cola magnate Charles Candler, steered by his yacht captain,
rushed out to rescue any survivors.
</P>
<P>
   They found 19 from the Oklahoma, but couldn't reach that ship's
dead. Thirty-eight of the Baton Rouge's 41-man crew took to
lifeboats, and its three dead were accounted for. The ships were
raised and towed to a spot near the King and Prince Hotel, and the
bodies removed, on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something,`` says Edwin Fendig, 71, now a harbor pilot
and Propeller Club member. ``I had a rowboat and took people out to
the ships. The holes were gigantic. I went right through.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Jack Lang, 70, a Coca-Cola retiree who was rocked out of
bed in nearby Brunswick when the Oklahoma was struck: ``It was like
a sonic boom. It took several days for the oil to wash ashore, and
the whole place was awash in rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The unknowns were buried on April 26 in a funeral service
conducted by two clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   Unmuddying the waters
</P>
<P>
   Actually there were five of them, not four, and this initially
muddied the waters for Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Lozamae Dietzler of Eau Claire, Wis., tried to find out
what happened to her brother Charles Rivette, who had been
classified as missing and presumed dead since 1942. She called the
Coast Guard to see if it had ever updated his files. It hadn't.
Dietzler gave up until she heard about a man named Terrence Logan,
who ran a veterans' program at the University of Minnesota and
reportedly could cut through red tape. Logan agreed to help her,
says Dietzler, but he ran into ``nothing but stone walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Logan thought to call the Glynn County coroner's
office, because he knew the ship had been sunk off St. Simons.
Someone there vaguely recalled that five unidentified men from the
Oklahoma had been buried.
</P>
<P>
   So Logan simply put two and two together: Rivette had been on
the ship; he was never seen again after April 8; so he must lie
under one of the burial plaques. In 1979, Logan had the American
Legion place a marble marker bearing Rivette's name among the five
small plaques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great relief,'' says Dietzler, now 78. ``It made me
feel better to know he'd been buried on land.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rivette's marker only made Higgins more determined to find
out the names of the other four. His obsessive search was like
following a seed trail to nowhere, through a minefield of answering
machines with endless options and bureaucrats with no answers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Higgins lucked onto Bill Chubb, a retired Coast Guard
commander and now an executive of its National Maritime Center, who
soon became just as determined to solve the mystery. Three weeks
ago, after navigating through a maze of warehouses and old records,
Chubb found what he was looking for enough evidence to identify the
unknowns, including Rivette. He came across the ship's roster, the
list of survivors and known dead, and separate files on each
seaman. The folders contained personal information and photographs
_ but no hint that the Coast Guard was ever told that the five had
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests that recovering the bodies must have taken a
while,'' Chubb says. ``With so many merchant ships being sunk and
so many mariners lost, word of the weeks-later recovery of these
bodies may simply have been lost in the confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   A government cover-up?
</P>
<P>
   Higgins contends that the government was so deeply involved in
stemming panic along the coast that it lost sight of the needs of
individual families.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts of the St. Simons sinkings rocked islanders and
residents of nearby Brunswick, shattering glass, wrote Michael
Gannon in ``Operation Drumbeat,'' as far inland as 18 miles. The
sinkings not only brought the seemingly distant war close to home;
they helped wake up coastal communities, and President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, to the immediacy of the German threat during America's
darkest days of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, the U.S. fleet had been decimated at Pearl
Harbor. Headlines were telling of Americans fighting against
hopeless odds at Corregidor and Bataan. The public wasn't told much
about the coastal battle, and the official word, issued daily, was
a lie: ``Sighted sub, sunk same.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, few German subs were sighted, and only three were
sunk, between January and May 1942, when 82 U.S. merchant vessels
went down, often close to America's shoreline. After taking out
three merchant vessels off the Georgia coast in the spring of '42,
and three off the coast of Florida, the German U-boats moved much
farther out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins is determined to raise America's consciousness about
these ``unsung heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly anybody knew so many merchant seamen were dying,'' he
says. ``And nobody knew then _ or now _ how close the war came to
Georgia. We're trying to change that.''

 &HT;    German U-boat commander: Oklahoma was `a sitting duck'
 &HT;    EDs: Emnbargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. _ The sea was calm, Kapitanleutnant
Reinhard Hardegan recalls, when he spotted the SS Oklahoma sailing
slowly under a quarter moon within sight of St. Simons' faintly
glowing beaches 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights on shore were illuminated,`` Hardegan said recently
from his home in Bremen, Germany. ``She was a sitting duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Prowling on the surface in the wee hours of April 8, 1942,
Hardegan's submarine closed in on the unarmed tanker, laden with
4.4 million gallons of oil. At 500 yards, he gave the order to
attack. The torpedo struck the tanker in the engine room, and it
quickly sank in water 40 feet deep. Then Hardegan sped away toward
the nearby Esso Baton Rouge, sagging with its load of 3.8 million
gallons of heating oil, and sank it too.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen men aboard the Oklahoma were killed; three died on the
Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Sparing civilian lives
</P>
<P>
   It had been a good day for Hardegan, now 85, one of Germany's
top submarine aces, who sank 25 ships over the course of the war
and, oddly enough, was honored in America many years later. In
1990, for risking his life to avoid killing tourists who had
flocked to the beaches on April 11, 1942, the city of Jacksonville
welcomed him back as a respected guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was moonshine, how you say, moonlight,'' said Hardegan
of that night in 1942. ``There were lights on the shore. And many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bars were open. People were on the beaches. The U-boat commander
could even see a roller coaster, all lit up, and streams of car
headlights heading toward the shore.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid hitting civilians with shells _ often used to finish
off torpedoed vessels _ Hardegan says, ``I went between the coast
and the (SS Gulfamerica) so I could shoot in the direction of the
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost cost him his life. An American destroyer soon gave
chase and almost got his sub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was received by (the mayor of Jacksonville) in 1990,''
Hardegan said. ``The town was very friendly to me.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once, says historian Michael Gannon of the University
of Florida, Hardegan gave aid to survivors in lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the ex-sub commander went into the oil business,
said Gannon, author of ``Operation Drumbeat,'' which tells the
story of the East Coast carnage. He even worked for Texaco, which
had owned the SS Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   And Hardegan later became friends with Jack Lang, 70, now a
Coca-Cola retiree, who was 11 when the Oklahoma was hit. Lang said
that the last time he saw Hardegan, the German said, ``Enemies
yesterday, friends today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The WWII sinkings set off a wave of hysteria along the East
Coast, but it was months before a blackout was imposed. The Coast
Guard organized a horse patrol to look for saboteurs who might try
to land on the coast. (Some did, but most were quickly caught and
executed.) Still, rumors flew that Germans came ashore often to
meet spies, buy bread and even attend movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't sent over to see movies, but to sink ships,''
Hardegan laughed. ``I read once that a German sub was captured and
cinema tickets found. That's nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardegan says he was astonished that it took Washington so long
to order the lights off. ``Nearly all the time I saw the coast, the
lights were clear. And all the time I was on the surface, the water
was so shallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing with Hitler
</P>
<P>
   Once, Hardegan got into hot water at home, with none other than
Adolf Hitler himself. After receiving the Knight's Cross, the
German equivalent of the U.S. Medal of Honor, at a private dinner
with the Fuhrer, he questioned the German dictator's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `It would be better to have more air forces and
submarines, and fewer tanks,' '' Hardegan laughed. ``He was angry.
He said he knew better. I told him he looked too much to the land,
and he didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardegan was scolded, says Gannon, but replied that it was his
duty to offer his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a Nazi,'' Hardegan said. ``I did my duty for my
country, not for Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1945, the German submarine force was decimated. Of 39,000 men
who served, 27,491 were killed and 5,000 captured; of 863 U-boats,
754 were sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Now retired after a successful business career, Hardegan said
he's better known in America, thanks to Gannon's book, than in his
homeland. But he's still in the sinking business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I sink putts. Not ships.''

 &HT;    Price announces retirement where it al started: Georgia Tech
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would not be a reach to consider Georgia Tech the
program that Mark Price built. At the very least, his arrival in
1983 and subsequent success in the Yellow Jackets' first years in
the ACC laid the foundation for coach Bobby Cremins to construct a
national power. So it was only right that on Friday, Price
announced the end of his basketball career at the place he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit back and think about playing in the NBA for 12 years,
and I can't believe it,'' Price said. ``Most people never thought
I'd last that long. Heck, I never thought I would.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only lasted a dozen seasons, but he flourished,
particularly early. He spent the first nine years in the NBA with
the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he made the all-star team four times
and first-team All-NBA once.
</P>
<P>
   But as the injuries piled up, Price's production went down. He
played the last three years with three different teams _ Golden
State, Washington and Orlando. It was that lack of stability that
signaled the end for Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to play one more (year) for a couple of teams,
but my wife is tired of moving around,'' said Price, who was cut by
Orlando in June. ``And so am I.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Price, who turns 35 Monday, retires as the NBA's
all-time best foul-shooter at 90.4 percent and with career averages
of 15.2 points and 6.7 assists per game. ``The thing about Mark was
that he moved as fast while dribbling a basketball as most guys did
without the ball,'' said Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens, who coached
Price in Cleveland. ``And few guys were as quick sideways as Mark,
which is important when it comes to getting open.''
</P>
<P>
   Future Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas said, ``That little guy became
the mouse that roared.''
</P>
<P>
   But injuries beat down Price. There was a major reconstructive
surgery on a knee, foot surgery, a broken wrist, broken fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days,'' he said, ``I still ache.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said he has no immediate plans. He is working as an
assistant coach at Duluth High. He and Laura are expecting their
fourth child next month. Other than that, Price is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure what I'm going to do next,'' said Price,
who scored 2,193 points at Tech and who holds the career record for
steals with 240. ``I'm doing some radio for Georgia Tech. I've
saved some money. Right now, we plan to stay in Atlanta and see how
things work out.

 &HT;    Slumping Earnhardt still hungry
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ One look into Dale Earnhardt's weary
cobalt eyes last year, and his relief in winning his first Daytona
500 after 19 failed attempts was clear.
</P>
<P>
   But after Earnhardt predicted that finally winning NASCAR's
crown jewel would propel him to a record-setting eighth Winston Cup
points title, he failed to find victory lane again in his final 32
races.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, No. 6 on Winston Cup's all-time career victories list
with 71, finished last season with only five top-five finishes and
slipped to eighth in the points standings, his worst campaign since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that ``The Intimidator'' didn't have any intimidation
left. And some people wondered whether the fire was still burning
in the 47-year-old Earnhardt's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about racing,'' Earnhardt said. ``I'm not ready to
quit, but I'm not ready to sit here and run in the top 20 or
somewhere in the middle of the field. I want to go out and win, and
that will keep me going longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt enters Sunday's Daytona 500 with the monkey off his
back. Not only did last year's Daytona 500 victory end a miserable
19-year drought, but it also snapped his personal 59-race losing
streak, which dated to March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great to come down to Daytona and not be asked if you
think you can win it this year and (not have to) talk about all the
things that have gone wrong the last several years,'' Earnhardt
said. ``All that's behind us, but now they want to know how it
feels not to have that question asked. You can go along (now) and
bug Terry Labonte and Rusty Wallace and some of those other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other guys _ Labonte (no victories in 20 Daytona 500
starts), Wallace (0-for-16) and Mark Martin (0-for-14) _ haven't
won the biggest event in American auto racing, but all have more
Winston Cup victories in the past three seasons than Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Since he tied Richard Petty with his seventh points championship
in 1994, Earnhardt finished second in `95; fourth in `96; fifth in
`97 and eighth last year, only the second time he fell outside the
top five since 1985. Earnhardt's 15-year streak of at least one
victory per season ended in 1997, and his number of top-five and
top-10 finishes declined in each of the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Childress, who owns Earnhardt's black No. 3 Chevrolet
Monte Carlo, concedes that the team fell behind in technology last
season. Earnhardt's average starting position was 26th.
</P>
<P>
   There also was tension in the garage area after Earnhardt's
relationship with crew chief Larry McReynolds soured because of a
slow start. McReynolds led Earnhardt's crew in 1997 after spending
the previous season with Ernie Irvan.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, Childress replaced McReynolds with Kevin Hamlin,
the crew chief from his other team, Mike Skinner and the No. 31
Chevrolet. Earnhardt didn't win under Hamlin's direction last year,
but he finished 10th or better in three of the final four races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin and I just sort of had a better relationship or thought
process,'' Earnhardt said. ``We ended up talking about the same
things. We're comfortable with each other, and it just seems to
work better. I think as much of Larry as I always have, and I'm
comfortable with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin worked the final 20 races of last season with Earnhardt,
who says he spent more time in the shop during the offseason. After
a disappointing testing time at Daytona in January, in which
Earnhardt finished 30th out of 40 drivers at 190.130 mph, he
rebounded with a solid Speed Weeks performance.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt was 10th in last week's first-round qualifying, then
on Thursday won his 10th Gatorade 125-mile qualifying race in a row
to earn the fourth spot in the Winston Cup season-opener. Earnhardt
led the final 43 laps of the 50-lap race after passing rookie Tony
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   And he won after skipping some of the week's practice sessions
and making minimal changes to his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were confident all week,'' Earnhardt said. ``A lot of
people thought we were too confident, not practicing any more than
we did. (But) give me the equipment and give me the team in the
shape it needs to be, then we can win races, and we can win
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt enters Sunday's race in a position to join Petty (1973
and `74), Cale Yarborough (`83 and `84) and Sterling Marlin (`94
and `95) as the only back-to-back winners of the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to make the track wide, and he has a fast car all
the time,'' two-time Daytona 500 winner Dale Jarrett said. ``I
think he has to feel good about his chances on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt says he's still hungry for a record-setting eighth
points title, as well as another trip to Daytona's Victory Lane.
But he also says he knows that the end of his storied driving
career is near.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's contract with Childress ends after the 2000 season.
Although there are talks about renewing the deal, Earnhardt says it
won't happen unless he's competitive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to sit out there and run 20th,'' Childress
said. ``If we can be competitive and have a chance at the
championship and still win our share of the races, you could see
him race through 2001, for sure. Who knows after that?''
</P>
<P>
   Childress confirmed that he and Earnhardt already have had
discussions about who will take over the wheel of the No. 3
Chevrolet when that time comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever find a replacement,'' Childress said.
``We're going to put somebody else in there after he leaves. We are
looking at other drivers. Dale and I have already had two
conversations about who we'd like to see in the car when that time
comes. We've kicked three or four names around of different
drivers. . . . He wants to make sure we put the right person in the
car.''
</P>
<P>
   When Earnhardt does retire from driving, he won't walk away from
stock-car racing altogether. His company, Dale Earnhardt Inc. based
in Mooresville, N.C., owns the Winston Cup team of Steve Park and
Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s Busch Grand National team.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's teams are housed in a 100,000-plus-square-foot
facility in front of his home in Mooresville, dubbed ``The Garage
Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt says his retirement won't include a farewell tour in
which he drives his own car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll drive my own car,'' he said. ``When I
retire from racing, when Richard won't give me a new contract, that
will be it. We started together, and we're going to finish this
thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Earnhardt's goal is closing the gap between him and
two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Dale Earnhardt as well as anybody,'' Childress said.
``He is ready to go, and I see that desire to win. Neither one of
us (is) happy the way we are running lately. Maybe we've let him
down a little bit. We're trying to put our program back to where he
can do his job.''

 &HT;    Intimidator shows patience in IROC; crashes mar dash-series
event
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ This is turning out to be Dale Earnhardt's
week.
</P>
<P>
   A day after winning his tenth straight Twin 125-mile qualifying
race at Daytona International Speedway, Earnhardt used a last-lap
surge to take the first race in the International Race of Champions
(IROC) series.
</P>
<P>
   With Bobby Labonte's help, Earnhardt came from behind and passed
Mark Martin on the last lap of the 40-lap race. It was Earnhardt's
fifth IROC win at Daytona and eighth in the series that matches 12
champions in Winston Cup, Busch and Indy cars in identically
prepared cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting,'' Earnhardt said. ``When Bobby got in there
with us and we started working together, we came to the front. If
it wasn't for Bobby, we probably wouldn't have won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was second by just 0.107 of a second and Martin, who led
the most laps with 23, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   The field was reduced by four cars after eight laps. Eddie
Cheever brushed the wall, lost control and through a curtain of
smoke took out Dale Earnhardt Jr., Rusty Wallace and Jeff Burton.
Earnhardt said he was driving defensively early in the race. ``Call
it what you want, patient, cautious, finesse. It was a little bit
on the scared side at one point, to be honest with you. There was
just a little too much three- and four-wide racing at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ELDER TAKES DISCOUNT 200
</P>
<P>
   Christian Elder of Minneapolis won the Goody's Dash series
Discount Auto Parts 200 by surviving a race punctuated by three
major wrecks that sent four drivers to a hospital, two with broken
legs.
</P>
<P>
   There were three red flags that stopped the race for 57 minutes,
20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter Scott Weaver was to go undergo surgery at Halifax
Medical Center for an open fracture of the left tibia. George
Crenshaw was set for surgery at the same facility for a fracture of
the right femur. Danny Snell and Danny Bagwell were examined and
released.
</P>
<P>
   SPONSOR FOR NO. 90
</P>
<P>
   Veteran car owner Junie Donlavy picked up major sponsorship for
his No. 90 Ford when Larry Hedrick, whose No. 41 car didn't make
the field, negotiated a deal that will allow his sponsor, Kodiak
chewing tobacco, to be on the No. 90 car for this race.

ALTHOUGH `TRIPLE-A,' BGN SERIES MERITING MAJOR STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Dale Earnhardt won the season-opening
Busch Grand National series race seven times, including the last
five he entered.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip won it three times. Geoff Bodine won it twice.
Bobby Allison won in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that a Winston Cup regular winning the Busch race
was as common at Daytona International Raceway as Earnhardt winning
one of the Twin 125-mile qualifying races.
</P>
<P>
   But while some things stay the same _ Earnhardt won one of the
Twins on Thursday _ others change. The Busch regulars have closed
the gap on the Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition level has improved considerably,'' said
Winston Cup regular Jeff Burton, who runs a limited, 14-race Busch
schedule and qualified 11th for the BGN NAPA Auto Parts 300 today.
``It's hard to beat those guys anymore. They're real good at their
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win a Busch race, you've won a really big race. It's
a really tough series.''
</P>
<P>
   It might even be the best, most competitive racing series in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people consider Winston Cup the major league and
Busch Triple-A,'' said Todd Bodine, who has been a regular in both
series. ``You have to realistically look at it that way, but the
competition level in Busch Grand National is every bit as hard as
Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Busch series features a compelling defending champion in
Dale Earnhardt Jr., up-and-coming drivers like Matt Kenseth and
Casey Atwood, and sons and grandsons of NASCAR legends in Adam
Petty and Jason Jarrett. And this year, it has the added attraction
of Winston Cup star Jeff Gordon, who is running a five-race
schedule in a car owned by crew chief Ray Evernham and Gordon's
wife, Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is so good we have a three-time Winston Cup
champion \RGordon\S coming to race with us this year,'' two-time
Busch champion Randy LaJoie said. ``Does that say something? The
series is awesome. You go to places and hear people say `Hey, the
Busch race is better than the Cup race.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cup drivers have won at least one BGN event every year since
1992. But in the series itself, Earnhardt Jr. remains the man to
beat. He won the championship as a rookie last year and returns
with the same team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level that race team competed at last year, I don't see
'em letting down,'' said LaJoie, who won the championship in '96
and '97. ``If there is going to be a downside for them, I'm hoping
that they spread themselves too thin, because that same team is
going to do five Cup races. But as well-prepared as that race team
has been, I don't see it slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie, who starts on the outside of the first row today,
intends to challenge Earnhardt Jr. for the points title after
finishing fourth last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting fourth at the banquet didn't sit too good with me,''
he said. ``Especially when you've been at the head table.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth doesn't have as big a gap to close as LaJoie. He
finished 48 points behind Earnhardt Jr. last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can pick up our laps-led and we can get some more wins,
those are the two main things I'm looking for,'' he said. ``The
team wants to win a championship, and so do I. But the
championship, a lot of times, has to do with mechanical failures,
racing luck, accidents and things like that. My main goal is to
step up our competition level and to win more races.''

 &HT;    Billy Ray Cyrus is rebounding from his years of stagnation
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Surrounded by lights and mirrors in his
showroom-perfect bathroom, Billy Ray Cyrus reaches into a vanity
drawer and pulls out a Ziploc storage bag. It has a date scribbled
on it _ 4/20/98 _ and there's a clump of something dark inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is!'' he says, grinning, holding the plastic trophy in
front of him like a boy showing off a garter snake. ``A mess of
tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Mess is eastern Kentucky for ``lots of.'' Tail is
the country singer's famous ponytail, the long chestnut mane that
hung down the back of Cyrus' muscle shirt every time he sang and
wiggled and did that little Billy Ray strut to ``Achy Breaky
Heart,'' the song that made him an international star. The mane is
gone now, clipped off like Samson's hair, as the man who once sold
15 million records tries to change his image and pick his career up
out of the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Ray Cyrus is back, with a Top 10 country single (``Busy
Man''), a new album (``Shot Full of Love'') and a concert tour that
brings him to Atlanta's Tabernacle on Friday. Some are calling it a
comeback. But the 37-year-old entertainer hasn't forgotten what it
was like to feel the flip side of success, being cast out of the
industry that once embraced him: ``I was as high on the mountain as
you can go. Then I went all the way back down to the very bottom.
And that's lower than ever before, because you've had a taste of
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Cyrus _ a regionally popular bar singer in the
working-class triangle where Kentucky meets West Virginia and Ohio
_ became the biggest act in country music, possibly the world. That
was the year Mercury Records took a risk and released his single
``Achy Breaky Heart,'' a goofy novelty song that captured America's
attention like a musical Slinky. The tune, written by Don Von
Tress, was a monster hit almost immediately. Cyrus' debut album was
No. 1 on country charts for 18 weeks and No. 1 on pop charts for 17
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The immensely popular music video, shot in Cyrus' hometown of
Flatwoods, Ky., showed women screaming over the beefcake singer
like he was the second coming of Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Little girls twirled batons to the tune. Their mothers bought
crateloads of records and cut their sons' hair to look Camaro-cool
like Billy Ray. You couldn't flip on the TV without seeing Cyrus
dirty-dancing, as fans squealed and critics rolled their eyes.
``Achy Breaky Heart'' was record-counting agency BMI's
most-performed country song that year. Even the Chipmunks covered
it.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, promoters created a special dance to hype the
song, where guys and gals stood side by side and pushed their
tushes in sync with the tune's wanky guitar riff. The ``Achy
Breaky'' choreography launched the national line-dance craze,
jump-starting the growth of country music clubs in the early '90s,
shows such as ``Club Dance'' on the Nashville Network and (no
doubt) the sale of thousands of matching his-and-her western
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the songs on Cyrus' 9 million-selling debut
album, ``Some Gave All,'' were far different from ``Achy Breaky,''
he could never eclipse the tune that had branded him. Two years
later, after nearly nonstop touring, the attention began to wane.
Subsequent singles stiffed as country radio turned its back on the
Kentucky kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of radio people thought he was a joke and didn't
respect his music,'' says Johnny Gray, program director of Atlanta
country station WKHX-FM (Kicks 101.5). Music Row insiders in
Nashville, believing that Cyrus hadn't paid his dues, also gave him
the cold shoulder. ``They saw him as one-dimensional, like a
cartoon,'' says Luke Lewis, president of Mercury Records.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky qualities that once made Cyrus a star were becoming a
liability. His trademark coif _ short as a GI on top, long as an
Apache down the back _ became derisively known as ``the 615
haircut'' (615 is the area code for middle Tennessee). And men
hated the booty shaking. Says Nashville music historian Robert K.
Oermann, ``Men don't like male performers who appeal directly to
women. And men run the industry.'' Even fellow artists took
potshots. Travis Tritt got into a highly public spat with Cyrus
when he said, ``What we're going to have to do to be popular is get
into a wiggling contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Now six years after the ``Achy Breaky'' climb and crash, Cyrus
is finally coming to terms with what was both his gold mine and his
curse. ``Oh, I wouldn't trade it for nothin'. I'll sing it till the
day I die,'' he says, sitting at the table in his bright kitchen
overlooking a pool and daughter Miley's white cottage playhouse.
``But I took a hit for it. I was pretty much set aside. Had a few
stones throwed at me on the way out.''
</P>
<P>
   With his thick Appalachian accent, penchant for using double
negatives and earthy slang, Cyrus exudes boyish, backwoods
sincerity. At one moment he's riding around his farm in a black
4-by-4 chasing down his mutt dog; in the next breath, he goes into
a kind of bizarre prophet rap, tossing out mantras from
motivational writers such as Norman Vincent Peale and Napoleon
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but think that this guy is for real. Authentic.
He's so innocently unpretentious that, during the interview, he
looks up and asks sincerely, ``Want a bowl of Honeycomb?'' then
pours some of the cereal for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculed for being himself
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real quirky guy in a lot of ways, but it's not studied,
it's really natural,'' says Mercury's Lewis. ``I've been around
people who thought he was the biggest joke on the planet, but I
think it's a Jethro thing, a thing against Southerners. I take
offense at it. Just because somebody may not use the queen's
English correctly, it's assumed they must not be bright. But one of
the most refreshing things about him is he doesn't mind being open,
doesn't mind being goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunky Huck Finn personality is in complete contrast to
Cyrus' show-biz looks _ tousled dark hair, a nose lifted right off
a Greek statue, deeply tanned skin set off by a neon-blue silk
shirt. Many in Nashville think that's part of Cyrus' problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus says as he was so caught up in his ``Achy Breaky''
experience, he was clueless about the resentment growing over his
centerfold looks and out-of-the-box success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I knew I was in trouble when `Storm in the Heartland'
came out,'' he says of the single, sipping coffee as a brood of
little boys run in, all sporting 615 hair. ``It was a heavy-hitting
song that, if anybody else in the world would have cut it, it would
have been a No. 1 record and highly praised. That's when I really
started feeling the other edge, the double side of `Achy Breaky.' I
thought, `Uh-oh. Something's not right here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus fell into a deep depression. He retreated to his 500-acre
farm in Williamson County, a country gentleman's estate once owned
by the designer of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.
(Billy Ray believes the old man's ghost still haunts the place).
Cyrus bought the white-columned mansion three years after his
``Achy Breaky'' success. Before that, he had been living in a Chevy
Beretta. For six months, he spent most of his time with his family
(wife Tish, son Braison, 4, and daughter Destiny Hope, who is
called Miley, 5) and five dogs, ``thinking and praying.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent 1995 hiking to the top of a hill overlooking his
rolling Tennessee farmland. He'd sit for hours in a Native American
tepee a fan had sent him. He's quite superstitious, says he
believes in voices and spirits, and has decorated the site with
trinkets significant to him. He would often take his children up
there to play, and he recalls the day that Miley changed his
perspective on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We was sitting there watching the sunset. She said, `Daddy,
wouldn't it be nice to be like the grass? To feel the wind and the
sun?' You know, I thought, `That's a pretty good thing.' I had
forgotten what it was like to hear coyotes yapping, or to see a
wild turkey, or find an arrowhead. At that point, I'm like,
`Everything's all right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Cyrus began writing songs, driving each day to a
fellow songwriter's log cabin to put together demo tapes. The tunes
were very different from ``Achy Breaky'' and would become the 1996
album ``Trail of Tears.'' It wasn't a commercial success, but Cyrus
finally found what he was looking for _ critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first review that came out on it was Chet Flippo in
Billboard,'' he recalls. ``In bold letters, it said, `Billy Ray
Cyrus Deserves Respect.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the positive press, Cyrus sat down and had a
heart-to-heart with executives at Mercury, his label. They had
stuck with him through the backlash but felt strongly that it was
time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Conforming to new career
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, we are rebuilding a career,'' says Mercury
president Lewis. ``There was a lot of talk about reinventing
yourself. But he's very resistant to change. We not only wanted to
hear something new musically but wanted to see a different kind of
show. That's what we're witnessing right now. And he's taking a
risk, because some fans might miss the ponytail and the
butt-shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   With the label's encouragement, Cyrus went into his bathroom on
April 20, 1998, wrapped a towel around his neck and had his tail
snipped off. It was a moment of mixed emotions. He had essentially
created the mullet-hair look as a Kentucky boy in the mid-'80s.
``That guy you saw in that video with the hair and the tennis
shoes, that was me,'' he says. ``And I gotta say to this day, I
don't feel like I've changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Billy Ray who'll walk across the Tabernacle stage Friday
is different from the naive kid who winked and wiggled his way to
the top of the charts. Look for boots, not sneakers. And hair that
is blown dry and styled. Gone is the Sly Dog band, the
rough-and-tumble musicians who rose to the top with Cyrus.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Billy Ray is working within the system. The album
``Shot Full of Love,'' released in December, is produced by
Nashville institution Keith Stegall (Alan Jackson, Sammy Kershaw,
Terri Clark). He's backed by session musicians and singing other
people's songs. And it's working. But there's a bit of irony in
Cyrus' comeback. Nashville music historian Oermann says, ``I really
don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics have been so unjust. Here was a guy doing
everything critics say they want _ recording his own material,
using his own band, having his own sound. He wasn't a cookie-cutter
act. Yet he was vilified for singing lighthearted dance tunes.
Critics say they admire musicians who are individualists. And now
he's having success by conforming.''

   The ``click'' Billy Tubbs has been waiting all season to hear
resounded loud and clear Thursday night at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
Tonight against Colorado State, the Horned Frogs' coach finds out
if the switch _ and his team _ is still turned on.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, and it stays that way, then the Frogs will not only
dance into the NCAA Tournament in mid-March, depending on the draw,
they could have a chance to do some damage.

   If it's not, what a waste this season will have been, and the
Frogs will have no one to blame but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to live with the knowledge they waited until the
second week of February to get down-and-gritty serious about a
season that once held so much promise, and now, even with Thursday
night's 102-85 victory against Wyoming, still teeters precariously
on the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It's no shock the hand that flipped the switch for the Frogs
belonged to preseason All-American Lee Nailon. The surprise is it
took 23 games before it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon and senior guard Prince Fowler took matters into their
own hands on Monday, two days after the skidding Frogs' fourth
consecutive loss, calling a players-only, ``come-to-Jesus''
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon, to his teammates' amazement, did the preaching, and
without his normal, everything's-cool grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was time for ``me'' to say something,'' said
Nailon, who usually leaves the serious talking to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason it kind of surprised me is that we don't think
of him as being the serious type,'' guard Ryan Carroll said.
``Lee's very vocal, of course, but usually not in that way. I
thought he should have done it a long time ago. I'm glad he did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Nailon, who seriously contemplated submitting his name for
the NBA draft in June before deciding to return to TCU, told his
teammates was simple: Quit waiting on me to win games for you and
go out and do it yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meeting should have been held even before the year ever
started,'' Tubbs said. ``Players have to make a commitment, and it
appeared \RThursday\S night that a commitment was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's been the leadership on this team and
maybe that's coming forth with Lee and Prince now. Lee didn't
start, \Rbecause of an ankle injury\S but he was highly involved in
the game from the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   A team that thought it had already been playing hard, discovered
another, higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the intensity,'' Tubbs said, ``and there's a
difference in being able to feel it and just hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   The message might have sounded like something the coaches had
been preaching all year, but this time, Tubbs said, it came from
exactly the right two people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the two guys that the team looks up to,'' he said.
``Prince Fowler doesn't know anything but full speed, so it's not a
matter of him not giving you all he's got. But when you have a
little show of camaraderie, you're not only playing hard, you're
pulling for other guys to play, and hard, and you expect them to
play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon understands his culpability in the Frogs' four-game
losing streak. He lost his cool and was ejected less than a minute
into the Nevada-Las Vegas game, was suspended for a game as the
Frogs lost at Tulsa, played poorly at Rice and then sprained his
ankle down the stretch in a loss at home against SMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could have made a difference in all four games,''
Nailon said. ``Even the Rice game, I wasn't really on. I thought we
were going to go there and pull out a victory, and it didn't happen
that way. As a player, you do get frustrated because we lost four
in a row and I didn't feel like there was a lot I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there is a lot he can still do. It is up to Nailon and
Fowler, who had 16 assists against Wyoming, to sustain the fire
they ignited at a metal-melting temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs have five games remaining. All five are winnable.
Reality says 4-1 is pretty much a necessity for them to have a
chance to get where they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-1 finish likely puts them into the Western Athletic
Conference tournament in second place from the Mountain Division. A
couple of wins there, coupled with decent RPI and Sagarin ratings,
and they'll get their invitation to the big dance.
</P>
<P>
   Some people apparently thought it would come easy. Maybe now
they know better.

TENDER, HANDWRITTEN WORDS REVEAL THE ROMANCE BETWEEN LBJ AND LADY
BIRD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first time Claudia Alta Taylor met him, she
thought he was ``excessively thin but very, very good-looking with
lots of hair, quite black and wavy, and the most outspoken,
straightforward, determined young man'' she had ever met.
</P>
<P>
   It was during that first encounter in her girlfriend Gene
Lassater's office that the straightforward young man asked Miss
Taylor _ all her friends called her ``Lady Bird'' _ out for a date.
``I was uncertain whether I wanted to or not because I had a sort
of queer moth-in-the-flame feeling about this remarkable young
man.''
</P>
<P>
   But she met him for coffee the next morning at the Driskill
Hotel, and by the end of the day, Lyndon Baines Johnson asked her
to marry him. She didn't say yes. He was 26, she was 23 and they
hadn't known each other long. But she didn't say no, either.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Washington, to his job as a congressman's
aide, a few days later, she left Austin to go back to her family's
home in East Texas. They wrote to each other nearly every day for
the next 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five years later, five of their love letters have gone on
permanent display at the LBJ Library and Museum as part of a larger
exhibit devoted to Lady Bird Johnson's life. It is the first time
even biographers have had such an intimate look at the private
lives of two public people.
</P>
<P>
   The letters started in the early fall of 1934.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Nite
</P>
<P>
   Dearest _
</P>
<P>
   Whatever are you doing in room 1? I didn't know they had such a
number in hotels!''
</P>
<P>
   You know, love, its been quite several days since I've had a
letter from you! But I shan't fuss 'cause I think its plain silly
(besides presumptious) to fuss at someone you love _ and besides I
feel sure there'll be one for me tomoro morning when I go down!''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday I set out through the woods for Mrs. Fox's in the
quite early morning _ and came upon more beautiful little glades
and hollows in the woods. And finally emerged at a cornfield that
was practically covered with the bluest blue Morning Glories! ..
Mrs. Fox is a rich old lady _ granddaughter of a fine Southern
family and one of these professional ``old Southerners.'' She
heartily dislikes most everybody around here but happens to be
quite fond of me ... And she's one of the few people around here I
enjoy being with.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a gold colly dog who weighs a ton and who pounces upon
me every time I go over there. He nearly eats me up and I love him.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon, when I get up to Washington my brain will have reverted
to the idiot stage! (That's the 3 to 7 year old, isn't it?) 'Cause
I never use it for anything more exacting than the design I want
for my garden seat and the best material to upholster the chairs in
et cetera ad infinitum ... So I'm going to buy me two or three
up-to-the-minute books on economics or government or
what's-the-world-coming-to. And one good one on Russia, which I'm
very interested in and know nothing about. Do you ever have time to
read, lamb, and do you ever read this kind _ I mean have you any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   O, dear _ I do miss you so. But its not a completely unpleasant
feeling 'cause I can look forward to when I see you again! Write me
some more about this Thanksgiving idea. Are you seriously
considering it?
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon I took the films to be developed. If they're any
good I shall send you several. And when I go to Dallas Nov. 12 for
the API I shall have you a big, nice one made _ if you want me to!
I wouldn't here for the world. _ The Marshall photographer makes
people look like ogres ... Here are two little ones made in my
beloved Austin in the enchanting month of April.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight, my dearest. Please write me. I love you _ Bird
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   My dear;
</P>
<P>
   All day Sunday I waited for Monday and a letter from you.
Disappointed Monday I longed for Tuesday _ longed for a word from
you. The last mail has just been delivered _ now I will look
forward to getting a word from my love tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even have a picture to gaze at when I'm dreaming and
planning _ dreaming of you _ planning for you.
</P>
<P>
   Only one letter from Mother since my arrival. Her reference to
you _ altho' an unusual expression for her _ yet a gratifying one
to her first born. Destroy Mother's letter and write if you want
to. all my love _ Lyndon''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   After they met for coffee, he took her driving in the
countryside. She later told biographer Marie Smith, for her book,
``The President's Lady,'' this account of their first date:
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me all sorts of things that I thought were
extraordinarily direct for a first conversation _ his salary as
secretary to a Congressman, about how much insurance he had, his
ambitions, about all the members of his family. It was just as if
he was ready to give me a picture of his life and of what he might
be capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   They saw each other every day for the next few days. He
introduced her to his boss, and she introduced him to her father,
who lived near Marshall. He mailed her a photograph inscribed with
these words: ``For Bird, a lovely girl with ideals, principles,
intelligence and refinement from her sincere admirer.''
</P>
<P>
   She still wasn't sure about marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Nite
</P>
<P>
   Dear -
</P>
<P>
   This time last week you and I were riding along our way to
Marshall ... It seems ages _ and yet its so vividly remembered it
seems only an hour ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Delco has pftt (that's no word _ only one of Mr. Winchell's
expressions) _ so I'm sitting here by a kerosene lamp and a candle.
And feeling like one on the last outposts of civilization. When I
come up the stairs the lamp makes the queerest shadows in the
corners and I am very scared! .. (I wish for you more than ever
then).
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Today I discovered two of Mother's old carved stone flower
posts, muchly covered with dirt and accumulation of years of
debris. So I scrubbed them up until they're nice and new and now
I'm going to put soil in them and plant lavendar hyacinths and red
tulips! Its more fun making things look prettier and renovating old
things! Also I learn quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
   What courses are you taking, dear? And how long do you go to
school? And when do you study? And whenever do you play, Lyndon?
There isn't any time left for you to, you poor lamb. But I adore
you for being so ambitious and dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Laura was there when I talked to you last night. I, of course,
got there about a half hour ahead of time and we had a long talk
... the first time I've seen anyone besides Dorris since getting
home. She (Laura) was as thrilled as I over your call! (Nobody in
Marshall knows you can talk that far over the phone _ especially
just for fun and not business.)
</P>
<P>
   It was so darling to hear your voice, right up close. Also it
was nice because Saturday I was feeling quite low and then all of a
sudden I'd remember I had something to look forward to Sunday
night. And I would feel happy!
</P>
<P>
   Daddy expressed himself about you the other night and was I
surprised _ I mean because he is so seldom enthusiastic about any
of the young men I bring around. And he thinks very highly of you!
I surely was glad. He made several complimentary remarks, quite of
his own volition, and I just sat up there and grinned to myself.
</P>
<P>
   I must write Gene. And do you likewise, love, when you've ever
time! Goodnite, dear dear Lyndon.
</P>
<P>
   Bird''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday noon
</P>
<P>
   My dear Bird;
</P>
<P>
   This morning I'm ambitious, proud, energetic and very madly in
love with you. I want to see people _ want to walk thro' the
throngs _ want to do things with a drive. If I had a box I would
almost make a speech this minute. Plans, ideas, hopes _ I'm
bubbling over with them. For fear you might think me too conceited
I'll stop there but there is so much more guiding my pen this
morning than when I wrote you of my worry about this time last
week. You are apparently always so free from concern that when I
feel as I do this morning I think how cruel it was to even let you
know how despondent I felt last week.
</P>
<P>
   This morning I've written letters so freely. Just finished one
to Alice Wyatt. She will probably think I've reverted to the
eighteen year old stage but I could feel no restraint. Dictated all
of my mail in a jiffy, had coffee with Joe Railey's secretary, and
before lunch I've finished my day at the office. A letter from you
on the afternoon mail will make this day a perfect one.
</P>
<P>
   The postman brought me several interesting, stimulating letters
from friends in Texas. I wish you were here to sit on the arm of my
chair and read them over my shoulder. ...
</P>
<P>
   But darling, with all of the nice things coming at once _ I
haven't had a letter from you since Saturday _ it was written
Thursday. Not fussing just checking up on Uncle Sams efficient
postal service.
</P>
<P>
   When you write again tell me about Austin and your schooldays
there. Tell me about what you did _ when you studied and what you
had for entertainment _ and just how much a ``young man'' in law
school can have. Tell me you love me if you want to and if you
don't I'll believe you do anyway and keep on loving you every
minute and it may be ``completely''_ suggestions from loved ones
not withstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a big hug-kiss and the everlasting love of
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Baines
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   She put off his proposal for 11 weeks until one day, he returned
for a visit and made an ultimatum. ``We either get married now or
we never will. And if you say good-bye to me, it just proves to me
that you just don't love me enough to dare to. And I just can't
bear to go on and keep wondering if it will ever happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Nov. 17, 1934, the day they drove from Austin to San
Antonio, when she wrote to a friend, saying, ``Last night, Lyndon
and I committed matrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   She stayed married to him through a lifetime in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Lisa Royse said the letters are an unparalleled look
into a romance that endured the strife of a nation: the Civil
Rights Act, the Cold War, the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird saved their courtship letters long after the couple
left Washington and returned to Austin, keeping hers in the
envelopes in which she received them, until 1977, four years after
he died, when she gave them to the library and museum that bears
his name.
</P>
<P>
   The public heard pieces of them for the first time when actors
Helen Hayes and Kirk Douglas read excerpts aloud for a museum
celebration that year.
</P>
<P>
   The letters returned to the archives until last year, when
curators turned Lady Bird Johnson's office space into a gallery of
her life: displaying her White House china, a ball gown, her
humanitarian projects, her love letters and her haunting comment on
their life together.
</P>
<P>
   She once said, ``I think we were a whole lot better together
than we were separate.''

INCREASINGLY, PEOPLE IN CRISIS PUT THEIR FAITH IN CHRISTIAN
COUNSELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After 28 years of marriage, Susie and her
husband had run into trouble _ the kind that required professional
guidance if they hoped to reach the 30-year milestone.
</P>
<P>
   But asking for help was also difficult. And before Susie was
willing to accept help, she wanted assurance that there was someone
she could trust.
</P>
<P>
   At the Baptist church she attends, Susie was directed to
Christian Counseling Associates, a nine-center counseling practice
operated by Daren K. Martin. It was a place, she and her husband
were convinced, where their Christian values would play an active
part in healing their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really where our roots come from,'' she said. ``I
knew he (Martin) was someone who would have the same values and
would place emphasis on what was important.''
</P>
<P>
   Although by no means a new field, Christian counseling has grown
in prominence and practice, counselors say. Increasingly,
Christians _ even those who have not seen the inside of a sanctuary
in years _ are reaching to the Bible to help heal emotional
difficulties. In addition, Christians who are licensed counselors
are relying on the Bible to help people through trying times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people who pick us out of the phone book who haven't
been to church in 20 years and they are having marriage problems,''
said Martin, a counselor and president of Christian Counseling
Associates. ``They think, `These people are going to support my
marriage, rather than tell me to call it off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, helping others through tough times is a Christian
tradition as old as the Bible, said Ian F. Jones, an associate
professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort
Worth and counseling director of the school's Baptist Marriage &AMP;
Family Counseling Center.
</P>
<P>
   Though the mental health profession has often been considered a
realm of secular thinkers, the formal practice of counseling from a
Christian perspective has taken root and grown in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Christian counselors seek to incorporate clinical
techniques with Christian principles as they guide people through
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secular views focus on the self and, at best, the self in
relationship to others,'' Jones said. ``Christian counseling adds
that, ultimately, healing is found in relationship to God.''
</P>
<P>
   At Christian Counseling Associates, which has centers in cities
including Bedford, Fort Worth and Irving, Martin sees clients
seeking help with marriage and family problems as well as
depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there are varieties of Christians, there also are a
variety of approaches to Christian counseling, Jones said. There is
a pastoral model, or counseling from the person in the pulpit.
There are also counselors who rely entirely on the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some counselors integrate biblical teachings with
clinical approaches gleaned from research and graduate studies. But
these counselors often seek theological and biblical foundations
for their work, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about a superficial thing here in terms of,
`Take two Scriptures and call me in the morning,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a profession, Christian counseling has become more organized
in the past decade. Since 1991, the American Association of
Christian Counselors has grown from about 700 members to nearly
17,000, said the group's president, Tim Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attributes the association's growth to the desire of
Christian counselors to join a professional organization, Clinton
said. Churches also have begun to recognize modern stresses on
members and have become more receptive to counseling as a way to
heal problems.
</P>
<P>
   The field of psychiatry has also become more involved in
spirituality and its relationship to mental health, said George T.
Harding IV, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's
Committee on Religion and Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the earliest days of modern psychiatry, psychiatrists
looked down their noses at religion,'' Harding said. ``Today,
psychiatrists recognize that religion is a very important part of
people's lives and recognize that ignoring religion is to ignore a
very important part of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But the American Psychiatric Association also recognizes
boundaries between medicine and religious beliefs, Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we utilize all of our information and
that we keep the boundaries in sight, recognizing that when in
doubt, if the patient has come to me as a psychiatrist, then I need
to utilize all of the psychiatric know-how,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Through about 20 years of professional practice, Texas Stevens,
a private certified mental health counselor who contracts with the
Richland Hills Counseling Center, said he moved toward a more
``Christ-centered model of counseling.'' That means he uses
clinical principles to help people remove barriers so they can
communicate and cope with difficulties. He also incorporates
Scripture and prayer into Christian clients' sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are working with someone with an anxiety disorder, you
can sit there and quote Scripture all day, but that is not going to
help much,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   But when psychological principles collide with the Bible,
Stevens sticks to Scripture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of approach that Susie felt she could trust to
help with her marriage problems, she said. After a year of
Christian counseling and another year of keeping tabs on the
relationship by talking to Martin, Susie can say that her marriage
made it through 30 years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was really the saving aspect that pulled us back
together and helped us to unite and determine what was important,''
she said.

 &HT;    Kerry Earnhardt catching up to kin
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The Busch Grand National Series kicks off
today with the NAPA 300, the first race in a season that might be
called ``NASCAR: The Next Generation,'' because of all the sons
following their dad's tire tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Five offspring of current drivers are in the field headed by
pole-sitter Ken Schrader in the No. 15 Chevrolet: Bobby Hamilton
Jr.; Adam Petty; Jason Jarrett; and a pair of Earnhardts, defending
champion Dale Jr. and his stepbrother, Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. is known as ``Little E,'' which probably
makes Kerry ``Middle E.'' At 29, Kerry is Dale Sr.'s oldest son,
from his first marriage, and is five years older than Dale Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry Earnhardt is many years behind Junior in racing. He
was two when his parents divorced and he grew up as Kerry Key,
taking the name of his stepfather. He said he legally changed his
name to Earnhardt when he was 16.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry began racing in 1992 when he and his younger brother
bought a street stock car. A year later, he had eight top 10
finishes in 11 Goody's Dash Series races. In 1994, he made 26
starts in late-model competition in Hickory, N.C., with one top
five and seven top 10s and was rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Kerry Earnhardt raced against his younger brother and
his sister, Kelley, in late models.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when you had the fun times, you could get to them,
you could bump on 'em, just have a good time with it,'' he said.
``My sister never won but she raced real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he isn't the least bit jealous of Dale Jr.'s quick
success or the $10 million deal he signed to drive a car for
Budweiser in the future.

<P>
   ``I'm proud of him,'' Kerry said. ``He's come a long way in his
racing career.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry qualified 33rd for today's race, blew an engine in
practice on Wednesday and the replacement motor, he said, seems to
be better than the first. He might have a better car than Dale Jr.,
who qualified 16th but was one of eight drivers wrecking in
Friday's happy-hour practice. Jr. will have to go to a back-up car.
</P>
<P>
   Six other drivers will be going to back-ups for the race: Jeff
Burton, Dick Trickle, Chuck Bown, Glen Allen Jr., Todd Bodine and
Ted Musgrave.

 Windows Refund Day Momentum Builds  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Since its inception on an Internet bulletin board about three weeks
ago, the idea of a worldwide Windows Refund Day on Monday has
picked up steam.
</P>
<P>
   As many as several hundred people, mainly fans of an alternative
computer operating system called Linux, are expected to converge on
a Microsoft sales and marketing office in Foster City at high noon.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Linux say Microsoft's license agreement lets
customers who bought computers with Windows preinstalled to seek a
refund if they never used the software. Consumers can accept or
reject the agreement when they first turn on a new PC with Windows,
but Linux users bypass Windows and install their own software.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bennett, Microsoft's group product manager for Windows, said
refunds have to come from the PC-maker, not from Microsoft. ``It's
really not a Microsoft decision,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The rally has blossomed from a quiet demonstration into a
full-fledged media event, complete with a small parade and musical
entertainment by Severe Tire Damage, a local band whose musicians
are high-tech workers by day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Similar but smaller events are planned for Monday at other
Microsoft offices from New York to New Zealand. Organizers hope to
generate enough attention to make Microsoft chief executive Bill
Gates take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident there will be refunds paid or at least agreed to
be mailed,'' said Donald B. Marti, a San Francisco computer
consultant who has helped organize Refund Day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Microsoft, which does not give its employees Presidents Day
off as a holiday, will have staff members greet the demonstrators
as they would any other customer and ``help them understand what
they need to do,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this fundamentally is really a public relations activity
that is driven by Linux users to drive interest in their system,''
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Linux was developed by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds in 1991
and has been gaining fans who believe it works better than Windows,
which runs on 90 percent of the world's new PCs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Friday acquitted President William
Jefferson Clinton on two articles of impeachment, falling short of
even a majority vote on either of the charges against him, perjury
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   After a harrowing year of scandal and investigation, the
five-week-long Senate trial of the president _ only the second in
the 210-year history of the Republic _ came to a climax shortly
after noon when the roll calls began that would determine Clinton's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is respondent William Jefferson Clinton guilty or not
guilty?'' asked Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in his
gold-striped black robe. In a hushed chamber, with senators
standing one by one to pronounce Clinton guilty or not guilty, the
Senate rejected the charge of perjury 55-45, with ten Republicans
voting against conviction.
</P>
<P>
   It then split 50-50 on a second article accusing Clinton of
obstruction of justice in concealing his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. Five Republicans broke ranks on the obstruction of
justice charge. No Democrats voted to convict on either charge, and
it would have taken a dozen of them, and all 55 Republicans, to
reach the two-thirds majority of 67 senators required for
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist announced the acquittal of the nation's 42nd president
at 12:39 p.m. ``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said
William Jefferson Clinton be and he hereby is acquitted of the
charges in the said articles,'' he said. Almost immediately the
mood in the Senate lightened.
</P>
<P>
   As required by the Senate's impeachment rules, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was formally notified of the Senate's
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded by once again declaring himself ''profoundly
sorry'' for his actions and words that had thrown the nation into a
13-month ordeal. ``This can be and this must be a time of
reconciliation and renewal for America,'' he said in a brief
appearance in the White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the hopes of healing, the bitterness and turmoil of
the past months were underscored when the Senate side of the
Capitol had to be cleared by police because of a bomb scare,
shortly after the trial ended and just as senators had begun a
series of news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the bomb scare, the Senate, by a 56-43 vote,
rebuffed an effort by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to force a
vote before the day had ended on a censure measure that would
rebuke Clinton for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible''
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of those who chose to acquit Clinton on Friday
delivered stinging judgments of him while concluding that his
evasions and attempts to conceal a sexual relationship with a
former White House intern did not constitute the kind of high
crimes the nation's Founding Fathers had contemplated when they
wrote the impeachment clause of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In voting to acquit the president, I do so with grave
misgivings for I do not mean in any way to exonerate this man,''
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, one of the Republicans to break with
her party, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied under oath,'' she said. ``He sought to interfere with
the evidence; he tried to influence the testimony of key witnesses.
And while it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young
star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to smear in an attempt
to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Democrats who had stayed so staunchly at Clinton's
side throughout the impeachment saga warned grimly that he should
not see his acquittal as political vindication. ``This has been a
long, tortured trial,' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.C. ``There are
no winners. The president should take no solace from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who wanted to remove him from office were far
harsher, raising questions of how Clinton and the congressional
majority that pursued his impeachment will ever reconcile across
the remaining two years of Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, called Clinton a man ``with a
capacity to lie about anything.'' And Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, quoted the words of the great southern novelist,
William Faulkner, to make clear his profound distrust of Clinton.
``One of the sayings that's always guided my life is, `I will
witness your advent and judge of your sincerity,''' he told
reporters. ``I guess you could say, in a little bit more of a
Reagan way, trust and verify.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now the only impeachment trial of a president had taken
place in 1868 when Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by a single
vote. That trial left in its wake a weakened presidency and came to
be viewed over time as a partisan vendetta, a term many Democrats
applied to this case, too.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be up to historians to judge what happened in this
impeachment, the first one to be conducted under the independent
counsel law enacted after Watergate. For now, the impeachment drive
has left the Republican party at record lows in public opinion
polls, while Clinton has retained some of the higest job approval
ratings of his presidency. But many in both parties believe that
public opinion could shift with the passage of time, now that
Clinton is out of danger of removal.
</P>
<P>
   Far from ending the national ordeal, Friday's verdict is likely
to propel forward a new cultural and political debate in the 2000
elections over morality and the right to privacy, creating sharp
lines of demarcation between the political parties, which have seen
so many of their policy differences diluted in the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the signs of the emerging debate were visible Friday as
both sides tried to take stock and assess the meaning of a vote
that saw neither article even gain majority support.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and some Republicans argued that the votes signaled
that the House had erred in sending forth impeachment articles
against the will of the public and on a partisan vote in December.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Tate, the executive director of the Christian
Coalition, said the House prosecution, in defiance of public
opinion, ``will be seen by history as an example of true American
greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tate deplored Clinton's acquittal, saying that ``children now
have the lesson that lying, cheating and breaking the law are
permissible on the pathway to success.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to reach a majority, said Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., ``reflected quite clearly the weakness of the House
managers' case.'' He said, ``These articles should never have been
brought in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is weighing a presidential bid,
asked whether the many senators who were once prosecutors were
``not deeply disturbed by an independent counsel grilling a sitting
president of the United States about his personal sex life, based
on information from illegal phone recordings?''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the impeachment saga were planted five years ago
when Kenneth Starr was named independent counsel to investigate a
real estate deal known as Whitewater. In January 1998 the
investigation took a new tack to allegations that Clinton had had
an affair with an intern and induced her to submit a false
affidavit in the sexual harassment suit brought against him by Paul
Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition in the Paula Jones case taken on January 19,
1998, Clinton laid the groundwork for the impeachment case by
denying he had had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky and sitting
silently as his lawyer brandished her own false affidavit to
support him.
</P>
<P>
   In a finger-wagging televised appearance, Clinton denied to the
nation that he had ever had sexual relations with ``that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.'' And for almost eight months he steadfastly deceived
aides and the country alike about his relationship with the intern.
One aide told a grand jury that the president had called her a
``stalker.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in August, after it became known that Ms. Lewinsky had
saved a stained blue dress that provided irrefutable evidence of
their affair, did he tell a grand jury and the American public that
he had had an ``inappropriate relationship'' with the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   His belated and grudging confession did not stay the
prosecutors. On Sept. 9, catching lawmakers off-guard, Starr
delivered to Congress 36 boxes containing a report and supporting
evidence of what he called ``substantial and credible information''
that Clinton may have committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote that began the investigation that led to the
first impeachment proceedings since Watergate was 363-63,
bipartisan and overwhelming. But the House Judiciary Committee, one
of the most polarized panels in the House, split almost immediately
along party lines as the committee released the entire Starr
report. Soon all the intimate and lurid details of Clinton's affair
were available on the Internet, and the public could see the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes were heightened as each side looked toward the
midterm elections. Republicans lost five House seats, in a
repudiation thought to be partly a result of the focus on
investigation and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the election and determined to get the case over with
rapidly, the committee returned in lameduck session and approved
four articles of impeachment along party lines, accepting Starr's
case without ever calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In December, after an acrid and bitter debate, the House
narrowly approved two of the articles in near party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the trial on January 7, the Senate tried
assiduously to avoid the partisan bitterness of the House. Fearful
of public backlash, Senate Republicans forced the House prosecutors
to scale back their witness list to only three and allowed only
depositions to be taken. Democrats and many Republicans rebelled
against the idea of Ms. Lewinsky testifying in the well of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also insisted on keeping the Senate's final
deliberations behind closed doors. And for three days this week,
the senators debated in private.
</P>
<P>
   When the doors opened again Friday at noon, the exhausted
senators were openly longing to return to legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the hushed chamber, senators stood one after another to
pronounce Clinton guilty or not guilty. Some barely whispered their
verdict. Others shouted it out with emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   There was barely a stir at the moment when Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., cast the 34th vote of not guilty that guaranteed Clinton's
acquittal on the first count of perjury, or when Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., cast the vote that assured his acquittal on the second
count. But a low murmer broke out toward the end of the first roll
call when the declaration of ``not guilty'' by Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., brought to ten the number of Republicans who broke with
their party on the charge of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial ended, and Lott bid farewell to Rehnquist, the
relief was palpable. ``I would like to close with our traditional
Mississippi parting: Y'all come back soon,'' the majority leader
told the chief justice. He quickly added as laughter broke out,
``But I hope that's not taken the wrong way. And not for an
occasion like this one.''

 Voice Mail Users Get Message From God  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A doomsday voice mail message predicting the end of the world
greeted some Pacific Bell customers yesterday morning after a
caller accidentally sent a message to some voice mailbox customers
in the 650 area code.
</P>
<P>
   A woman, reading from the Book of Revelation, recorded herself
and then sent the message at 3:01 a.m. to an undisclosed number of
voice mailboxes in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials said the woman inadvertently accessed the
voice mailboxes by punching in a wrong numeric code on the voice
mail system. The message was sent to fewer than 1 percent of Pac
Bell voice mail customers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Pac Bell, said the customer
meant to send the message to people she knew, but instead sent her
apocalyptic diatribe to random people in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said Pac Bell, which received calls from concerned
customers about the message, was upgrading its system so the
problem could not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred because Pac Bell's voice mail system allows users to
set up a distribution list of friends and family in order to send
group messages simultaneously to several people.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people who are on a baseball team together could
set up an account that allows them to send the same voice mail
message to the whole team announcing the game time.
</P>
<P>
   Customers enter a list of telephone numbers they want to include
in their group and are assigned a code. Each time they want to
record a message for that group, they must enter the code for
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said the woman ``inadvertently got access to a group
that was not her own. It was human error.'' She said the woman
probably misdialed her code.

NEW FORD WINDSTAR IS FAMILY-FRIENDLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Ford Windstar just might be the most family-friendly car
ever built.
</P>
<P>
   A team of more than 30 moms worked along with Ford's product
engineers to design the 1999 Windstar, which represents a complete
update of the minivan that Ford introduced four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This new Windstar is chock full of safety and convenience
features that moms and dads have been wishing for on their minivans
for years.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, there are sliding doors on both sides.
Although Ford was among the last of the minivan makers to add the
sliding door on the driver's side of the vehicle, it's a feature
that no family would want to do without once experiencing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has gone a step farther and offered dual electric-powered
sliding doors on both sides of the vehicle, and the doors can be
opened and closed separately or together by pressing buttons on the
tiny remote control hooked to the keyring.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has offered a passenger-side power sliding door
on its minivans for several years, but only Ford and Honda offer
the power option on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   A reverse-sensing system (a $245 option) uses four ultrasonic
beams in the rear bumper to let the driver know if there are
objects in the vehicle's path while backing up. It works from a
range of 6 feet down to 10 inches, emitting a beep inside the
vehicle that increases in frequency as the vehicle gets closer to
the object. At 10 inches, the tone is steady.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great feature for parallel parking or backing up in
mall parking lots; it will even detect pedestrians in the vehicle's
path. As long as the vehicle is moving slowly _ which is how you
should be backing up _ you can keep from hitting anything if you
pay attention to the warning tones.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Windstar is the first vehicle with available head and
chest side-impact air bags for the driver and front passenger (a
$390 option). The air bags are mounted into the sides of the seats.
These and other standard safety features earned the new Windstar
the federal government's top ratings in crash protection from side
impacts.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever gotten out of your car and accidentally locked
your keys inside _ perhaps even with a baby strapped into an infant
carrier in the back seat _ you'll appreciate the Windstar's new
``Smartlock'' system.
</P>
<P>
   If the key is in the ignition and you use the button to lock all
of the doors, this system automatically unlocks the driver's door.
I've seen frantic moms take the nearest heavy object and smash out
the driver's window to get into a locked vehicle with their small
children inside.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other features the moms designed into the
Windstar:
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping-baby lights. This eliminates having the bright dome
light shine in the child's face when the doors are opened. Instead,
soft footlights come on.
</P>
<P>
   Conversation mirror. This allows the driver to watch children in
the back seats without turning around.
</P>
<P>
   Personal audio controls for backseat passengers, including
headphone jacks and volume controls. The kids can listen to their
music while Mom and Dad listen to something different up front, and
with the headphones, the kids can turn it up as loud as they want
without disturbing everyone else, including sleeping babies.
</P>
<P>
   A storage bin under the radio, designed to hold diapers.
</P>
<P>
   A second-row seat that can be moved left or right to create a
walk-through space on either side to get to the third seat.
</P>
<P>
   And a large 26-gallon fuel tank that allows Mom to drive all
week without refueling, so Dad can take care of that on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle was the seven-passenger SEL Wagon model (base
price $30,415, plus $580 transportation). It comes with leather
seats and the dual electric sliding doors, which are an $800 option
on lower-priced Windstar models.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features on the SEL Wagon include the
200-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine; four-wheel antilock brakes;
four-speed automatic transmission; power windows/door locks/heated
mirrors; tilt steering wheel; cruise control; remote keyless entry;
second-generation depowered front air bags; roof rack; rear
defroster; 16-inch machined aluminum wheels; cornering lamps;
air-conditioning with auxiliary unit for rear passengers; power
passenger seat; air-filtration system; and numerous storage areas
and cupholders.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $31,630, which reflected a $1,070 discount on
options. Our vehicle included the reverse-sensing system and side
air bags, as well as a four-way power driver's seat as options.
</P>
<P>
   Ride is very smooth and carlike, and the 3.8-liter engine
provides plenty of acceleration for freeway merges and passing,
even with a full load of kids and stuff. The base engine in the
Windstar is a 3.0-liter V-6 rated at 150 horsepower, but the
3.8-liter is obviously the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   Road-handling is rather sporty for a van. Sure, it's no coupe or
sports car, but it handles surprisingly well in curves and turns.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the 3.8-liter engine are 17 miles
per gallon in the city and 23 mpg on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The Windstar has one of the cleanest-burning gasoline engines on
the road, qualifying it as a low-emissions vehicle (LEV). Emissions
are 70 percent below the maximum allowed by EPA standards, Ford
says.
</P>

&HT;        CLINTON ACQUITTED: SPECTER VOTES NOT GUILTY, SANTORUM VOTES
GUILTY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 12, -- With Sen. Rick Santorum voting
``guilty'' and Sen. Arlen Specter voting ``not guilty,'' President
Clinton won acquittal Friday in the Senate's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the perjury and obstruction of justice charges
failed to get the two-thirds majority needed for conviction, ending
a year-long national drama that threatened to force Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, R-Pa., was one of ten Republicans who broke ranks and
voted not guilty on the perjury charge, which got a vote of 55-45
against. He was among only five Republicans who voted ``not
guilty'' on the obstruction of justice charge which failed 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   A more conservative Republican, Santorum, had not announced his
intentions before the vote, but was expected to vote ``guilty.'' He
said his reelection bid in 2000 did not affect his decision on the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Santorum took an opportunity to denounce
Clinton's behavior. But in the end he deferred to the Senate's
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum called Clinton's behavior in the eruption of the
scandal surrounding his relationship with then-White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, ``frightening for a chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you vote to remove a president from office, you have to
do so because it is in the public's best interest,'' Santorum said.
``I think that was the case in his ability to face a serious crisis
in the future and ask the people to trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said, because the Senate acquitted him, he would give
Clinton the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``One side of this debate was wrong today,'' Santorum said. ``I
hope it wasn't the side that won.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he prayed every day for wisdom about how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, I wanted to get this right,''
Santorum said ``For me, I got the guidance I needed to make my
decision. I pray what the Senate did today was the right thing for
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter was the only senator to expand on a guilty or not guilty
verdict on each charge, by saying ``not proved, therefore not
guilty,'' when casting his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the Senate for hindering the impeachment managers'
ability to prove the charges by not allowing live witness
testimony, Specter called the trial a ``sham'' trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Specter surprised many of his colleagues by
announcing his intentions to vote that the charges against Clinton
were ``not proven.'' Citing Scottish law, Specter said a juror has
three options for a verdict: guilty, not guilty, or not proven.
</P>
<P>
   But, while he said Wednesday he intended to record his vote as
``present'' and didn't want his vote recorded in the ``not guilty''
column, he said Friday he had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that because I wasn't even sure if a present vote was
allowed,'' Specter said. ``Also I did that to avoid all the
dialogue and questions that would have followed. My true feeling
was recorded by what I said when I voted.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he did keep abreast of public opinion polls
throughout the trial. ``You can't ignore them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In voting to acquit on both articles, Specter was joined by four
other Northeastern Republicans -- Sens. John Chafee of Rhode
Island, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The additional five, who voted to acquit on the perjury charge
were: Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Slade Gorton of Washington,
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Warner of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   One Pennsylvania political observer said Specter's vote was
``lawyerly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Wrabley, a professor at University of Pittsburgh's Johnstown
campus, said he did not think Specter's vote would be received well
by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Senators looked for a way to please everyone,''
Wrabley said. ``I think Specter found a way to please no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he didn't consider public opinion polls when he
made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the charge was true and it rose to the level of high
crimes and misdemeanors, were his only considerations, Santorum
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled mightily with the perjury charge because there was
not a specific enough construction of it,'' Santorum said. ``But I
believe it occurred. Lying in front of a federal grand jury that is
investigating you is the worst kind of lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he worried about the message the verdict sent to
the public about how justice works for the powerful and affluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are O.J. Simpson or the President, and you can hire top
lawyers, you can win,'' Santorum said. ``We have dealt a blow to
justice and democracy. It has not been ruined, but we have taken a
chip out of it.''

BONDS TUMBLE ON INTEREST RATE FEARS, STOCKS FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices dropped sharply Friday, pushing interest
rates to their highest levels since last August. The selling was
triggered by growing fears that rising yields in Japan will attract
investors away from the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in interest rates also helped push stock prices lower.
Higher interest rates can lure investors away from stocks and cause
those who stay there to worry more about the high price of
equities. So with investors already worrying if the sharp run-up in
stocks since last October can continue with the slower earnings
growth of the last two quarters, Friday's interest rate surge made
the market's outlook worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a major shock in the bond market and stocks don't
usually ignore that,'' said Byron R. Wien, U.S. investment
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``When you get to 20
percent overvalued, you usually get into trouble,'' he said of the
stock market, adding that his overvaluation measure was now nearing
18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, which closed early ahead of the Presidents'
Day holiday Monday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped
to 5.42 percent, its highest since Aug. 26, from the 5.30 percent
yield of the new 30-year bond auctioned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But more important for investors than the absolute level of
interest rates was that the yield on the 30-year bond and other
Treasury securities broke through the top of a trading range that
had lasted since Nov. 6, when the yield on the 30-year bond was
5.39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With more and more signs that the economy is not slowing down as
forecast by many economists, ``you can't rule out yields going
higher,'' said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, global chief economist at
Salomon Smith Barney. And, he said, ``the higher yields go, the
more they highlight the vulnerability of the equity market.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wall street, stocks gave up most of the gains they had made
on Thursday when the Nasdaq index leaped 96 points in its biggest
one-day point gain ever. Technology stocks were the culprits again,
as Dell Computer, down 12, to 89~; Microsoft, off 5, to 157};
Intel, down 6}, to 126{; and Cisco Systems, off 5 13/16, to 99
1/16, helped lead the broader market lower. Earnings concerns
undermined Dell's price as an analyst from BancBoston Robertson
Stephens said Dell's fourth-quarter sales would slow sharply. Dell
is to report earnings next week.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks also took a beating, led by Excite, Realnetworks
and At Home. In the first six trading days of this year, Internet
stocks, as measured by The Street.com's Net index, jumped 44.7
percent. Since then, the sector has lost 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of smaller companies have also suffered recently, after a
strong rally since last fall. The Russell index of 2,000
smaller-company stocks rose 40 percent from early October to the
second week in January. But since then, the index has fallen 8
percent. And the Russell index is the only one of the four majors
that has not surpassed its 1998 high.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Nasdaq index fell 83.66 points, or 3.5 percent,
to 2,321.89 and is off 2.2 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which is light on technology
stocks, fell 88.57 points, or 1 percent, to 9,274.89. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks, which includes some of the big-name
technology stocks, dropped 23.91, or 1.9 percent, to 1,230.13. The
Russell index fell 7.72 points, or 1.9 percent, to 398.44. For the
week, the Dow was off 0.3 percent, the S&AMP;P 500 0.7 percent and the
Russell 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 have now been trapped in a trading range
for a month, taking sharp swings up and down but going nowhere. The
Russell has been falling since the beginning of February. The
Nasdaq has been selling off for a few weeks, but is still up 5.9
percent for the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The major political news of the day, the acquittal of President
Clinton, seemed to have no effect, analysts said, although the fall
in bond prices accelerated after the two votes. Instead, it was
disappointment that a move by the Bank of Japan to stimulate
economic growth there did not go far enough and, therefore, would
allow Japanese interest rates to move higher.
</P>
<P>
   What the Bank of Japan announced was a cut in a key lending rate
to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent. But the central bank's
announcement also showed that it would not buy any more Japanese
government bonds, a move that would both help to lower interest
rates and increase the nation's money supply. Both steps,
economists said, would stimulate Japanese growth much more than the
simple rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   For bond investors, however, the decision not to buy more bonds
was a signal that Japanese interest rates could continue to climb
and draw investors away from the American bond market. Since
October, the yield on 10-year Japanese bonds has jumped to 2
percent from 0.7 percent. While still lower than comparable
American rates, the Japanese yields are drawing Japanese investors
back home.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenholtz and Wien said that other factors were also
undermining the bond market. One is that investors may be switching
their views on Federal Reserve interest rate policy. They began
this year expecting the Fed to cut its interest rate target as the
economy slowed. Now they are wondering if the next Fed move will be
a rate increase if the economy keeps moving along at last year's
3.9 percent pace.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that growth around the rest of the world may
be bottoming, rather than continuing to decline. If that is the
case, renewed buying of American exports could keep the economy
growing too rapidly. Schoenholtz said that business confidence
indicators in Europe have begun to trough and that there are some
signs of revival in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that even if interest rates move higher, they
should begin to decline again later this year. One reason is that
inflation will remain low. The other, he said, is that he believes
higher interest rates will undermine the stock market. A stagnant
or declining stock market will, in turn, slow consumer spending.
And that would put the brakes on the economy, allowing interest
rates to fall again.

<P>
   Since last October, when the current stock market rally began,
equity investors have set caution aside. They have a ``buy now''
mentality, based on their belief that the future will prove them
right, and they prefer to ignore risks rather than chance missing a
big rally. Sharp selloffs just re-enforce that behavior; after all,
the downturns have regularly been followed by rapid recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The high-yield bond market, however, has been behaving
differently. Investors there have decided to put a healthy dose of
risk back into their buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and early 1998, junk-bond investors were dismissing
risk, just as their stock-buying brethren did, as they rushed to
buy anything with a higher yield. They routinely ignored
differences in credit quality, a fact that worried the chairman of
the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Russian ruble devaluation and bond default last
year, risk popped back on the junk-bond radar screen, and the
market did not bounce right back, as the stock market did.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the spread, or difference, between the yield on a
10-year junk bond issued by Arcadia Financial and the comparable
Treasury note dropped to 5.85 percentage points last June.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the difference in credit quality, the spread was not
that wide, compared with the 3.05-point spread on a 10-year LTV
Corp. junk bond over the Treasury. LTV, a steel manufacturer, is
rated BB by Standard &AMP; Poor's, two notches higher than the B rating
of Arcadia, an automobile loan-servicing company.
</P>
<P>
   But since the autumn selloff, the pricing of Arcadia and LTV
bonds has returned to more normal levels; a risk differential has
been restored. At the low for the high-yield market in October,
Arcadia was trading at a 14.58 percentage-point spread over
Treasuries while the LTV spread was at 5.47 points.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Arcadia spread is at 10.97, still more than two and a
half times the 4.02 for LTV, according to data from KDP Investment
Advisors in Montpelier, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman D. Penniman, the president of KDP, says investor caution
means that there are still opportunities in high-yield bonds,
despite the rally so far this year. His high-yield index is now
4.51 percentage points over the 10-year Treasury note, down from
6.25 points in October. But it is still above the 3.54-point
average since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Two concerns have been holding back the high-yield bond market:
investor worries about the strength of the economy and the fear of
another global financial scare that would send investors running
for cover in the United States Treasury market while every other
bond market is sold off.
</P>
<P>
   Penniman says that with 1999 economic growth looking stronger,
the bigger restraint on the market is the fear of more global
shocks. But since he expects this fear to wane, he adds that ``it's
a great time to be in high yield.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey A. Koch, portfolio manager of the Strong High Yield
fund &UR; ,  &LR; also sees opportunities in what he calls the middle tier of
the high-yield market. These are the bonds, like those of Grove
Worldwide, a crane manufacturer, and B.F. Saul REIT, which has an
80 percent stake in Chevy Chase Savings Bank, that were of decent
credit quality but were sold off sharply in the fall and have not
rebounded fully. He said the return of a premium for risk was
making high yield attractive again.
</P>
<P>
   He is not sure, however, that everything is lined up for a great
year. ``Something like Brazil is going to happen,'' he said. ``Or
the economy will slow. Or new issuance will be so big that spreads
will have to widen out. I think we will get a lot of periods of
volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a way to deal with this volatility, he said. An
investor can pick a promising company and stick with the bond; if
the investor doesn't sell, the price fluctuations won't make a big
difference over the long term. As Koch put it: ``Stay invested and
get the coupon.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining question is whether the pause last week in the
stock market _ with a 3.4 percent selloff in the NASDAQ, this
year's best-performing stock index _ is a sign that equity
investors may be beginning to see the risks that high-yield
investors have taken for granted since last fall.

ONGOING INVESTIGATION THREATENING STARR'S REPUTATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's wide-ranging, ongoing investigation
of President Clinton has failed to snare the chief executive but is
beginning to entangle the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's reputation for fairness, honed in the 1980s when he was
a federal judge and then a top government lawyer, has been called
into question at the same time the Senate has acquitted Clinton of
impeachment charges that the independent counsel first raised in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is asking Starr, a Texas native who was
in the running for a Supreme Court vacancy nine years ago, to
explain methods he used during his investigation. In addition, a
federal judge is examining whether Starr violated the privacy of
grand jury witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to threatening Starr's reputation, his controversial
five-year investigation at a cost of more than $40 million might
sound the death knell for the 1978 independent counsel law. The law
will expire at the end of June unless Congress renews it. At the
very least, lawmakers appear poised to amend the statute to reign
in the broad authority of independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who served as former President Bush's solicitor general,
disgusted many Americans in September when he submitted a 453-page
report to Congress that contained lewd details of Clinton's
extramarital affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Starr alleged in the report that Clinton committed 11 impeachable
offenses in trying to conceal his dalliances with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John G. Roberts Jr., who served as Starr's deputy in
the solicitor general's office, disputed the rap against his former
boss. If Starr's good name has been tarnished, Roberts contended,
it is the fault of outspoken Clinton defenders who have
inappropriately cast the independent counsel as the source of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation began with a relatively mundane inquiry
into Clinton's alleged improprieties in a failed Arkansas land deal
known as Whitewater. But it expanded to include an examination of
whether the president broke the law in trying to keep his White
House tryst secret.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's allegations that Clinton lied to a federal grand jury
and obstructed justice in trying to conceal the affair were based
on Lewinsky's testimony. Lewinsky spoke before a federal grand jury
_ and later to House prosecutors during the Senate trial _ after
reaching an agreement with Starr immunizing her from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has asked Starr to respond to allegations
that his office broke agency rules by offering Lewinsky an immunity
deal in January 1998, without her attorney present. That offer fell
through, but Lewinsky, with attorneys by her side, accepted a later
promise of immunity before she testified.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's acquittal of Clinton has not ended the president's
potential legal trouble in the Lewinsky scandal. Starr could
theoretically seek a criminal indictment against Clinton while he
is in the White House, as the Supreme Court has never considered
the question of whether the Constitution prohibits a sitting
president from being indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he disagrees with Starr's detractors who believe
the independent counsel, a seasoned advocate before the high court,
would relish the chance to help the justices answer that
constitutional question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken has had the opportunity to argue enough momentous cases,''
said Roberts, himself an appellate attorney who argues regularly
before the high court. ``I don't think he's looking for the
opportunity to argue another one.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Starr is continuing to investigate whether the
president committed perjury when he told a jury he knew nothing
about fraudulent loans that helped fund Whitewater, an Ozarks land
deal in which Clinton and his wife, Hillary, were partners. The
Whitewater investigation led to the 1996 fraud conviction of former
Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and two Clinton partners in the
enterprise, James McDougal and his ex-wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater was not part of Starr's report to Congress, in large
part because the prosecutor said he could not corroborate the
claims against Clinton. But Starr continues to examine what if
anything Clinton, then Arkansas governor, knew of a fraudulent
$300,000 federally backed Small Business Administration loan to
Susan McDougal that was was used in part to underwrite Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel statute, Starr , who has been on
the job since 1994, can remain a thorn in the president's side even
after Clinton leaves office. But the law, and Starr's
investigation, might not survive beyond June.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans, in a rare example of bipartisanship
in the Clinton scandal, almost certainly will not renew the law in
its current form and might not even rescue the act before it
expires.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the independent counsel statute, such as Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas, say it gives prosecutors unbridled authority,
an unlimited budget and no time limit in which to investigate an
individual. Supporters of the statute as written call the law an
effective safeguard against wrongdoing by executive-branch
officials, illegal activity that the attorney general _ herself an
agency head _ cannot investigate due to conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will soon hold hearings regarding
whether Congress should renew, amend or abolish the law. Jackson
Lee, a committee member, said she is leaning toward letting the
statute expire, noting that investigations of high federal
officials were adequately conducted by executive-branch attorneys
prior to the independent counsel act.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a fellow member of the judiciary
panel, said he will consider proposals to improve the law _ but not
to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of the law was to not have a Department of
Justice investigate its own administration,'' Smith said. ``There
needs to be some vehicle for independent investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, however, is not immune to oversight.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson is investigating
whether Starr illegally leaked confidential grand jury testimony to
reporters in the Lewinsky matter. Johnson has asked Starr, who
served briefly on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington
before becoming solicitor general, to show that he did not violate
the federal rules against disclosure.

A RUSSIAN SOAP OPERA: THE TYCOON TAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Berezovsky has always been the most brazen, the
most quoted and the most visible of Russia's new tycoons _ all
reasons why he also seemed to be the most influential.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the math whiz-auto dealer-financier extraordinaire _
reportedly one of the richest, and certainly one of the most
reviled men in Russia _ also became the most overheard.
</P>
<P>
   A Moscow newspaper printed verbatim transcripts of his telephone
conversations with President Boris Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana
Dyachenko, with a top television news anchor and a with former
government official. Reportedly, he taped the conversations over
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The recorded conversations, published by the newspaper Moskovsky
Komsomolets as part of a monthlong campaign against Berezovsky,
show the inner workings of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It tracks the 53-year-old master intriguer as he tries to lobby
the president's 33-year-old daughter for a tax amnesty, plant and
inflate information damaging to a business rival on the evening
news and order up a campaign to browbeat members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the Russian public _ already hooked on
television soap operas _ has watched one unfolding about the
highest echelons of power.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the president of Aeroflot airline, who is the husband of
Yeltsin's daughter Lena, declared open war on Berezovsky, his
onetime benefactor. And the president's other daughter, Tatyana, is
slowly being dragged out of Berezovsky's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Tatyana Borisovna is our ally, not our opponent,'' said
Alexander Khinshtein, the Moskovsky Komsomolets reporter and author
of the articles who has sources deep inside the anti-Berezovsky
camp. ``I think she made a decision recently which comes down to
one thing: to put as much distance as possible between herself and
Berezovsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes described as a modern-day Rasputin, Berezovsky has
long been the subject of rumors about his hold on Yeltsin, his
wife, Naina, and their two daughters, as their financial adviser
and the keeper of their financial secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The published transcripts come one week after offices connected
to Berezovsky's various businesses were raided by federal agents
looking, among other things, for evidence of a Berezovsky
eavesdropping operation aimed at his associates, his rivals and
members of the Yeltsin family.
</P>
<P>
   Khinshtein says the tapes published Friday were not among those
seized by the police last week, nor among those taken from Atoll,
Berezovsky's private security agency, during a raid last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Khinshtein said they definitely had come from the Atoll
archives, which he said had been distributed in offices and
apartments around Moscow. He said he would hand the cassettes to
prosecutors next week.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the Interfax news agency Friday night,
Berezovsky reacted defensively to the latest disclosures, which he
dismissed as a ``well-planned provocation by the intelligence
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign against Berezovsky seems to have originated
at the hand of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has made no
secret of his antipathy to his chief rival for influence over
Yeltsin and his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Although physically feeble and politically damaged, Yeltsin
remains Russia's chief political protagonist as long as the
constitution allows him to unseat the Cabinet and disband
Parliament. It is Yeltsin's lingering power that makes the affairs
of his family _ or The Family, as they are popularly called _ so
important for Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, a behind-the-scenes intriguer who manages to turn
his benefactors into his dependents, has become the symbol of
Russia's unscrupulous, runaway capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career as a systems analyst and in the early 1990s
was able to turn a quick and huge profit at Russia's biggest
automobile manufacturing plant by selling cars bound for export on
the domestic market. His empire gradually expanded to include ORT,
Russia's largest television channel; Aeroflot; the oil company
Sibneft, and a host of other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other so-called oligarchs, Berezovsky is not a banker,
although he had interests in banks, but rather an operator and
financier who buys influence, directly or indirectly, through
politicians, bureaucrats and the media.
</P>
<P>
   `'His know-how has always been very simple,'' said Andrei
Piontkovsky, a political analyst. ``If you want to get control of a
company, you don't need to buy the company. You just need to buy
the management.''
</P>
<P>
   As bits of his empire are chipped away, Berezovsky's once
unassailable position has weakened, exposing his own tenuous
financial positions as well as his fading political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ORT, the television channel that was one of Berezovsky's first
prizes, is now virtually bankrupt. And Valery Okulov, the husband
of Yeltsin's daughter Lena, took a long-simmering conflict with
Berezovsky out into the open when he dismissed two longtime
Berezovsky associates from Aeroflot and helped start an
investigation of a Swiss company, half owned by Berezovsky, that
had been the repository of Aeroflot's hard-currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As Khinshtein pointed out in his article Friday, the
conversations show how Berezovsky is able to change personalities,
switching from polite niceties to the crudest cynicism, depending
on his listener.
</P>
<P>
   He called Tatyana Dyachenko by affectionate nicknames like Tanya
and Tan, brusquely ordered up news items with Sergei Dorenko, a top
television anchor and, using vulgar language, told Igor
Shabdurasulov, a top government official who later became the head
of ORT, how to go about negotiating with balking legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever others want, and whatever is profitable for him,''
wrote Khinshtein. ``Berezovsky knows how to change masks.''

U.S. SAYS JAPAN, BRAZIL DUMPED STEEL; PENALTIES PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va.)  (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration ruled Friday that Japan
and Brazil had illegally dumped steel in the United States at
prices as much as 70 percent below normal, and said that it would
impose enormous penalty tariffs on their products to protect the
jobs of American steelworkers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling from the Commerce Department came after a
considerable battle within the administration over how to handle
the complaints of steel companies and the politically powerful
steelworkers' union. While the Commerce Department and the office
of the U.S. trade representative advocated strong action, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and others in the administration have argued
that the United States should not appear to be closing its doors to
foreign goods, especially as Asia and Latin America are trying to
use exports to ease their financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Actions against ``dumped'' products are always a mix of economic
and political calculation, and Friday's announcement was no
exception. Russian steel, which American steelmakers complain has
also been sold here at illegally low prices, was temporarily
exempted from the ruling. In a gesture to Moscow, the Commerce
Department said that it would continue its investigation into
Russia's practices through the middle of next week, while it
negotiated an agreement that could allow Russia to export steel to
the United States in limited amounts, at set prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important that we not cut off one of the few
sources of raising hard currency that the Russians have right
now,'' one of President Clinton's top economic advisers said.
``There's a very delicate balance between protecting our industry
and not worsening a crisis in Russia that is clearly getting
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action covers only hot-rolled steel. Technically, it
would not go into effect until a final ruling is issued in 75 days.
But final rulings rarely vary much from preliminary rulings _ which
is what were released _ and Commerce Secretary William Daley has
already invoked a special provision of the trade laws that permits
him to invoke the duties retroactively, to November.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the administration's calculation in acting Friday was to
head off a movement in Congress to impose quotas on imported steel.
Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., is one of several lawmakers
from steel-producing states who have advocated such limits. Friday,
shortly after voting to acquit the president on both impeachment
charges, Rockefeller said that the ruling represented ``only a
small step toward stopping the flood of cheap imports.''
</P>
<P>
   The steel dispute may provide something of an early test of
Clinton's persuasive abilities in a post-impeachment Congress. He
is now deeply indebted to Democratic lawmakers, who have tended to
take a far more protectionist view of dealing with imports than
Clinton has. ``He owes these guys a lot,'' one White House aide
noted recently, ``and they are going to come looking for his
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley said the administration opposed quotas, and he insisted
that its quick ruling on dumping showed that it was prepared to
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think now we're on top of this,'' he said. ``The dumping
margins we've found are substantial, and if they hold up in the
final ruling, which we expect they will, it will substantially
reduce imports.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, recent statistics show that steel imports from Japan
and Brazil are already on the decline, a sign that both countries
are reacting to considerable political pressure from the United
States. Some of that has been encouraged by Vice President Al Gore,
who, administration officials say, has taken an intense interest in
an issue that clearly will be an election issue in steel-producing
states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The announcement Friday afternoon came too late for reaction
from the Japanese government, which has long argued that exchange
rates and depressed commodity prices worldwide, not unfair pricing,
account for the flood of low-cost Japanese hot-rolled steel. But
the Japan Steel Information Center, financed by the Japanese steel
industry, said that the dumping charges were ``unjustified,
ill-considered and counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, David Phelps, executive director of the
American Institute for International Steel, which is financed by
importers and exporters of foreign-produced steel, contended that
the ``domestic steel industry has abused this process to protect
its market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to pay these kinds of duties,'' he said,
arguing that the reduction in steel imports ``has already taken
place.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Friday's rulings, importers of Japanese and
Brazilian steel will have to pay deposits or post bonds on their
steel imports to the U.S. Customs Service. Full payment of duties
would not begin until a final ruling is made on April 28. The
antidumping margins calculated by the Commerce Department _ in
essence, the difference between the cost of producing and shipping
the steel and the price at which it was sold _ ranged from 25.14
percent to 67.59 percent for Japanese producers, and 50.66 percent
to 71.02 percent for Brazilian producers.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the higher duties on Japanese goods are an easy
sell in the Clinton administration. But the Treasury Deartment is
clearly worried about Brazil, which is still negotiating with the
International Monetary Fund on amendments to the country's
financial bailout plan, which collapsed in January.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is an even more sensitive issue in Washington. With the
Russian economy headed steadily down, the administration clearly
did not want to be blamed for worsening unemployment in Russia's
steel centers. It is able to negotiate an agreement with Russia on
all its steel products because Russia is not yet a member of the
World Trade Organization, which has strict rules on bilateral side
deals to set limits and prices on trade of any kind. Brazil and
Japan are members, and so cannot negotiate similar deals.

 &HT;    Poll shows support for new Texas Constitution
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While most were aware that education is a top
priority that Texans want their Legislature to address, there was
surprise at how many supported a rewrite of the state constitution
in a recent Texas Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, a random survey of 1,001 adults conducted statewide in
late January and early February, found almost half of respondents
considered constitutional revision very or somewhat important. The
poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of pleasantly surprised,'' said state Sen. Bill
Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant), who helped draft a reworked
constitution for consideration this year. ``I thought the people of
Texas generally understood the need for a new constitution. But
that margin shows greater understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed respondents attached importance to managing
the state's budget surplus, open government issues, utility
deregulation, paying for education, procedures for commuting death
sentences and ending social promotion for schoolchildren who
otherwise would not be eligible to pass a grade.
</P>
<P>
   The poll said 49 percent of survey respondents gave priority to
consideration of a new constitution, 41 percent gave it little or
no priority and 10 percent were not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and state
Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, head of the equally powerful House
Appropriations Committee, together proposed a slimmed-down
alternative constitution last month.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Pete Laney appointed a special committee to
consider the constitutional revision, a signal that it may be a
sleeper issue in a session without new and divisive issues so far.

MAJORITY LEADER DELIVERS ACID COMMENTS ON CLINTON`S CHARACTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, denounced
President Clinton's conduct and character on Friday and called into
question the ability of the two political leaders and their parties
to work together in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   In his most extensive public remarks since the Senate
impeachment trial began, Lott told a small group of reporters that
while Clinton had escaped conviction, the story might still yield a
postscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I say now what I said in closed session?'' he asked an
aide. When the aide mumbled assent, Lott hemmed and hawed and then
finally continued: ``Let me just say that at various points along
the way the last few days, I have referred to this sordid saga that
we have been through as being only one chapter in our national
nightmare. I fear that this sordid saga is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who had all these things in his background,''
Lott said of earlier accounts of Clinton's infidelity, ``and he did
it again, in the neighborhood of the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were making a prediction of further misconduct by
the president, Lott said: ``It's not a prediction. It's a fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott added that he was no longer sure he could trust the
president. He had no answer to the question of whether he any
longer had respect for him. ``I don't think it serves any good
purpose for me to talk about that,'' the majority leader said.
</P>
<P>
   His acid assessment suggested that while Republicans were coming
out of the impeachment ordeal without the verdict that most of them
had wanted _ and with opinion polls portraying them at odds with
most Americans _ they had not been cowed in the least.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lott said confidently that it was Democrats who would
have more to worry about as time went by and Americans looked back
at the trial. ``This thing may bounce in a way that's different
from conventional wisdom,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   While that remark carried the ring of either wishful thinking or
artful spin, it also reflected a conviction among some Republicans
that their stance during impeachment might have some long-term
benefit by casting them as people of conscience willing to buck the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a broad silver lining in any cloud from this whole
thing, I think if nothing else, the American people got a chance to
meet and see political leaders who will stand for conscience and
principle and not for polls,'' said Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., who
was one of the 13 House prosecutors at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., one of the Republican senators who
rendered two guilty votes on Friday, voiced a similar theme after
he left the chamber, saying that while polls were not irrelevant,
``I don't accept that they're determinative, that we should simply
do what the polls say.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lott had kept his comments relatively sparse during the
trial, on Friday he took off his suit jacket, leaned back in a
chair and, for about 45 minutes, ranged over a variety of topics
related to the trial. The hard line he took toward the president
might well have been his attempt to answer criticism from the right
that he did not facilitate a more forceful prosecution.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His tone was consistently chatty, but the mood he projected
turned downright snide when he referred to what he considered
Clinton's lack of contrition. He cited a report earlier this week
that Clinton had vowed to punish Republicans for their prosecution
of him by working harder than ever to help elect more Democrats to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound like reconciliation,'' Lott said. ``That
sounds like revenge and politics. Then he says, `You can trust me
on Social Security.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Lott said, his voice oozing sarcasm. ``Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he was quoting a fellow Mississippian, William
Faulkner, and addressing Clinton in absentia, Lott said, ``I will
witness your advent and judge your sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he and Senate Republicans could still work with the
president, in part because not much contact between them was
necessary: ``We legislate. He executes. Let's do that.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lott also exhibited some testiness toward news organizations,
saying they had frequently failed to put the blame where it
belonged, both in terms of the origins of the long impeachment
ordeal and the partisanship that often characterized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keep reminding people,'' Lott said, ``that Ken Starr
didn't make this happen. This is a grown man, the president of the
United States, parsing words, splitting legal hairs, having a
relationship with an intern in and around the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing charges of partisanship, he leaned more heavily on
his Southern drawl and asked, ``When are you all going to get that
right?'' Noting that 10 Republicans voted with Democrats on one
article of impeachment but no Democrats joined Republicans on
either, he said, ``We were bipartisan, as usual, and they were
totally partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   His pique with Democrats did not end there. ``The Democrats'
intent for the next two years,'' Lott said, ``will be basically to
try to delay, draw out and stop all legislation and then say, `See,
Congress is not doing its job.' So I'm warning you now, and I want
you to write it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But really, he said, he pitied his colleagues across the aisle.
``I tell you what: I'd hate to have to defend the conduct of this
president before my constituents if I was a Democrat,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he added, ``I'm not going to worry a whole lot
about it. I'm moving on.''

RUNNING CUPID'S WALL STREET OFFICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janis Spindel, Wall Street matchmaker, is picky. ``I don't do
fat, I don't do short, I don't do poor and I don't do schlubs,''
said Ms. Spindel, an energetic 46-year-old, pausing for 10
breathless minutes between appointments at Lehman Brothers and
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to talk on a cellular phone about
matchmaking in a bull market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning I was at Goldman, Sachs,'' she said. ``Then Bear
Stearns. Now I'm at Lehman, then I'm at Salomon, then J.P. Morgan.
I need a chauffeur to take me around from one to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spindel has happened upon a fascinating sociological
phenomenon. Since 1993, when she turned herself into Janis Spindel,
Serious Matchmaking, and started taking paying clients, she has
found that an active stock market means that financial executives
spend more time at the office and have less time to find spouses.
</P>
<P>
   When the market is up, dozens of investment bankers, corporate
lawyers, business consultants and managing directors _ that is, if
they're slender, tall, rich and otherwise nonschlubby _ contract
for Ms. Spindel's services, which she sees as just ``another kind
of outsourcing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she said. ``It comes down to this: Money buys love.
Who wants to look around all that time when you can hire me, your
own personal shopper?''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds cynical, bear in mind that in Ms. Spindel's
world, as in much of Manhattan, money is the DNA, the essential
building block, of happiness. And the price of a soul mate has
risen faster than many a hot Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spindel charges men $10,000 for a dozen dates over a year,
and that doesn't include dinner, dancing or a $5 tip for the
coat-check attendant. She charges women about half as much. (``They
don't need as much help,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   One Spindel client, a 35-year-old investment banker who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that in his business, he felt pressure
to spend most of his waking hours at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a relatively short shelf life,'' he said, ``so you
want to get in, make your money and get out.'' Outside the office,
he is looking for an athletic, down-to-earth Jewish woman. ``My
friends say I'll never find her in New York,'' he said, and sighed.
(Then he asked the reporter interviewing him if she was free on
Saturday night.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spindel, a former fashion executive, had long set up friends
and acquaintances on dates. When she realized that her casual
matchmaking had resulted in 14 marriages, she announced to her
husband, Allen: ``Honey, this is a business!''
</P>
<P>
   Her program is simple: She meets with clients at their offices,
over lunch or coffee, or over drinks. She notes their interests,
their likes and dislikes, and their visions of the ideal mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All men are alike,'' she said. ``Every man is looking for a
woman who is attractive, thin, smart, sexy, feminine, young, who
comes from a good family. And she ought to be a nonsmoker. That's
the biggest pet peeve. Some men say they like a full-figured woman,
and when I say I've found one, they are always careful to say,
`Well, she's not fat, right?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Women, she said, are less concerned about looks and more
interested in just meeting someone compatible. ``I had lunch with a
28-year-old Harvard attorney today,'' Ms. Spindel said of a new
client who works at a major law firm. ``She's tall and thin and
pretty, and she thinks her big problem is that most men are
intimidated by her.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is kept confidential. ``These people are neurotic
about love and privacy,'' Ms. Spindel said. After the date, she
calls the client and gets the skinny: Did you like her? Was he
smart? Was he too fat? Did he wear cheap shoes? Did she smoke?
</P>
<P>
   If the pairing works, she supervises from a reverential,
aunt-like distance, staying in touch by phone. If the date didn't
work out, she'll try again. And again. And again. She said that she
has spawned 294 monogamous relationships and 70 marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Her fees, she said, do not scare clients away; rather, they
attract the right kind. ``Ten thousand dollars certainly separates
the men from the boys,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fran Heller, 49, a marketing consultant, went on several Spindel
dates and found only one of the men unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone one I went out with had a certain level of
professionalism, intelligence and _ I won't say good looks exactly,
but they all cared about their personal appearance,'' Ms. Heller
said. ``But one of my dates turned out to be a very nice man, but
with a huge belly. I called her the next day and said, `Wow, what
were you thinking, Janis?' I mean, really.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heller continued her search until she alighted upon Ron
Gartner, 54, a textile executive, presumably with a flat belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janis knew Ron from the Hamptons, from tennis clubs,'' Ms.
Heller said. ``And she recognized a certain energy level in him
that I have, a certain spark.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heller said that while the notion of a matchmaker is almost
antique, it meshes with modern notions of personal service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm taking tennis lessons,'' she said, ``I don't want to go
into a class with a lot of other people. I want my own personal
tennis coach. That's Janis.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of dating, Ms. Heller and Gartner were married
last October in a reception room on the 29th floor of the United
Nations Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gorgeous night,'' Ms. Heller said. ``When you were
inside the room, looking out at all the lights of Manhattan, you
felt like you were dancing in the stars, over the tops of
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the way, I still have two dates left. But I'm not about
to call in my coupons.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Hakeem takes some advice, runs with it
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It began, as it often does, with a pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   This was in the first week of June at Second Baptist Church on a
Saturday morning, and Frank Rutherford was disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   He had just watched his friend and fellow former Houston Cougar
Hakeem Olajuwon labor to get up and down the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't run. He couldn't jump. He couldn't spin,''
Rutherford said. ``His mobility was so impaired that he couldn't do
any of the moves that we have come to identify with him. The Dream
Shake was nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you how bad it was. One of the regular guys in the
gym, somebody who just showed up to play a little ball, came real
close to getting right up in his face and blocking the shot of one
of the 50 greatest NBA players ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The something was the pain that had turned last season into a
long, torturous march for Olajuwon. Following the Rockets' playoff
elimination by Utah, he had rested for several weeks, then had both
knees examined. The right one, which had been repaired with
arthroscopic surgery, was fine. But the left knee, the one he uses
to push off and elevate for his jump hook, was painful. The
decision was made by the medical staff to hold off on more surgery
and give it time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't happening, and Rutherford thought he knew why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hakeem wasn't running properly,'' he said. ``He had bad
technique. I told him if he'd show up at the track at Robertson
Stadium Monday morning at 10, I could show him how to get rid of
the pain completely. He asked me how. I just said, `Show up.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Olajuwon did, for two reasons. First, because Rutherford had
his own credentials: a former member of the UH track team, a
three-time Olympian, and the first man from the Bahamas to win an
Olympic medal, claiming bronze in the triple jump at Barcelona.
Second, because there was nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got there at 10 o'clock, and it was already about 90
degrees,'' Hakeem said. ``I asked Frank where we were going to work
out, and he said, `Right here.' Outside? I thought he was
kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rutherford wasn't. For several hours, he put Olajuwon
through a regimen designed to change the way he ran and to build up
the muscles in his legs to take stress off the knees. On the first
day, the former Most Valuable Player couldn't run a lap without
stopping due to the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was bent over with his weight out over his feet,''
Rutherford said. ``And he was trying to stay up on his toes all of
the time. No wonder he had pain. Everything was going on to his
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford consulted with former UH track coach Tom Tellez, one
of the all-time greats, and made a plan for Hakeem. They
straightened his posture. They taught him how to roll from heel to
toe while running, to distribute the shock of each step evenly, and
they put him on a program of weight lifting and plyometrics that
quickly paid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to me,'' Olajuwon said. ``I never thought about
learning to run the right way, about training to run. Having gone
to UH, I knew Frank and Carl Lewis and Leroy Burrell. But I never
thought about the kind of training they had to do to excel, about
asking coach Tellez for advice. I thought running is just running.
But it's much more. They work a lot harder than we do at basketball
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The plyometrics involve boxes of various heights and getting
Olajuwon to jump from the floor to the box, from one box to
another. It builds up the calf muscles and the quadriceps, and it
has helped not only to alleviate the pain, but also to put the
explosiveness back into his game.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first five games of the season, Olajuwon is
averaging just 12.8 points. But he's pulling down nine rebounds per
game and has blocked 10 shots while playing pain-free. What's most
important is the spin moves along the baseline have been sighted _
along with the jump hook in the lane _ as he tries to find a
comfort zone and fit into the offense with Scottie Pippen and
Charles Barkley. At 36, Hakeem looks alive again, making multiple
jumps on the same offensive possession, challenging more shots on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford's goal is to recover from nagging injuries this track
season and return in 2000 to bid for his fourth Olympic team. He'll
take his first step back today in the RunSport All-Comers Meet at
the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He also watches at a Rockets practice as one large figure comes
out of a pack to grab an offensive rebound. Hakeem soars to spike a
dunk, and his buddy Frank grins.
</P>
<P>
   Just call it getting high with a little help from your friend.

BUSINESS PEOPLE LEARNING PROPER ETIQUETTE FOR THE POWER LUNCH  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By   JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Judith Re joined her guests at the round banquet table,
delicately placed her napkin on her lap, and began telling horror
stories.
</P>
<P>
   There was the executive who routinely took her shoes off under
the table, then lost one. The man who sneezed directly over the
soup course. The woman who wiped her mouth with a piece of pita
bread and then ate it. (Economical, perhaps, but not socially
savvy.)
</P>
<P>
   While her anecdotes did not exactly strike fear into her guests,
they did remind the 11 men and women why they paid $275 apiece to
attend her business etiquette class at the Ritz Carlton on a recent
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about breaking bread with
your clients,'' said Ms. Re, an etiquette consultant who has cured
many corporate executives of bad table manners. ``We're talking
about turning that restaurant into your boardroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Re, who has taught manners to children at the Ritz Carlton
for 12 years, began the one-night executive etiquette classes this
year to help the increasing number of adults who come to her with
questions about business meal propriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has become very full, and because of that, the
people are doing a lot more entertaining,'' she said. ``People want
to sharpen their entertaining skills. What's happening is, people
know everything there is to know about their business. That's what
they've done well, they've learned their skills, and they're great
at it. Now they want to master this. They want to make sure they're
putting their best foot forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the (FM)80s, people didn't have the same kind of feeling,''
she said. ``They'd say, `You must be crazy, Judith. We just have
money and that's all that counts.'''
</P>
<P>
   It pays to have the gift of manners these days. Corporations are
seeking out consultants in savoir-faire to train their employees.
Etiquette schools that once catered only to children and diplomats
have started offering courses with titles like ``Business Etiquette
for the New Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   One five-year-old consultant group in California, called the
Workshoppe, finds a wealth of clients in the socially awkward
executives of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   MBA candidates at Daniels College of Business at the University
of Denver are required to attend an etiquette dinner, while the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology runs a not-for-credit charm
school each January.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Re, who learned her manners at her parents' dinner table,
says graduate students whose parents came of age in the 1970s had
things other than p's and q's to mind, like the Vietnam War and the
sexual revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Modern times demand new rules, too. As Ms. Re's class ate
olive-crusted sea bass and filet of beef with caramelized shallots,
the director provided lessons in pager protocol, cell phone
etiquette and avoiding liability.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sullivan, an investment company director, said he took
clients out to dine three or four times a week but still has
shortcomings at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get confused about whether my salad fork is the one to
the left or the right,'' he said as he practiced setting a table in
a class exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Maguire, who works at Charles River Ventures, a
venture capital firm, managed to prop her serviette into an
M-shape, proclaimed it ``good enough,'' and marched off to the soup
course.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Re started her instructions with the basics. A Madeira
consomme with truffle shavings is eaten by swiping the spoon from
the 6 o'clock position to 12 o'clock. (``Seven to 1, that doesn't
work?'' Sullivan joked.) No blowing or slurping, please.
</P>
<P>
   What to do when a dessert fork hits the floor? Or a glob of
black tapanade plunks onto the white table linen? Mercifully, much
of the success of the meal rests on the white-gloved servers, who
quickly retrieve and replace the fallen fork and immediately swipe
clean the mess with a sterling table scraper.
</P>
<P>
   All pretty standard, right? Even those who think themselves
well-mannered were taken aback when the teacher advised against
ordering alcohol at a business lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry,'' she said. ``You don't drink
wine on someone else's clock.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If a client has a questionable amount to drink, she said,
``Please make sure that when the server is right next to you, turn
to that person and ask, `Would you like me to get you a cab?''' In
acknowledgment, the word ``liability'' murmured around the table.
</P>
<P>
   (This being a dinner, and the Ritz being the Ritz, wine is
served with each course.)
</P>
<P>
   As the intermezzo of cassis sorbet was served, Ms. Re reminded
her students to turn their beepers to silent at a meal and excuse
themselves if they must return a page.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones should be left behind, she said. If the client
decides to take a call during the meal, she suggested continuing to
eat, but more slowly. If the call continues for 10 minutes, ``then
you know you're in trouble,'' she said. ``You've lost them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you eavesdrop?'' she asked devilishly. ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Re's adult students can be even more nervous than her
preteen pupils, timidly asking things like whether it is all right
to eat the entire spear of asparagus, or just the tip. (Ms. Re
loves the whole thing.)
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they sipped the dessert wine (the fourth of the
evening) the students had begun to rattle off questions. Is it
allowable to switch between the American style of eating and the
European style?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like I'm eating upside down,'' Ms. Maguire said,
as Ms. Re showed her how to use the knife to ``escort'' some garlic
potatoes onto the back of her fork. Either style is acceptable, but
no switching back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Are there certain foods that should not be ordered at a business
lunch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't order the 12-ounce burger with the au jus dripping
off it,'' Ms. Re said. Linguine with clam sauce is her own nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's dessert, peach a la Ritz, was a challenge all its own:
a mousse garnished with a foot-high triangle of chocolate lace.
Rather than risk toppling the tower off the plate, most guests ate
around theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Although corporate attire had been requested, Ms. Re, dressed in
a long-sleeved, toe-length black dress accented with a gold pin,
was not out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set the rules,'' she said when asked where she finds her
etiquette knowledge. ``I also listen to the pulse, everything from
riding the metro trains to when you're traveling on an airplane.
You're very visual, and you ask people questions, and that's what I
do.'' She does not do color analysis or grin-and-greet classes, and
no, she does not read Ann Landers.
</P>
<P>
   A successful business lunch, she said, is all about making the
client feel taken care of. If a client suggests a particular
restaurant, go there in advance to choose the best table for
conducting business.
</P>
<P>
   You can present your credit card to the maitre d' in advance, to
save any confusion about who gets the bill later. Choose a seat
that allows you to keep eye contact with the server, but gives the
client the best view.
</P>
<P>
   If the guest has a coat or valet ticket, ask for it and pay the
tip. Don't discuss business as soon as you sit down, but let the
conversation flow naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Many people say the time of the power lunch is past, that people
are too busy to have lunch outside the office. For Sullivan, the
business meal is a way to break through the ``wall of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's just voice mail and just phones and our product is a
little better than their product,'' then there's little to set the
company apart, he said. ``But if I can make that personal contact.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Re added: ``Out technology is growing at such a fast pace
that I don't think people have time to think. And I don't blame the
people. I blame the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just got to be a choice about what you bring over into
the millennium,'' she said. In fact, she mused, the Internet could
be a good way to spread the gospel of etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   For now, she sent her students off with booklets of the rules
she taught them. In it, she reminds them not to use long words when
short ones will do, and if they don't know how to pronounce the
name of a wine, it is fine to order it by its number on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way in which you can overdo it, ladies and
gentlemen,'' she said, ``is when you're pretending you're something
you're not.'' &QL;

SOUTH ASIAN NATIONS DISCUSS DETENTE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Nine months after India and Pakistan
tested nuclear weapons and scared the world into imagining nuclear
war between the hostile neighbors, legislators from the two nations
began historic talks here Friday in an effort to lay groundwork for
detente in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day session marks the highest-level contact so far in a
series of recent overtures _ including a cricket match and the
creation of an India-Pakistan bus route _ that peacemakers hope
could spur a breakthrough in relations. For the first time in 51
years, 100 elected leaders from the rival states rose for each
other's national anthems and honored one another's flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no words to express my joy. . . . This is not just a
conference, but a historic event,'' said R. K. Malkani, a member of
India's Upper House and senior vice president of the ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will break the ice,'' said Goyar Ayub Khan, Pakistan's
former foreign minister and a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim
League. ``We have a shared history, culture,'' but ``we are like
oil and water in a barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Separated at birth, the two nations came into being violently in
1947 with the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and
Pakistan at the end of British colonial rule. Since then,
Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan have fought three wars,
two over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The testing of nuclear weapons by India and then Pakistan last
May outraged the West and prompted the United States to impose
economic sanctions. US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
recently visited both nations to prod them to sign nuclear test ban
treaties and disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said the nuclear tests may have breathed new life
into stalled talks between New Delhi and Islamabad. The threat of a
nuclear mishap with missiles just moments apart, plus the crippling
impact of sanctions on Pakistan, have become too serious to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan has come to the point where it has no choice but to
negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, and that means
negotiating with India,'' said Syed Naveed Qamar, a lawmaker of the
opposition Pakistan People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will take
the inaugural bus ride from New Delhi to Lahore, Pakistan, to meet
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It will be the first trip by
an Indian leader to Pakistan in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   High hopes are riding on the so-called bus diplomacy, but like
the parliamentary gathering here, it could be largely symbolic.
What will matter is the willingness of both governments to resolve
contentious issues, such as the future of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of how emotional that issue remains, some 100
demonstrators gathered outside the Foreign Ministry Friday,
chanting slogans and waving banners that declared ``No Peace
without resolution of the Kashmir Issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawmakers and observers insisted the parliamentary talks
could lay a key foundation for the mutual trust needed to conduct
sensitive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot change the perceptions of 51 years of history when
people . . . are not talking to each other,'' said Dick Hoagland, a
US diplomat who observed the proceedings. ``What this is is
breaking down the Berlin Wall. . . . It's only one brick in the
wall, but it's a terribly important brick.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said the time for idle talk has expired, if only for
economic necessity. The costly arms race is stunting opportunity
for a billion residents of one of the world's poorest regions,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   While half a billion people in South Asia live below the poverty
line, military spending in the region has risen in the last decade
_ even as it has fallen worldwide, said Aitzaz Ahsan, Senate leader
of the Pakistan People's Party. Nuclear weapons, he added, ``may be
good for our egos . . . but these are too much a burden to place
upon the frail, tired, and doubled-up skeletal frames of the poor
in South Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by a leading Pakistani economist asserts that social
conditions are now worse in South Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa.
Yet Pakistan's defense budget exceeds its health and education
spending by 25 percent, while India's is two-thirds of its health
and education budgets combined, said Imtiaz Alam, an editor of The
News, the Pakistani newspaper that organized the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal Choudhry, chairman of India's parliamentary committee on
defense, said he watched military escalation from the inside during
21 years in the Air Force, but he now believes that tensions ``can
be defused by man-to-man contacts. I will go back and share my good
impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly every visiting Indian, this was a first chance to see
Pakistan, since travel between the two nations is so restricted.
Their impressions seemed largely positive, but suspicions linger.
</P>
<P>
   Meira Kumar, a Congress Party lawmaker from India, said she was
struck by the beauty of Islamabad, the 1960s-era planned capital.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added with a wry smile, ``I wonder where they've tucked
away their slums.''

COMMENTARY: LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton accomplished little else in the year of Monica,
he did disprove one of the most quoted lines in American
literature, F. Scott Fitzgerald's rueful dictum that ``There are no
second acts in American lives.'' Through cunning, guile, stamina
and sheer luck, the president showed that an American life can have
countless acts, even within a single year, no matter how many times
your adversaries lower what everyone declares to be the final
curtain.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also during the past year that another Fitzgerald
maxim was triumphantly reaffirmed: ``The test of a first-rate
intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind
at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.'' That
line could well apply to another major player in this drama _ the
much-speculated-about American people.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Clinton first wagged his finger about ``that
woman,'' a majority of the public judged him a lying philanderer _
even as they came to the parallel conclusion that his scandalous
behavior shouldn't force him from office. Though the Washington
establishment would eventually be driven bananas by the
compartmentalization of those two opposed ideas, Americans beyond
the Beltway, possessed of first-rate intelligence, shrugged it off.
And the country functioned just fine.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Friday's verdict, there's the usual run of
buzzwords (``closure,'' ``legacy'') and journalistic compilations
of winners and losers. The cliche of the moment has it that ``there
are no heroes'' in Monicagate. True enough, if applied to Clinton,
Kenneth Starr, media bloviators and partisans across the political
map. But the public's sense of proportion through it all has been
heroic. Whether speaking to pollsters or in actual balloting, it
has known just how to apply the brakes when either the president or
his Javert threatened to drive the country into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   What's shocking is how readily those who hate Bill Clinton are
willing to transfer that hatred to the people who refused to give
him the boot. William Bennett now labels Americans ``ignoble.''
Lindsey Graham summed up his case for impeachment by saying, ``This
nation is in hopeless decline.'' In his summation, Henry Hyde
declared, ``I wonder if after this culture war is over ... an
America will survive that's worth fighting to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   Love it or leave it, buster.
</P>
<P>
   The America Hyde finds worthless hardly admires Clinton, but it
does know the difference between a fair prosecution and a
tarring-and-feathering (with the avalanche of Starr evidence being
the buckets of tar in this case). The America that Bennett finds
ignoble is the most churchgoing country in the world, with a
steeply declining crime rate. The nation Graham finds in hopeless
decline is not overrun by greedy, idle fools seduced by the stock
ticker; it is full of people who are toiling hard to build the
companies, many of them new, that have fueled the current boom even
more than Alan Greenspan has. Most Americans have been much too
busy working to listen to Washington's moral defeatists.
</P>
<P>
   For those Americans, Monicagate's official end won't mean much,
except a decline in white noise; they tuned it out long ago. It's
less clear, however, if the antagonists who played leading roles in
the circus are any wiser for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Linda Tripp (or don't). Interviewed by Jamie Gangel on
the ``Today'' show Friday, she managed in an impressively short
time to charge her beloved surrogate daughter Monica with lying
under oath to the Senate, and the president with threatening the
lives of both her and her children. If it's possible to drive her
poll rating even lower than last fall's 3 percent, the
self-martyring Ms. Tripp may have done it.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Donaldson, the unabashedly partisan ABC White House
correspondent who speculated more than a year ago that the Clinton
presidency might be ``numbered in days,'' is also incorrigible. Now
officially journalism's clown prince, he went on ``Politically
Incorrect'' to crack anti-Clinton jokes on the eve of Friday's
Senate vote. Clinton-haters, convinced that just one more
revelation will nail their prey, are still frantically chasing
after purported White House sex tapes and Jane Doe No. 5. Starr is
ready to oblige all accusers, and Clinton, his gloat-free apology
done with, is setting off on another fund-raising binge.
</P>
<P>
   As for All Monica media, the Fox News Channel is now loudly
promoting next week's bill: ``Four Nights! Four Special Reports!''
_ on JonBenet Ramsey. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this where
we came in?
</P>
<P>
   For the next four months I'll be away working on a book about
the Washington of my youth, when the town's idea of a babe was
Mamie Eisenhower. See you back here in June.

MARCUS CAMBY : YOUNG LEGS FOR OLD KNICKS TO LEAN ON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcus Camby had stayed out of it. He quietly
accepted his bench status, his coach's criticism and the unending
comparisons that made him seem as thin and frail as uncooked
spaghetti next to Charles Oakley, the rugged folk hero he replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Camby stood back as Knicks management privately prodded Coach
Jeff Van Gundy to play the shot blocker in order to validate the
unpopular trade by the team's president, Ernie Grunfeld, while Van
Gundy openly pushed for Camby to earn his minutes and raise his
threshold for pain.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in the middle, Camby remained patient. He had been a star
since he was old enough to drive. But for the first two games of
the season, Camby, the No. 2 pick in the 1996 draft, was sitting in
another area code on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He played an embarrassing 19 seconds in the opener against the
Orlando Magic and five frantic minutes in the Knicks' loss to the
Miami Heat at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Van Gundy met with Camby. One person
familiar with the situation said Van Gundy did not want Camby to
get discouraged or let outside influences _ like an agent, the
management or the news media _ create a wedge between player and
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Van Gundy did not guarantee Camby that he would get to
play against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday or the Chicago
Bulls on Thursday. But that was hours before a magnetic resonance
imaging exam revealed a stress fracture in the right heel of
Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to fill that athletic void. Van Gundy turned to
Camby and since then, Camby has made it very difficult for Van
Gundy to remove him. In 15 minutes against the Wizards, he was
active but still finding his way. In 28 minutes against the Bulls,
he found his niche with eight blocked shots as he loomed over Toni
Kukoc and held Chicago's remaining star to a 4-for-22 night from
the field. Camby's wait was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it wasn't that he was waiting for it, but working for
it,'' Van Gundy said. ``I was reading somewhere. I think it was
some guy in Golden State who wasn't playing as much as he wanted
and was killing the coaches about not playing him. And that's
totally the opposite of Marcus. He has been great. As I've said,
he's very coachable and listens. After those first four days of
camp, I couldn't be happier with him.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Camby is working hard, playing hard and is content with
popping off the bench to deliver the kind of energy he displayed
against the Bulls. So far, Camby has weathered all the criticism,
comparisons and organizational tension. He has been mature for a
24-year-old who naively came to New York expecting to light up the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kept a very level head,'' Allan Houston said. ``He hasn't
let the talk get to him. And it takes a lot to do that in New York.
He's going to continue to do that, and we're going to continue to
lift him up and stand by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby lifted his team over the Bulls. Camby, along with a late
push by Houston, saved the Knicks as they began to show signs of
fatigue. Patrick Ewing was growing wobbly. In the final four
minutes, Camby was Ewing's cane as he leapt for two blocks, grabbed
a pivotal rebound and came up with a loose ball. Instead of Oakley
doing the dirty work, it was Camby for a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus had a great game,'' Ewing said. ``He played outstanding
defense on Kukoc. He makes everyone's life easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby made it easier for the Knicks to lean on him. They will
need his athletic talent and young legs as this season begins what
Van Gundy called the ``death march.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, the Knicks will play four games in five
nights. The next time they have a three-day breather is late April.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the back-to-back games and three games in a row, we'll
need energy,'' Camby said. ``Against the Wizards, I went into the
game with Chris Childs and our intensity went up. The same thing
happened against Chicago. The intensity went up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, the tension surrounding Camby and his playing
time had died for the moment. As a result, the organization can
feel better about completing a contract extension for Camby _ who
is in the last year of his three-year rookie deal _ before the
March 13 deadline. Camby can feel better about his place with the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called my number, I just had to make the most of my
minutes,'' Camby said. ``I just had to be patient.'' &QL;

SENATE ACQUITS CLINTON OF IMPEACHMENT CHARGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Washing its hands of a sex-and-lies scandal that
dogged the nation for more than a year, the Senate on Friday
acquitted President Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice
charges, ending a Republican effort to drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of both articles of impeachment, which grew out of
the president's affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and his effort to cover up the relationship, was a stern
rebuke to Clinton's GOP detractors.
</P>
<P>
   It also signaled that U.S. presidents are not easily deposed. In
the only previous impeachment trial of a president 131 years ago,
Andrew Johnson was acquitted by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   While neither charge against Clinton mustered a simple 51-vote
majority, much less the two-thirds needed for the Senate to convict
him, the president is forever paired with Johnson as America's only
impeached presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emerges from the trial with a scandal-stained legacy and
a reputation for lying, offset only by high job approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   On the perjury charge, 45 senators voted guilty, 55 not guilty,
with 10 Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting to acquit. On
the obstruction of justice charge, the vote was 50-50, with five
Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats in voting not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The president ``hereby is acquitted of the charges,'' declared
Chief Justice William Rehnquist after the two roll-call votes.
Then, following 19th-century impeachment rules, Secretary of the
Senate Gary Cisco was dispatched to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's office to formally notify the government's executive
branch of the trial's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Rehnquist, the House prosecutors and the
president's legal team were escorted from the Senate chamber, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., tried to push through a resolution
condemning Clinton for ``shameless, reckless and indefensible''
behavior in the Lewinsky affair and cover-up. Republican senators,
led by Phil Gramm of Texas, immediately blocked the censure effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis will be coming back before censure does,'' Gramm said as
the Senate recessed for the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with Gramm was Sen. Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican
who voted ``guilty'' on both charges against Clinton. ``Let's move
on. He won. He always wins,'' Smith muttered of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a bomb threat, which turned out to be a hoax,
forced the evacuation of the Senate wing of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, a subdued Clinton appeared in the Rose
Garden to say he was ``profoundly sorry'' for the nation's 13-month
ordeal. He expressed gratitude for the Senate votes and called for
reconciliation with the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all Americans, here in
Washington and throughout our land, will rededicate ourselves to
the work of serving our nation and building our future together,''
said Clinton, who now faces the task of salvaging the remaining two
years of his term and a legacy sullied by his sexual infidelity and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The final 45 minutes of the Senate trial and Clinton's latest
apology were broadcast live to a public that, according to
pollsters, wanted the scandal to go away and the trial not to occur
at all. Yet, Americans continued to watch from the first report of
the scandal, to Clinton's finger-wagging denial, through the
rancorous House debate and the five-week Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of it,'' said Crystal Miller, who was visiting the
Capitol with her 12-year-old daughter, Janelle. ``They've had to
focus their attention on this for too long, but it had to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   As ABC television wound up its coverage of the Senate vote and
Clinton's response, anchor Peter Jennings called the day ``a little
anticlimactic for some, but a great, historic civics lesson for
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before the House passed the articles of impeachment in
mid-December, the outcome of the trial was never in doubt _ Clinton
had enough allies among the Senate Democrats to secure the 34 votes
needed to block conviction and removal. His acquittal was assured
Jan. 27 when 44 Democrats voted to dismiss the charges and end the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that there was high climax there, because we
knew in advance how it was going to come out except for the exact
count,'' said Sen. John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who was
among the five GOP senators to vote not guilty on both articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Chafee, Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan
Collins, both of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania voted to acquit Clinton on both charges. When the
roll was called on the perjury allegation, they were joined by
Republican Sens. Slade Gorton of Washington, Richard Shelby of
Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John
Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was confident enough of how the Senate would
vote Friday that Vice President Al Gore, who would have taken
office immediately had Clinton been found guilty, was cleared to
visit New York as part of his own campaign for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the immediate threat to Clinton's presidency is over,
he still faces the possibility of indictment from independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, who has led a five-year, $40 million
investigation of the president's business dealings in Arkansas and
a series of White House scandals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a report from Starr on Sept. 9 that prompted the
Republican-controlled House to begin impeachment proceedings.
Starr's report, heavily laced with Lewinsky's salacious
descriptions of her trysts with Clinton, was reprinted by the
Government Printing Office and posted on the Internet for review by
anyone with computer access.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the hearings, Starr testified that although his
investigation was still under way the only impeachable offenses
turned up against Clinton involved his effort to conceal his affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an
Illinois Republican who served as chief House prosecutor during
linton's trial in the Senate, said it would not be in the nation's
best interest for Starr to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think indicting and criminally trying him (Clinton)
after what we have all been through is going to be helpful to the
country,'' Hyde said, explaining that the thought of a former
president sitting in jail ``is off putting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hyde said Starr's investigation of Clinton
should not be abandoned altogether. ``There may be other things of
great importance,'' Hyde said. ``But I think we ought to put
something to bed, or put it on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the Senate verdicts, Hyde said he has
no regrets about the outcome. ``We fulfilled our oath of office to
discharge our duty according to the Constitution,'' he said. ``And
when people do that, when elected representatives do that,
democracy works.''
</P>
<P>
   Less sanguine was Rep. Steve Buyer, an Indiana Republican and
House prosecutor, who was alone in implicitly criticizing the
Senate. House prosecutors ``sought the truth, laid out the facts,
applied the law, applied Senate precedents, and it scared some
members of the Senate,'' Buyer said. ``It's unfortunate that they
didn't follow through on their conscience and conviction.''

EVERYDAY LIVES OF BRAZILIANS SQUEEZED BY E3CONOMIC DOWNTURN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ The financial whirlwind that trashed Russia and
Asia last year has blown onto the porch of Cassio Figuereido
Almeida's ramshackle, two-story house.
</P>
<P>
   And Almeida says the international lenders who prescribed tough
free-market love to halt Brazil's economic slide have not done him
any favors.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking a wooden pipe, Almeida broods about how he'll support
his wife and seven children in the face of rising inflation and the
sinking value of his monthly pension check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep quiet, but I feel oppressed,'' Almeida, 51, said
outside his house in Manguariba, a working-class section of this
coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has become the latest laboratory for imposing strict but
vital reforms. And while investors and analysts applaud such
measures, families like the Almeidas must live through them, often
painfully.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical weekday in Almeida's neighborhood, barefoot
children fly paper kites, and men without jobs hose down their
stoops, waiting for a cool patch of sidewalk shade to set up a
table for beer and dominoes. Vendors drive horse-drawn carts
through the streets, hawking everything from potatoes to passion
fruit popsicles.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, Almeida, a retired city driver, leaves his house
at 3 a.m. and travels to a federal bank, where he waits up to six
hours before receiving his check. His roughly $270 pension payment
will be cut soon _ though he hasn't been told when or by how much _
because of a cost-cutting policy recently approved by Brazil's
Congress to reduce pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   After working the same job for 35 years, Almeida feels cheated
out of his retirement money. But he was never confident that the
government would deliver his full benefits, just as he doubted the
government's five-year-old plan to stabilize inflation and the
value of the real, Brazil's currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed in the Real Plan or any Brazilian laws,''
Almeida said. ``There was a calm in a certain sense, but you always
felt insecure. In this country, you can never feel very secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and 20 other countries,
including the United States, have pledged $41.5 billion in aid to
Brazil. In return, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has moved to
strengthen the economy, in response to demands from the IMF and the
other foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, Cardoso broke a longstanding pledge by allowing
the real to float freely against the dollar. Initially, the real
lost nearly 40 percent of its value but has since regained some of
its losses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the president removed the country's top banking
official and replaced him with Arminio Fraga, a US-trained
economist who had been a top aide to billionaire currency
speculator George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   However, Almeida and his 43-year-old wife, Beatriz, like most
other Brazilians, are more concerned about rising food prices than
about free-floating exchange rates or stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, the Almeidas dined on rice, beans, and beef
with sliced onion. If things get worse, they said, the beef will go
from future meals, followed by the beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that passes weighs heavier on the backs of the
people,'' Beatriz said as she nursed her 3-year-old son, Gustavo.
``Every day we go to the supermarket, and things are more
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials argue that tough measures are needed to cut
the country's swelling deficit _ now at 9 percent of gross domestic
product _ in order to spur economic growth and keep Brazil
attractive to international investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, there may be a gap between what we do and
what people feel,'' said a Finance Ministry official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``But that's often the way it is. Once
people feel the benefits of our policies, they will have more
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many specialists now predict an inflation rate for
Brazil this year of between 10 and 20 percent, more than the
single-digit rise people have seen in recent years, but far less
than the 3,000 percent rates of the nightmarish 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still enough to make most Brazilians anxious and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same worry, the same problems,'' Almeida said. ``But
I think it's going to be worse this time. In the '80s, you had
inflation, but when costs went up, your salary did, too. Now,
inflation is going up again, but our earnings are going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the current economic crisis began last year, Maria de
Lourdes, a 59-year-old retired elementary school arts teacher,
attended the theater once a month and made regular weekend getaways
to small coastal towns like Vitoria and Salvador. It's been a year
since she's done either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many things I've stopped doing to save money for
food,'' de Lourdes said from the living room of her tiny apartment
in Rio's Engenho Novo neighborhood. ``These are things I can't do
anymore because of the situation today.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Pereira, a 28-year-old mother of three, feels betrayed by
Cardoso. The former seamstress, who now cleans offices because her
sewing company closed, voted twice for Cardoso, in 1994 and again
last year, when he promised to fight inflation and currency
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to pay 2 reals for good beans, when before it was only
1,'' Pereira said. ``Even the bad beans cost 1.70 reais, but they
have insects and rocks and you can't eat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeida is willing to go back to work, but he wonders how he can
compete with so many other people who are also looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're over 50 and retired, no one wants to hire you,''
Almeida said with a sigh. ``They'd rather get someone younger.''

NEW YORK DEMOCRATS HOPE FIRST LADY SAYS ``YES''?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that President Clinton's impeachment trial is
over, Hillary Rodham Clinton will give serious thought to
fulfilling the fantasy of every Democratic leader in New York _
declaring herself a candidate for the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While impeachment proceedings were underway, the first lady
``wasn't able to think about that,'' Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's
press aide, said in a telephone interview. ``Now that this is over,
I suspect she will turn her attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the state's senior senator, Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, announced he would not run for a fifth term in 2000,
party officials have daydreamed that Mrs. Clinton would try to take
his place.
</P>
<P>
   As popular as the president is in this state _ he won every
Assembly District in the 1996 election and, despite the subsequent
scandals, wins higher positive ratings here than almost anywhere in
the country _ the first lady is more popular still.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, she came here four times in four weeks to campaign
for Democrat Charles Schumer, who defeated the state's other
incumbent senator, Republican Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   At union rallies and corporate luncheons alike, Mrs. Clinton
wowed crowds with her passion for social issues and an electrifying
rhetorical flair. Talk of Hillary-for-Senate took off like brush
fire.
</P>
<P>
   One reason was and is that Democrats have no clearly attractive
candidate to field for Moynihan's seat, especially against the most
likely Republican contender, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   All the state's big-draw Democrats _ Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
Andrew Cuomo, state comptroller Carl McCall _ have decided not to
run. If star power is what's needed to beat Giuliani, then Hillary
Rodham Clinton is a potent dream indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton beating Giuliani, 52 to 41.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no other Democrat would bother opposing her in a
primary race.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here last week, the president himself threw a couple
of logs on the fire by saying, ``It's highly likely that I will
increasingly be known as the person who comes with Hillary to New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark was a play on President John F. Kennedy's famous
comment, after his wife made a grand impression during an official
trip to Paris, that he would be known as the person who accompanied
Jacqueline Kennedy to France.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president, well aware of the excitement over Mrs.
Clinton's possible senatorial bid, must have known that many would
take the remark as grounds for further frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats doubt she will run. One person close to the
Clintons said recently the first lady will want to get away from
politicians and the press as soon as she leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, local tabloids have reported rumors that
Mrs. Clinton has been shopping around for an apartment on the Upper
West Side. Berry denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News quoted an unnamed source Friday as saying she
might make a decision on a Senate run as early as next week. One
person close to the first lady, who asked not to be identified,
scoffed at that notion, too, saying, ``Look, people need to relax
about all this. It's a big decision.''

NEW ENGLAND REPUBLICANS VOTE TO ACQUIT CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 ENGLAND-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New England bolstered its image Friday as a home
for moderate Republicans, as four of the region's six GOP senators
broke with their party and voted to acquit President Clinton on
both articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 10 of the 12 New England senators voted against
conviction. The lone ``guilty'' votes from the region were cast by
New Hampshire's Republican senators, burnishing the state's
reputation as an island of conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire marches to a different drummer,'' said the
state's junior senator, Judd Gregg. ``We march a different way on
economic, social, and political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the charges against Clinton, Gregg added: ``We
place great faith in things like oaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith, New Hamsphire's senior senator, said he read no
evidence of the state's political personality in the impeachment
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a Republican when I went in as a juror,'' Smith said.
``I wasn't analyzing how the votes or the state was going to come
out. I was an impartial juror.''
</P>
<P>
   In the entire Senate, only five Republicans voted to acquit
Clinton of both charges. The four from New England were Senators
Susan M. Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine; John H. Chafee
of Rhode Island; and James M. Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth Republican was Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
who voted ``not proved'' and was counted as a ``not guilty'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   The same five Republicans have worked together at times to
oppose their Republican colleagues on issues such as tax cuts.
Three of the five _ Snowe, Chafee, and Jeffords _ face reelection
next year and come from states that Clinton carried in the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   None of the votes from New England senators were surprises,
though Collins had not laid out her reasons for voting for
acquittal before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a press statement, Collins said her vote was not meant to
exonerate Clinton. ``He lied under oath. He sought to interfere
with the evidence. He tried to influence the testimony of key
witnesses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, while it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young,
star-struck employee,'' Collins said, alluding to former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's prosecutors ``neglected to pin him down'' and
obtain precise testimony, leaving the record ``too murky'' to
support a perjury charge, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton made ``clear attempts to tamper with witnesses
and obstruct justice,'' his actions did not rise to the level of an
impeachable offense, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The first charge against Clinton, for perjury during his Aug. 17
grand jury testimony, failed with 45 senators voting to convict and
55 to acquit. Senators split 50-50 on the second charge,
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   That was a change from December's House vote to impeach Clinton.
In the House, the perjury article passed by a larger margin than
did the obstruction charge.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican who voted to convict
on both articles of impeachment, said some of his colleagues
believed that the perjury charge was ``too vague'' and ``doesn't
say which pieces of testimony were perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyers in the crowd were disturbed by the way the article
was drawn . . . that it was fatally flawed,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republicans voted to acquit Clinton of perjury but voted to
convict him of obstructing justice. They were Senators Slade Gorton
of Washington, Richard Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska,
Fred Thompson of Tennessee, and John Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad and tacky as some of this was, it's not the kind of
thing the Founding Fathers would approve for removal from office,''
Thompson said of Clinton's actions leading to the perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Three former House members who joined the Senate last month
voted consistent with the impeachment votes they cast last year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senators Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Mike Crapo of
Idaho had voted to impeach Clinton on all charges when they were
House members, and they voted to convict on both charges Friday.
Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, voted against both
charges Friday, as he had in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said they did not look forward to deciding
whether to censure Clinton or to revisiting any aspect of the
impeachment matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The articles are over. This is over. Go home. Get a life,''
said Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said he looked
forward to attending Mardi Gras. Senator Pete Domenici, Republican
of New Mexico, said he planned to spend some time with his
grandchildren. ``They don't see me enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the New Hampshire Republican, said he planned to relax,
perhaps go for a drive, and then prepare for the kickoff next week
of his campaign for president of the United States.

SOMBER CLINTON APOLOGIZES TO NATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim, optional ending) 
 
By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A somber and circumspect President Clinton moved to
end the 13-month scandal by apologizing Friday for the national
burden created by his affair with Monica Lewinsky and called for
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate acquitted him, the legacy-conscious Clinton
will still go down in history with Andrew Johnson as only the
second president to be impeached and tried by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Senate has fulfilled its constitutional
responsibility, bringing this process to a conclusion, I want to
say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what
I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they
have imposed on the Congress and the American people,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours earlier, the Senate failed to muster even a majority
vote for charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming
from the president's affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared before reporters on an unseasonably warm day as
a solitary figure, walking from the Oval Office to Rose Garden for
a brief statement intended to show his contrition and counter the
image of defiance he displayed in December when the House voted for
the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The president angered many Republicans and some Democrats in
December when he was joined by Vice President Al Gore, first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and dozens of House Democrats for what
critics labeled a Rose Garden pep rally after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House attempted to strike the proper tones that would
avoid any sense of celebration for having survived, politically at
least, the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, naturally, this coming to an end brings relief both
to the president and to the people here at the White House,'' said
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart. The White House appeared
outwardly as the ``gloat-free zone'' that Lockhart had declared it
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it were time for independent counsel Kenneth Starr to
close his investigation into the case, Lockhart said, ``It's an
issue that the independent counsel will have to search his own
sense of whether the time has come to wrap this up.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who urged the House to impeach the president, has not
disclosed if or when he will bring criminal charges against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke for only two minutes after White House aides spent
much of the morning debating how the president should respond,
unsure if he should appear in person or release a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also am humbled and very grateful for the support and the
prayers I have received from millions of Americans over this past
year. Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all Americans _ here in
Washington and throughout our land _ will rededicate ourselves to
the work of serving our nation and building our future together,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and
renewal for America,'' Clinton said, clinching his jaw as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The president turned to walk away when a reporter shouted a
question, asking him if he could forgive and forget in his heart.
Clinton paused, then walked back to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be
prepared to give it,'' Clinton said. He then walked back up the
steps to the colonnade and into the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
The president offered a regretful and even longer address in the
form of an e-mail to the White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past year has been especially difficult for you,'' the
e-mail said. ``I know that my actions and the events they triggered
have made your work even harder. For that, I am profoundly sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your dedication and loyalty have meant more to me than you can
ever know. The best way I can repay you is to redouble my open
efforts on behalf of the ideals we share, and to make the most of
every day we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent much of his morning in the White House residence,
visiting with his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, and spending some
time with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate voted 55-45 against the charge of perjury, the
president was in the exercise room for his daily routine. When the
Senate voted 50-50 against the charge of obstruction of justice,
the president was penning his own text for his post-acquittal
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of staff John Podesta called the president with the
outcome of each vote and gave the president a rundown of which
Republicans voted against the charges. Lockhart said Clinton chose
not to watch the televised Senate votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Clinton called about a half-dozen Senate
Democrats to thank them for their support during his trial.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gore praised the Senate vote and echoed Clinton's
call for reconciliation. ``Now we must rededicate ourselves to the
higher purposes to which we have an opportunity to turn,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart maintained that Clinton's reach for reconciliation with
Congress will begin as soon as it returns from its weeklong break
for the presidents' holiday. Clinton will leave Sunday for a
two-day visit to Mexico to visit President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president tried to reach out a hand just a few
moments ago to Democrats and Republicans, saying that this needs to
be and must be a time of reconciliation and renewal. That's
obviously, I believe, the right sentiment for today,'' Lockhart
said. ``Congress will go off for a recess and ... when they come
back we'll be ready to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton will meet with the leadership of both
parties in Congress at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very aggressive legislative agenda,'' Lockhart
said, pointing to Clinton's plans on Social Security, education,
health care and raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all issues that, because of the nature of our
government, we are going to have to reach out and get Republican
support for. And I expect that, when they come back, at the
appropriate time we'll all get together and start working on
that,'' Lockhart said.

 &HT;    America, have we forgotten how to have fun
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Call it the new American dream: Having fun _ for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Americans want, according to the national polling
firm Yankelovich Partners , which prides itself in keeping a finger
on the pulse of the nation's attitudes and temperament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for the fourth year running, the pollsters asked 2,500
Americans what their top priorities were for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the fourth year running, the No. 1 answer was: ``Have
more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd contradiction. Isn't this supposed to be the country
where the fun never ends?
</P>
<P>
   Don't booming, multibillion dollar industries _ TV, movies,
sports, the Internet, Hollywood, video games, theme parks, casinos
_ exist to amuse us silly?
</P>
<P>
   Yet beneath all this packaged jollity, about half the nation's
population suspects that life is passing them by, according to
Yankelovich.

<P>
   The roots of this feeling are deep; the American ethic of work
before pleasure is as old as Calvinism. According to an old joke,
the American dream boils down to this: ``Work, work, work. Save,
save, save. Buy a house. And die.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that old jestnut rings too true.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta family therapist Mori Freed has heard her share of woes
from the overworked class. Over the past decade, as Americans got
caught up in the roar of Wall Street and the wreckage of corporate
``downsizing,'' she detected a recurring theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s it became all work, work, work _ a salt-mine
mentality of earning as much money as you can _ instead of having
as much fun as you can,'' Freed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a complete turnaround from the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same people who once reveled in freedom and the
anti-establishment decided to cash in. Suddenly, they were unhappy,
and they didn't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, with its burgeoning class of millionaires next door,
typifies _ and magnifies _ the modern-day ``Main Street'' malaise
of all work and little fun.
</P>
<P>
   We commute in greater, nerve-wracking volume than any city in
America, driving an aggregate 100 million miles a day. And,
according to ``Places Rated Almanac,'' Atlanta is the No. 1 city to
look for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   In this go-getter work-a-thon ethos, one is hard-pressed to see
past the grindstone. Just ask Ed Hall, 33, if he's having fun. Hall
is a game editor at White Wolf publishing in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really thought about it,'' he said, then rattled off a
handful of reasons, not the least being that he works three jobs
and 70 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   He designs role-playing games. ``So, there's some fun in that,''
he said. But beyond that? He thinks a moment. ``I used to like to
hike,'' he said. ``But I don't have time. So now I walk around my
neighborhood instead. The problem is, that's when I do my best
thinking. So I guess I'm actually working.''
</P>
<P>
   A common lament. Overworking these days afflicts every age
group, beginning in elementary school. A recent issue of Time
magazine carried this cover headline: ``Too Much Homework!''
</P>
<P>
   According to researchers at the University of Michigan, the
amount of time first-graders, second-graders and third-graders
spent on homework rose from 44 minutes a week in 1981 to two hours
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the homework load for fourth-graders,
fifth-graders and sixth-graders increased from 2 hours and 49
minutes a week, to 3 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Even when kids get a break they don't get a break. What used to
be known as ``recess'' _ kids left to their own devices to frolic
on the playground between classes _ has become a relic.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state education standards encourage ``structured''
play periods instead of recess. Deborah Teitsman, physical
education coordinator for Atlanta Public Schools, ex- plained:
``There's still a time when kids have a choice in what they want to
do. It's just a guided choice.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``guided choice'' seems a bit oxymoronic, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   Lee J. Fried, principal of Sarah Smith Elementary School in
Atlanta and a 28-year veteran of public schools, says such policies
are to be expected in an environment where a kid can't just be a
kid anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less freedom for kids than there used to be for a lot
of reasons,'' he said. ``There's more pressure for them to succeed
at an earlier age.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried remembers that all his parents expected of him was that he
work hard and ``do my best. If I got a `B' or a `C,' that's what I
got.'' But these days, that's not enough for many parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I've gotten calls from parents
asking me why their child didn't get all A's,'' Fried said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the so-called ``slacker'' generation, Gen X, doesn't have
fun the way its parents did 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yankelovich researcher Jennifer Aaron says people in their 20s
and early 30s tend to enjoy themselves more than their elders _
``The nature of youth is they tend to live it up and take risks,''
she said _ but having grown up in the Roaring '80s and seen their
parents cash in, or crash out, Generation X'ers aren't as carefree
as Mom and Dad once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very strong planning ethic, so they're taking care
of themselves very early on _ much earlier than boomers, because
they saw what happened to their parents,'' Aaron said, noting that
Gen X'ers are apt to plot their careers, even their retirement,
straight out of college.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike Mark Scott. Single, 33, and director of
communications for Home Banc in Atlanta. Scott is devoted to his
career. Since college, he's had little time for much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to the office at 7 a.m. and leave about 6 p.m.,'' he
said. ``Then I go to the gym four times a week, work out for two
hours and go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I eat, walk and feed the dog, I'm ready for bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott believes he's having fun when, for instance, he has lunch
with friends or chums around with buddies in the gym. But he's just
not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm missing,'' he said, ``since I'm not
doing it in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Boggs, 50, is a representative boomer who's been through the
grinder. He's still recovering from the economic upheavals of the
past decade, when he was laid off from a job at Digital Equipment
Corp. He started his own business, Grand Slam Plus, a sports
facility in Cobb County (Ga.). The job, he says, is ``fun at
times.'' But it's also a pressure cooker.
</P>
<P>
   He makes 40 percent of what he earned at Digital, and every day
is make or break.
</P>
<P>
   ``My average transaction is $4.62, and I've got to make 230 of
them a day just to break even,'' he said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs works 70-hour weeks. His last vacation was a week at
Myrtle Beach, S.C., in 1996. Staying ahead ``is like being on a
treadmill that's going 5 miles an hour faster than you can run,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that America might emerge from its un-fun funk;
after all, half the population says it wants to ``have more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That shows people are ``ready to reintroduce the emotional parts
of their lives and let off steam,'' researcher Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes time to learn to have fun again, psychologists say.
The process begins with realizing what you're missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who've been obsessed with making money get thrown out
of balance, they get depressed,'' therapist Fried said. ``And they
don't know why, because they've met all the goals they've set for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly trying to add `fun' to your life at age 55 or 60 is
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed says her clients often discover that their depression is
rooted in having ignored their passion: ``They've completely
forgotten that when they were younger, for instance, what really
gave them pleasure was painting or writing poetry or music. When
they rediscover that, it's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Schlossberg, author of ``Overwhelmed: Coping With Life's
Ups and Downs,'' says having fun, in the short term, is as simple
as changing your routine: ``Treat yourself to an expensive dinner,
or doing something you haven't done in years. Go dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Nevada psychologist Jerry May says the people who
have the most fun are those who enjoy their work. If you don't, he
advises finding fun where you can. ``A researcher at the University
of Oregon compiled a list of 316 of the most common pleasant
activities. They're everything from hiking to brushing your teeth
and reading. Begin by savoring these little things,'' he advises.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to have fun will come back _ maybe slowly, but it
will come back if you work on it, psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Boggs is working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a day he stands in the parking lot of Grand Slam Plus and
contemplates the heavens. ``I enjoy just looking at the sky,'' he
said. ``Or I'll have a telephone conversation with my grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find small victories, small wins _ that's my fun.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church has always struggled to speak with one
voice to both the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Pope John Paul II toured Mexico and St. Louis,
he sternly warned against a runaway free-market system based on a
``purely economic conception of man.'' But he also exhorted church
leaders not to forget the wealthier members of their flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love for the poor must be preferential, but not exclusive,''
he said. ``The leading sectors of society have been neglected, and
many people have thus been estranged from the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the pope's avid listeners was Thomas S. Monaghan, the
founder of Domino's Pizza Inc., who has long struggled to balance
his own conflicting impulses towards God and Mammon.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Monaghan sold most of his stake in Domino's, the
world's largest pizza-delivery chain, to Bain Capital Inc., a
private investment firm, for a reported $1 billion. And inspired by
the pope, he vowed to devote the rest of his life _ and his money _
to spreading the Gospel, especially among the business elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, it would have been much better for me to hold
onto the company for another 20 years,'' said Monaghan, 61, who
remains chairman emeritus of Domino's, which is based in Ann Arbor,
Mich. ``But I don't want to take my money with me when I go, and I
don't want to leave it for others. I want to die broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Monaghan plans to use his fortune to finance a network of
Catholic schools, starting with Ave Maria College in Ypsilanti,
Mich., and to support politicians who oppose abortion. He also
wants to promote his conservative agenda through Credo, a
newspaper; WDEO, a radio station he owns, and the Thomas Moore Law
Center, a new Catholic law firm supported by his Mater Christe
Foundation. All are in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, he is focusing his attention on Legatus, a lay
support group for Catholic executives and their spouses that he
believes can ``change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Legatus (Latin for ambassador) came to Monaghan in
1987 as a ``divine inspiration,'' he said, after he met the pope
for the first time, in Rome. He patterned the group after the Young
Presidents' Organization, an international support group for
business leaders. But while YPO is devoted to making its members
better executives, the goal of Legatus, according to the mission
statement, is to encourage Catholic executives to ``study, live and
spread the Faith in our business, professional and personal
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Legatus now has more than 1,300 members in 25 American chapters
and nascent groups in Canada, Mexico and Honduras. Some 275 members
and spouses gathered last weekend in Phoenix for the group's annual
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Monaghan, his company-building days behind him, thinks he
can build Legatus into a major force _ his goal is 10,000 members
or more within five years _ using the same zealous, uncompromising
approach he employed in forging his global network of Domino's
stores. A recent gift from the Mater Christe Foundation doubled
Legatus' annual budget to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disproportionate number of CEOs are Catholic, and there must
be at least 100,000 who would qualify for membership,'' Monaghan
said. ``What I can do is set a good example and get people fired up
about the church. It's what businessmen do: They see a need and
fill it.''
</P>
<P>
   He would just as soon have Legatus, not Domino's, be his legacy.
But he expects to encounter obstacles. ``If Legatus' work is going
to be as important as I think it is, we're going to have a lot of
enemies _ namely the Devil,'' he said. ``He's a fallen angel, very
intelligent. And his spirit is loose in the land.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Monaghan always wanted to be a priest. After his father died
on Christmas Eve in 1941, Tom was placed in a Catholic orphanage.
(His younger brother, Jim, has been quoted as saying that their
mother could not control the boys.)
</P>
<P>
   There, as Monaghan tells the story, Sister Berarda taught him
that God and the Golden Rule were the most important things in
life. But as a 10th grader at the St. Joseph's Seminary in Jackson,
Mich., he was expelled for pillow-fighting and whispering in
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was temperamental as a young man,'' Monaghan said. ``The
rector decided I didn't have the vocation for the priesthood.''
What he did have a vocation for, it turned out, was the pizza
business _ and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he and Jim borrowed $900 and bought a struggling
pizzeria in Ypsilanti, called DomiNick's. A year later, Jim traded
his share for a used Volkswagen Beetle. Meanwhile, Tom built the
business into Domino's.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always easy. In 1970, he dismissed everyone but his
wife and the bookkeeper to avoid bankruptcy. But by last year,
Domino's had 6,250 outlets worldwide with sales of about $3.3
billion and pretax profits of roughly $75 million. Monaghan owned
98 percent; the rest was owned by other family members and longtime
employees.
</P>
<P>
   With success, Monaghan developed a reputation for both religious
devotion and publicity-hungry materialism. He arranged for a priest
to say daily mass at Domino's headquarters. And, happily mugging
for the media along the way, he collected everything from an island
resort to an $8.1 million Bugatti Royale sports car, a $500,000
Frank Lloyd Wright bedroom, and, in 1983, the Detroit Tigers, who
would win the World Series the next year. His infatuations were
all-consuming, though transitory.
</P>
<P>
   He also became an outspoken advocate of a traditional,
politically conservative brand of Catholicism. In 1988, his
faith-based politics and his business collided when the National
Organization for Women led a nationwide boycott of Domino's to
protest Monaghan's support of anti-abortion groups. The controversy
_ along with boycotts by homosexuals and other groups _ angered
some Domino's franchisees and colored the company's image.
</P>
<P>
   Monaghan founded Legatus a year after the American bishops of
the church issued a letter critiquing Reagan-era capitalism and
calling for fair wages, stronger unions, a guarantee of full
employment and other economic policies that took the powerless into
account.
</P>
<P>
   The letter drew strong reaction from leading Catholic
conservatives like the theologian Michael Novak and William E.
Simon, Treasury secretary in the Ford administration (and later a
Legatus member), who defended free-market capitalism. But Monaghan
was not part of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Monaghan is not concerned with politics or the lay
culture,'' said Novak, who was a speaker at the Legatus national
conference last weekend. ``His point of reference is the personal.
He founded Legatus when it was right for him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Monaghan, the late 1980s were a time when his interest in
managing Domino's day to day was waning, while his Catholic
activism was rising. He underwrote construction of a mission in the
Honduran mountain town of San Pedro Sula and paid $3.5 million of
the $4.5 million cost of building a cathedral in Managua,
Nicaragua, that was favored by the conservative Miguel Cardinal
Obando y Bravo and opposed by liberal Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he was made a Knight of Malta, thus joining an
international charitable group with a conservative cast. He also
hired several members of the Word of God, a charismatic Catholic
group active in right-wing causes, though Monaghan says he was
never a member himself.
</P>
<P>
   Critics began to say that religion was merely a stalking horse
for his political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``His goal is to spread his conservative ideas, and he just
waves a thin veil of religion in front of them,'' said Barbara A.
Pott, coordinator of a Michigan branch of Call to Action, a liberal
Catholic organization.
</P>
<P>
   Monaghan is indifferent to such talk. ``The things I do always
bring out praise and criticism,'' he said. ``It doesn't bother me.
You have to do God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that he was neglecting Domino's at the
time. Competitors introduced new menu items and upgraded their
computer systems. Domino's floundered, burdened with a half-billion
dollars in debt, and Monaghan tried unsuccessfully to sell the
company.
</P>
<P>
   It was C.S. Lewis' book ``Mere Christianity,'' which uses
everyday situations to explore the fundamentals of Christian faith,
that helped him regain his equilibrium, Monaghan said. After lying
awake one night thinking about what a ``bad'' person he was,
Monaghan said that he decided to renounce his big sin: pride.
</P>
<P>
   Rededicating himself, as he put it, to, ``God, family and
pizza,'' Monaghan in 1991 began selling off his collections at
fire-sale prices. Drummond Island, a Lake Huron resort for which he
had paid $28 million, sold for $3 million; the Bugatti went for $5
million. He even sold the Tigers to Michael Ilitch, the chief
executive of rival Little Caesar Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   He restructured Domino's debt, invested in computers, laid off
600 administrative employees, devised new products like a pizza
with garlic in the crust and, in 1993, abandoned the company's
signature 30-minute delivery guarantee, which was a lightning rod
for lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, the company was in its best financial shape ever, with
money to pour into a $150 million image-freshening campaign and to
add outlets in India and China. Then, last May, in Rome, Monaghan
decided it was time to sell the company once and for all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, the New Testament says.
But for members of Legatus, the pursuit of faith and trade are _ or
are supposed to be _ complementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``CEOs have the biggest need of spiritual guidance of any group
of individuals anywhere; they can get so carried away with their
own perceived value to the human race,'' said J. Michael Hagan, a
Legatus member who is chief executive of the Furon Co., a publicly
traded plastics maker in Laguna Niguel, Calif., with 3,300
employees. ``Ego can destroy you,'' he said. ``The best way to keep
your ego in check is through spiritual contemplation.''
</P>
<P>
   The last few years, the workplace has increasingly served as an
organizing platform for spiritual quests by business people of many
faiths _ lunch-hour and after-work Bible, Torah and Koran study
groups, for instance. But a religious organization of corporate
leaders can still raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynics might say, `Here are a bunch of good old boys who made
a pile of money on earth, and now they want to buy some heavenly
insurance,' '' acknowledged the Rev. George Rutler, a priest of the
Archdiocese of New York who serves as national chaplain of Legatus.
``There is a tendency to strike a rather condescending stance
towards businessmen; it's assumed that a successful entrepreneur
has stolen money from the poor. But many of our members marvel at
their own success, or are even a bit threatened by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, Legatus chapters _ which range in size from 10
couples in Canton, Ohio, to 70 couples in Detroit _ convene at a
chapel for mass, then move to a hotel or restaurant for dinner and
a lecture by a church or lay person. The idea is to give executives
and their spouses a chance to pray and reflect, to talk about
integrating faith into their secular lives and to be educated.
</P>
<P>
   Lecturers at various chapters have included Sister Helen
Prejean, the author of ``Dead Man Walking'' (Random House, 1993),
who spoke about inequities of capital punishment; a rabbi speaking
on Jewish-Catholic relations; Catholic psychiatrists on
homosexuality, and a writer on why ``Angels Aren't Just Pretty
Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Luminaries who have spoken before national or local meetings of
the group include former President Ronald Reagan, former United
States Court of Appeals Judge Robert H. Bork and John Cardinal
O'Connor of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, at the national conference in Phoenix, William J.
Bennett, the author and former Education secretary, filled in as a
speaker for Rep. Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois _ who was
busy in Washington with the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Legatus come from 675 companies in a wide range
of businesses. They can be the chairman, chief executive or
president of a company with at least 30 full-time employees and
annual sales of $5 million (or with 10 employees and $100 million
in annual business for financial services companies).
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of members are lower-ranking corporate officers
or board members at much larger corporations. Retired executives
can belong, too. Of the more than 1,300 members, 31 are women who
own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dues range from $1,200 to $2,000 a year, depending on the
chapter, and each member is expected to contribute $550 to the
national office every year, with 10 percent of that money given to
the Vatican as a tithe. Last year, after 50 members traveled to
Rome with Monaghan _ a trip that included an audience with the pope
_ the group sent a check for $250,000 to the Vatican and asked that
the money be used for the Holy See's charities in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   While some members have enlisted for spiritual education, others
are motivated by social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as Christ's ambassador to the marketplace of
health care,'' said Adeline A. Laforet, chief executive of Health
Care Professionals Ltd., a medical staffing service in Southfield,
Mich. ``I believe there is a terrible hunger for faith right now,
and I want to tap into that energy and evangelize the marketplace.`
</P>
<P>
   James D. Davidson, a professor of sociology at Purdue University
who spoke to the Indianapolis chapter, said: ``I was surprised by
the range of views expressed when I asked their opinions on faith
and morals. Some were very traditional, but others were clearly
exploring other points of view. They weren't authoritarian or
closed-minded. They're the same kind of people I run into at the
country club.''
</P>
<P>
   What many members share _ and discuss at Legatus meetings _ is
the experience of having their faith and ethics tested by
challenges at work.
</P>
<P>
   When Albert H. Langsenkamp, chief executive of the Sigma/Micro
Corp., faced a financial squeeze a year ago, he had to lay off
several of his 75 or so workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was personally very humbling,'' said Langsenkamp, whose
closely held Indianapolis company develops computer systems. ``As
chief executive, I felt I had done something wrong to get us into
that situation. The Golden Rule says treat people as you wish to be
treated. I apologized to the workers,'' he said, and ``asked for
their cooperation and forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Langsenkamp is largely compensated by dividends, he took
a financial hit when the company did; his laid-off employees were
given 30-days' severance.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Laforet of Health Care Professionals said, ``Legatus is
absolutely the reason I learned to take a stand on ethics in the
workplace.'' When it looked last fall as if the Michigan
Legislature might pass a measure legalizing assisted suicide, she
helped rally opposition with a mass mailing to everyone in the
company's data base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time we as a company took a stand on
anything, and we won a magnificent victory,'' she said, noting the
bill's defeat. ``Part of our business is to deal with end-of-life
issues, and we do not believe it's OK to die in a van with Dr.
Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how long Legatus will hold Monaghan's
notoriously fickle attention and how his personal style, which he
describes as ``intense,'' will affect the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of members run privately held companies. But about
20 percent are executives of publicly held businesses and are
therefore more vulnerable to criticism from shareholders,
directors, analysts or customers who take issue with the church's
views on hot-button topics like abortion, divorce, assisted suicide
and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though J. Peter Grace, the late chairman of W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co., was a charter member, there are few heads of major, publicly
held corporations on the group's roster. Monaghan said that when he
asked Roberto C. Goizueta, who was the chief executive of
Coca-Cola, to join the group, Goizueta declined because he was
concerned about the reaction of shareholders. Goizueta died in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, members who head publicly held companies say their faith
does not get in the way of doing their jobs. ``I accept fully the
church's position on those issues, and I've made no secret of my
feelings,'' said William R. Burleigh, chief executive of the E.W.
Scripps Co., the Cincinnati-based owner of newspapers and
television stations. But, he said, ``these are matters of intense
importance, and they need to be discussed,'' adding, ``I accept
others' points of view no matter how vigorously I disagree with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ranking executives who belong to Legatus include Frank A.
Olson, the chief executive of the Hertz Corp., and Harry J.
Longwell, an Exxon Corp. senior vice president. Wellington Mara,
owner of the New York Giants, is also a member, along with Roger
Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback who is now a Texas
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Monaghan's plan to expand Legatus rapidly has some members
fretting that the organization will create an unwieldy bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Legatus is Monaghan's mission now, and when you are
wrestling with the Devil, you don't play games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to every idea, and if I don't agree I give a decisive
but sensitive response,'' he said. ``That's what I did with the
franchisees my whole career. Legatus is a volunteer group. If
people don't like what I'm doing, they can go form their own
organization.''

SPORTS CLUMN: LOTS OF READING AND REBOUNDS, BUT LITTLE SLEEP
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The referee tossed the ball in the air for the jump
ball that began a recent college basketball game, and one center
jumped and the other didn't. One just stood there, crouched, with
his hands on his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's all right to jump for the ball,'' his coach
shouted from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   George Politis smiled as he recalled the advice from his coach.
``But I was out of gas from the start,'' said the burly,
square-jawed, 6-foot-4-inch center for St. Joseph's College of
Patchogue, N.Y., a Division III program on Long Island. ``Wasn't
the first time. I don't get a lot of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that Politis, 25, the team's leading scorer and
leading rebounder, occasionally may be too tired to jump or run on
a basketball court may be expected, since he frequently spends part
of his day, and night, chasing after alleged criminals.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not involved in schoolwork, and when he is not
wearing the gold-and-navy uniform of the Golden Eagles basketball
team, Politis is wearing the blue of the New York Police
Department, where he is in his third year as an officer out of the
13th Precinct in the Gramercy section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Politis, a junior in college, left St. Joseph's in 1996 to join
the police force and then, last month, decided to return to school
_ but remained on the beat.
</P>
<P>
   As the world turns more toward professionalism in sports in
every area, from payment of college athletes to payment of
sanctimonious Olympic officials, Politis plays college basketball
for no money, no free sneakers, no athletic scholarship _ Division
III rules it out _ no nothing, as the saying goes, except for the
joy of the game. A shocking thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had put in two years of school, and I felt I wanted to
finish what I had started,'' Politis said on a recent morning at
breakfast _ or was it dinner? _ after he had finished his tour of
duty at Bellevue hospital, where he had been guarding a physically
ailing prisoner. ``And I love basketball. To be able to compete
again in organized ball was something I missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Politis works the midnight shift as a police officer, drives to
school for classes, attends basketball practices and plays in
games. The team has an 8-10 record and plays host to Old Westbury
at 6 Saturday night. Politis snatches some sleep when he can in his
bachelor apartment near the school, and studies when he can.
``Like, I was relieved for an hour from guarding the prisoner last
night,'' he said. ``So I took the opportunity to read Nietzsche for
my philosophy class.''
</P>
<P>
   If hospital personnel did a double-take at the sight of this
scholarly cop, Politis didn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   But the times that he can't muster energy in basketball are
overshadowed by the times he can. In the first week he was back in
a basketball uniform, he was named player of the week in the
Skyline Conference. In a recent game in White Plains against
Manhattanville he scored 20 points, with a combination of strong
and nifty moves around the basket, and took down 15 rebounds (he
holds the school record with 22 in a game). But St. Joseph's lost a
close game in the last seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was great in the game, a typical game for him,'' said
Joe Maniaci, his coach, ``though I had to rest him for periods down
the stretch. But he's an inspiration to us. Here's a guy with a
full-time job who comes to play and plays hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Politis takes needling from players and coach. ``There are a
lot of old-man jokes,'' Politis said with a smile. ``And the coach
gets on me, sometimes, but my training in the police academy helped
me learn better discipline. You take a lot of abuse there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Politis had dreamed of becoming a policeman since he was a boy,
and television shows like ``Hill Street Blues'' made the work seem
glamorous. Not that it always has been, and he is aware of the
dangers. He wears a light-blue memorial wrist band with the
inscription ``Anthony W. Sanchez,'' for a fellow officer in the
precinct, and the date, ``May 19, 1997,'' when Sanchez was shot and
killed in the line of duty. But Politis said he enjoyed the work,
though he was also aware of criticisms of the force, like those
resulting from the recent shooting and killing of an unarmed man in
the Bronx. ``I wasn't there,'' Politis said. ``I can't comment.''
</P>
<P>
   While his police colleagues have been supportive in giving him
assignments that will allow him his college time, Politis, the
center with the badge, also must suffer their barbs about his
basketball, such as ``Would you grow up already?'' and ``Let it go,
man.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen, apparently, until his Nietzsche and his
basketball eligibility are completed.

STATE BILLS TAKE AIM AT `SPAM'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Va., Md.)   (af)  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As lawmakers around the country discover that their constituents
are concerned about Internet issues, bills to regulate or outlaw
junk e-mail are popping up in state legislatures. Three laws
restricting junk e-mail are already on the books, and lawmakers are
considering four more.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the laws say they are encouraged by the states'
interest in protecting consumers and Internet service providers
from the scourge of junk e-mail, known as spam. But they worry that
a patchwork of different state laws could hamper legitimate on-line
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer a single good federal law, but if we can't
find a federal solution, we're going to have to work state by
state,'' said John Mozena, a board member of the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail. ``We don't want to make it difficult
for people to do authentic business on line,'' he continued. ``We
just want them to be paying their own freight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last Congress, a coalition-backed proposal to extend to
e-mail an existing law banning junk faxes made little headway. A
weaker measure, favored by the Direct Marketers Association and
requiring that junk e-mail be labeled as advertising and that
recipients be given an easy way to get off mailing lists, passed in
the Senate but stalled in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail coalition and the marketers' group said in December
that they had tentatively agreed on a joint proposal, but Mozena
said last week that he was unsure the agreement would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   A bill in Texas appears to be the broadest a state has yet
considered; it would outlaw any unsolicited advertisement that
imposes a cost or charge on the recipient, addressing one of the
main complaints about junk e-mail. Bills in Washington and Maryland
would protect Internet service providers by making it illegal to
violate providers' rules against spam.
</P>
<P>
   A Virginia bill would outlaw use of forged headers to obscure
junk e-mail's true origin.

PAN AM GYMNASTIC TRIALS SET FOR CAL POLY POMONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Many of the nation's best female gymnasts,
including Vanessa Atler, Jamie Dantzscher and Tabitha Yim of
Charter Oak Gymnastics, will be at Cal Poly Pomona this weekend for
the Pan American Games Trials.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are six spots on the team that will represent the
United States this summer in Winnipeg. Many of the same gymnasts
likely will compete for the U.S. at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gymnasts coming in from all over the country,'' said
promotions director Anna Furman of SCATS Gymnastics, the host club
for the Trials. ``Basically, it will be a chance to see the best in
women's gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's event will feature 31 gymnasts in the Junior
International Division at 7 p.m. The Senior International Division,
showcasing 37 gymnasts, is scheduled for Sunday at 2 p.m. at
Kellogg Gym.
</P>
<P>
   The format calls for one round of all-around competition per
division of optional exercises only. The top six all-around scores
_ the total of all four apparatus _ of any age-eligible gymnast,
regardless of division, will comprise the team.
</P>
<P>
   Meet director Don Peters, also the director for SCATS, said both
sessions will feature top-flight talent despite the junior and
senior designations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that because of the junior tag for Saturday's
meet, I think people see that and automatically think it's a lesser
event,'' Peters said. ``But there's a lot of kids in that session
that have a really good shot. I will go out on a limb and predict
that some of those kids will make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the gymnasts competing are three who train at Charter Oak
Gymnastics in Covina; Atler, of Canyon Country, Dantzscher, a San
Dimas High student, and Yim, of Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Atler, ranked No. 2 in the country after finishing as runner-up
U.S. National Champion in 1998-99, held the country's top spot in
1997-98 and was the U.S. Junior National Champion in 1996-97. She
will compete in Sunday's competition.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher, also a Sunday competitor, is ranked No.9 overall and
is a current U.S. national team member. Yim, 13, who joined Charter
Oak two months ago, will compete in today's session.
</P>
<P>
   The other notable entry from Southern California is Jeanette
Antolin, who trains at SCATS in Huntington Beach and is ranked No.
6 in the nation.

TRAVEL CHAOS AS SICKOUT BY AMERICAN AIRLINES PILOTS CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Creating chaos on the busiest travel day of the
Presidents' Day holiday weekend, American Airlines was once again
forced to cancel about half its scheduled flights Friday because of
the labor dispute with its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   More than a fourth of the airline's pilots called in sick in
defiance of a federal judge's order, disrupting air travel across
the country for the seventh day.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Boston, New York and other cities, police and
passengers described scenes of overcrowded terminals and irate
passengers, some of whom erupted into screaming at American's
passenger service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the American terminal at Kennedy International Airport in New
York, Port Authority police were sent to quell several dozen angry
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   American appealed to the judge, Joe Kendall of the federal
district court in Dallas, to hold the pilots' union in contempt for
failing to comply with his order.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge put off his ruling until Saturday morning,
although he strongly warned the union to press the 2,443 pilots who
called in sick Friday to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   American, a subsidiary of the AMR Corp., canceled 1,102 of its
2,250 scheduled flights Friday. It also canceled 536 scheduled
flights Saturday and 290 flights Sunday, although those numbers are
expected to rise significantly if the pilots' sickout continues.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said they announced the cancellations because
of staffing problems and so many airplanes were out of position.
</P>
<P>
   In one measure of passenger frustration, Steve Vives, 39, a
resident of the Bronx who stood in line for hours at Kennedy Friday
before abandoning his attempt to fly to Aruba, shouted, ``The
pilots should be arrested and put in jail!''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, hundreds of passengers took up a vulgar chant directed
at American.
</P>
<P>
   What apparently pushed many passengers over the edge was the
realization that they really did not have any prospect of getting
to their destination, on American or on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passengers on other airlines had booked their
flights days or even weeks ago, airline spokesmen said, because
they realized that planes usually fly full at or near capacity
during a three-day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients were pretty understanding for the first few days
of the strike,'' said Kay Dickson, who owns a travel agency in Fort
Worth, Tex., ``but now a lot of them are angry and they're booking
on other airlines for flights even a month from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport anger was in some cases shared by American
employees. When one of her clients complained to an American
employee at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said Nancy A.
Strong, a Dallas travel agent, the employee snapped back: ``We're
not to blame. Take up your complaints with the pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   Several travel agents, including Ms. Strong, said that the chaos
that reached a crescendo Friday was likely to give ammunition to
demands for a so-called passenger bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   A bill recently introduced in Congress would require airlines to
pay passengers double the cost of their tickets for delays of two
hours or more, and triple after three hours. ``At least it's
something,'' Ms. Strong said, ``because now passengers have no
recourse.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines passengers bound for Latin America, where the
carrier is also a powerhouse, had to move quickly in order to
re-book on other airlines. But many flights to South America had at
least some seats available, because of the growing number of
airlines flying those routes in the last several years, and by the
difference in seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of the summer in Argentina and Chile, but
because a lot of businessmen in those countries aren't yet back
from vacation, business travel to both countries is lighter than
usual,'' said Alex Degunten, vice president of international
flights for Lan Chile Airlines, which itself has almost 40 flights
a week between Chile and the United States. ``Also, Chile is one of
the few countries where American is not No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Business comes to a virtual standstill this time of year in
Brazil, where carnival brings back thousands of Brazilian citizens
who live in the United States, and brings many American tourists as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 75 to 80 percent of the traffic to Brazil at carnival is
Brazilian, and planes are carrying heavy loads,'' said Paulo Leite,
the area sales manager in New York for Varig Brazilian Airlines,
which has almost 50 flights a week between Brazil and the United
States. But with so many airlines now flying that route, he added,
and because of the current weakness of the Brazilian currency,
Varig does not plan to add additional flights.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines in South Florida were relieved Friday when American
reinstated many of the flights to Miami that it had canceled over
the last week.
</P>
<P>
   For days cruise line officials worried how the American
cancellations would affect the approximately 40,000 passengers who
were booked on Caribbean cruises this weekend, and about the same
number of passengers who were due back into port from last week's
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   That question will not be answered finally until Sunday.
Meantime, Norwegian Cruise Line had weeks ago chartered planes to
fly passengers to and from Miami this weekend, knowing that space
on airplanes would be at a premium. And Royal Caribbean managed to
charter three planes beginning last Wednesday to accommodate
passengers flying to and from Boston, Newark, Philadelphia and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In all the turmoil, there were some humorous moments. Some
stranded passengers, for example, were chortling over a news
article about a passenger whose American flight to Dallas from
Toronto on Tuesday had been canceled, forcing him to fly back on
Continental. That passenger: Robert L. Crandall, the hard-driving
former chairman and chief executive of American, who had himself
presided over strikes involving flight attendants and pilots. &QL;

L.A. INVITATIONAL ALREADY A GRAY AREA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Johnny Gray has competed throughout the world and
in four Olympics during his career. The L.A. Invitational indoor
meet at the Sports Arena, however, holds special significance for
the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who will soon turn 39, will be seeking an unprecedented
sixth victory in the L.A. Invitational tonight when he competes in
the 800 meters at the 39th annual event. No other athlete has won
the half-mile more than three times.
</P>
<P>
   For Gray however, who won his first L.A. Invitational in 1985
and is the three-time defending champion, the meet's proximity to
his Agoura Hills home offers the most incentive to return year
after year to the banked boards of the Sports Arena track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to run at your best when you have been traveling on
a plane for 12 hours and living out of your suitcase in Europe,''
Gray said. ``I find I run my best races close to home when I can
sleep in my own bed, get in my car and drive to the meet in an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's indoor performances at the L.A. and San Diego
invitationals would attest to that. In the 1985 L.A. Invitational,
Gray set the world indoor record of 1 minute, 46.8 seconds in the
880 yards. At the 1986 San Diego meet, Gray clocked 2:04.39 for the
world indoor 1,000-yard standard. Both marks stand as world bests
for a 160-yard track. Gray has also held the American outdoor
record at 1:42.60 since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Gray will face a field which includes Santa Monica
Track Club teammates Isaac Turner, the 1997 Pacific-10 champion
from USC, and Jean Destine and UCLA's Jess Strutzel, who finished
second to Gray in the San Diego Invitational on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Invitational, sponsored by the Daily News, is part of
USA Track &AMP; Field's four-meet Golden Spike Tour. The series that
began with the Millrose Games on Feb. 5 also includes the D.C.
Invitational and the USATF Indoor Championships in Atlanta later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   This year's L.A. Invitational will boast its strongest field
since 1986 when four world records were set within two hours,
according to meet co-chairman Don Franken. In all, the competition
will feature five Olympic gold medalists and world-record holders
as well as 23 athletes ranked among the world's top 10 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 50 meters, Maurice Greene, the 1997 World Champion
in the 100 meters, will face 1998 national champion Tim Harden.
Harden won the 100 meters at the USATF outdoor championships in New
Orleans in June in the absence of Greene, ranked No. 1 in the
world, who scratched from the competition because of cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia's Mark Crear, the world's top-ranked 110-meter high
hurdler, will face national champion Reggie Torian and Dan O'Brien
in the men's 50-meter high hurdles. O'Brien, the world
record-holder in the decathlon, will also compete in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   In other circuit events, Jeff Hartwig, the U.S. record-holder in
the pole vault, and former national record-holder Lawrence Johnson
head a field of seven of the top 10 vaulters in the U.S. Inger
Miller and Chryste Gaines, members of the U.S. 1996 Olympic gold
medal 400-meter relay and the 1997 World Championship team which
won in an American record, will go head-to-head in the women's 50
meters.
</P>
<P>
   The high school competition will feature nearly 2,000 athletes.
Blaine Bussey of Taft could challenge the meet record in the boys'
500 yards. Bussey, a senior, won the event in 57.3 at the San Diego
Invitational to move into a three-way tie for second on the
all-time high school list.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Fleshman of Canyon, the 1998 state Division I cross
country champion, and Bridget Pearson of Hoover, the 1997 state
girls' pole vault champion, are also scheduled to compete. Oliver
Jackson of Royal and Tim Adrian of Moorpark, the defending Ventura
County champions in the long jump and discus, highlight the field
events.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Burgess of Birmingham, the three-time City Section
1,600-meter champion, and Lisa Wygant of Camarillo, defending
Southern Section Division I high jump champion, are other entrants.

PETS TREATED LIKE PART OF THE FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Your boss was on a rampage today. The phone never
stopped ringing. Lunch was a candy bar from the vending machine.
And traffic crawled all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   But the minute you open the door, you know there'll be somebody
there to give you a big, wet smooch, listen to your problems and
offer as much cuddling as you can handle.
</P>
<P>
   And he's got a cold, wet nose and a wagging tail, too. Or maybe
a throaty purr and a way of curling around your legs that makes the
rest of the world recede for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us, beset by life's troubles and travails, our pets
are a haven, a refuge, a place of peace and solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that pets were called pets,'' said Bill
Schoolman, executive director of the American Pet Products
Manufacturers Association. ``Then they were `companion animals.'
Now, they're part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like our human children, we take their pictures, enroll
them in (obedience) schools, dress them in cute outfits. We buy
them the best food we can afford, hire doctors to soothe their
ailments. And, at the end of life's journey, we buy a cemetery plot
and headstone to memorialize them.
</P>
<P>
   To keep these furry, feathered or finned friends happy,
Americans shell out at least $27 billion annually. Is it all worth
it? You bet, say pet lovers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pets fill our lives with love,'' said psychotherapist
Sherry Gantman of Tarzana. ``And they teach us simplicity. It just
doesn't take that much to make a pet happy, and you recognize that
for yourself as well. They teach us how to love in the very
simplest way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 58.2 million households, or 58.9 percent of U.S. families,
include a pet. More than 112 million dogs, cats and other assorted
animals fill our lives, according to a 1997 survey of pet owners by
the American Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   A need for four-footed companionship isn't a modern trend;
people have owned pets for centuries. The first dogs, besides
providing companionship, helped early man track wild game and herd
sheep. Early domestic cats were regarded by the Egyptians as gods;
later, they were sought-after mouse-catchers on farms and ships.
</P>
<P>
   In today's society, animal experts say, pets may provide a
primal connection with nature at a time when people are growing
more isolated from each other. Many people are marrying and having
families later, or not at all, and for singles, pets can provide
something _ somebody _ to come home to. For empty-nesters whose
children are grown and on their own, pets can offer a chance to
nurture again. And for elderly people, pets can provide a reason to
get up in the morning, a reason to take a walk, to stay active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets are taking a much more important role in people's lives
than just being the family dog,'' said Mark Davis, administrator of
Veterinary Referral Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., sometimes
referred to as the Mayo Clinic of veterinary hospitals. ``Pets fill
a void.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pet projects &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some of us, in fact, our pets are our best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as auto detailer Ron Costello of Woodland Hills _ owner of
two dogs, a cat, two tortoises and an iguana _ puts it, ``Your
dog'll never do you wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   How could you provide less than the best for such a friend? This
widespread affection for pets is a marketing analyst's dream.
</P>
<P>
   It's a $20 billion a year business for what the U.S. Census
Bureau says in 1992 totaled 87,000 pet retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   And the nationwide bill for veterinary care rose from $4.9
billion in 1991 to more than $7 billion in 1996, according to the
AVMA.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are willing spenders, you will find eager
entrepreneurs, and the pet industry has been joined by many. Among
them are purveyors of pet journals, pet greeting cards, pet
sitting, pet Web sites, pet day care, pet medical advice, pet
breeding and pet naming.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the most devoted _ or fanatical _ pet owners at pet
shows and entering pet contests such as the Friskies PetCare Co.'s
``Friskiest Cat in America'' photo contest or Purina Dog Chow's
``America's Most Incredible Dog'' contest. The rewards: a hefty
supply of food for the pet and up to $10,000 for its owner.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't find it in a specialty pet store or on the
Internet, surely one of the nation's pet super stores, each stocked
with more than 10,000 items, will have something to satisfy even
the most finicky four-legged friend.
</P>
<P>
   While animals around the house are nothing new, this expansion
of the pet retail market is a recent phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based PetSmart Inc. started in 1987 as a two-store
chain. Twelve years later, it's the No. 1 pet retailer in sales,
raking in $1.3 billion in the first 11 months of 1998 at 532 stores
in 45 U.S. states, Canada and England.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Petco, the No. 2 pet retailer, started with one
store in 1965 and now has 465 locations in 37 states that did
$188.6 million in sales in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want their companions to be happy,'' said Petco
spokesman Don Cowan. ``They pamper them. As a result, a lot of
money is being spent on pets.'' &QL;

AFTER VOTE, PRESIDENT CALLS FOR RECONCILIATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a 13-month sex scandal that led to the second
impeachment trial in US history, President Clinton Friday offered a
sober, muted reaction to his acquittal, saying, ``This can be and
this must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared briefly in the White House Rose Garden about
two hours after the Senate voted not to convict him on two articles
of impeachment. And, in an apparent effort to keep a recent White
House promise not to gloat about the outcome, the president did not
even express relief that the ordeal had finally ended, and in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to the tone of defiance the White House struck
at a pep rally that followed the Dec. 19 House vote to impeach him,
Clinton Friday appeared solo before a bank of cameras and
reporters, projecting the image of a humbled man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Senate has fulfilled its constitutional
responsibility, bringing this process to a conclusion, I want to
say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what
I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they
have imposed on the Congress and on the American people,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``humbled and very grateful for the support and
the prayers I have received from millions of Americans over this
past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all Americans, here in
Washington and throughout our land, will rededicate ourselves to
the work of serving our nation and building our future together,''
he said. ``This can and this must be a time of reconciliation and
renewal for America.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Clinton turned to walk back to the Oval Office, where
he is assured to stay for the remainder of his term. But when a
reporter shouted, ``In your heart, sir, can you forgive and
forget?'' he paused and pivoted back to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be
prepared to give it,'' Clinton said. He ignored a second shouted
question about whether he felt vindicated by the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   While the president took pains not to appear elated or to claim
exoneration by the Senate vote, his lawyers appeared to enjoy a
victory stroll of sorts, walking from the White House through
Lafayette Park to a nearby restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief counsel Charles F.C. Ruff and several of the
president's personal and private attorneys left through the White
House gates, about 45 minutes before Clinton's Rose Garden
statement.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen spectators peering through the wrought iron
gates, rushed to greet them with applause, though one man booed.
The lawyers nodded and smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to lunch. We will enjoy it,'' said Clinton's
private attorney, David E. Kendall, as the other lawyers waved off
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it feels really good,'' Kendall said, nodding in
agreement when asked if he was glad the trial was over.
``Definitely for the American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another onlooker approached Ruff, who uses a wheelcheer, and
bent over to hug him. ``Every day I have lived through this process
has been like Friday the 13th,'' the woman, One Brooks, said
afterward. ``I'm so glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   While the outcome of the Senate vote has been assured for weeks,
if not months, Clinton spent the night before thinking about what
he would say, and worked on his 82-second statement Friday morning
and again shortly before delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   When senators voted 45-55 against conviction for perjury and
50-50 against obstruction of justice, Clinton was in the White
House residence doing his daily exercises, after having spent time
chatting briefly with his wife, some of her friends, and his
mother-in-law, all of whom are visiting.
</P>
<P>
   The president's chief of staff, John Podesta, called him after
each vote to relay the tally and to tell him ``who had voted which
way,'' said presidential spokesman Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton had no plans to celebrate. ``I think,
given the circumstances of this matter that's gone on for this
long, we can be relieved it's over, but there's really nothing to
celebrate,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key response was, at least outwardly, in keeping with
Lockhart's recent pledge that the White House would be a
``gloat-free zone'' in the ``post-impeachment era.''
</P>
<P>
   That promise was made after both Republicans and Democrats
roundly criticized the White House for its response to the House
vote to impeach Clinton in December. Back then, busloads of House
Democrats gathered on the South Lawn, and washed Clinton with
applause as he walked out of the White House, with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton clutching his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, jaws clenched, that day vowed to remain in office
``until the last hour of the last day of my term,'' while Vice
President Al Gore said he believed the House vote ``does a great
disservice to a man I believe will be regarded in the history books
as one of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   While aides say that Clinton believes he was unfairly targeted
by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and some House Republicans
who voted to impeach him, he is still willing to work with Congress
across party lines, to deal with issues such as shoring up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton also plans to gear up to help
Democrats in the 2000 election, beginning with a commitment to
attend one fund-raiser a month for the next five months.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to his staff, Clinton apologized for how the
scandal had made their work harder. He wrote that the best way to
repay them is to ``redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideas
we share.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the White House atmosphere, Lockhart said: ``For
those of us who have had to engage in this on a daily basis, relief
is the most descriptive and accurate word that I can use.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``So there's no great high or low from a day like
today except relief that it's over and we can all move on.''

Los Angeles:  a lot of money is being spent on pets.''

   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Opening day at Three Dog Bakery in Old Pasadena was a testament
to man's weakness for his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tasty treats are the product of the Kansas City, Mo.-based
operation that opened its 16th branch in Pasadena on Jan. 30 at the
One West Colorado pedestrian mall. And nearly 4,000 people and 800
dogs came the first day to sample the goodies, said co-owner Mark
Bodnar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shoulder-to-shoulder and haunch-to-haunch,'' Bodnar
joked. ``When we opened, Pasadena went to the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Dog Bakery _ founded in 1992 by Mark Beckloff, an
ex-accountant, and Dan Dye, a former copywriter _ specializes in
dog treats made from ingredients humans can enjoy, too. Seven years
later, the duo has licensed 15 stores across the country, and plans
to open another 10 in the next two months, including one March 6 in
West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are encouraged to bring their dogs in so they can pick
out their own treats and chow down right in the store. On the menu
at each Three Dog Bakery are treats like Boxer Brownies and Bulldog
Bars ($3 each) and Pup Tarts (50 cents). For $200, an owner can buy
his dog a specially made, sugarless birthday cake. Within a few
months, the bakeries will also offer $2 servings of pet ice cream
with a yogurt base.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it is healthful, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are eating healthier,'' said Beckloff, ``and we think
it's a way to show their dogs that they care about their health,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Three Dog chefs are working on perfecting cat treats, but
... well, cats are more finicky about taste than dogs, Beckloff
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem Bob Ditchik is trying to solve at his Pet
Greetings firm, based in Westlake Village. The company makes
rawhide greeting cards _ available for $2 at many pet stores and
veterinarians' offices _ that dogs love to chew on, but he hasn't
been able to perfect a card that appeals to cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it, though,'' he said. ``People want to have
treats for all their animals. That's why people like our cards.
With a regular card, the owner reads it, but the dog gets nothing.
With our card, the dog gets to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal lover, Ditchik said his one regret is that constant
business travel keeps him from having a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty empty when you get home,'' he said. ``There's
something about a pet that brings a feeling that somebody's there
waiting for you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking care
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone will open a pet rental service that'll deliver a
pet of your choice to your home to greet you with loving kisses
when you return from a long trip. Sound far-fetched? Maybe. But if
pet lovers demand it, you know someone out there will one day offer
it.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew 20 years ago that the human obsession with pets would
spawn pet sitters? It didn't take long for the 2,800 licensed,
bonded sitters in the United States, Canada, England and a few
European countries to organize themselves into a group called Pet
Sitters International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your pet is your surrogate kid, so why wouldn't you hire a
professional to take care of it?'' said Kay Calzolari, spokeswoman
for the North Carolina-based organization. ``Used to be, if you
were away from home, you'd hire the kid down the street to feed the
dog, but that kid has grown up and turned pet-sitting into a
profitable business.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of pet owners hire sitters when they're away
from home, Calzolari said. That translates into 13.5 million home
visits a year, most at a rate of $12 to $15 a visit _ a $162
million to $202.5 million annual business.
</P>
<P>
   (Pet owners can avoid a pet sitter's bill for the day on June 25
by observing Take Your Dog to Work Day, sponsored by PSI.)
</P>
<P>
   And all this spending doesn't end when it's time to tell our
pets that final goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   When death comes, many people provide their pet one final bit of
pampering with a satin-lined coffin and burial at Los Angeles Pet
Memorial Park in Calabasas, Southern California's oldest pet
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1928, more than 40,000 pets have been buried on rolling
hills covered with animal sculptures, stuffed animals, pet toys,
flowers and colorful whirligigs. Those who lie there range from the
famous _ MGM's Leo the Lion, Hopalong Cassidy's horse and Rudolph
Valentino's Doberman _ to family dogs and cats, rabbits, snakes and
an occasional guinea pig. Burial costs range from $200 to thousands
of dollars for large animals or elaborate services.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Newth, an actress and cemetery board member, has buried
two of her dogs _ Alfie and Spooky _ in a plot that has room for
nearly a half-dozen more pets. Losing her dogs _ in particular,
Alfie, a 70-pound golden retriever/collie mix, who suffered from
lymphatic cancer _ has been one of the most devastating things in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   It was like ``losing anyone in your life that's important to
you. I felt the same as when my father died, but it's a different
kind of missing,'' said Newth. ``An animal is there for you 100
percent, shares in your sorrows and plays with you and depends on
you to take care of it. It's like a child that never grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people never really recover from a pet's death, said Encino
family therapist Zoe Sager, who leads pet grief support groups. (To
join, call (818) 754-1550.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With people that we lose, there are a lot of unresolved
issues, unresolved grief,'' Sager said. ``With a pet, we just seem
to love them so much unconditionally. Of all the relationships we
have, our relationship with a pet is probably one of the purest.
That's why we miss them so much when they're gone.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a chilly Tuesday in January when Michael Birck, chief
executive and co-founder of Tellabs Inc., found himself stuck at
O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. With snow piling up, he
was hard pressed to make the 2 p.m. speech he was scheduled to give
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's annual technology conference in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Finally airborne, three hours late, Birck checked in with his
secretary, Mary McShane. ``Do you know what happened to the
stock?'' she asked. ``We're up $9 a share.'' Phones were ringing
off the hook at Tellabs headquarters in Lisle, Ill., with analysts
and reporters asking for his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Birck was cornered by a reporter at the
conference that he learned why his stock shot up 20 percent that
day. The reason, the reporter said matter-of-factly, was that Birck
had been meeting with executives of Lucent Technologies &UR;  &LR; to discuss
a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   Birck denied the report. Tellabs, was not then and is not now in
talks with Lucent, he said in a recent interview. ``It struck me as
beyond bizarre, based totally on unsupported rumors,'' he said.
``It's not healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one who was upset. ``I hate this market,''
said Robert Gensler, an analyst at T. Rowe Price, the
Baltimore-based mutual fund company, which owns shares of Tellabs,
a telecommunications equipment maker. ``Fundamental analysis is
completely out the window. I could start other rumors you'd like,
but Lucent and Tellabs wouldn't be it.''
</P>
<P>
   While investors' love affair with Internet stocks has been the
most torrid development on Wall Street the last few months, turning
shareholders into paper millionaires overnight, lost is the fact
that this decade's merger boom has been the true market mania of
the '90s _ bigger, broader and more significant for investors and
the economy alike. The Internet hoopla itself is as much about deal
making as it is about the stock market debuts of young ``dot-com''
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied takeovers of the 1980s were often more dramatic _
hostile assaults by corporate raiders, whose maneuverings for
support from institutional investors were chronicled as if they
were movements in a ground war. But with the broadening of stock
ownership by average Americans _ through mutual funds, stock
portfolios, pensions and 401(k) plans _ and the pervasiveness of
mergers in nearly every industry, few Americans are unaffected by
today's merger wave.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1994, roughly the starting point of the decade's
boom in deal making, $7.1 trillion in deals have been announced
worldwide. Of the 50 biggest American companies, measured by market
value at the start of that year, six have disappeared through
mergers _ including Chrysler, Amoco and Nynex _ and three more will
vanish if announced deals are completed. Those 50 companies have
been involved in 4,190 mergers or acquisitions in the last five
years, with a total value estimated at $1.4 trillion, according to
the Securities Data Company, a provider of financial information in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is it just sophisticated institutions that trade
merger stocks actively. Now, with the 24-hour-a-day availability of
detailed financial news and chatter on television or on line,
everybody can play the game. The slightest hint of an executive
power chat can send stock prices soaring or tumbling, depending on
whether investors love or hate the possible combination.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who own shares in merging companies in the weeks, or
even days, before an announced takeover are getting a rush not too
different from that enjoyed by Internet stock players as some of
their investments double or better, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``People buy and sell stocks based on an expectation that
everything is in play,'' said Steven Koch, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Rumors can move the
world with abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors are fast becoming takeover junkies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sexy everyone wants to be a part of it,'' said John
Markese, president of the American Association of Individual
Investors. ``Part of the mind-set is any company could be a merger
candidate. People have that in the back of their heads and use it
almost as a wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Faith Van Voolen, a 55-year-old social worker in
Syracuse, N.Y., who, with her husband, Arthur, has been investing
in stocks for years. The couple won't buy Internet companies
because they are too risky, Mrs. Van Voolen said. But last year,
four of the more than 20 blue-chip stocks in their portfolio _
Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., Citicorp and Rubbermaid Inc. _ hooked up
with partners. ``The mergers of a decade ago didn't impact us all
that much,'' she said. ``But now it is something we think about all
the time.''

   So much so that Mrs. Van Voolen and her husband have regular
debates over breakfast about whether to keep the stocks of merged
companies in their portfolio. She scans business talk shows and
newspapers for any scrap of news and often talks with her broker
and accountant about the merits of deals. And she worries, as any
investor should, whether the combinations announced these days are
a result of well-thought-out strategies or ill-conceived
matchmaking. ``We are really not sure how it will affect us in the
long term,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like hers abound. Pete Kelley, a self-employed investor
in Vermont with a portfolio worth about $150,000, recently bought
shares of Infoseek, the Internet search-engine company, with the
hope that the Walt Disney &UR;  &LR; Co. will buy the remaining 57 percent of
Infoseek it does not already own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have bought it if I didn't think it would be
acquired,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Collins, a financial planner in Irvine, Calif., said
buying shares once a deal has been announced is an integral part of
the investing strategy she deploys for her clients. Currently, one
of every four stocks in her clients' portfolios is involved in a
merger, she said. ``You are taking the chance that the deal could
fall apart,'' she said. ``But these are companies we'd want to own
whether the deal falls apart or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Long-Term Capital Management, &UR;  &LR; the hedge fund that was
taken over by a consortium of investment banks last fall, played
the merger game, albeit with disastrous results. It learned the
hard way how risky betting on acquisitions could be, losing
hundreds of millions when Tellabs backed out of a deal to buy the
Ciena &UR;  &LR; Corp., another telecommunications equipment maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think that the merger wave is having a psychological
impact? Yes, '' said Samuel Hayes, a professor of finance at the
Harvard Business School. ``The fingertips are sensitive to every
single clue.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, many takeovers were perceived as attacks, often on
self-satisfied managements, by impatient and often greedy investors
intent on squeezing costs to bolster the value of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, mergers have undergone a makeover. Now they are just
another tool in corporate America's kit, a tactic used either to
increase earnings or to transform corporations into strong global
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Securities Data, January was a record month for
domestic mergers in terms of dollar value _ $131 billion, including
Vodafone Group's planned acquisition of Airtouch Communications for
$60 billion and Lucent's proposed purchase of Ascend Communications
for $20 billion. But few of the deals stirred the interest they
might have only a few months ago _ unless, of course, they involved
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The same forces driving deals in other industries, however, are
fueling consolidation among Internet companies. America Online
started the wave last November when it agreed to acquire Netscape
Communications for $4.2 billion. Several companies have announced
acquisitions or partnerships since then. Yahoo, the leading portal
company, agreed to acquire Geocities, the biggest collection of
personal World Wide Web pages, for $3.6 billion in stock. Just last
week, Lycos, another portal company, agreed to a merger with the
electronic shopping units of USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially what you have is Internet time at work,'' said
Brad Koenig, co-head of global high technology at Goldman Sachs.
``The landscape in existence this week is not the same landscape as
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those dizzying combinations, Internet stocks are only a
small part of the merger pie _ and even less of the total market.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter calculates the total value of the 77
companies it tracks in the Internet sector, excluding the $75
billion America Online, at $153 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That pales next to the value of all domestic mergers last year:
$1.6 trillion, or 11 percent of the total capitalization of the
stock market. And because the number of publicly traded shares in
Internet stocks is so limited, relatively few investors own them.
Instead, much of the market fervor in the sector is driven by the
frantic activity of day traders.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, one of every three diversified American
mutual funds owned at least five companies involved in the top 25
deals for 1998, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher. One of every 12 funds owned at least 15
companies involved in those mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The public's fascination with Internet stocks has been fueled in
large part by the unprecedented gains that some of them have
recorded on the first day of trading _ a 163 percent gain by Ebay,
for example, or the 119 percent rise of Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   But merger stocks are not without quick one-day gains of their
own. Getchell Gold, a mining company, announced on Dec. 14 that it
was being acquired by Placer Dome, and the stock jumped 72 percent
that day. Shares in Fingerhut Companies, which announced last
Thursday that it would be acquired by Federated Department Stores,
climbed 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who hold shares a few days before a deal is announced
can often enjoy big premiums once it is completed _ sometimes
doubling the value of their holdings, according to data compiled by
Mergerstat, a division of Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, a Los
Angeles investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, if the deal is a stock swap, the announced premium _
the price above market value to be paid to shareholders _ can
change significantly by the time the deal closes. Critics say that
poorly managed mergers don't always deliver gains for investors in
the long run. But those incredible first-day gains in Internet
stocks tend to wane, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The incessant merger activity can make managing money a guessing
game, even for the best managers. Brian Stansky, manager of the T.
Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications fund, plies his trade in
the busiest of sectors for mergers. About 25 percent of the
companies in his portfolio on Dec. 31 were either being acquired or
acquiring other companies. An additional 25 percent were rumored to
be in discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things get caught up in a frenzy, you ask yourself, `Does
anything change?''' Stansky said. ``When does the merger sentiment
get out of hand, and when do you start taking chips off the table?
We know our stocks are going to get bought. But by whom?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace is playing a leading role in democratizing a world
once inhabited only by deal makers and sophisticated stock
speculators. Rumors about deals used to be filtered by traders who,
employing a network of sources, ferreted out fact from fiction.
Now, within minutes, rumors sprint from whispers at the water
cooler to the status of ostensible facts on line. Deals are
chronicled in the earliest of stages, and far less experienced
people are trading without fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to have to be an expert to hear about this stuff,''
said Karen Altfest, an investment adviser based in Manhattan. ``It
doesn't have the same mystique anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because of Internet communication, but also
because the media are eager to satiate investors' hunger for news.
One investment banker who spoke on condition of anonymity described
a morning last month when a company he advises was rumored to be in
merger talks _ gossip that was unfounded. Regardless, within two
hours, he got 10 phone calls from reporters eager to break the
story. ``You feel this crush of interest,'' the banker said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Parr, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan
Stanley, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed is the real-time nature of information and wide
distribution of rumors,'' Parr said. ``If a rumor shows up on the
Internet, for example, you have lots of people who can jump in and
trade on that information. That wasn't always the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the recent bidding war between Bell Atlantic &UR;  &LR; and
Vodafone for Airtouch, the wireless communications giant. On Dec.
7, one person in an online chat room noted that someone was buying
400,000-share chunks of Airtouch stock. Ten days later another
chat-room denizen reported more of the same. ``There is something
moving the stock,'' this person wrote. ``Maybe there is a deal
percolating that we know nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were prescient; Airtouch was in talks, and
several large blocks of stock were traded in mid-December. Still,
once word spread of the company's talks with Bell Atlantic, most of
what was written in the chat rooms was unreliable. One participant
speculated that MCI Worldcom was making a hostile offer of 1.4
Worldcom shares for every Airtouch share. (Worldcom never made such
an offer, according to people close to the company.) Someone else
wrote that Bell Atlantic had offered $100 a share in stock and cash
_ also untrue. Ultimately, Vodafone increased its bid and won
Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get real-time information, but a lot of it can be
junk,'' said Tom Watson, an adjunct professor in new media at
Columbia University. ``It's like that old parlor game `I've Got a
Secret.' It gets passed around, and by the time it gets passed
around to you, it is not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just investors who can be misled. Last year, Parr
of Morgan Stanley, in a presentation to the board of an American
company that was for sale, was reviewing a list of bids. After a
quick rundown of all the offers, one director asked about a company
with which Parr was not familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The director said he had seen a message on an Internet chat site
stating that this company was offering $3 a share more than the
best offer presented by Parr's team that day. Parr told him the
company had never contacted Morgan Stanley or made a bid.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange still gives Parr pause. ``It really surprised us
that that the Internet was where his information was coming from,''
he said. &QL;

VETS DO MORE THAN EVER FOR AILING PETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hunting dogs don't lie around doing nothing. And
Travis certainly fit that profile _ until a little more than a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 9{-year-old Hungarian Vizsla appeared in pain, but his
owners never would have guessed Travis had swallowed a pair of
nylon stockings and that the hosiery had lodged in his intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Goodwein of Van Nuys rushed his dog to a 24-hour emergency
room that Sunday morning, worried, scared and willing to pay
whatever it took to make Travis healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, Goodwein would have had nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, serious medical treatment _ and even visits to
the doctor _ were pretty much just for humans. A cat or dog chewed
up in a fight might get a few stitches, but mostly pets simply
lived and then died.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the same miracles of modern medicine that cure humans
of cancer, let them live longer lives with heart or kidney disease,
or at least exit life relatively pain-free are available to pets.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to surveys, more than 10 percent of owners also
have tried massage therapy, and 9 percent have tried
holistic/homeopathic remedies for their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners are taking advantage of medical advances to keep
their four-footed friends alive and well, with the average family's
veterinary bills rising from $131 in 1991 to $186 in 1996,
according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency clinics generally are even pricier _ at least 30
percent more expensive than regular vets.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwein isn't much concerned with cost when it comes to his
pet: ``They'll send me the bill, and whatever it is, I'll pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in good company. According to the American Animal Hospital
Association, 38 percent of pet owners surveyed say they'll even go
into debt for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that people care more for their pets now,'' said
Dr. Garth Peterson, who's practiced for 30 years at McClave
Veterinary Hospital in Reseda. ``But they definitely love them, and
they want to do whatever they can for them, including treatments
that just used to be for humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fluffy and Fido can now benefit from everything from
anxiety-ending tranquilizers to cancer treatments, from new
heartworm remedies to kidney transplants, from a new doggy
Alzheimer's drug to limb-saving orthopedic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There's even pet CPR.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year and a half, nearly 2,000 pet owners have been
trained in animal first aid, including pet cardiopulmonary and
mouth-to-snout resuscitation, at Encino-based ABC Rescue's classes.
(To sign up for a class, call 818-780-7860.)
</P>
<P>
   The classes work, said ABC owner Craig Jones, who contracts with
the American Red Cross to offer the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been cases of people bringing their dogs and cats _
as well as lizards and chickens _ back from the brink of death,''
he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Need a specialist?
</P>
<P>
   Veterinary Referral Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., sometimes
referred to as the Mayo Clinic of veterinary hospitals, is where
more than 5,000 families a year turn when their pets are diagnosed
with life-threatening cancers and other serious ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen doctors _ 13 of them specialists in neurology,
orthopedics, oncology, ophthalmology, radiology, cardiology and
nephrology (kidney disease) _ plus 65 nurses and technicians care
for cats and dogs in the 65-cage hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of care is expensive; a course of radiation treatments
for a pet with cancer can cost $3,500, and chemotherapy can run an
additional $2,000. Sometimes, there are miraculous cures _ dogs
brought in comatose from a brain tumor who scamper home happily
after surgery, cats with kidney disease who leave with a
transplanted organ, perky and purring again.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no guarantees, said VRA administrator Mark Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be just adding six months to an animal's life, and we
tell the owners that up front. But they're willing to spend the
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sad is that we have people who come in who can't pay,
and it's really upsetting because they'd really like to save their
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter pet medical insurance, one of the newer offerings in the
pet care market.
</P>
<P>
   As new ways are found to lengthen pets' lives, some pet owners
are investing in insurance that covers pacemakers and heart
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, bone replacement surgery and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Stephens is president and founder of Anaheim-based
Veterinary Pet Insurance. Opened in 1982, it's America's oldest and
largest pet insurance company, with more than 850,000 clients and
backed by more than 800 veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums run from $99 to $300 or so a year per pet but cover
medical procedures costing thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saving animals that mean a lot to their owners,''
Stephens said. ``People realize the love that a pet gives and want
to return that with good medical care. There's no reason anymore to
put a pet to sleep when the owner wants to use modern technology to
keep it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 2 percent of 1,252 respondents to an American Animal
Hospital Association 1998 pet owner survey said they have health
insurance for their pet, nearly two-thirds said they would spend
$1,000 or more to save their pet's life, whether it's a family pet
or a show animal.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS) &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, show-dog breeder Stephanie Archuleta &UR;  &LR; of Palmdale
took her 3-year-old prize-winning cocker spaniel, Mishka, in to
have his chronically swollen tonsils removed, an operation not
often performed on dogs. The surgery cost $85.
</P>
<P>
   Swollen tonsils don't ``affect Mishka's looks, but if he's not
feeling well, then the dog show is a no-go,'' she said. ``And he's
the love of my life. The money I'd spend on him is limitless. He
deserves that, and the reason is that he gives me 150 percent _ and
why should that not be returned?''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the pet scale, Geraldine Horvill recently
spent $600 for her 6-year-old Pomeranian, Foxy, to have her teeth
cleaned and X-rays taken of a gimpy back leg. Her vet told her
she's looking at a much bigger bill _ perhaps into the thousands of
dollars _ for surgery to correct Foxy's leg problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Reseda widow can ill afford a big vet bill but says she'll
spend whatever it takes to have her companion well again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very expensive, but I figure I have to,'' Horvill said.
``If you don't take care of 'em, you don't have 'em anymore. And
she's my pal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ER for animals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same rule that says you'll have a flat if there's no spare
tire in your trunk seems to decree that a pet will become sickest
after your veterinarian's office closes for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Without 24-hour emergency clinics _ the first one opened 1974 in
New York City _ pets must suffer, and their owners must worry,
until Monday morning when their regular vet's office opens.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time pet owners resort to an emergency clinic,
usually the animals already have been ill for a while, said Dr.
Daniel Grayson, manager of the Animal Critical Care and Veterinary
Specialty Center in Woodland Hills, where Travis was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's 3 in the morning, and it's an emergency,'' Grayson
said. ``Usually when an animal looks sick, it's pretty far along.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the center spent five hours in surgery with Travis,
pumping him full of antibiotics to fight infection. Travis made it
until Wednesday, when he slipped into a coma and died. Through
their grief, his owners are full of praise for the emergency room
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very compassionate _ with both Travis and us,''
Goodwein said, choking back tears. ``They did good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing pets die is the hardest thing about being an emergency
vet, said Grayson.
</P>
<P>
   And telling owners the sad news can be even harder, especially
today, when most people think of their pets not as animals, but as
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 5:30 in the morning; his wife had just left him, his
father had died six months ago, his mother was dying of cancer, and
now his dog was sick,'' Grayson said, recalling a young man with a
12-year-old dog who came to his clinic recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left her here, and she seemed fine,'' the vet said. ``All
of a sudden, she absolutely crashed, and we weren't able to bring
her back. That was about the hardest phone call I've ever had to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   The brighter side of medical advancement for pets is that better
veterinary care, better diet and recent medical advances have all
combined to allow pets _ like humans _ to live longer than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   But that also means veterinarians who were trained to give
rabies shots and do minor surgery must learn to recognize
unfamiliar symptoms in geriatric animals, said Dr. Patrick Melese,
director of Veterinary Behavior Consultants in San Diego and one of
the few certified animal behavior specialists in California.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and cognitive dysfunction
syndrome _ a canine ailment that in many ways mimics Alzheimer's
disease in humans _ all occur in dogs over 8 years old _ an
estimated 6.5 million in America, Melese said. And millions more
aging cats are susceptible to feline leukemia, feline AIDS and
kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back 20 years ago, dogs used to die from being hit by a car.
They didn't live as long, and we didn't know as much,'' he said.
``Today, we can increase animals' life span, and we can keep them
healthier longer. People expect that of us. And they should.''

CLINTON TRAVELS TO MEXICO TO STRENGTHEN TIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 14) 
 
By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A tense year put behind him with the end of his
impeachment trial, President Clinton is doing what many
stressed-out Americans have done for generations: He's heading for
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But what had been expected to be a relaxing stopover after a
trip to storm-ravaged Central America has been transformed into a
agenda-filled visit framed by the annual tug-of-war between
Clinton's administration and the U.S. Congress over Mexico's
anti-narcotics efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a working trip,'' said Mike Hammer, a
spokesman at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Central America has been postponed until
early next month. But the president and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton are scheduled to arrive in the city of Merida, capital of
Yucatan state, Sunday night for a 24-hour visit with Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is going to Mexico because this is arguably the
most important bilateral relationship that the United States has,''
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, told
reporters last week in Washington. ``The focus of the trip will be
on steady, practical progress across the range of common interests
that we have with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Zedillo and their wives will dine together Sunday night
in Merida. Then the two leaders will hold talks, along with members
of their cabinets and staffs, Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   After about 2 1/2 hours of meetings with Zedillo, Clinton will
give a 40-minute speech to business executives Monday afternoon in
Merida before boarding Air Force One to return to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the brevity of the visit, White House officials say
Clinton and Zedillo will discuss issues ranging from narcotics and
immigration to the five-year-old North America Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA, which formally links the economies of Mexico,
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these (presidential) visits are important because they
oblige the presidents, especially the U.S. president, to focus on
the relationship,'' said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, an expert on
U.S.-Mexico relations. ``You have started seeing some negligence in
Washington in terms of Mexico. The (Clinton) administration has
been distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Zedillo, who will leave office in 2000, are
winding up presidencies plagued by crises: Clinton's personal and
political, Zedillo's economic.
</P>
<P>
   That has led some analysts to question the importance of this
visit, especially since it is to be so brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last summit for lame ducks,'' said Federico
Estevez, a Mexico City political scientist. ``This is their last
hurrah before they have to hand over (bilateral policy) to their
candidate in the presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Merida meeting comes just weeks before Clinton must
make his annual ``certification'' to Congress that Mexico and other
countries are cooperating fully with the U.S. government's effort
to curtail the international narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of corruption scandals and evidence of high-level
official involvement with drug smuggling organizations, no U.S.
administration has ever decertified Mexico on the grounds its
government was not making a good-faith effort in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton administration officials once again praised
Mexico's efforts in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between cooperation and success,'' State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Colombian cocaine passes through Mexico on its way
to U.S. consumers, U.S. drug enforcement experts say. Mexican
narcotics gangs also produce and ship large quantities of heroin,
marijuana and methamphetamine to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The multibillion-dollar narcotics industry has spun a web of
corruption in the Mexican government, from low-level police
officers employed as body guards for smugglers to the highest
levels of power. For example, Mexico's newly appointed drug czar
was arrested in February 1996 for allegedly being employed by the
country's most powerful narcotics smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   The certification issue has become an annual ritual in
Washington, as the White House and Congress tussle over Mexico, and
an annual torment in Mexico, where many resent what they see as
U.S. meddling in this country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo sent Mexican Interior Minister Francisco Labastida to
Washington last week to sway the U.S. administration and Congress.
Some members of Congress publicly vowed again to challenge the
president's expected certification of Mexico. But some analysts
believe such challenges will be dampened in a Congress weary from a
year of political scandal and a bruising impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that Mexico constitutes a cause for battle (in the
Congress),'' said political scientist John Bailey, an expert on
Mexican politics at Georgetown University in Washington. ``They're
not looking for a fight right away (after the impeachment trial).''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that despite tensions over drug enforcement,
immigration and other issues, the U.S.-Mexico relations ``begins
with economics.'' He pointed out that Mexico is now the United
States' second largest trading partner, after Canada, and imported
$79 billion in U.S. goods last year, double the total before the
trade agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA has helped insulate both countries from the impact of
the global financial crisis,'' Berger said.

 (Editors: corrects 1st graph, changes ``yesterday''
to  ``Thursday'')   Voice Mail Users Get Message From God 
 &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A doomsday voice mail message predicting the end of the world
greeted some Pacific Bell customers Thursday morning after a caller
accidentally sent a message to some voice mailbox customers in the
650 area code.
</P>
<P>
   A woman, reading from the Book of Revelation, recorded herself
and then sent the message at 3:01 a.m. to an undisclosed number of
voice mailboxes in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials said the woman inadvertently accessed the
voice mailboxes by punching in a wrong numeric code on the voice
mail system. The message was sent to fewer than 1 percent of Pac
Bell voice mail customers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Pac Bell, said the customer
meant to send the message to people she knew, but instead sent her
apocalyptic diatribe to random people in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said Pac Bell, which received calls from concerned
customers about the message, was upgrading its system so the
problem could not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred because Pac Bell's voice mail system allows users to
set up a distribution list of friends and family in order to send
group messages simultaneously to several people.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people who are on a baseball team together could
set up an account that allows them to send the same voice mail
message to the whole team announcing the game time.
</P>
<P>
   Customers enter a list of telephone numbers they want to include
in their group and are assigned a code. Each time they want to
record a message for that group, they must enter the code for
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said the woman ``inadvertently got access to a group
that was not her own. It was human error.'' She said the woman
probably misdialed her code.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was trying to access a group that was hers, but somehow
managed to send it to people that were not in her group,'' Cassidy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers were upset by the message, which they described
as ``disturbing'' and said they wondered how secure Pac Bell's
voice mail system is.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said the same situation has happened once before but
said this type of problem is ``very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   She said security was not compromised because even though the
woman accidentally sent a group message to other customers, she
could not access individual accounts or listen to another person's
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts said misdirected messages are becoming more
common as technology gets more complex and people rely on it for
more things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for something to be sent to the wrong
person,'' said Beth Givens of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in
San Diego. ``When you hit the wrong button, things can go awry.
It's something we're probably going to see a lot more of since we
use so many communications systems and they're so complex.''

EXCERPTS: SENATORS TALK ABOUT THEIR VOTES IN THE IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from statements Friday by
senators sitting in judgment in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   Susan Collins
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Maine
</P>
<P>
   As this case has been argued in this chamber, I have become
convinced that the perjury charges of Article I are not fully
substantiated by the record. The president's grand jury testimony
is replete with lies, half-truths, and evasions. But significantly,
not all evasion is lying, and not all lying is perjury. Even
blatantly misleading testimony that all fair-minded people would
consider dishonest may not actually constitute perjury, as the law
defines it. ...
</P>
<P>
   The evidence supporting Article II is more convincing. Indeed,
the case presented by the House managers proves to my satisfaction
that the president did, in fact, obstruct justice in Paula Jones's
civil rights case.
</P>
<P>
   While the circumstances surrounding Monica Lewinsky's filing of
a false affidavit are unclear, there is no doubt in my mind that
the frantic efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job, the retrieval and
concealment of gifts under the bed of the president's secretary,
and, most egregious, the president's blatant coaching of Betty
Currie _ not once, but twice, were clear attempts to tamper with
witnesses and obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if I were a juror in an ordinary criminal case, I might
very well vote to convict faced with these facts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I do not think that the President's actions
constitute a high crime or misdemeanor ...
</P>
<P>
   I will cast my vote not for the current president, but for the
presidency. I believe that in order to convict, we must conclude
from the evidence presented to us with no room for doubt that our
Constitution will be injured and our democracy suffer should the
president remain in office one moment more.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the claims against the president fail to reach
this very high standard.
</P>
<P>
   Max Baucus
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Montana
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's responsibility in this impeachment trial was not to
determine whether the president had done something wrong or
something that was morally unacceptable. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution required us to determine whether the
president's conduct rose to the level of an impeachable offense
that warranted removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe that his conduct rose to that level on either
perjury or obstruction of justice. Therefore, I voted against
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher S. Bond
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Missouri
</P>
<P>
   If we are to have a government of laws and not of men and not of
public opinion polls, then we must judge the president on the
evidence presented to us. I believe that the acts that he committed
constitute high crimes and misdemeanors warranting his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   I should note that the Senate made a serious mistake in
beginning the proceedings by limiting the ability of the House
managers to call witnesses. The absence of witnesses to testify to
the acts alleged as the basis of impeachment charges significantly
impeded the progress toward resolving the allegations against the
president. I trust that the Senate will not make the same mistake
in future impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Bayh
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Indiana
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the president's behavior was wrong. Clearly it was
immoral. Clearly his actions fall far below the conduct Americans
should expect of their chief executive. He cannot escape history
and will be treated harshly by it. Ultimately, he will be judged
for his sins by that tribunal before which we all must stand one
day. But we must apply a mortal, constitutional standard here. ...
</P>
<P>
   In the end, on both Articles, we are left with dueling accounts,
disputed inferences and contested suggestions. It is not enough to
imply or infer or assume that a president must be removed. The case
must be overwhelming. Here, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Nighthorse Campbell
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Colorado
</P>
<P>
   The president came through a difficult childhood as I did, and I
genuinely like him and feel sorry for both him and his family. But
after agonizing as many of my Senate friends have, I remember the
first question my then 9-year-old son, Cohn, asked me 17 years ago
when I told him I was going to run for public office. He asked,
``Dad, are you going to lie and stuff?'' I told him, ``No.'' Human
frailties notwithstanding, elected officials should not ``lie and
stuff.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   If we are not going to honor our oath, why don't we get rid of
it and have an every-man-for-himself kind of elected official?
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, let's change it. Mr. Chief Justice, you could say:
``Senators-elect. Raise your right hand and repeat after me: `On my
honor, I'll do my best, to help myself and lie like the rest.'''
</P>
<P>
   I took a solemn oath _ perhaps it is the only thing in common I
share with John F. Kennedy, Harry Truman and Daniel Webster as well
as the founders of this nation _ and that is why honoring it is all
the more important to me.
</P>
<P>
   Simply speaking, the President did, too. And, so even though I
like him personally, I find I can only vote one way. And that is
guilty on both articles.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Max Cleland
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Georgia
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has committed serious offenses. His personal
conduct in this matter was, as I have said before, wrongful,
reprehensible and indefensible. He has admitted to personal
offenses, and will be appropriately judged for his misconduct
elsewhere. In my judgment, under all the oaths I have taken under
the United States Constitution, his offenses do not rise to the
required level for impeachable offenses under the United States
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Pete V. Domenici
</P>
<P>
   Republican of New Mexico
</P>
<P>
   While the legal nuances offered by both sides were interesting
and essential, I kept thinking as I sat listening, that the most
obvious and important, but unstated, question was: What standard of
conduct should we insist our President live up to? ...
</P>
<P>
   In this day and age of public yearning for heroes, we criticize
basketball, football and baseball players and actors and singers
who commit crimes or otherwise fail to be good role models. One of
those celebrities said a few years ago that he was only a
basketball player, not a role model. He said in essence: Want a
role model, look to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Do not underestimate, my friends, the corrupting and cynical
signal we will send if we fail to enforce the highest standards of
conduct on the most powerful man in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Conrad
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of North Dakota
</P>
<P>
   James Wilson, an 18th-century constitutional scholar, has
written that impeachment was designed for ``great and publick
offences by which the Commonwealth was brought into danger.''
</P>
<P>
   These charges against the president just do not measure up to
that standard. Hiding presents under a bed. Asking a secretary
leading questions. These can hardly be the great and public
offenses that our Founding Fathers had in mind. These charges, and
the facts behind them, simply do not bring our commonwealth into
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Gramm
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Texas
</P>
<P>
   In an impeachment process steeped in partisanship, I have tried
to screen out my own strong partisan sentiments by asking a simple
question: Would I vote to convict President Ronald Reagan or
President George Bush if they had committed the acts that President
Clinton has committed? The answer is a sad but firm yes. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have asked myself how men from an era when honor was valued
above all other traits, men like George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, John Adams and James Madison, might have viewed a
President who committed perjury and obstruction of justice for
personal and political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Would they believe that denying another citizen equal protection
of the law was a betrayal of a public trust? It seems to me the men
who pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor in
order to establish our nation of laws would find President
Clinton's behavior to be a high crime and misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   John Edwards
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of North Carolina
</P>
<P>
   Every trial I have ever been in has had one moment, one
quintessential moment when the entirety of the trial was described.
And in this case we have such a moment. There was a question that
had my name on it. The reality is, Senator Kohl wrote it _ I tagged
on _ but it was a great question.
</P>
<P>
   The question was, Is this a matter about which reasonable people
can differ? I will never forget Manager Lindsey Graham coming to
this microphone and his answer was, ``Absolutely.'' Now if the
prosecution concedes that reasonable people can differ about this,
how can we not have reasonable doubt?
</P>
<P>
   Charles E. Grassley
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Iowa
</P>
<P>
   The president's actions are having a profound impact on our
society. His misdeeds have caused many to mistrust elected
officials. Cynicism is swelling among the grass roots. His breach
of trust has eroded the public's faith in the office of the
Presidency. The President's wrongdoing has painted all of us in
Washington with a rather broad brush. ...
</P>
<P>
   The true tragedy in this case is the collapse of the President's
moral authority. He undermined himself when he wagged his finger
and lied to the nation on national TV, denying a relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. That did more damage to his credibility than any
other single act.
</P>
<P>
   There was no better reason than that for the resignation by this
President. I did not personally call for his resignation. That's
something the President should decide on his own. But once you lose
your moral authority to lead, you're a failure as a leader.
</P>

   Russell Feingold
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Wisconsin
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to historians and constitutional scholars
who may know more or feel differently, it is my sense that the case
against William Jefferson Clinton is the first close case or
``hard'' case of presidential impeachment in our nation's long
history. This case lies in the middle, between the rather weak case
brought to impeach President Andrew Johnson, and the overwhelming
series of allegations that would have led to President Nixon's
impeachment if he had not resigned. This one is a hard case and
senators may see it either way.
</P>
<P>
   The single most salient fact in this case is that on November 5,
1996, over 47 million Americans voted to re-elect William Jefferson
Clinton as President of the United States. ...
</P>
<P>
   The people choose their leaders in America, and we must not
lightly reverse their will.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Gregg
</P>
<P>
   Republican of New Hampshire
</P>
<P>
   The primary issue raised here is one that has plagued the 20th
century. It is the concept that everything is relative, that there
is no definable right or wrong. This century has produced some
truly horrific ideas: the concept of popular totalitarianism,
otherwise known as fascism or communism; the concept of a
socialized marketplace; and the idea that all things ethical can be
relative. ...
</P>
<P>
   Are the president's crimes, which have been fairly proven, all
that important? Should crimes not be looked at in relation to the
person committing them and his contribution or importance to
society?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are the essence of the president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   In a country based on the system of laws, which is really the
great gift given to us under the terms of our Constitution, there
needs to be a consistency of application. The idea that all people
are equal under the law is not a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the framers intended the House and the Senate to use
the impeachment power cautiously, and not wield it promiscuously
for partisan political purposes. Sadly, in this case, Republicans
in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against
the president, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the
way the framers rejected recklessly and without regard for the
Constitution or the will of the American people. ...
</P>
<P>
   Our Republican friends have desperately been trying to produce a
two-thirds majority to remove the president from office. But their
efforts have succeeded only in turning a serious constitutional
process into a partisan process that demeaned both the House and
the Senate and became a painful ordeal for the entire country. ...
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hutchinson
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Arkansas
</P>
<P>
   This trial is not about punishment. It's not about getting our
pound of flesh from the Democrats. it's not about getting our
retribution on the president. It's not political vengeance. It's
not about polls. If polls had prevailed, Andrew Johnson would have
been removed, and that would have been wrong. To argue that a
popular president should not be removed regardless of his actions,
merely because he is popular, is to lower our constitutional
republic to a meaningless level.
</P>
<P>
   To say popularity should be a factor in our decision is to say
that bad poll numbers and unpopularity is an argument for removal
of a President. How contrary to our constitutional system. The
popularity of this president should never even have been mentioned,
in my opinion. Nor should political consequences of our votes be
the basis for our decision of whether to remove this president.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kerry
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   The country does not believe the fiber of our nation is
unraveling over the President's egregious behavior, because most
people have a sense of proportion about this case that seems
totally lacking in the House managers' presentation.
</P>
<P>
   No parent or school in America is teaching kids that lying or
abusing the justice system is now okay. And I say the president's
predicament does not make it harder to do so. No amount of inflated
rhetoric, or ideological or moral hyperextension, can lift the
personal, venial aspects of the President's actions to the kind of
threat to the fabric of the country contemplated by the founding
fathers. ...
</P>
<P>
   No matter the words about not hating Bill Clinton _ no matter
the disclaimers about partisanship, I sensed at times not just a
scorn, but snarling, trembling venom that told us the President is
a criminal, and that ``we need to know who our president is.''
Well, the president is certainly a sinner. We all are. And he may
even have committed a crime. But just plain and simply measured
against the test of history so eloquently articulated by the
senator from New York this morning, and by the senator from
Delaware yesterday, this is not in any measure on the order of high
crime and misdemeanor so clearly contemplated by the founding
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Inhofe
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Oklahoma
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes say one of the few qualifications I have for the
U.S. Senate is I am not a lawyer. So that when I read the
Constitution, I know what it says; when I read the oath of office,
I know what it says; when I read the law, I know what it says. I
don't have to clutter up my mind with what the definition of `is'
is. So it makes it a little easier for me. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think we have seen the truth. And I think the final truth is
that this president should be held to the very highest of
standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Mikulski
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Maryland
</P>
<P>
   The House managers' case on both counts was thin and
circumstantial. ...
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the House manager's assertions about perjury rested on
President Clinton's vague and unhelpful responses to the
independent counsel's questions. While those responses may have
been frustrating to the independent counsel, the Republican House
managers, and, perhaps the American public, they were not
perjurious as defined by law.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the case presented by the Republican House managers
did not present sufficient direct evidence to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the President obstructed justice. Instead,
they relied on extensive conjecture about what the President
``may'' have been thinking. In fact, there was credible testimony
by multiple witnesses that was directly contrary to the House
managers' conjecture, leaving ample room for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kyl
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Arizona
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about this case is the president's persistent,
sustained, carefully calculated, deliberate, and callous
manipulation of the judicial process for over a year. ...
</P>
<P>
   An acquittal in this case will make it much harder to deal
properly with similar conduct in the future. We will be hard
pressed to perpetuate a double standard, so the lowest common
denominator of conduct will be established as the permissible norm.
And this cannot help but weaken the ability of courts to enforce
truth-telling and prevent obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent set by this case may not change the law overnight,
but this unforgettable episode is now part of the institutional
life of our country. The chief magistrate perverted justice and
remained in power. The lesson is corrosive. Like water dripping on
a rock, it eventually makes a deep hollow in the American justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Patrick Moynihan
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of New York
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a power singularly lacking any of the checks and
balances on which the framers depended. It is solely a power of the
Congress. Do not doubt that it could bring radical instability to
the American government. ...
</P>
<P>
   Senators, do not take the imprudent risk that removing William
Jefferson Clinton for low crimes will not in the end jeopardize the
Constitution itself. Censure him by all means. He will be gone in
less than two years. But do not let his misdeeds put in jeopardy
the Constitution we are sworn to uphold and defend.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Mack
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Florida
</P>
<P>
   Be it understood, the Senate tried the president because the
Constitution requires that we do so. There is no exception for
popular presidents, such as William Jefferson Clinton. The
Constitution provides for this process to be applied to everyone
evenhandedly. ...
</P>
<P>
   The callous disregard for the soul of another human being and
the unsympathetic wounding of the character of another carried out
by the president using the apparatus of the presidency is chilling
and deserves condemnation by those who cherish freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Robb
</P>
<P>
   Democrat of Virginia
</P>
<P>
   I will vote not to convict on both articles because the factual,
legal and constitutional standard for removal was not met.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not prepared to say, however, that perjury and obstruction
of justice are not impeachable offenses, because I believe it would
be a mistake to attempt to do that which the Founders chose not to
do _ to define what is impeachable with specificity.
</P>
<P>
   For impeachment to remain what our forefathers intended it to
be, a deterrent to misconduct and a means to protect the republic,
future generations should be free in each case to examine the
facts, apply the law and follow the Constitution, and to render
impartial justice.
</P>
<P>
   That is the impeachment process we have inherited from those who
came before us, and that is the precedent we bequeath to the
ongoing chronicles of American history. ...
</P>
<P>
   In our limited role, we are not called upon to judge him as
husband and father, for that is the province of his family. We are
not called upon to judge him as accused citizen, for that is the
province of the courts. We are not called upon to judge him as
sinner, for that is the province of God. And we are not called upon
to judge his legacy, for that is the province of history.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Roberts
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Kansas
</P>
<P>
   We in Kansas know that you don't call witnesses in the middle of
the night unless you want to sway them. The president did so.
</P>
<P>
   We in Kansas know that you don't urge hiding legal evidence
under the bed unless you want to affect the outcome of a legal
proceeding. The president did so.
</P>
<P>
   We in Kansas know that you don't hide behind the meaning of
``is'' when you are asked a direct question. The president did so.
</P>
<P>
   Do these actions rise to the level envisioned by our founding
fathers in the Constitution as ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' so
warranting removal from office? Our Constitution requires that the
threshold for that judgment must be set by each senator sitting as
a juror.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I believe an open-minded individual applying Kansas
common sense would reach the conclusion that I reached.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Shelby
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Alabama
</P>
<P>
   Because these offenses are grounds for removal, and because they
involve criminal charges, I believe that the Senate had to use the
high standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in reviewing the
evidence. Furthermore, I felt that the House managers had the
burden of proving all the elements of these charges.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the evidence, I believe that the House managers
proved beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton obstructed
justice. Therefore, I voted for his conviction and removal for the
offenses charged in Article II. However, I do not believe that the
House managers met the legal requirements of proving perjury beyond
a reasonable doubt. Therefore, I voted against conviction and
removal for the offenses charged in Article I.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thomas
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Wyoming
</P>
<P>
   The president is at the helm of the executive branch of the
government, which is charged with enforcing the law. What use is it
for the Congress to make the law and the courts to interpret the
law, if the president does not enforce it? We must bring the power
of the three branches of government back into balance. Otherwise,
it is a threat to the structure of the government. Similarly, the
law should be applied to each citizen equally. Otherwise, it is a
breach of the public trust. Clearly, the public good is served by
removing this president.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Thompson
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   You can't go through a process like this without learning some
things. I think we learned some things about the facts and just how
bad some of the president's actions were. But we also learned some
things about the law and just how high the Founding Fathers set the
impeachment bar. Not even crimes are always enough to remove a
president. I thought that bar was reached on Article II.
</P>
<P>
   The acts that the president committed included repeated lies,
witness tampering, the defaming of those who might testify
truthfully and facilitating the filing of a court document he had
reason to know was false.
</P>
<P>
   The president's repeated obstructions denied the legal rights of
an American citizen to have her day in court. They were undertaken
over many months with cold deliberation. The pattern of disrespect
for the law exhibited by the president, as well as the harm it
caused to the Federal courts, warrants his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't think Article I was as strong. Perjury is very hard to
prove, and the president's shoddy actions here are probably not the
kind of things the Founding Fathers intended to cause removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   We went through the process and the system worked, whether or
not we liked the result. It's time now to put it behind us and get
on with the business of the nation.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   I and others have been guided, first, by this question: Has the
prosecution provided evidence beyond a reasonable doubt; and,
second, if so, do the president's offenses rise to the level of
gravity laid out by our founders in the Constitution? ...
</P>
<P>
   I believe _ I believe strongly _ that the record shows that on
both principles the answer is no. ...
</P>
<P>
   I also share the view expressed by many of my colleagues on the
process which brought us here: an investigation by an independent
counsel which exceeded the bounds of propriety; a decision by the
Supreme Court subjecting sitting presidents to civil suits _ it is
my prediction that every future president will be faced with legal
trauma as a result _ a deeply flawed proceeding in the House
Judiciary Committee, which in an unprecedented fashion effectively
relinquished its obligation to independently weigh the case for
impeachment; the disappointing decision to deny members of the
Senate and the House the opportunity to vote on a censure
resolution, even though I believe it would be supported by a
majority in both Houses; and finally, the bitterly partisan nature
of all the actions taken by the House of Representatives in
handling this case.
</P>
<P>
   But as deeply disappointed as I am with the process, it pales in
comparison to the disappointment I feel toward this president.
Maybe it is because I had such high expectations. Maybe it is
because he holds so many dreams and aspirations that I hold about
our country. Maybe it is because he is my friend. I have never
been, nor ever expect to be, so bitterly disappointed again. ...
</P>
<P>
   Whatever legal consequences may follow from this president's
actions, the case made by the House Managers does not satisfy the
exacting standard for removal.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Republican of Alabama
</P>
<P>
   It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral
certainty that President William Jefferson Clinton perjured himself
before a federal grand jury and has persisted in a continuous
pattern of lying and obstructing justice. The chief law enforcement
officer of the land, whose oath of office calls on him to preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution, crossed the line and failed to
defend and protect the law and, in fact, attacked the law and the
rights of a fellow citizen. Under our Constitution, equal justice
requires that he forfeit his office. For these reasons, I felt
compelled to vote to convict and remove the President from office.
...
</P>
<P>
   It is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth.
I fear that an acquittal of this president will weaken the legal
system by providing an option for those who consider being less
than truthful in court. Whereas the handling of the case against
President Nixon clearly strengthened the nation's respect for law,
justice and truth, the Clinton impeachment may unfortunately have
the opposite result.

END OF THE TRIAL BRINGS RELIEF TO ALL INVOLVED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One by one they stood at their places, facing the
chief justice and history, and with bellows of ``not guilty'' and
whispers of ``guilty,'' they ended the trial of President Clinton _
bringing to an end, too, a historic trial of the American system.
</P>
<P>
   In the chamber, for five weeks not quite a courtroom and not
quite a legislative assembly, there was a hush, and then a
shuffling of papers and then a quiet murmur _ and everywhere, from
the tables of the House managers who tried to remove the president
from office and from the tables of the White House lawyers who
struggled to keep him there and, finally, from the senators whose
burden was to decide between the two, there was relief.
</P>
<P>
   Relief, in some cases, tinged with anger. ``What a jerk this guy
is,'' Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat, said of the
president he had voted to acquit only moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Relief, in some cases, tinged with anguish. ``Nobody can feel
good about today,'' said Senator Barbara Boxer, the California
Democrat who judged the president not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Relief, in some cases, tinged with regret and resignation.
``It's a constitutional process working,'' said Senator Orrin G.
Hatch, the Utah Republican who voted to convict the president. ``I
accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Washington weary of what the president called a ``great
burden'' _ indeed, in a country weary of Washington _ this was a
moment to pause.
</P>
<P>
   It was the conclusion of a process so rare that it has been
attempted only once before, at the end of perhaps the most perilous
time of our history, the Civil War era. It was the ultimate clash
of the two political branches of our system. It was sufficiently
historic that senators, who answer the call of the roll but never
keep their own tally sheet, actually sat at their desks, ticking
off the senators' verdicts one after another and then, knowing that
today's scorecards are tomorrow's souvenirs, stowed the sheets in
their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 387th day of a scandal that prompted new departures
in American political life, caused new divisions in America, and
forced new debates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment _ when what House Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, called the ``total indifference'' of the
people seemed to end _ the whole event was reduced, almost
ruthlessly, to human scale.
</P>
<P>
   Here were 100 senators, alone at their desks, stripped of their
aides and their airs, rendering judgment on another man of their
political class.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment there was no time, no occasion, for what Thomas
Hutchinson, the 17th century Connecticut preacher, had already
recognized as an American trait: ``raw and windy discourses to
please sinful humors and corrupt hearts.'' At this moment it was
the time and occasion to perform the duty of leadership, to, as
Jonathan Mitchel, a Cambridge preacher of the 17th century, put it,
``maintain, cherish, and preserve civil honesty amongst a people.''
</P>
<P>
   At this moment _ responding to the charge of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, ``Senators, how say ye?'' _ the words
``guilty'' and ``not guilty'' seemed to have acquired mysterious
new weight. For this vote, the senators stood. For this vote, many
of the men buttoned their suit jackets before they spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Their moment of duty began when six yellow lights and one red
one suddenly appeared on the Senate clocks, signalling that the
doors, closed for three days of secret deliberations, were to be
opened. The crowds proceeded to their places.
</P>
<P>
   At the House managers' table sat Representative F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican, his hands folded. At
his side was Representative Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican,
his hands fidgeting nervously. Senate pages paraded in with trays
holding fresh glasses of ice water. They placed them, one at a
time, on coasters emblazoned with the seal of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith, the New Hampshire Republican, ambled to his
seat in the second row. Senator Slade Gorton, the Washington
Republican who defected from his party on one of the articles of
impeachment, stood in the back, reading the comic pages of The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Strom Thurmond, the 96-year-old Republican from South
Carolina and once a symbol of Southern resistance to integration,
shared a laugh with one of the president's lawyers, Cheryl Mills,
who in her remarks last month pointedly lingered on the lessons of
the civil rights movement. Hyde strolled over to Nicole Seligman,
one of the president's lawyers. The exchange between the two was
out of earshot. But the word ``congratulations'' was discernible on
his lips.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kendall, the president's personal attorney, spoke with
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who moments
later would twice proclaim the president guilty. Kendall had his
hand on his chin, pensively. Domenici's head was bouncing volubly,
his hand pumping vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   But all the clashes _ the clash of lawyers, the clash of
parties, the clash of cultures _ were over now.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 as in 1868, the presidential impeachment trial was a
symbol of a larger breakdown in politics. In 1868, Andrew Johnson
staved off by a single vote the effort of Republicans to convict
him. One of the Republicans who defected then from the party lines,
Senator William P. Fessenden of Maine, said that removing a
president from office was the most perilous thing a Senate could
do, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be free from the taint of party; leave no reasonable
ground of suspicion upon the motives of those who inflict the
penalty, and address itself to the country and the civilized world
as a measure justly called for by the gravity of the crime and the
necessity for its punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the Senate's decision in 1999 as well. Not that
lawmakers felt at ease with what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that it's over, but this is not a happy day,''
said Senator John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who judged the
president not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said he almost voted to convict the president, and
probably would have, had the articles of impeachment been worded
differently. ``He was willing to let'' Monica S. Lewinsky ``go to
jail to save him from having to acknowledge this relationship,''
Kerrey said in a conversation in one of the Senate subway cars. He
said the president faced the choice of making Lewinsky vulnerable
to a jail term so he would not ``go down a few points in the
polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey's conclusion: ``It's not obstruction of justice. But he
does deserve to be condemned.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and the Congress now face a new and in some ways
more difficult trial, conducted by the voters and, in years to
come, by the historians. But their job is over, and none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave you now a wiser but not a sadder man,'' Rehnquist said
at the conclusion of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   On this day the chief justice, accustomed to ruling on the law
of the land, may have captured the sentiment of the nation.
Americans may be wiser for what they have endured. But, as the
relief pours out of every Senate office, every city and every
village at the end of the ordeal, they are certainly not sadder.

 WASHINGTON: opposite result.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Ashcroft
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Missouri
</P>
<P>
   Because it is clear that these crimes are high crimes and
misdemeanors, the Constitution leaves no further discretion: It
states that the president ``shall be removed from office on
impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the only conclusion that I believe is consistent with my
oath to do impartial justice. This case is, in large measure, about
the importance of oaths. The President's failure to honor his oath
necessitated this proceeding. Some might see a vote to acquit as
expedient, but such a vote would be against the evidence and I
could not do further damage to our culture by disregarding my oath.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Brownback
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Kansas
</P>
<P>
   I find that William Jefferson Clinton did commit perjury and
obstruct justice; that these offenses rise to the level of high
crimes and misdemeanors; that William Jefferson Clinton should be
convicted under the Articles of Impeachment, and that he must be
removed as President of the United States. ...
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton repeatedly chose to lie and obstruct justice
rather than tell the truth and comply with court orders throughout
this ordeal. By his words and deeds, he chose to place himself
above the law. By his words and deeds, he has undermined the rule
of law in America to the great harm of this nation. By his own
words and deeds, he has undermined the truth-finding function of
the judiciary, at great harm to that branch of our Government. ...
</P>
<P>
   We have lost many things over the past few months: trust in
public officials, respect for the rule of law, confidence in the
truth of the White House's public statements. But perhaps the most
tragic loss has been the steady erosion of our societal standards.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Warner
</P>
<P>
   Republican of Virginia
</P>
<P>
   When our founding fathers gathered in Philadelphia to form our
national government, they clearly understood the profound
responsibilities they were entrusting to all citizens. An anxious
crowd gathered outside of Independence Hall as the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention completed their work. One in the crowd
shouted out, ``What have you given us?'' Without hesitation,
Benjamin Franklin snapped, ``A republic _ if you can keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Franklin, may I say with deep humility, I have done my best.
I have done what my conscience directs. I have done my duty to
``keep'' the republic. ...
</P>
<P>
   It is for the future to judge, but this will stand as one of the
most tragic chapters in the history of the Executive Branch. I have
grave concerns about the accelerating effect that this terrible
experience will have upon the growing cynical view of politics,
politicians and the making of public law and policy. What message
does this chapter send to our able young people whom we are trying
to encourage to enter public service? ...
</P>
<P>
   To accord the president _ the Office of the Presidency and the
Executive Branch _ the greatest degree of protection and fairness,
I will strictly adhere to the highest level of proof. To find the
President guilty on a count, I must be convinced that the weight of
the evidence, ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' is the foundation for
my votes. ...
</P>
<P>
   No matter how great my deep disappointment in President Clinton,
as a person, he is entitled to the highest standard of due process,
as is every other citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, I find that the weight of the evidence does not
provide a basis to find the president guilty on Article I. ...
</P>
<P>
   The perjury charge is inextricably dependent on the depositions,
affidavits and assertions of Ms. Lewinsky. In my view, she lacks
legal credibility, as evidenced by her many conflicting actions and
statements over a long period of time. Likewise, President Clinton,
regrettably, lacks credibility. A colleague reminded me of a quote
by Mark Twain who said: ``The next best thing to a lie is a true
story no one will believe.''
</P>
<P>
   On Article II, obstruction of justice, I find that President
Clinton is guilty as charged. I will vote to convict. ...
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, on a freezing January day, I stood near the
chief justice, on the west front of the Capitol, as the president
took the oath of office. With hand upon the Bible, he swore to
``faithfully'' execute his Office, twice conferred to him by the
power of the American people, and to ``preserve, protect, and
defend'' our Constitution. He has failed.

EDITORIAL: THE VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 13:
</P>
<P>
   In a season of frailty, the Constitution has prevailed once
again.
</P>
<P>
   It remains the great anchor rock of the Republic, enduring
through partisan storms in the Congress, immune in the end to even
so large and unpredicted a betrayal as a president's dereliction of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   If history were written on the same principles that govern news
articles, that would be the lead of the sad story of William
Jefferson Clinton and how he was spared to finish his second term.
Neither the cheapness of Clinton's liaison with Monica Lewinsky nor
the zealotry of some of his opponents should cause us to overlook
the grandeur and symmetry of the constitutional template that on
Friday produced the acquittal of the president on two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Process
</P>
<P>
   Alarmists had argued that allowing the legal and constitutional
processes to deal with Clinton's offenses would do irreparable harm
to the political system. We had long believed that far greater harm
would flow from some kind of enablers' compact by which Congress
and the public agreed to ignore Clinton's disrespect of the
presidency, his obvious lies and his clumsy efforts to tamper with
the legal process. Although first the House and then the Senate
refused to adopt the resolution of censure advocated in this space,
we celebrate the outcome for making a point that is more important
and more lasting than this presidency. That point is simply that
American history has not yet produced a governmental conundrum that
could not be solved by careful adherence to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Words
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that Clinton's brief and somber Rose Garden
response to the acquittal will set the tone for the days ahead, for
it contained an admission heretofore missing in the serial evasions
and blame-layings that brought him to such a low pass. At long
last, he apologized ``for what I said and did to trigger these
events and the great burden they have imposed on the Congress and
on the American people.'' Clinton has been years too slow to
acknowledge that whatever the excesses of the other players _ some
of whom may yet be punished by the voters or the law _ this buck
started and stopped with the president.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton found out on Dec. 6, 1997, that Ms.
Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Paula Jones case. He had 42
days before his sworn deposition on Jan. 17, 1998, to figure out a
way to avoid lying under oath. But his premeditated decision to lie
threw everything out of whack. The nation's legal system is not
designed to deal with blatantly irrational conduct, in this case a
calculated decision to violate the law by the person with the
utmost constitutional authority to uphold it. In the Rose Garden on
Friday, in an appearance of 82 seconds, Clinton got it at last. He
did ``trigger these events,'' and not just by reckless sexual
conduct. He plunged himself and the nation into crisis by turning
his White House into a factory for the weaving, stitching and
patching of a fabric of lies that was bound to unravel no matter
how many workers Clinton put to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr's Exit
</P>
<P>
   We shall never know, probably, just what the man thought he was
doing, or why, by the agencies of courage and truth, he could not
extricate himself. Perhaps he does not know himself. But if he is
willing to continue this reality-based contrition and to get back
to the legislative business he has outlined, he deserves certain
benefits. One has to do with the future of the investigation by the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. That future needs to be, in a
word, short.
</P>
<P>
   Any thought by Starr of indicting the president now or after
2000 or through the use of sealed indictments would be, in
political terms, offensive to the Constitution, and in personal
terms, nutty. Starr heard that Friday from his biggest supporter in
Congress, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and he had better listen. This
matter has been adjudicated in the manner prescribed by the Framers
of the Constitution. As an investigation and prosecutorial matter
involving Starr, it is over. The charges were not of a magnitude to
warrant removal, and that having failed, they are not of a scale to
justify either the prosecution of a sitting president or pursuit of
a former one. If Congress wants to consider resolutions of censure
or petitions or other instruments of condemnation, they may do so
without the independent counsel's services.
</P>
<P>
   As for other investigative targets, Starr needs to indict them
or clear them and begin closing his operation. Meanwhile, the
investigation authorized into his prosecutorial techniques must
proceed according to normal Justice Department procedures. The
question of whether he lied to Attorney General Janet Reno about
contacts with Paula Jones' lawyers is a serious one. If he did, he
must be examined with the same rigor applied to the investigation
of Clinton's offenses. However that comes out, the main business
with which Starr was entrusted has been settled by the House and
Senate, and it is time for him to return to the private labors to
which he seemed so powerfully attracted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The House's Blunders
</P>
<P>
   To commend the following of constitutional design is not to
dismiss the mistakes that prevented an earlier solution to this
matter. Those failures began in the House, where the Republican
majority too quickly succumbed to Starr's overly conclusionary
initial findings. Hyde, the Judiciary chairman, and Robert
Livingston, the would-be speaker, wasted many opportunities to
guide the Republicans toward a censure resolution that seemed from
the start more proportional to Clinton's offenses than impeachment
and removal. Their mistakes could be laid to bad judgment, but our
vote goes for cowardice. They were both intimidated by the majority
whip, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, into supporting impeachment. If the
House managers want to blame their defeat on someone, they could do
worse than DeLay. More than any other person, he created the
atmosphere that sent them across the Capitol to argue a case that
was not strong enough to meet the constitutional standard for
removing a president.
</P>
<P>
   The managers varied widely in their ability. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., was devastating, George Gekas, R-Pa., looked irrelevant,
and Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., was easily outpointed by Ms. Lewinsky. But
all seemed infected by the decorum of the Senate and perhaps even
by the somber, focused argument of their chief adversary, White
House Counsel Charles Ruff. The managers could never recover,
however, from Hyde's defining strategic blunder. Having ruled out
fact witnesses as unnecessary in the House, he could not sell the
argument that they were suddenly essential in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Order in the Senate
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., and his
Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle, D-S.D., obviously learned from
watching the House. They firmly defeated early efforts by Hyde and
the House managers to set the rules for the Senate trial. As a
result, the Senate proceedings were fair and dignified and never
seemed out of control. Given the fact that it was obvious from the
start that the 67 votes for removal were not there, Lott did a
solid job of containing the frustrations and incendiary instincts
of the most conservative members of his caucus. He could not,
however, prevent Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, from performing with his
usual smarmy disingenuousness.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm blocked the bipartisan censure movement. He described his
motives as constitutional, but they were clearly based on tactics.
He wanted to prevent moderate Republican senators from opting for
censure before the final vote, and he also wanted to deny Democrats
the ability to say during the 2000 campaign that they had delivered
a just punishment to their own president.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the remarkably prescient Framers of the Constitution
could reach forward in time to invest every senator with good
judgment. But their design was vindicated in remarkable ways. The
Senate, with its longer terms and smaller membership, was intended
to be a cistern from which the water of wisdom could be drawn in a
dry time, and so it was. They intended that making the chief
justice the presiding officer would add another element of balance,
and William Rehnquist did more than fulfill that role with his
calm, taciturn rulings. He also resisted admirably the temptation
to make himself an actor rather than a stage manager in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   What Will Endure
</P>
<P>
   As the curtain fell in windy Washington, it seemed more than
ever a drama of tragical lineament. That is to say, the conflict
that swirled all round the stage originated from the conflict
within the protagonist's mind. Clinton and his constituents must
look there for even a partial understanding of the hash he has made
of his one and only presidency. Given what has been wasted, it is
understandable that Clinton would be drawn to blame a conspiracy
rather than his own addiction to reckless pleasures and bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end, we still believe that Clinton's tragedy is a
personal rather than a general one. With respect, we disagree with
Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s conclusion that because America has had a
weak president it now has a weakened presidency. The people
stepping forward from both parties to compete for the office look
capable of treating it with honor. And Congress has just
demonstrated that an impeachment based solely on partisanship
cannot succeed under a process that, like the presidency itself, is
founded on so steadfast a rock.

IN ENCOUNTER,   POLICE ALTERED   HIS OPINIONS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Padro grew up in Washington Heights. Although
he lived downtown for a while, he moved back in 1979 to a roomy
apartment near the river where the air was cooler. Then it got hot.
In the 1980s, drugs and violence crept into the streets south of
him. Cars with Jersey plates ferried suburbanites over the George
Washington Bridge looking to score crack. Recently, however, Padro
felt optimistic about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's quality-of-life
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the city changing and it felt better,'' Padro said. ``I
started supporting his initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   That ended on Feb. 2. He said he had parked his car and was
walking home that afternoon along 176th Street when two white men
came up from behind him, flashed gold badges and asked to see some
identification. Padro asked what was wrong. He also asked to see
more than their badges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard of a scam here of people impersonating police
officers, so I needed to see some more identification,'' Padro
said. ``I said I knew my rights. The smaller of the two grabbed my
arm and said, `Get up against the wall.' I'm 51 and I've never been
in trouble with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The two officers frisked him, he said, then released him. He
said he asked for their badge numbers _ which they must provide,
according to regulations _ but they refused and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Padro's encounter did not end with handcuffs or the kind of
violence that days later claimed the life of an unarmed African
immigrant in the Bronx. But it frustrated him enough to go to the
Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a victim of crime prevention is an interesting thing,''
Padro said. ``Once it happens, you start looking at the police very
differently. You don't trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   Padro said the two plainclothes officers had told him that he
looked like the kind of person who comes to Washington Heights to
buy drugs. ``I'm Puerto Rican,'' Padro explained. ``But I look more
Italian.'' He said the officers told him that they had stopped him
because they had seen ``a colored guy'' hand him something when he
was crossing the street. Padro said no such exchange ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   He is upset that he _ a neatly dressed businessman whose company
designs Internet Web sites for major corporations _ was stopped for
fitting a profile. His block, near New York Presbyterian Hospital,
is home to people of different races and nationalities who work and
study at the hospital. Claudia Soifer, his wife and business
partner, is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the police know who lives in this neighborhood?'' Ms.
Soifer said. ``The majority of the people who live in this
neighborhood work, and we pay a whole heck of a lot of taxes. I
don't understand how the police cannot point out people doing bad
things but any 8-year-old can. Why not the police? They don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   She is hardly a cop-basher. Her brother and sister were police
officers. She said most police officers did a difficult job well.
But she wondered if a few members of the so-called elite
crime-fighting units think they are above the law and the
community. ``What makes them special?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Padro wanted only a simple ``I'm sorry'' from the officers. All
they left him with was fear and humiliation on the streets near
home, where people who see him every day saw him up against the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they do that to him?'' said Ruben Peralta, a bodega
worker who saw the encounter. ``He's not that type of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Padro is the type who now wants to assert his rights. ``My black
friends have told me about this for years,'' he said. ``Doctors in
Mercedeses, they're stopped and they can get hassled. This should
not be happening in our time. We need to start making noises about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not at City Hall, his wife concluded, even though she traced
the arrogance of some police officers to the mayor's often
combative tone. ``He doesn't want people to speak on the steps of
City Hall,'' Ms. Soifer said. ``He's not listening. He's not
capable of listening. I don't know if he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that when the mayor was asked about the Bronx
shooting, he responded with figures about how the use of deadly
force had declined. ``People don't want to hear about statistics,''
she said. ``They want to hear something heartfelt to give them
something to have faith in him. They're losing faith in him.''

VICTOR G. BLOEDE, 79, EX-CHIEF OF BENTON &AMP; BOWLES, IS DEAD 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Md.)  By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor G. Bloede, a former advertising executive who helped
introduce the slogan ``Good to the last drop'' for Maxwell House
coffee as well as other enduring advertising campaigns for consumer
products, died on Wednesday in Boca Raton, Fla., from complications
after surgery. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Bloede rose to chairman and chief executive of
Benton &AMP; Bowles Advertising, where he was hired as a copywriter in
1950.
</P>
<P>
   He rose quickly, becoming a vice president in 1955 and regularly
receiving promotions before being named president and chief
executive in 1968. He was the first and only creative executive to
run Benton.
</P>
<P>
   His promotion came as several other agencies were considering
moving creative executives, rather than businessmen, into top
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising is a rough business,'' Bloede said in an article
in The New York Times on March 10, 1968. ``It's scary. If I'd known
that it was going to be like combat, I never would have gone into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Baltimore native had had his way, he would have become a
police reporter for The Baltimore Sun. Bloede worked on newspapers
in high school and college but found it difficult to break into the
newspaper business. So he went into public relations and later
moved to an advertising agency, French &AMP; Preston, before joining
Benton &AMP; Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   Bloede became chairman of the agency in 1971 and held that
position until 1983, having given up the chief executive job in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   He was credited with turning around the agency, which in 1967
saw its domestic billings fall more than $10 million and reduced
its work force by 255.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first agency heads to refuse to take cigarette
accounts after the negative health effects of smoking became known
and even resigned several accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being instrumental in building the Maxwell House
brand for General Foods, Bloede helped Procter &AMP; Gamble establish
Crest toothpaste as a leading brand and persuaded the company to
use the ``Please don't squeeze the Charmin'' slogan for its toilet
tissue. He also led the agency's creative efforts in building the
Zest soap and Pampers diapers brands.
</P>
<P>
   Benton &AMP; Bowles merged with D'Arcy, Masius in 1985 and is now
D'Arcy, Masius, Benton &AMP; Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   Bloede attended St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., and
graduated from the University of Maryland in 1941. During World War
II, he was a captain in the Army Air Force and flew 33 missions
over Europe as a bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies in 1973. In retirement, he was a member of the board and
the advisory committee of the Professional Golfers Association.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Merle; a son, Victor Jr.; a
daughter, Susan; seven grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren. &QL;

EARNHART GIVES SON A LESSON AT IROC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s car rolled forward on
the starting grid. Smack. Dale Earnhardt Sr., sitting one spot
behind his son's, rear-ended it. Smack. The elder Earnhardt bumped
his son's car again.
</P>
<P>
   The International Race of Champions was several minutes from
going green and the gamesmanship between father and son had begun.
And while the nudges appeared to be in good humor, whenever Dale
Earnhardt Sr. is involved, you're never sure.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Sr., the defending Daytona 500 winner and a seven-time
Winston Cup champion, rarely bypasses a chance to get in a shot,
whether aimed at his son or a fellow competitor. That's how the
47-year-old NASCAR legend earned the nickname, ``The Intimidator.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., 24, the defending Busch series champion, shares
an aggressive style of driving that is reminiscent of his father
and grandfather, Ralph Earnhardt, both of whom made the all-time
NASCAR top-50 drivers list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to run go-karts, and dad would get out there on a
Honda four-wheeler and he'd be on two wheels and outrun all of
us,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``That was probably the earliest
competition that we had. He cheated. He had more horsepower.''
</P>
<P>
   In the IROC race Friday, the father and son met on the track for
only the only second time.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. brought the fans to their feet when he grabbed an
early lead before getting involved in a wreck on the eighth lap.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Earnhardt Sr. who got the last ovation, winning with
a breathtaking move on the final turn. Making one of his trademark
moves, Earnhardt Sr. bumped Mark Martin out of the way at 180 miles
an hour and took the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique racing against Dale Jr.,'' said Earnhardt Sr., who
drove against his son in an exhibition in Japan last season. ``It's
a proud moment in my life and in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven laps into the race, Earnhardt Jr. had his father, Jeff
Gordon and nine of the world's best drivers in his rear-view
mirror. He put them there with a series of aggressive, calculated
moves. But before Earnhardt Jr. could stretch his lead, a
miscalculation allowed several drivers to slip to his inside on the
eighth lap. A few laps later, he was charging back through the
12-car field of identical Pontiacs when his lime-green car hit the
wall, spinning out of control. ``They crashed me out,'' Earnhardt
Jr. told his father as they met near the victory podium. ``They
ganged up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Earnhardt Jr.'s only wreck. Later in the afternoon,
driving a Busch series Chevrolet owned by his father, Earnhardt Jr.
tangled with another car on the backstretch and damaged the rear
quarter panel during practice for Saturday's NAPA Auto Parts 300.
</P>
<P>
   But his car figures to be ready when he begins to defend the
Busch Series championship in the No. 3 Chevy that was made famous
by his father, who has won $35 million in prize money, more than
any other driver.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers might be topped by the younger Earnhardt, whose
rise to prominence began last April when he won the Coca-Cola 300
at Texas Motor Speedway _ his first Busch Grand National series
victory.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to win six more Busch races on his way to the title,
establishing the Earnhardts as the first family to have three
generations win NASCAR championships.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1996, Dale Jr. raced late-model stock cars in North
Carolina, winning three times and posting 59 top-five finishes in
113 starts. He made eight starts on the Busch circuit in 1997, but
never won. He decided to take Steve Park's seat on his father's
Busch team when Park left to race in the Winston Cup series.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch recognized Earnhardt Jr.'s talent early in his
career. And last month the beer company signed Earnhardt Jr., who
has yet to compete in a Winston Cup race, to a five-year,
$50-million deal, the biggest sponsorship agreement in NASCAR
history. The deal calls for Dale Jr. to compete in five races this
season on the Winston Cup circuit, in addition to his full-time
Busch ride.

   RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK AT CENTER OF POLITICAL STORM
</P>
<P>
   Russia's central bank is engulfed in a political firestorm over
its decision to use an offshore company to manage some of its cash
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much of the bank's reserves were kept
overseas or who may have earned fees and commissions from managing
the money. But the move raises a new issue in Moscow's already
troubled relations with the International Monetary Fund, which has
funneled billions of dollars in aid to Russia through the central
bank. It also underscores a lack of supervision over one of the
country's bedrock institutions.
</P>
<P>
   VISA BACKS ITS MARKETING CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   The board of Visa has voted to keep the Visa brand name at the
center of its marketing campaigns. Two Citigroup executives
resigned from the board of Visa last week in protest over the
issue. Still unresolved is whether the Visa logo will be moved to
the back of credit cards to emphasize the brands of member banks, a
move Citigroup had requested.
</P>
<P>
   NEW BARCLAYS CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Neill, the newly named chief executive of Barclays,
Britain's second-largest bank, has negotiated a compensation
package based on his ability to turn the financially ailing bank
around. Among the many problems facing Barclays is the fact that
the investment arm of the bank lost about $412 million in Russia
last year. Its retail branches are under pressure from rivals
offering direct banking services. And its credit card business,
Britain's biggest, is being eroded by American banks offering
cheaper consumer credit.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN APPROVES BAILOUT OF 15 BANKS
</P>
<P>
   Japan granted preliminary approval for a 7.45 trillion yen ($65
billion) bailout of 15 of the nation's biggest banks, the latest
step in the government's drive to bring back confidence in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   GIVEAWAY BY MICROSOFT'S MAGAZINE
</P>
<P>
   Slate, Microsoft's online magazine, said it would no longer
charge for the privilege of reading the bulk of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR AT&AMP;T CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T fell $2.25, to $85.9375, but have risen about 41
percent in the last year as C. Michael Armstrong has reshaped the
telecommunications giant. He will receive more responsibilities in
the day-to-day operations of Tele-Communications following its
$59.4 billion acquisition, which is expected by April. AT&AMP;T said
the changes were related to the company's recent decision not to
create a tracking stock for some of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN WATER WORKS IN DEAL
</P>
<P>
   American Water Works plans to buy National Enterprises, a
privately held water utility that has investments in
telecommunications, for $475 million in stock. It will also assume
$226 million in debt. American Water Works completed 22
acquisitions last year.
</P>
<P>
   MOODY'S UPGRADES KOREAN BOND
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's foreign-currency bond rating was raised one notch
by Moody's Investors Service because of the country's improved
finances and political support for change.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS INVENTORIES UNCHANGED
</P>
<P>
   Inventories of unsold goods at U.S. businesses were unchanged in
December at $1.088 trillion as drops in factory and chain-store
stockpiles were offset by increases at auto dealers,
building-material suppliers and wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   PUNTA DEL ESTE'S ECONOMIC BLUES
</P>
<P>
   Uruguay's coastline resort of Punta Del Este remains a rarefied
place where American dollars and Argentine and Uruguayan pesos are
exchanged interchangeably and the likes of Julio Iglesias, Omar
Sharif and Pamela Anderson still order bottles of 1990 Dom Perignon
at $350 a pop. But Punta's business elite is growing alarmed over
the fallout from Brazil's economic crisis, which has caused a 35
percent plunge in the value of Brazil's currency. Brazilian tour
groups have scrapped hotel reservations in droves, and now
Argentina's middle class visitors are spending less money.

   Redding is about 2,500 miles from Wolfinger's hometown of
Portland, Ore., but it is light-years away from his former
surroundings. Before coming here last May, Wolfinger, now 19 years
old, had lived alone from the age of 15 while attending Woodrow
Wilson High School in Portland somewhat sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 6-foot-11-inch Wolfinger lives what he calls a ``Brady
Bunch'' life with Todd and Wendy Kaufman and their three sons, the
oldest of whom, Brandon, is a teammate of Wolfinger on the Joel
Barlow High School basketball team. ``This is about as perfect as a
family life can be,'' Wolfinger said before a recent practice.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfinger knows that the competition at the small, mainly
suburban schools that Joel Barlow faces does not compare to the
talent in the Portland high school city league. But he also knows
that he desperately needed a change and he seems to have found the
right niche _ albeit an incongruous one _ in this sylvan community
of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the next stop on a journey that has brought
Wolfinger from the angry tantrums of a teen-age truant living alone
in Portland to affluence in Connecticut to a basketball scholarship
at St. John's next September and perhaps _ if he continues to
improve and bulks up his rail-thin 200-pound frame _ eventually to
the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfinger's experience also highlights the delicate and
ever-expanding role that people outside a promising young athlete's
immediate family begin to play in his or her development.
</P>
<P>
   With 699 students, Joel Barlow is less than half the size of
Wolfinger's high school in Portland; and Redding's suburban
affluence also made the teen-ager uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that I was very different from the other kids,''
Wolfinger said. ``And I know that some of them didn't especially
like me, but then I didn't like a lot of them, either, and I felt
out of place. I've gotten more used to it all, but not completely.
One thing I found out early was that most of these kids had so
much, but they didn't seem to appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfinger did not find the transition any easier on the court,
either on the school team or in the Amateur Athletic Union league
where he played last summer. ``At first, Jack argued with everyone
_ officials, opponents, his own teammates,'' said Bob Menegay, his
coach at Joel Barlow. ``But he more than held his own against some
good competition. Since then, he's established a much better
rapport with his teammates and, over all, has responded positively
to coaching.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A smooth and graceful big man, Wolfinger has poise, fluidity and
skills as a passer that overshadow his outstanding shooting
ability. ``More than anything, I like handling the ball,'' said
Wolfinger, who is averaging 22 points, 12 rebounds, 6 blocked shots
and 5 assists a game for a 12-5 Barlow team. ``I like playing all
five positions, but realize I'm not going to be a point guard in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Jarvis of St. John's is excited about what Wolfinger
could bring to the Red Storm front line. ``We know he can develop
into a very special player,'' Jarvis said. ``He's going to be
difficult to defend against, and he should fit very well with us,
although it may take a year or two. And considering what he's been
through, he has tremendous character. He's had to overcome
incredible obstacles in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at a time when young men frequently come from lives of
extreme hardship to excel in college, Wolfinger's story is
striking.
</P>
<P>
   After his parents separated when he was 15, Wolfinger chose to
live on his own in Portland. ``I was bitter about my parents
breaking up, and I blamed them,'' he said, ``but it wasn't really
their fault. We were poor and times were tough.''
</P>
<P>
   With some limited aid from his father and income from various
odd jobs, Wolfinger rented an apartment in a house. ``It had a bed,
some chairs and tables, a TV, a refrigerator and a microwave,'' he
recalled. ``The microwave was important because about all I ever
ate were instant noodles _ sometimes three times a day. Sometimes
I'd eat at a friend's house, or one of them would come over and
we'd have something special, like hot dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfinger would closet himself in the apartment, playing video
games. ``Sometimes all day,'' he said. ``I'd sleep late almost
every day and usually miss the first period in school, but then I
didn't care about school, just basketball. I got suspended several
times for talking back to teachers and had some other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his passion for basketball, he did not impress his coach
during two years on the high school varsity. ``Jack started on and
off, but he was inconsistent and he practiced sporadically,'' said
Jack Bertell, who retired last year after 35 years at Woodrow
Wilson in Portland. ``He wasn't always reliable, but you couldn't
help but like him. There was some interest by some Pac-10 schools,
but they were turned off by his academics.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bertell was not taken by Wolfinger's talent, Bob Gaillard
was. Currently the coach at Lewis &AMP; Clark College in Portland,
Gaillard previously coached at the University of San Francisco,
where his Dons were ranked No. 1 in the country during most of the
1976-77 season when they finished 29-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a built-in bias on the part of a lot of coaches out
here who define a player by size,'' Gaillard said. ``And if you're
Jack's size _ he was about 6-8 when I saw him last summer _ you're
supposed to get under the basket where you belong, even though
you're a great ball-handler. Here he was not even starting most of
the time, and I think he was the best player in the Portland city
league.''
</P>
<P>
   When Larry Gillman, a former assistant of Gaillard's at San
Francisco who now lives in Connecticut, went to Portland on
business last spring, Gaillard sought Gillman's impressions of
Wolfinger. ``We put him through a series of drills,'' Gaillard
said, ``and I remember Larry saying, `This kid can play.' And he
was right. I know that if I was still at San Francisco, I certainly
would recruit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillman, the head coach at East Carolina University from 1977 to
1979 who later represented a number of NBA players, now runs a
series of youth basketball clinics nationwide. Gillman, who is no
longer an agent, said he was touched by Wolfinger's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that he had no one to turn to,'' Gillman said.
``And even though he knew he wasn't doing well in school, he told
me how much he wanted to go to college. It was clear that he needed
a more stable environment and, after talking with Bob, I offered to
take him back to Connecticut to live with my wife and me and our
young son.''
(MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   Before Wolfinger moved, Gaillard administered a bit of tough
love. ``I told him that the opportunity to go back east and live
with Larry and attend high school in Connecticut could be his last
chance to straighten out his life, but that he would have to buckle
down and prove himself in the classroom. We talked for a long time,
and he finally agreed to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In late April, Wolfinger flew to Connecticut. The day, which
began at 5 a.m. when Gaillard drove him to the airport, is etched
in Wolfinger's memory. ``It was nighttime when we got to Redding,
and I never saw it so dark in my life,'' he recalled. ``The first
thing I asked Mrs. Gillman, who picked me up, was, `Where are the
street lights?' And when I could see, all I saw were trees. Then I
couldn't believe the size of their house.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Wolfinger arrived at Barlow High for the last
two months of the school year. He was stunned by what he found.
``First of all, it looked like a middle school, not a high
school,'' he said of the one-story building set in a rural area
with no other buildings in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I couldn't believe how so many of the kids drove to school
in their own cars,'' he added. ``And I'd hear some of them talking
about how they wish they had a '98 instead of a '96 Ford Explorer.
And I remembered how back in Portland I was driving a broken-down
'75 Volvo wagon with no shocks and windshield wipers that didn't
work, which made me stick my hands out the window and wipe the
windshield when it rained. Fortunately, I have long arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gillmans said that they made it clear at the start that
Wolfinger was not in Redding solely to play basketball. ``We told
Jack what we expected of him, and that this wasn't going to be
party time,'' Donna Gillman said. ``You could sense that he felt,
`Wow, these people have rules.' But you also could tell that he was
starving for direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Larry Gillman arranged for Wolfinger to play with an
AAU team based in Stamford, Conn., which played about 40 games
while traveling as far as Las Vegas, Nev. It was while playing AAU
ball that he drew the attention of Kevin Clark, an assistant coach
at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   By then he had moved in with the Kaufmans. ``Much as we enjoyed
having Jack live with us, it was a better situation, since the
Kaufmans had sons closer to his age,'' Donna Gillman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfinger's new living arrangements pleased St. John's Coach
Mike Jarvis, who makes no secret of his antipathy toward Gillman.
``I had to be convinced by Jack that he had disassociated himself
from Gillman,'' Jarvis said. ``Otherwise, I would not have
recruited him, since I want nothing to do with a player who's
associated with Larry Gillman.''
</P>
<P>
   The history between Jarvis and Gillman dates from 1994 when,
Jarvis believes, the agent encouraged Yinka Dare, a 7-1 sophomore
center from Nigeria, to withdraw from George Washington University
where Jarvis was then the coach and declare for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Gillman insists he had nothing to do with Dare's decision. ``He
called me and asked me to come and get him,'' Gillman said. ``But I
encouraged him to stay in school, which, for an agent, is
occupational suicide. But when he realized the money he could make
in the NBA, he wanted to drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillman said he later negotiated a $9 million contract for Dare,
who played sparingly during three and a half seasons with the New
Jersey Nets. Dare is no longer in the NBA. Gillman also said he
negotiated a lucrative contract for Chris Washburn, who also left
school after two years. Washburn, a former North Carolina State
player, was eventually banned from the NBA for life because of drug
addiction. Another N.C. State player, Charles Shackleford, said
Gillman had loaned him $45,000 while he was still in school.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that recently, Gillman said, ``I never gave him a
penny.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Gillman also worked with Eric Gingold, a 7-3,
270-pound player from New York City. Gingold, who did not run the
floor particularly well and could not dunk despite his size, played
sparingly at Williams College, a Division III school in
Williamstown, Mass., but Gillman succeeded in getting him two shots
with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   It was with this same kind of persuasiveness and basketball
savvy that Gillman convinced Wolfinger and his father, Phil, that
Jack should relocate to Redding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a great opportunity,'' Phil Wolfinger, a
designer of custom homes, said in a telephone interview from
Portland. ``And I figured it was best for Jack to let him chart his
own course. I knew he had lost the battle with academics in
Portland. When I talked with Gillman, it seemed he wanted to help
Jack, but my overall impression was that he wasn't doing all of
this out of the goodness of his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated to me that he could help groom Jack for the NBA,
and that he somehow would probably be involved in his career and
that he could probably hook him up with a good agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Wolfinger, though, said Gillman never discussed the
possibility of representing him as an agent or leading him to an
agent. ``He would work with me on my game while I was living with
him and his family,'' Wolfinger said, ``but it was just to help me
as a player. I don't think it was anything more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Wolfinger finally has found his stride
in Connecticut, both on the court and in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent game at Stratford High School, he played all five
positions. When he grabbed defensive rebounds, he whipped outlet
passes before his feet hit the floor. Before bringing the ball
upcourt on occasion, he dished off to players on the wing before
moving into the low post or to the outside. His nine field goals
came on a variety of shots _ soft jumpers, baskets inside off spin
moves and fakes, and a 12-foot bank shot. He finished with 25
points, about 3 above his average, as Joel Barlow fell to
Stratford, 56-51.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly a poor, indifferent student in Portland, Wolfinger
has held his own at Joel Barlow, which sends 92 percent of its
graduates to college and where the average SAT score is over 1,100.
``Jack had a 3.14 for the first quarter this year, which is a B
average,'' Wendy Kaufman said. ``He spends his lunch hours being
tutored in English and algebra,'' she added, ``which are two of his
five courses. And he wrote a great essay about kids having so much
and not appreciating what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   With a grade-point average to match his statistics, Wolfinger
said he was recruited by a large number of schools. He pared his
list to St. John's, Rutgers and Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made my visit to St. John's in November, I realized it
was the place for me,'' he said. ``I liked the fact that it's a
city school. And Coach Jarvis was great. He said, `I see a young
man who gets up to about 245 pounds and is a Keith Van Horn-type
player.' He also told me that I was going to have to keep proving
myself academically _ and that he knew I could do it because he had
faith in me. After that, I knew in my heart that St. John's was the
right place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way, Wolfinger realized that he had to leave
the place he knew best to find himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely matured since I got here,'' he said, ``and
I've worked very hard. I think I've also changed. I'm sure a lot of
people back home wouldn't even recognize me _ or even understand
me. Coming here has not only helped me; it's also changed me for
the better and, thanks to the Gillmans and Kaufmans and my coaches
here, helped me get my life in order.'' &QL;

YEAR OF SCANDAL ENDS AS SENATE VOTES TO ACQUIT CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's tumultuous impeachment odyssey ended
Friday as it began, with Bill Clinton's legacy forever tattered but
his presidency intact.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 months of scandal and partisan upheaval, the ordeal
officially ended at 12:39 p.m., as Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist pronounced the Senate's acquittal of the 42d president on
two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sparing Clinton the dishonor of becoming the first president to
be forced from office for high crimes and misdemeanors, the Senate
firmly rejected both impeachment articles in what many viewed as a
a partial rebuke of the House Republicans who presented the
sex-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Republican senators joined all 45 Democrats to defeat
Article I, alleging perjury, 55-45, at 12:20 p.m. Just six minutes
later, Article II, charging Clinton with obstruction of justice,
failed, 50-50, with five GOP senators defecting. Sixty-seven votes
were required for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said William
Jefferson Clinton be, and he hereby is, acquitted of the charges in
the said articles,'' Rehnquist declared, after a session that was
short on suspense but rich in historical import.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were broadcast to a nation that has grown weary
of the scandal and, polls show, wanted Clinton acquitted as quickly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Clinton emerged from the Oval Office, where he
began the sex scandal that nearly consumed his presidency, to ``say
again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what I
said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they have
imposed on the Congress and on the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many in Congress, Clinton appealed for ``reconciliation and
renewal for America'' after the turbulent months that former
Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas portrayed as a ``long national
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution came 13 months after allegations first burst into
headlines that Clinton may have broken the law in trying to cover
up his illicit affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House
intern who was less than half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Before the drama ended in the same chamber where Andrew Johnson
was cleared 131 years ago in the only previous presidential
impeachment trial, both houses of Congress were shaken by the case.
</P>
<P>
   The chief catalyst behind the impeachment charges _ the House
Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois _ expressed
disappointment at Clinton's acquittal but offered hope for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this entire experience is in the hands of history,'' Hyde
said, after he sat glumly with the 12 other House impeachment
managers as the impeachment rolls were called in the Senate
chamber. ``We must all now look forward to the many challenges
facing our great nation in a spirit of reconciliation, not
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Hyde said he hopes the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, does not pursue criminal charges against Clinton
during the final 23 months of his presidency or later. Starr has
not indicated whether he will move to indict Clinton or close the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde cited President Richard M. Nixon, who resigned rather than
face being impeached by the House and a probable impeachment trial
in the Senate. Hyde quoted President Ronald Reagan as saying he
assumed Nixon ``got up every morning with a ball of lead in his
stomach, knowing he had been the leader of the free world and now
was disgraced.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, Hyde said, ``I don't think indicting and
criminally trying him, after what we have all been through, is
going to be helpful to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although members of both parties denounced Clinton for his
actions causing the impeachment crisis, a bipartisan effort to
censure the president was derailed Friday by Senator Phil Gramm, a
Texas Republican. Censure supporters fell 11 votes short of the 67
needed to override Gramm's opposition to permitting a vote on the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The lead censure sponsor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California
Democrat, vowed to revive the effort when the Senate reconvenes
Feb. 22. But many other supporters declared the effort dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over. Let's move on,'' said Senator John F. Kerry. ``I'll
let my vote and my final statement stand as my censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's statement, which he delivered Wednesday and released
Friday, assails the House managers for ``the moral righteousness,
even the zealotry of their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed at times not just scorn, but snarling, trembling
venom that told us the president was a criminal,'' Kerry said,
according to his statement.
</P>
<P>
   But he spoke harshly of Clinton and conceded that the president
``may even have committed a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, expressions of outrage peppered the final statements
that many senators delivered in more than three days of closed-door
deliberations of Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the final hours of debate before the vote Friday, the dean of
Senate Democrats, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, accused Clinton
of damaging ``all of the institutions of government'' in ``this
national tragedy.'' Byrd was the only Democrat whose position on
Clinton's fate had remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens here, many, many people will be left
tasting only the bitter dregs of discontent,'' Byrd told his
colleagues, according to a statement he released afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But in announcing that he would oppose Clinton's conviction,
Byrd called on members of both parties ``to crush the seeds of
ugliness and enmity which have taken root in the sacred soil of our
republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama's final scene began just past noon, before a
standing-room-only gallery of spectators. With no public debate,
the votes were taken after each article of impeachment was read by
a Senate clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of this,'' each article stated, ``William Jefferson
Clinton has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought
disrepute on the presidency, has betrayed his trust as president,
and has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and
justice, to the manifest injury of the people of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   After each article was read, Rehnquist asked, ``Senators, how
say you? Is the respondent, William Jefferson Clinton, guilty or
not guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, 99 senators rose from their seats to respond,
beginning with Spencer Abraham of Michigan, ending with Ron Wyden
of Oregon. Senator Max Cleland, a Georgia Democrat, spoke from his
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-week Senate trial and a four-month House
impeachment process, the last act was over in less than 45 minutes.
Under impeachment rules that have endured since 1868, the Senate
formally notified the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, of
the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave you now a wiser, but not a sadder, man,'' Rehnquist
told the senators before he closed the trial and was escorted from
the chamber moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Every New England senator voted to acquit Clinton, except for
the two New Hampshire Republicans, Senators Bob Smith and Judd
Gregg. Breaking ranks with the GOP majority were Senators John H.
Chafee of Rhode Island, James M. Jeffords of Vermont, and Olympia
J. Snowe and Susan M. Collins, both of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth Republican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
joined the four New Englanders in opposing both articles of
impeachment and denying the House managers the consolation of
gaining majority support for either charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as it troubles me to acquit this president, I cannot
do otherwise and remain true to my role as a senator,'' Collins
said in her closing statement, which she made Thursday and released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Five additional Republicans who voted to remove Clinton from
office on the obstruction charge joined Specter and the New England
moderates in voting against the perjury count: Senators Slade
Gorton of Washington, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of
Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee, and John Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, Smith, the New Hampshire Republican, voiced
the frustration of many of Clinton's most ardent foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won,'' Smith said. ``He always wins. But that doesn't mean
America won or the rule of law won.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Smith's political opposites, Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a victory for the Constitution of the United
States,'' Kennedy said in his Capitol office, moments before police
rushed in to announce they were evacuating the building because of
a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Police said they received an anonmymous tip that a bomb
was set to detonate in the Senate chamber at 2 p.m., but ``nothing
of a suspicious nature was found'' and the building was reopened
about an hour after the scare began.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kennedy heeded the evacuation order, he renewed his
criticism of the House impeachment process. Citing Abraham
Lincoln's birthday Friday, Kennedy said Lincoln ``probably would
have taken a deep sigh'' at the ``tainted'' process in the House
that led to the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the culmination of highly divisive proceedings, the
Republican-controlled House in December voted largely along party
lines in passing the perjury charge, 228-206, and the obstruction
count, 221-212.
</P>
<P>
   The votes forced the first impeachment trial of an elected
president. Andrew Johnson was vice president when he ascended to
the presidency after Lincoln's assassination. In the seething
climate of retribution after the Civil War, Johnson avoided
conviction by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fared better than Johnson, in part because Democrats
such as Kennedy were able to cast him as the target of ``radical
Republicans'' who were bent on removing him over circumstances
stemming from private indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after Clinton spoke at the White House about
his acquittal, the president telephoned Kennedy at his Senate
office to express his gratitude for the senator's support. A source
said Clinton also ``expressed his eagerness to move on to the
health care and education agendas,'' Kennedy's major initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, senators in both parties, though fatigued by the
impeachment ordeal, portrayed themselves as eager to return to
legislative business.
</P>
<P>
   In the last words of his closed-door speech, Byrd told his
colleagues: ``We have much important work to do. And, in truth, it
is long past time for us to move on.''

DE LA HOYA'S GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya needs this fight against Ike
Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that De La Hoya has won titles in four weight classes and
has beaten nine current or former world champions. Forget his
career earnings (more than $100 million), his gold medal in the
1992 Olympics and his idol status.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champ, needs this fight against
Quartey of Ghana tonight at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in Las Vegas
because a win will help validate his career.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the beginning of his professional career he has
been criticized for his choice of opponents. Each had a glaring
deficiency: too small, too old or simply overmatched. But not
Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   The unbeaten former WBA welterweight titleholder is recognized
as one of the best fighters pound-for-pound in the world. Quartey
has a pile-driving jab, power and the ferocity to turn it loose. He
has the respect of the boxing community.
</P>
<P>
   If De La Hoya can win, even his most ardent detractors are going
to have to give him credit. No one is more aware of this than De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who wanted this fight,'' De La Hoya said this
week. ``I'm the one who stepped up and said I want Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't, I'd be fighting some Joe Schmo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the De La Hoya camp doesn't believe this is a tough
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, De La Hoya, a 3{-1 favorite, is doing his part to
boost pay-per-view sales. This week, he said with a straight face:
``I'm going to have to prepare my mind for possibly losing.
Hopefully, it won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (29-0, 24 knockouts) doesn't believe anyone could
beat him, including Quartey, whose straight-ahead, easy-to-hit
style could render him easy prey for a fighter of the champion's
boxing ability and substantial height and reach advantage.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's true feelings have surfaced somewhat. Recently, he
said Quartey ``doesn't have the best head movement. His defense
isn't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alcazar, his trainer, went a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Easy win or tough win, it really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   If De La Hoya wins, he will get his due. Quartey might not be a
difficult opponent once they step into the ring tonight, but
clearly he's the best De La Hoya will have faced and a worthy
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very significant fight,'' said Sugar Ray Leonard,
who knows a significant welterweight matchup when he sees one.
``There are still questions as to whether Oscar has faced the
toughest opponents, whether he's dodged the big punchers for
business reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he understands that to be great, you have fight great
fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight also is tremendously significant for
Quartey (34-0-1, 29 KOs). It's his chance to ensure more
million-dollar paydays (he'll make $3 million tonight, De La Hoya
$9 million) and secure an exalted place in the eyes of his
countrymen, who idolize former champion Azumah Nelson but still
have questions about Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   And he's paid a stiff price the past 16 months to get to this
point.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 17, 1997, he was lucky to escape with his title (which
he has since given up) when he fought Jose Luis Lopez to a draw. He
seemed to be exposed as vulnerable when he was nearly knocked out
late in the fight, but Quartey said a bout with malaria during
training sapped his energy.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't fought since, which could be the deficiency doubters
point to if De La Hoya wins.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey was set to face Pernell Whitaker in April but the fight
was canceled when Whitaker tested positive for cocaine. Then, he
was supposed to fight Felix Trinidad, but that fell through because
of promotional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   And the original Nov. 21 date for this fight was pushed back
when De La Hoya was cut during sparring.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Quartey, frustrated over his fate, insisted De
La Hoya had concocted the cut story to give more time to prepare
after a tougher-than-expected eight-round knockout victory over
Julio Cesar Chavez in his last fight.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll break his neck like a chicken,'' said Quartey, normally
as taciturn as anyone you'll ever meet.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, promoter Bob Arum is likening the bout to those of the
Leonard-Tommy Hearns-Marvin Hagler-Roberto Duran golden era of
lower-division fights. He even had Leonard and Hearns speak at the
final news conference leading to the fight.
</P>
<P>
   In a more candid moment, he admitted the general public isn't as
familiar with Quartey as they were with that quartet, but added
that it's not the general public that makes pay-per-view buys: It's
those who know boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious fans know Ike Quartey,'' Arum said. ``They understand
how important this fight is.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially to De La Hoya.

CLINTON'S NOTE TO HIS STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the e-mail message President Clinton
sent to his staff on Friday, as obtained by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I want to thank you personally for all you are doing for this
Administration and our nation. Working at the White House is a
great privilege, but I know it is also often a burden on you, and
on the family and friends to whom you turn for support. That has
meant long days, late nights, and many weekends here _ and I want
you to know how grateful I am.
</P>
<P>
   The past year has been especially difficult for you. I know that
my actions and the events they triggered have made your work even
harder. For that, I am profoundly sorry. In all this, under the
most extraordinary of circumstances, you never lost sight of your
first obligation _ to serve the people of our nation. For that, I
am profoundly grateful.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining years of this Administration can and must be a
time of great achievement for our nation. I know you share my pride
in what we have accomplished already to strengthen America at home
and abroad, including over the past year, when we created the first
surplus in three decades and continued dramatic advances in
education and other vital areas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, together we have much more to do to meet our obligations to
future generations. We have set out our goals before the American
people _ from saving Social Security and Medicare, to strengthening
education and health care, to advancing peace and security around
the world _ and I know you share my determination to act on those
priorities. Today, the nation we love is strong and confident. In
the months to come, we can move beyond the divisions of the past
year to build a nation that is stronger and more united as it
enters the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Your dedication and loyalty have meant more to me than you can
ever know. The best way I can repay you is to redouble my own
efforts on behalf of the ideals we share, and to make the most of
every day we are here. I thank you again for everything you are
doing _ and I ask you to keep working hard in the months ahead.
Together, we can achieve great things for the American people.

BIG MEN ARE BRUINS' LARGEST CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ The Bruins strolled into breakfast Friday
morning both encouraged by their performance at Stanford and
concerned about the state of their freshmen big men, Dan Gadzuric
and Jerome Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they get better,'' guard Baron Davis said. ``Right now,
it's tough trying to make a stretch run and having them hurt. We
want them to be ready for the (NCAA) Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   For various reasons, Moiso and Gadzuric combined for just 12
points and five rebounds at Stanford. Those numbers may be good
enough to beat Oregon State, but not elite teams like Stanford or
Arizona or anyone the Bruins may face in the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso has developed tendinitis in his right foot, near the arch.
It has disrupted his conditioning, confidence and timing. He made 1
of 12 shots in Maples Pavilion and has not scored in double figures
since the Washington game two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's affected his whole confidence,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lavin spoke to Moiso about sitting out for a game or
two, but the training staff does not believe a few days off will
help: Moiso needs prolonged rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to get any better by staying out for one week
or two games,'' Lavin said. ``He's in some real pain. He's trying
to fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul trouble has become as great a nemesis for Gadzuric as the
tendinitis in his knees. He played 14 minutes against Stanford and
fouled out with nine minutes left, stripping UCLA of its best
rebounder for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of his fouls are over-the-back and he could eliminate one
or two of those per game,'' Lavin said. ``But because he's so
aggressive, we don't want him to get away from that. At Washington,
he tried not to foul, and you saw what happened. (Todd MacCulloch
scored 26 points.) He's better off, even if it's for limited
minutes, playing as hard as he can for as long as he can.''
</P>
<P>
   But playing hard and fouling are not mutually inclusive _ just
ask Stanford's Mark Madsen. Eventually, perhaps, Gadzuric will
learn to play hard and play clean at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   (Gadzuric and Moiso were not available for comment Friday
because of a midterm exam.)
</P>
<P>
   Their A games: Despite subpar performances by the big men, the
Bruins were in a position to win because Davis and JaRon Rush
played arguably the best games of their careers _ combining for 43
points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rush has sandwiched a one-game benching (Oregon State) around
two stellar performances. He scored 17 points last week against
Oregon, then contributed 20 points and 11 rebounds at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty special (Thursday) night,'' Lavin said. ``One
encouraging thing is it's not just him, but the entire team
responds to discipline and challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he's sorry: Lavin sent an impromptu letter to Washington,
the Seattle Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer apologizing
for his conduct during the UCLA-Washington game. (He charged the
court, was restrained, slapped with two technicals and ejected.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed sincere,'' a Washington official said. ``We thought
it was a nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracking down?: The Pacific-10 is taking a tough stance on crowd
control and, specifically, the use of lasers to disrupt players
when shooting free throws. It happened during the Stanford-Arizona
game in Tucson two weeks ago and again Thursday night at Maples
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league, use of a laser will be culpable with
other disruptive acts, like throwing objects on the floor. If
problems persist after a warning is issued, the home team will be
assessed a technical foul.

SICKOUTS OFTEN HAVE SAME EFFECT AS STRIKES ON AIRLINES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pilots for American Airlines aren't on strike. Neither were
Trans World Airlines flight attendants over Christmas weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But their ``sickouts'' had the same effect as a strike: canceled
flights, lost revenues and peeved passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to passengers of American and TWA, the flying public
has seen flights canceled or delayed over the past year due to
sickouts, slow downs or other job actions at Northwest Airlines and
Houston-based Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unions are constantly these days looking for alternatives
for striking,'' said Jack Getman, a University of Texas professor
who specializes in labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   Such job actions can cause nearly as much disruption for an
airline as a strike, catching management off guard and without
contingency plans. And they don't bring employees some of a
strike's risk, such as loss of pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on strike everyone knows what the story is,'' said
Michael Boyd, a Colorado-based aviation consultant who has done
work for airlines, aircraft manufacturers and American's pilots
union. ``When you're in a job action nobody knows where the mayhem
will strike or where the mayhem will manifest. &UR; '' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   American spokesman Tim Smith said officials were caught a bit by
surprise by its pilots, who began calling in sick Feb. 5, forcing
Fort Worth-based American to ground flights.
</P>
<P>
   The issue centers on Reno Air, the small carrier American
recently purchased, and how its 300 pilots are to be integrated
with American's 9,200. The Allied Pilots Union, which represents
American's pilots, says the Reno deal violates its contract. The
two sides negotiated over the issue during the week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, American canceled more than 1,100 flights, or nearly
half its schedule. That was down slightly from Thursday's tally,
but American said Friday it would cancel more flights over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge, responding to American's request, Wednesday
ordered pilots back to work. But the sick calls kept coming. The
parties were back in court Friday hearing American's motion that
the union be held in contempt. A ruling is expected Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent job actions at carriers other than American, employees
were waiting for new contract agreements to be reached. Under
federal law, unions in contract negotiations must follow a series
of steps, which can take years, before they can legally strike.
</P>
<P>
   At Continental, for several days in November some mechanics
engaged in what they dubbed a safety campaign, following the rules
to every little detail, that caused delays and cancellations, which
the airline wouldn't put a number on. The airline and the union
quickly reached a second tentative contract agreement, which was
later approved by the rank-and-file. An earlier tentative deal had
been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   For airline employees in such a highly unionized and regulated
industry, experts say a sickout, done in the right way by the right
employees, has fewer risks than a strike. Employees stay on the
payroll and the union doesn't bear the cost of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the effect of a strike, without the negative downside
for the employees,'' said Greg Tarpinian, executive director of
Labor Research Association, which consults for unions.
</P>
<P>
   Highly-skilled and not-easily-replaced employees, such as pilots
and to a lesser-degree mechanics, have the most leverage. Those who
are more easily replaced, experts said, are best to engage in
quick-hit actions to get management's attention. Prolonged action
can lead to job losses.
</P>
<P>
   Airline pilots are especially poised to carry off sickouts.
Pilots, some of whom previously served in the military, are known
as a tough, disciplined group that shares information with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as aircraft require pilots to fly, the pilots are
going to have extreme leverage over any airline. That's the way it
is,`` said PaineWebber analyst Sam Buttrick. ``For a passenger
whose flight is canceled whether it's a strike or a sickout is
largely an irrelevant detail.''
</P>
<P>
   And pilots have leeway, under federal rules, to decide if they
are fit to fly. Their assessment can include illness and stress.
Back-to-work court orders can be hard to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's a company going to prove a pilot really isn't sick?``
said George Hopkins, a Western Illinois University professor of
history with expertise in airline unions.
</P>
<P>
   At American, which has a history of bad labor-management
relations, pilots are fueled by anger built up for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots have a great deal of frustration and anger at the
company,'' said union spokesman and American pilot Drew Engelke.
``It comes from years of contract abuses and poor treatment at the
hands of ... management.''
</P>
<P>
   One drawback, experts said, can be drawing the wrath of
customers, who may refuse to fly a particular airline after a job
action. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of passengers have
already been affected by the pilot sickout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is irritating the public, and I'm sure it
irritates the stockholders,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   And at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, people weren't
too happy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pilar Ostolaza was trying to get home to Mexico City after a
visit to Chicago. Her direct American flight Thursday from Chicago
was canceled. After a night in Chicago and American losing her
luggage, she flew Friday from Chicago to Dallas on American. She
then took a Delta Air Lines flight to Houston, and was hoping for a
Delta flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was going to be so complicated,'' she said.
``They're so disorganized.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Clipson, a Nacogdoches, Texas, resident, was headed from
Dallas to Albuquerque, N.M. His Friday flight was canceled, so he
drove from Nacogdoches to Houston for another flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not fly on American again unless it's absolutely an
emergency,'' he said.
</P>

HOUSE MANAGERS SEEMED RELIEVEDS JUST TO ESCAPE ALIVE &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One was ``surprised'' by Friday's impeachment vote.
Another was ``perplexed.'' And a third even claimed victory, saying
Republicans were ``vindicated by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the 13 Republican House managers seemed relieved
just to have escaped the Senate alive. Filing quickly out of the
chamber after President Clinton's acquittal, they scurried to their
side of the Capitol ``at the end of a bayonet,'' quipped
Representative Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't blame the senators for not inviting us there to
spend a couple of months,'' said House Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors, the managers had clearly lost. Their effort to
oust Clinton ended with neither of the two articles of impeachment
winning a majority of votes, though the obstruction of justice
count fell just short with 50 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the managers said they had succeeded on other grounds.
Expressing little bitterness, and in a markedly softer tone than in
the past, the House prosecutors emerged from the second
unsuccessful presidential impeachment trial in the nation's history
with their heads held high.
</P>
<P>
   They also put forward a ``glass half-full'' interpretation of
the day's events _ their vision of how the impeachment effort
should go down in history, and their hope for how voters will
consider the trial the next time they go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm satisfied. I don't walk away from this feeling
I've been badly treated,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this trial showed America at its best,'' agreed
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 50 senators who voted to convict the president voted to
establish a standard of integrity for the office of the
president,'' said Representative Charles T. Canady of Florida,
referring to the vote on the obstruction of justice charge. ``Those
are not meaningless acts. And I think the message of this whole
process for future presidents is that they will violate the law at
their peril, that they will not remain unscathed if they engage in
conduct in violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Their remarks were not without tinges of sadness and exhaustion.
Several of the managers, indeed, spoke as they rushed to the
airport to catch flights home. Representative Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas, whose brother was among the senators who voted to
convict, said he was ``looking forward to a long walk in the Ozark
hills'' before returning to legislative work.
</P>
<P>
   They also seemed more inclined to reflect on their own futures,
with a growing awareness that their fates, too, had been
irrevocably altered by the impeachment trial. Representative
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina acknowleged that there was nothing
he could ``do in politics to change the first line of my political
obituary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My political obituary is going to be, trial manager in the
trial of William Jefferson Clinton, leader of the coup against
Newt, and anything else that could follow. And I regret that in
many ways,'' he said. ``I'm proud of the job I did here, but
there's a definite taste of regret in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the lead prosecutor in the case and a congressman since
1974, dismissed the question about his legacy more easily. ``I hope
to slay many more dragons, which will supersede the events of
impeachment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One manager, Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, sounded
the most stung by the final verdict, even though the outcome had
been all but certain for months. As he dashed out of the Capitol,
he said he was caught unaware by several Senate Republicans who
voted against both articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perplexed by whatever rationale'' they used, McCollum
said.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme among the managers was that their inability to
call live witnesses added greatly to their defeat. Graham said that
with only ``the pitiful three'' witnesses, who testified by
videotape, it was difficult for the prosecution to prompt interest
in the case, or to convince senators the charges rose to the level
of an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Graham said, ``I think we did a good job of showing lies
by the president, showing that those lies were passed on to the
grand jury. I had some frustrations with the process, but I'm glad
it went to a vote. I have a sense of satisfaction. And now we need
to move on.''

SHARPTON SLIPS INTO A FAMILIAR ROLE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before the evening news the other night, the
parents of Amadou Diallo, the West African street vendor shot dead
by plainclothes police officers last week, walked up to microphones
to offer their first extended public remarks about the death of
their son. The setting was a second-floor auditorium up a scuffed
flight of steps in Harlem. And the host, wearing a crisp, gray
three-piece suit and clearly enjoying this latest bustle at his
Harlem headquarters, was the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps inevitable. In the 15 years since Sharpton took
up the cause of one of the four black youths shot by Bernard Goetz,
he has developed a network of supporters, an articulate public
presence and a command of politics and media that is unmatched in
New York. As was clear again Friday, as Sharpton assumed a
prominent role at Diallo's memorial service, that arsenal has
established him as arguably more influential than any black leader
in the city, including those who have been elected to public
office.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said in an interview that he had never imposed himself
into any of the half-dozen racially charged police cases with which
he has been identified since the Goetz shootings in 1984, including
this one. ``I would not have contacted them,'' Sharpton said. ``I
feel that is ambulance chasing. I am not an ambulance chaser: I am
the ambulance. People call me.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no need for Sharpton to chase anyone, indeed. Other
Guinean immigrants called Sharpton after Diallo was shot, just as
other Haitian immigrants called him after allegations that Abner
Louima was assaulted in a Brooklyn police precinct in 1997. There
are no other black leaders who are as well known, or have proven
themselves as resourceful, as Sharpton. That has never been as
clear as this week, when a family from another continent turned to
him for help in dealing with a tragedy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo shooting has illuminated Sharpton's strengths _ and
some of his weaknesses _ in racially charged situations. In the
nine days since Diallo died in the Bronx, in a barrage of 41 police
bullets, Sharpton was able to assemble large crowds, on short
notice, for rallies. He brought in a network of people, including
fund-raisers and lawyers, to help the Diallo family. And once
again, by design or not, he has become the face of the opposition
to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, serving as the Diallos' guide to this
alien terrain as they rejected offers of financial assistance from
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Sharpton, who for many New Yorkers will always
be remembered as the unquestioning advocate for Tawana Brawley, has
opened himself to the suggestion that he has turned an unknowing
family's plight to his political advantage. But there has been
little criticism of Sharpton on this count.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a genius for this,'' said Edward Koch, the former mayor
whose relations with Sharpton have thawed since Koch left Gracie
Mansion. ``He has the respect of the black community. He can
deliver a picket line of large numbers when he decides he wants to.
He's very quotable. And he's very smart.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that Sharpton had
captured the role of ``providing safe cover for people who have
been victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Rangel said, it was more complicated for
established black leaders _ the congressman offered himself and
David Dinkins as examples _ to fill the role. ``You know it and I
know it: We have not gained the credibility that Sharpton has in
case after case,'' Rangel said. ``Why should they go to a local
politician, especially one who is out of office?''
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly more than a little envy among officials who
have run successfully for office _ Sharpton has been a candidate,
but has never won _ over his success at establishing himself as
such a visible leader in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, while praising Sharpton, said that he had been helped by
what the congressman described as an absence of leadership by
religious figures in the city on the Diallo shooting; to some
extent, Rangel said, Sharpton had stepped into a void.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Sharpton has managed, with a few dissents, to
present himself as a leader of a group of New Yorkers that is more
politically, economically and ethnically diverse than ever: from
old-line black Democratic leaders in Harlem to the new groups of
immigrants that are now jockeying for a place on New York's
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone calls me, I don't have to gear up,'' Sharpton
said. ``They know when they call me that I have a staff that deals
with this every day. I can walk into a situation and in five
minutes say that we'll provide financial help.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has become something of a self-perpetuating political
force. Salimatou Diallo, a home-care attendant who is not related
to the shooting victim, urged Sharpton to intervene in the case
because she had seen him on television. ``I told him that somebody
was killed and we need him to come uptown to help,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day, Sharpton arranged a news conference to draw
attention to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also introduced the Diallo family to one of the
best-known lawyers in the country, Johnnie Cochran. ``Reverend
Sharpton,'' Cochran said Friday, ``is one of a kind.''

VERDICT AGAINST GUN MAKERS LIKELY TO PROMPT MORE LAWSUITS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa., Ill., Conn., Mass., La., Fla., Ga., Calif.,
Ind.)   (jw) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A landmark verdict in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, holding gun makers liable for shootings because of
negligent marketing practices, is likely to encourage many more
lawsuits using the same legal approach.
</P>
<P>
   While industry executives express confidence that the Brooklyn
verdict, issued Thursday, will be overturned, the plaintiffs'
success, in the first gun trial using the novel claim of negligent
marketing, poses a serious threat to the gun makers as more suits
are filed.
</P>
<P>
   The success against gun makers came much more swiftly than in
suits against the tobacco industry that pioneered the negligent
marketing approach. And the threat to the gun industry is
especially serious because gun makers do not have the enormous
resources of the tobacco companies, with total sales in 1997 of
only $1.4 billion compared with $48 billion in sales for cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of the seriousness of the stakes, the National
Rifle Association has used its influence to rush through a law in
Georgia barring cities from suing the gun industry. Similar bills
are pending in Louisiana, Alabama and Wyoming. The Brooklyn suit
was brought by victims of gunfire or their survivors; suits are
pending in other states where cities have sued gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's verdict, holding 15 of the 25 firearms makers named
in the suit negligent, caught people on both sides by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting to me, because it is the first verdict
against an industry that up till now has been invincible,'' said
David Kairys, a professor at Temple University Law School, who has
been involved in preparing some lawsuits brought by cities. ``I
think what it bodes is that there will be an increase in both
individual and governmental suits, and by my count I expect there
will be a dozen or so more within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' said Kristen Rand, a lawyer with the Violence
Policy Center in Washington, a research and advocacy group. ``The
fact that a jury has said that the gun industry is responsible when
a gun functions as it is designed to is just as huge as a jury
saying the cigarette industry has contributed to an individual's
lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Chicago and Bridgeport, Conn., have filed suit against
the gun industry, charging, much as the plaintiffs did in the
Brooklyn case, that the gun makers negligently distributed their
products, flooding dealers in areas with lax gun control laws,
knowing that their handguns were likely to end up in the hands of
criminals or juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Welsh, chief of policy and planning for Boston Mayor
Thomas Mennino, said Boston planned to file suit and would
incorporate the negligent marketing charge against the gun
manufacturers. ``It was a really encouraging verdict for us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other cities, including New Orleans, Miami and Atlanta,
recently filed lawsuits using a different approach, a product
liability claim, charging that the gun makers failed to include
sufficient safety devices in their handguns.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A lawyer familiar with the New Orleans case said Friday that the
city now might amend its suit to include the negligent marketing
argument. Mayor Marc Morial said the issue was under study.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other cities have announced they will also file suit
soon, including Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Gary,
Ind. The cities want to be reimbursed for the police and
medical-care costs that shootings impose on them.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, a trade association, said, ``What counts is
winning, and this was a win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn jury's verdict was ``confused and compromised,''
Feldman said, noting that it was reached only after a prolonged
deadlock, and Feldman predicted that the judge, Jack Weinstein, or
an appeals court would overturn it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Feldman insisted, the practices that troubled the
Brooklyn jury _ that some of the companies had no restrictions on
selling their handguns at unregulated gun shows or sold them to
dealers who did not maintain stores _ had been revised up in the
years since the case was filed in 1995. ``Whatever liability we had
as an industry was years ago,'' Feldman said.

BRUINS' MARTIN DEALS WITH MIGRAINE HEADACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kathy Olivier called Maylana Martin and didn't
like what she heard. The normally upbeat UCLA forward sounded down
and negative.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier knew something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``She couldn't find a positive about things,'' said Olivier, the
UCLA women's basketball coach, ``and it's very way out of
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivier knew the cause of Martin's pessimism: migraine headaches
caused by a tiny fluid leak in her spine. For four weeks, Martin
fought through the pain and tried to lead as normal a life as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The pain was too great _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Martin walked into practice and smiled at Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see her smile,'' Olivier said. ``I haven't seen
her smile in four weeks. She's so happy to be up and about. She's
back.''
</P>
<P>
   After four weeks of wishing she could escape the pain, Martin
realizes now she is on the way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not better, but I'm not going to get any worse,'' she said
this week. ``It's a relief they (doctors) know what's going on. I
hate not being able to play, and I hate not being able to go to the
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin received a cortisone injection for her aching back eight
weeks ago but the needle accidentally punctured her spine, causing
fluid to enter the bloodstream, which caused the migraines. She
missed the Dec. 30 game with Pepperdine and last weekend's series
with the Washington schools while doctors tried to determine the
cause and plug the leak.
</P>
<P>
   She rarely practiced and missed class for two weeks, making
on-campus appearances for games or road trips. She lost 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do play, I'm really weak,'' Martin said. ``I feel like
a freshman again.''
</P>
<P>
   While her strength slowly fades with her minutes, she
nonetheless entered Friday's Pacific-10 game against Stanford
leading the conference with a 17.8-point average and ranking second
in rebounding at 9.2 per game.
</P>
<P>
   This week is her first full week of practice in more than a
month, and it comes at an opportune time. The Bruins dropped five
places in The Associated Press poll to 12th after being routed at
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked on the phone. She's positive. She's upbeat,''
Olivier said. She can see the good side of everything again.''
</P>
<P>
   Braxton's D-lightful: Pepperdine enters this weekend 15-7, 7-3
in the West Coast Conference, just a game behind Santa Clara, which
faces the Waves today at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine has been in this situation before. Two weeks ago the
Waves won at St. Mary's to pull into a first-place tie, only to
drop back two nights later with a loss at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mark Trakh thinks this time will be different, in part
because Dee Braxton has come around.
</P>
<P>
   There never was any doubt the the 6-foot junior forward could
play. Braxton averaged 28 points in her final 10 games at Cal State
Fullerton last season and led the team in several defensive
categories. But she had not shown the same defensive prowess until
recently, so Trakh motivated her by calling her ``E'' because there
wasn't any `D' in Dee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always saying, `I want that D back,''' Trakh said. ``I
said, `I've got the D in my pocket. I'll give it back to you when
you learn to play D.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It took Braxton time to adjust to the Waves' man defense, but
now that she has (she's among the team leaders in blocked shots,
rebounds and steals), Trakh has given back her first initial.

RUSSIA'S CENTRAL BANK HIT BY DISPUTE OVER CASH RESERVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's central bank is engulfed in a political
firestorm over its decision to use an offshore company to manage
some of its cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much of the bank's reserves were kept
overseas or who may have earned fees and commissions from managing
the money.
</P>
<P>
   But the disclosure raises a new issue in Moscow's already
troubled relations with the International Monetary Fund, which has
funneled billions of dollars in aid to Russia through the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   It also underscores a lack of supervision over one of the
country's bedrock institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's former prosecutor charges that $50 billion was managed
by the offshore company over a five-year period. But former bank
officials say the amount never exceeded more than $1.4 billion at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   The explanations provided by the bank, however, raise more
questions than they answer. And the manner in which the accusations
surfaced, as well as what has since happened to the accuser, has
become a new source of political intrigue in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the current row the Central Bank was the target of
damaging allegations. Critics complained that bank officials had
paid themselves handsomely and then failed to effectively regulate
Russia commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   The charges first surfaced early this month when Yuri Skuratov,
then Russia's prosecutor general, sent a letter to the
Communist-led Parliament reporting that the central bank had used
Financial Management Company Ltd., an offshore company registered
in Britain's Channel Islands, to manage $50 million in reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are potentially explosive because they cover the
tenure of Viktor S. Gerashenko, the current as well as former
chairman of the central bank, and Sergei K. Dubinin, who left his
chairman's post shortly after the August financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts questioned Skuratov's $50 billion figure, noting
that it vastly exceeded the bank's currency reserves. Those
reserves peaked at $24 billion in 1997, and have since plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The affair assumed an air of mystery when Skuratov was ousted
soon after delivering his letter. Then it took an unusual twist on
Thursday when Dubinin, the former head of the central bank, and his
deputy, Sergei Aleksashenko, confirmed the arrangement in an open
letter that was published in a Moscow newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The two former bank officials insisted the charges were part of
a nefarious effort to undermine the independence of the central
bank. No more than $1.4 billion in bank reserves was ever kept at
the offshore company and that was in 1994, they noted. The
arrangement was discontinued in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that the central bank had founded the offshore
company in 1990, during Soviet days but only started keeping its
reserves there in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It was, Dubinin and Aleksashenko wrote, ``a necessary measure to
defend the economic safety of the nation.'' They argued that it was
necessary to hide money from creditors who might want to seize
Russia's reserves.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, however, how much was paid to manage the
reserves, who received the fees or what profit may have been made _
and by whom _ from investing the funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the explanation for using the offshore company has failed to
convince most experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unusual practice,'' said Charles Blitzer, a former
World Bank economist in Moscow and an investment banker.
``Typically, central banks manage their own reserves and in their
own name.''
</P>
<P>
   Margot Jacobs, an analyst at United Financial Group, a Russian
investment bank, cautioned that the use of an offshore company was
not proof of wrongdoing. She noted that the role of the offshore
company in handling reserves was noted in the annual report of one
of the foreign banks controlled by the Russian central bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything depends on knowing what the fee schedules were,
what the contracts were and whether any funds were diverted,'' she
said. ``You can't make final judgments until you learn the little
things we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boris G. Fyodorov, the former finance minister, offered a
darker view.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that he had become suspicious of how the
central bank was managing the reserves in 1993, but never received
an adequate account from Gerashenko or from then-Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran up against a wall of silence,'' Fyodorov recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, as I understand it, friends were given a chance to
make some money. When somebody gets a certain commission, it turns
out to be a very big one in the long run.''

PROSECUTOR WEIGHS CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not over.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Senate voted not to convict President Clinton in
the impeachment trial, the specter of independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr still haunts the White House. Starr is studying whether to
indict Clinton, either during the remainder of his presidency or
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Starr has active cases against Clinton friends
Webster Hubbell and Susan McDougal and a third case against a
witness who disputed allegations by Kathleen Willey that Clinton
made an unwelcome sexual overture to Willey, a former White House
volunteer. Starr also is finishing a report on a wide range of
Clinton's activities, leaving open the possibility that Starr might
include new information that could be damaging to the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr, whose investigation of a Whitewater land deal started
four years ago and turned into a $40 million probe of a variety of
Clinton activities, finds himself under scrutiny as well. A federal
judge has ordered an investigation into whether Starr illegally
leaked secret grand jury information to news reporters, and the
Justice Department is examining whether Starr improperly handled
the first interview with Monica S. Lewinsky or had unethical
contact with lawyers for Paula Jones in her sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A number of legal analysts said this week they believe Starr
plans to continue to pursue Clinton as long as possible, perhaps
all the way toward seeking an indictment. Alan Baron, special
counsel to the House on several judicial impeachment cases, said he
believes Starr plans to indict Clinton _ and the White House shares
that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the criticism that Clinton took for ``legal
hair-splitting,'' in his defense, Baron said: ``They took that
legalistic approach with an eye toward the belief that Starr is
perfectly capable of pursuing the president down the route of
criminal prosecution. My sense of Starr is that he is determined to
make Clinton pay for what he believes he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Other legal analysts disagreed, saying Starr understands the
public qualms about an indictment after the Senate acquitted
Clinton. But whatever course Starr takes, he appears to be far from
finished investigating Clinton and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton adviser James Carville, who has perhaps been Starr's
strongest critic, worries that Starr will go on ``forever.'' But
with a laugh, Carville wondered whether Starr will wind up in court
because of the charges against him, not against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles G. Bakaly did not return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the active cases being handled by Starr:
</P>
<P>
   --Former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell. The US
Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia last month reinstated
the tax-evasion case against Hubbell, but the court warned that
Starr could face difficulties prosecuting it. The court said Starr
must show that his case is not built upon information from 13,120
pages of financial records that Hubbell turned over to Starr under
a grant of immunity in a previous case.
</P>
<P>
   --Julie Hiatt Steele. Steele was recently indicted by a Virginia
grand jury for obstruction of justice. Starr alleges that Steele
lied to a federal grand jury when she cast doubt on an allegation
by Willey that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance toward her
in the White House, an allegation that Clinton has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Starr alleged that after Willey told Steele about the encounter
with Clinton, Steele then told two friends.
</P>
<P>
   Steele this week asked a judge to dismiss the case, asserting
that Starr filed the charges in Virginia to avoid a trial in the
District of Columbia, which is mostly Democratic and might be more
favorable to Steele.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, Starr also has been examining whether
Democratic fund-raiser Nathan Landow played any role in trying to
intimidate Willey or shape her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   --Susan McDougal. McDougal, who previously served 18 months in
prison in a civil case for refusing to testify about Clinton's role
in the Whitewater land deal, was indicted last May on similar
charges. Starr alleged that McDougal obstructed justice and
committed criminal contempt in refusing to testify before a grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant question is whether Starr could indict
Clinton. Many legal scholars believe that a sitting president
cannot be indicted. But Starr has reportedly obtained an opinion
from at least one adviser that he can indict Clinton while the
president is in office. Such a move, however, is not expected. If
Starr does indict Clinton, it is likely that it would either be in
a sealed indictment opened after Clinton leaves office, or it would
be done after Clinton's term ends.

SHAQ'S INJURY NOT SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Home again and humbled, the Los Angeles
Lakers were still smarting Friday from their lackluster loss in
Minneapolis, but they could take solace in a positive medical
report on Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Dr. Stephen Lombardo examined O'Neal and
confirmed the initial diagnosis of a slight strain of his right
groin. The injury is not as severe as the abdominal injury that
sidelined him for 22 games last season, and O'Neal was reported to
be feeling much better, one day after sitting out the Lakers' loss
to the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, O'Neal's status is day-to-day, but the Lakers are
hopeful he will be available Sunday, when they play host to the
Indiana Pacers. That will depend in part on how O'Neal feels after
practice today.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal suffered the injury in the second quarter of Wednesday's
win at Denver and played with pain throughout the second half
against the Nuggets.

   LOS ANGELES _ It's no dumb blonde joke. Hair stylist to the
stars Frederic Fekkai really has a new shampoo just for blondes who
want to get their highlights shining as bright as possible. It's
called Baby Blonde, has lots of chamomile _ which he calls nature's
own hair brightener _ and works on natural or chemically enhanced
hair. The shampoo is $18.50 at his Beverly Hills salon, as well as
Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus stores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you've got red hair, listen up. There's a new catalog
called Just for Redheads, filled with hair-care products and
cosmetics (including mascara in five shades of red). To get a copy,
call (800) 831-8240.
</P>
<P>
   For really red hair, brush on Red Corvette or Hot Chili from the
nifty new Fudge Paintbox Home Kit. Each kit contains three tubes of
color and a brush to apply to virgin or prebleached hair, priced at

   YAKKETY-YAK: Telephone chats have become a major pastime since
the invention of take-and-talk-anywhere cell phone. Not only are
folks having arguments with their spouses and reprimanding their
kids in the most public of places, but there's a lot of buzz over
which models are the most cell-chic.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the super-tiny model. It's so five minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Crayola-colored models (red is hot) to match your
ensemble, and the sleek black Samsung SCH-2000 Voice-Dialing Phone.
The latter is ultra-small, flips open and allows you to reach a
caller by saying their name into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Samsung's nifty voice-activated speed-dialing feature lets
you automatically dial up to 20 numbers by simply calling out a
name. For instance, you can ring up your boss by saying, ``the
jerk'' or some other endearment. It's also handy for names you need
but can't remember, like ``dog groomer'' or ``plumber,'' and allows
you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. The phone, at $149,
is available through Sprint. For more details, call (888) 987-4357.
</P>
<P>
   WIPE ON A TAN: Folks in Omaha or Duluth probably don't care
about maintaining their tan in February, but in la-la land it's as
important as having the latest designer sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's been a tad gloomy of late, so you may want to keep up
that sun-kissed look with a self-tanning product, like Clarins
Self-Tanning Milk, which requires you to get naked, exfoliate your
skin and stand around while the milk turns to tan. Or, if you're in
a hurry and just want your face to have glow, pull out a TanTowel,
a new product developed in Australia by the Darian Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tiny towelette dipped in clear self-tanning,
lemon-scented liquid that absorbs quickly and tans your face within
three hours. TanTowels, at $2 a packet, are available at Fred Segal
and other boutiques around town. For more information, call (888)
826-8695.

RELIGIOUS SERVICE FOR MAN SLAIN BY POLICE ENDS IN CHAOTIC PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Held aloft by strangers and clutched at by a chanting
crowd, the pine coffin holding the body of Amadou Diallo became the
centerpiece of both an emotion-fraught memorial service Friday and
a furious demonstration against racism and Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who was heckled when he made a brief appearance to pay
his respects.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22, a West African street vendor, was killed on Feb. 4
by four plainclothes police officers as he stood, unarmed, in the
entrance to his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   In life, his friends said, he was a quiet sweet-tempered young
man with big ambitions. But in death, Diallo has become a rallying
point for critics of the Giuliani administration, who turned the
religious service at the Islamic Cultural Center in Manhattan into
a sometimes unruly political rally.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, hundreds of men gathered at the foot
of the red-carpeted platform where the Muslim imam, or prayer
leader, had finished his sermon on what he said is Islam's message
of justice and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the entreaties of the imam, Mohamed M. Gemeaha, for
order and calm, the crowd cheered when one speaker called Diallo
``a martyr.'' There were shouts of ``We want justice,'' as many
people pushed and shoved to get out the door.
</P>
<P>
   The mood outside was as tumultuous. When Diallo's coffin was
carried out of the mosque, people in the crowd surged toward it,
calling ``Allahu akbar'' _ God is great _ and ``Justice, justice.''
Many threw themselves at the coffin, scrambling for a touch as it
listed from side to side on the outstretched palms of the men who
were trying to deliver it to a funeral-home car.
</P>
<P>
   As the pallbearers were swept through a narrow gate leading from
the mosque, police officers moved in to force bystanders back
against a wall and uniformed Fruit of Islam guards swatted and
screamed at those caught in the crush.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents, who at times appeared frightened by the
chaotic scene at the mosque, said they would bury him in his native
Guinea, in the village where his father was raised, next week. They
are expected to leave the United States with the body Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who had been rebuffed twice in his attempts to meet
the Diallo family in private to offer his condolences, slipped into
the mosque toward the end of the service with Police Commissioner
Howard Safir at his side. They stayed for about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting has been condemned by a broad array of officials
and prompted calls for an investigation into police training and
firearms policies. The four officers who killed Diallo fired 41
shots between them. Nineteen hit him.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what prompted the barrage of shots that killed
Diallo. The officers, who were patrolling the Soundview
neighborhood looking for a serial rapist, have not yet given
statements about the shooting and a state grand jury has not yet
been impaneled to investigate the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, said
Friday that agents of the FBI, as well as federal prosecutors, were
working with the Bronx district attorney's office on the
investigation. Previously, federal prosecutors had said only that
they were monitoring the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, who attended the service, said he would
ask Attorney General Janet Reno to personally monitor the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four officers' lawyers declined to comment Friday.
Alan Nelson, whose firm represents one of the officers, Sean
Carroll, released a statement on behalf of Carroll that said,
``Officer Carroll joins the family of Amadou Diallo in mourning his
tragic death.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that on the officer's behalf, ``we ask that the public
and the media not rush to judgment and await the determination of
all the facts surrounding these events. We are firmly convinced
that once all the facts are known that Officer Carroll will be
exonerated of any wrongful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family is being represented by several lawyers,
including Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Barry Scheck, whose clients
have included O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service for Diallo took place after the regular
noon prayers at the mosque, the city's largest. It drew more than
5,000 people who crammed into the large prayer hall, a cool oasis
with a vaulted ceiling and mint green walls, and hundreds more who
waited on the street outside.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who came did not know Diallo. ``But he was a
brother. He was from Africa,'' said Ahmed Gaye, an immigrant from
Senegal. ``This could have happened to me too. So I have to be here
to show support and strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was heckled and jeered by some people who noticed him
as he entered the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   But he apparently passed unnoticed by a line of men and women
dressed in black, their faces covered by black ski masks, who stood
outside the building chanting, ``Arm the masses'' and holding signs
that said Giuliani should ``burn in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   That group was led by Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the black minister
who organized a youth rally last summer in Harlem over the
objections of the Giuliani administration.

MELLON NOTED FOR ROLE IN CREATING CAPE COD NATIONAL SEASHORE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The story goes that Paul Mellon was dismayed to
discover that his Oyster Harbors home was lacking in what he
considered a sufficient number of sand dunes. So he brought in
2,000 tons of sand from the north shore of Cape Cod and built his
own dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went one giant step further: He helped to create the
Cape Cod National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon, who died Feb. 1 at age 91, has been remembered as a
billionnaire philanthropist, art collector, and the only son of
legendary financier Andrew W. Mellon. Less well-known are his
visionary contributions as an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, his legacy is 44,000 acres of pristine beach,
wind-blown dunes, and wild sandy bluffs that literally define a
much-loved corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon, along with other key leaders, ``foresaw that they had a
last chance to protect and preserve for the future one of the most
significant natural and cultural resources in the US,'' said Mike
Whatley, a supervisory park ranger with the Cape Cod National
Seashore in Eastham.
</P>
<P>
   ``They literally snatched it from the hands of developers,''
Whatley said, ``and at the same time left many charming, compatible
communities intact.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, beaches were seen as little more than places to
sunbathe or swim. Mellon made the country take them more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Although the national park service had begun in 1872 with the
creation of Yellowstone National Park, as recently as the 1950s it
was short on shoreline. National parks typically were inland chunks
of wilderness, and beaches were not considered important natural
and cultural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Only 240 miles of the 3,700-mile coastline between Canada and
Mexico had been set aside for preservation and public use, Whatley
said, citing 1950s data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, a consortium of foundations supported by Mellon
published ``The Vanishing Shoreline,'' a report highlighting the
significance of coastline territory and detailing the runaway
development that threatened to change it forever. It also
identified key sites that should be included in the national park
system.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of this list was a swath of land from Provincetown to
Chatham, then known mainly as ``The Great Beach of Cape Cod.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's difficult to imagine Cape Cod without it. The 40-mile
stretch of sand is dotted by sand dunes and banked by sandy bluffs
with bear berry, beach plum, and stunted pitch pines. Feathery
beach grasses and ground-hugging plants such as beach pea adorn the
dunes. Spectacular salt marshes nourish a panoply of flora and
fauna, and red and white cedars grow in some sheltered areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beach is surprisingly colorful,'' said Provincetown
resident Jay Critchley, who administers an artist-in-residence
program in the dune shacks. ``People expect it to be brown and
bland. But especially on overcast days, all the colors of sand and
beach grass and scrub oak and beach plum, they just glow.''
</P>
<P>
   The area's glacial history dates back at least 18,000 years. But
it also is home to many significant man-made sites. For thousands
of years, nomadic tribes roamed the area, leaving behind precious
archeological remains. Upland areas adjacent to the beach included
key pre-revolutionary sites, such as where the Pilgrims first
landed, and an array of historic homes and other structures,
including the dune shacks that provided shelter and inspiration for
well-known artists. All these were included in the protected zone,
along with the beach.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many locals didn't accept that the entire area
should be preserved. ``Many natives resented the idea because of
the money they were going to lose,'' recalled Marjorie Burling,
secretary to the seashore's first superintendent. ``People who
owned large blocks of land had counted on developing it, and they
saw that they would be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Others worried that the designation would bring a rush of
tourists, spoiling the habitat and overrunning their quiet
communities.
</P>
<P>
   So, prime seashore advocates _ Congressman Hastings Keith, US
Senators Leverett Saltonstall and John F. Kennedy, Francis Sargent,
and others, supported by Mellon _ came up with a novel solution.
</P>
<P>
   Previous national parks had been created by federal land
purchases or private donations. To these devices, the advocates'
``Cape Cod Formula'' added a zoning agreement among the six
affected localities to set aside the land and limit development.
</P>
<P>
   Many private landholders retained ownership of their land but
agreed not to develop it.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed the law
creating the Cape Cod National Seashore. In all, 44,000 acres were
set aside, including offshore lands. It was the nation's first
National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Birth of the Cape Cod National Seashore,''
Francis J. Burling cites an August 1961 editorial in The Berkshire
Eagle: ``This is the finest victory ever recorded for the cause of
conservation in New England.''

CITY DESTROYING MAPLE TREES TO COMBAT ASIAN BEETLE INFESTATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when tree lovers thought New York's streets
might be safe again, officials have confirmed a new sighting of the
Asian long-horned beetle _ a voracious black bug that already has
eaten its way across a swath of Brooklyn and southern Queens.
</P>
<P>
   City and federal officials announced that more of the
tree-killing beetles have surfaced, this time in northern Queens _
about seven miles northeast of the bug's original landing spot in
Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Officials discovered the bug in 1996, but
they suspect the beetle first arrived about 13 years ago as a
stowaway in wooden crates shipped from China.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that chopping down and burning infested trees is
the only way to contain the beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,500 infected trees already have been cut down in the
Greenpoint area and another 54 await a chain saw and wood chipper.
Officials found an additional 41 beetle-bored trees after just two
days of inspections in a 130-block area in Bayside and suspect that
hundreds more may be discovered. There are only two other known
infestations in the country, in Amityville on Long Island and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the beetle could have arrived in firewood taken
from an infected tree or in a wooden crate delivered to someone
from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The average Asian long-horned beetle is about two inches long
and has a shiny black coat covered with white spots. The male bug
is distinctive for a spindly black antenna, which is also dotted in
white and can grow as long as two inches.
</P>
<P>
   The bug devours trees from the inside out. During a lifespan of
only a few weeks, female beetles can lay more than 30 eggs, placing
each egg in a hole chewed into the bark of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The hatched larvae create the most serious damage as they grow
into two-inch long, cork-screw shaped caterpillars, which bore deep
into trees looking for heartwood that is safe from pesticides. The
larvae can live in a tree for one to two years, and when they
emerge as adults they burrow back out of the tree, creating a
perfectly round hole about a half-inch to nearly an inch in
diameter. A tree can have hundreds of beetles emerge from it.
</P>
<P>
   Adult beetles usually fly only about 45 feet to 50 feet from the
trees where they are hatched. But they will plant more eggs,
spreading destruction along the way. That is why officials say the
only way to fight the bug is to destroy infested trees in the
winter before adult beetles emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The beetles tend to prefer horse chestnut, poplar, willow, elm,
mulberry and black locust trees, but their yen for maple is what
poses the biggest threat to the city. More than a third of the
500,000 trees that line the streets of New York City are maples.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture will spend $5.5 million
nationally on antibeetle efforts this year and has earmarked an
additional $2 million for next year.

 &HT;    President faces another trial: history
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Slick Willie or the Comeback Kid?
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans long ago made up their minds about President
Clinton. They tuned out his impeachment and subsequent trial and
acquittal. Tired of the tedious process, many related to the
spectator who was arrested last week after shouting from the U.S.
Senate gallery: ``God almighty, take the vote and get it over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Friday's acquittal of Clinton will not ``get it over with.''
No less a commentator on current affairs than Doonesbury assures us
that this is the stuff of history. Although history's final verdict
is decades away, historians and presidential scholars already are
speculating on the effect of the impeachment on Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   With the trial concluded, some expect Clinton's popularity in
the polls to slip as many Americans no longer feel compelled to
choose between an embattled president and his prosecutors. Scholars
say Clinton is likely to continue slipping in history despite his
plans for the ultimate comeback.
</P>
<P>
   And while other presidents have rebounded in history after their
terms were marred by scandal or controversy, historians today
predict that Clinton will not rise much above average _ and might
sink to mediocre _ because his trial was as much about character as
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president who's had a series of scandals doesn't fare well
with historians,'' said Robert Murray, professor emeritus of
history at Penn State University. ``It's inevitable that the first
paragraph will begin, 'William Jefferson Clinton, the second
president in history to be impeached.' That sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray and Tim Blessing, who co-wrote ``Greatness in the White
House'' based on their surveys of historians about how they rank
presidents, said an administration's record of scandal has the
strongest impact on a president's standing. They contend the impact
is stronger than war or assassination:
</P>
<P>
   ``Scandal is the kiss of death for a president's long-term
reputation,'' they wrote in a recent column.
</P>
<P>
   They cite Warren G. Harding as a popular president of his time
``doomed to the presidential basement'' by multiple scandals in his
administration. They said Ulysses S. Grant, a war hero with a thin
list of accomplishments as the country's leader, also was dragged
to the bottom of the rankings by scandal. Even a popular,
charismatic leader such as John Kennedy is affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Kennedy generation slowly passes from the scene, the
sex scandals have begun to blot out the lights of Camelot, while
the emotions generated by his assassination cool,'' Murray and
Blessing wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Anne Warshaw, professor of political science at
Gettysburg College, said she does not believe Clinton's impeachment
will dominate his chapter in history because of the mixed views
about whether his actions constituted an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Clinton's legacy will be focused on the
impeachment as Nixon's is on his resignation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon resigned from office to avoid an impeachment trial
over the Watergate burglary and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   In a few instances, scandals do not pull down a president's
ranking in history. A great president can be larger than his
personal failings. Franklin Roosevelt's affair with his secretary
is just part of his complex story _ and it was disclosed long after
he died in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``FDR still ended the Depression and beat Hitler, no matter what
happened next,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a government professor at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, was not a candidate for greatness even before
Monica Lewinsky, according to many historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't win a war or pull us out of a recession. He managed
prosperity without screwing it up,'' said Steffen Schmidt,
professor of political science at Iowa State University. ``I think
Clinton is going to have a harder time rising above an average
president because of the impeachment. But I don't believe there was
much there to lift him anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Selecting Clinton's accomplishments is the greatest topic of
dispute among scholars interviewed. With the defeat of his
health-care proposal, Clinton does not have the benefit of
Roosevelt's New Deal or Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the kinds
of programs that affect generations. His bid to ``rescue'' Social
Security for future taxpayers and retirees may be his best, last
stab at that kind of posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, scholars suggest a range of accomplishments: ending
federal deficits, reducing welfare rolls, promoting free trade,
pushing technology, emphasizing economics as foreign policy and
moving the Democratic Party closer to the political center.
</P>
<P>
   Events beyond Clinton's control, however, can change how history
views him.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H.W. Brands, a history professor at Texas A&AMP;M
University, suggested that 1999 could mirror 1929, the eve of the
Great Depression. If the global economy crashes, Brands said,
``History will have a very much different view of the Clinton
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring such surprises, Clinton's legacy is likely to be
maintaining peace, managing prosperity and marshaling his political
skills to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been impressed with how effective Bill Clinton kept the
focus on himself and the function of the presidency, so that the
impeachment didn't take center stage alone,'' said Peri Arnold,
government professor at Notre Dame University. ``You can't squelch
the modern presidency. It's still the focus for most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political skills leave Cal Jillson, chairman of the
political science department at Southern Methodist University,
thinking about what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for real greatness was there,'' Jillson said.
``If you take the Monica thing out, he was the first two-term
Democrat since Eisenhower. FDR, LBJ and Bill Clinton _ he would
have been one of three great Democratic presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   No more, Jillson said.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents have rebounded in history after leaving office
under a cloud. When Harry Truman left office in 1953, he was blamed
for losing China to the communists and not being tougher on the
Soviet Union. Historians have rethought that assessment, and
Truman's stock has continued to rise. The U.S. Senate censured
Andrew Jackson when he killed the National Bank. Jackson's
political enemies were defeated in the next election, and the
Senate removed the censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew Jackson in his own time was a very divisive figure,''
Jillson said. ``Today he's on the $20 bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jillson and others said Clinton is different because his
impeachment was about character, not policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history books will say he was tragically flawed,'' Jillson
said. ``The nature of the character flaw: He lies, he dissembles,
he tells half-truths. Once you've lost your honor, you are
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if history concludes Clinton was wrongly impeached by a
radical opposition, he may only echo Andrew Johnson, the first
president impeached. A group of Republicans impeached and almost
convicted Johnson for what they considered his moderate approach in
dealing with the defeated Confederacy. History has vindicated him
on that point but has found no reason to raise his ranking.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton leaves office, he will be only 54. Can Clinton
emulate another ex-president from the South, Jimmy Carter, and
burnish his image by doing good works?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that could be a huge part of his legacy, an
ex-president who continues to be a statesman and represents the
nation in some area,'' said Warshaw of Gettysburg College.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, the UT government professor, disagrees. He points to
James Madison as one of the country's greater political thinkers as
a founding father but ranked only as an average president.
</P>
<P>
   When historians rank presidents, he said, they focus on what the
leaders did in office, not what they did before or after their
White House years.

DE LA HOYA-QUARTEY A TITLE BOUT THAT CARRIES BIG CLOUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya and his promoter, Bob Arum, have
said that Saturday's fight against Ike Quartey is the first
significant welterweight bout since the Sugar Ray Leonard-Tommy
Hearns fight in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Hearns had one defeat between them _ Leonard had
lost to Roberto Duran _ and each had a world title _ Leonard was
the World Boxing Council champion and Hearns was the World Boxing
Association champion.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (29-0) is undefeated and has the WBC welterweight
title; Quartey (34-0-1) was stripped of his WBA title last year for
missing a mandatory defense and has a draw against Jose Luis Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Leonard, who knocked out Hearns in the 14th round in
1981, that is where the comparison ends. Leonard and Hearns have
been hired to help promote the De La Hoya-Quartey bout at the
Thomas and Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   Their first bout was promoted by Arum, but Leonard does not
think Saturday night's showdown is the spiritual or stylistic
extension of his bout with Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not, because Oscar is a personality, but Ike Quartey
is not,'' Leonard said. ``We had our own identity. I had a strong
personality. Tommy had a strong personality. Duran had his own
personality. At least in the public mind, they knew who each of us
was. In a fight like this, Ike Quartey has to take advantage of his
underdog image.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons aside, this fight should stand on its own
in this era as the most significant match in boxing since Mike
Tyson-Evander Holyfield II on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the lower weight classes, it is the most important bout since
De La Hoya moved up to the welterweight division to fight Pernell
Whitaker on April 12, 1997. Next week, Whitaker and Felix Trinidad
will square off in an equally significant welterweight bout at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this bout significant is that both De La Hoya, 26,
and Quartey, 29, are in their prime. Both are considered to be at
the top of the most competitive division in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The winner cements himself as the fighter to beat in the
division. And the loser does not drop that far, because he has not
been tested by the other superb fighters in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Dino Duva of Main Events, Quartey's promoter, said he believed
the bout would open the floodgates for more attractive bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the promoters, the TV people and the fighters all
know they have to make the big fights now,'' Duva said. ``You can't
even get on TV now without fighting the best.''

DAVID DUKE IS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS AND RESPECTABILITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANDEVILLE, La. _ He finds the Talmud more offensive than ``Mein
Kampf,'' and views black Americans as an unalloyed scourge, but
David Duke says it's time to stop shrouding his political dreams in
the white sheet of his racist past.
</P>
<P>
   What he craves is respectability.
</P>
<P>
   And a seat in Congress. For the fifth time in 10 years, Duke,
apostle of Aryan pride and voice for the politically incorrect, is
a candidate for public office, seeking the congressional seat being
vacated by Bob Livingston, the fallen House speaker-elect.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts minimize his chances, Duke's presence in the
race has given Republican operatives the same queasiness they felt
earlier in the decade when he took advantage of Louisiana's unusual
``open primary'' to crowd favored GOP candidates out of two Senate
races and a wild governor's campaign in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a big threat. His numbers are not as strong
as the national media thinks,'' said Becky Miller, executive
director of the state Republican Party. But she confirmed that
there would ``probably be some effort'' by party leaders to rally
behind one candidate in order to block Duke, who is running as a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fear that Duke, renounced by national GOP leaders
because of his former role as grand dragon of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, could bring new embarrassment to the party with a strong
showing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, an incumbent Republican governor, Buddy Roemer, was
eliminated in the primary, the victim of a system where all voters
participate and send the top two candidates, regardless of party,
to a runoff. Duke recruited a powerful following that year among
disaffected whites. He wound up paired against Edwin W. Edwards, a
twice-indicted former governor who happily campaigned in the runoff
as ``the crook'' against the ``Klansman.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards prevailed, and the Republicans were left in the cold
until they benefited from the open primary four years later. Mary
Landrieu, the Democratic favorite to become governor, was edged out
of a place in the runoff by a black congressman, Cleo Field. A
little-known white Republican, Mike Foster, won in a racially
polarized runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Duke seems poised for a high finish in
the May 1 primary, inasmuch as the ballot is expected to include a
half-dozen well-connected politicians and an ophthalmologist named
Monica Monica who is said to be willing to invest $500,000 in her
own campaign. Even though there is no Democratic candidate on the
horizon, a big field could split the vote and give Duke an opening.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the deeply conservative confines of the 1st
Congressional District, which embraces the predominantly white
suburbs of New Orleans and three rural parishes, Duke is considered
too ideologically radioactive to win in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still an unpredictable factor,'' said John Maginnis,
author of ``Cross to Bear,'' an account of the 1991 race. ``Duke's
stock goes up and down depending on the mood of the people.'' And
the people, Maginnis said, are relatively affluent and content this
year, while Duke's appeal centers on the alienated voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's accurate to still consider David Duke an unrepentant
racist who is an extremist in the American political spectrum,''
said Jerry Himelstein, director of the New Orleans office of the
Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   Over a long meal at a Mandeville steakhouse, around the corner
from Duke's home (which doubles as his campaign headquarters), the
48-year-old candidate expressed resentment that his Klan background
was constantly used against him and depicted himself as the
original clarion of Republican values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first major candidate who wanted to get rid of
affirmative action,'' Duke said. ``I was for workfare instead of
welfare as early as 1975. I was the first to talk about eliminating
the IRS. I was the first to raise serious questions about
immigration. The Republican Party won control of Congress on my
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke wants respectability. The Klan unit he led 20 years ago was
nonviolent and had no connection to the terrorist groups in
neighboring Mississippi, he said. ``I was too young to have known''
any of the notorious Klan figures who emerged in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that ``former Ku Klux Klansman'' had been
incorporated as part of his name by journalists. Asked what
description he would prefer, Duke said: ``A white civil rights
activist.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's views on race, immigration, bilingual education, and Jews
continue to carry a cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at a National Alliance meeting in Parma, Ohio, in
1997, Duke said: ``Nearly a million white Americans are victims of
black violent crime every year. . . . One-third of the young blacks
are in jail or on probation or parole _ and those are only the ones
who got caught. Two hundred white women were raped by blacks for
every black woman raped by a white. . . . Seventy-four percent of
the Nigerians who immigrated here are involved in crime. . . .
We're becoming second-class citizens in our own country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League calls the National Alliance
``neo-Nazi . . . the single most dangerous organized hate group in
the United States  &UR; today &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Duke said he is being branded with ``the worst kind of political
McCarthyism.'' He has spoken before National Alliance groups a few
times, he admits. ``But I speak before black colleges, liberal
groups, Jewish organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   His new, self-published autobiography, ``My Awakening,''
complains that the heritage of white Americans is being lost to
blacks, and that a Jewish cabal permeates the US government and the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any open-minded reader who reads both `Mein Kampf' and the
Talmud would find the Talmud far more intolerable,'' he asserts at
one point. (James Gill, a columnist for The Times-Picayune in New
Orleans, wrote that Duke's book ``is called `My Awakening'
presumably because `Mein Kampf' is taken.'')
</P>
<P>
   When he takes office later this year, Duke said he would not
have to spend years building a reputation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody,'' he said, ``will already know my name.''

AIR PLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best ideas to come along in many a year is the ``Air
Traveler's Bill of Rights,'' which Senators John McCain and Ron
Wyden have introduced in Congress. The proposed legislation would,
among other things, require that airlines be more user-friendly in
matters such as refunding tickets within 48 hours of purchase and
telling passengers the truth about flight delays and cancellations.
Who has not experienced the concerted disinformation campaigns that
airline counters are so famous for when things go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not mandating fluffy pillows here,'' Wyden told The
Wall Street Journal. ``But we think airlines ought to comply with
the same rules as the corner grocery store or the local movie
theater.'' Wyden is an Oregon Democrat; McCain is an Arizona
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, as corner grocery stores have given way to supermarkets,
so have passenger comfort and amenities given way to cost-cutting
in the highly competitive airline business. Planes have been
getting smaller and smaller as airlines go from wide- bodied jets
to narrow airplanes on many runs. In addition, the airlines are
cramming in more and more seats to squeeze every last dollar out of
every flight, making tourist class a nightmare of constriction and
discomfort. Even Swissair, which used to pride itself on giving its
customers more seat room than other airlines in its spacious
Boeings and MD-11s, is beginning to introduce a smaller Airbus on
trans-Atlantic runs. To fly tourist class on these planes is to
risk blood clots from a seating arrangement that seems designed for
children under 6.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Transportation reports that passenger
complaints have risen 26 percent, and no wonder. This follows a
long period of relatively few complaints. In the early 90s
complaints against US and foreign airlines actually fell, but no
more.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about cancellations and delays have risen 35 percent.
Northwest is the industry leader when it comes to passengers
finding fault. The reports of passengers on the runway in Detroit
for up to 11 hours, unable to fly off or return to the gate during
a January storm, rivaled the stories of Middle East hostage
situations. A class-action suit has been filed against the airline
on behalf of the survivors. The plight of American Airlines
passengers this weekend, victimized by striking pilots who are
still calling in sick despite a court order to return to work,
seems beyond recourse to the law.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent flier programs are also getting more stingy. Mileage
requirements are rising, along with blackout days when frequent
fliers cannot use the miles they have earned. Last year there were
between 15 percent and 45 percent fewer frequent flier tickets
issued, depending on the airline, than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The trend in the airline business seems to be to provide fewer
amenities and inflict more discomfort on the weary customer.
Passengers of the world rise up! You have nothing to lose but your
pains.

   Hart had given the police an 11-page confession of his role in
the slaying of the teacher, Jonathan Levin, citing details that
detectives said only someone present at the killing would know. And
prosecutors had eyewitness testimony that put Hart at an automated
teller machine near the victim's apartment at the same time that
records showed Levin's bank card was used there.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stunning turn of events, a Manhattan jury acquitted
Hart of all charges in the case Thursday. The confession, which
seemed to be the strongest part of prosecution's case, turned out
be its downfall. So many questions were raised about how the
confession was obtained _ Hart was drunk and high on marijuana when
detectives questioned him over more than six hours _ that jurors
decided it was too unreliable and threw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ofshe, a social psychologist at the University of
California at Berkeley and an expert on police interrogation, said
that because Hart's confession was not recorded, it would never be
known whether it was genuine or coerced. He said a videotaped
confession would have allowed jurors to assess Hart's state of mind
more clearly. Confessions are sometimes videotaped in New York, but
detectives chose not to videotape Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Ofshe also said that while it was still quite rare, a growing
number of juries were believing defendants when they recanted
confessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last decade, there have been many examples of police
soliciting false confessions from the innocent,'' Ofshe said. ``Any
case where someone has been charged and convicted and is proven
innocent does get a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, a popular English teacher at William Howard Taft High
School in the Bronx and the son of the chairman of Time Warner,
Gerald Levin, was slain in May 1997. The discovery of the body
sparked a citywide manhunt and intense pressure on the police to
make an arrest. The teacher had been tortured, apparently as part
of an effort to get him to reveal the secret access code to his
bank card.
</P>
<P>
   Bound and gagged with electrical tape, Levin was stabbed in the
shoulder and side twice with a steak knife.
</P>
<P>
   His killers had also pulled Levin's head back by the hair and
drew the knife across his throat three times before shooting him in
the head, execution style.
</P>
<P>
   The other evidence in the prosecution's case _ other than the
confession _ that appeared to link Hart to the crime was shown to
be inconclusive, according to the jurors. They also said, after the
verdict, that police actions during the hunt for Levin's killers
undermined the case against Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Police _ who apparently first believed that it was Cory Arthur,
a former student of Levin's at Taft, who went to the bank machine
with the victim's card _ did not show the eyewitness a lineup with
Hart in it until eight months after the slaying. The eyewitness
picked out Hart, a dark-skinned black man, but the witness had
already told the police that the person he saw was a
``light-skinned black or Hispanic'' or possibly ``Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said they felt the identification was not strong enough
to base a conviction on.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, who faced first-degree murder charges and life in prison
without parole, was convicted in November of the lesser charge of
second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Arthur's refusal to say who was with him at the
murder, it will likely never be known whether jurors freed a killer
on Thursday or spared an innocent man from decades in jail.

 (Repeating to add Sunday advance line. No other changes.)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 14) 
(js) 
 By FRANK DECARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cupid has been going to the gym. A lot. In the latest ad for
Hallmark Cards, the chubby little cherub with the wings and the
bow-and-arrow set has grown into a blond hunk with no body fat and
a crown tattoo on his bulging biceps. Having shortened Valentine's
Day into the more masculine moniker of V-Day, Hallmark has recast
the infant god of love as a grown-up guardian of good loving.
``Fight Heartache!'' this muscled arrow-slinger says, all
testosterone, feathers and big-smile wholesomeness. It's enough to
make some people quiver.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Leo Burnett USA Chicago as part of a multimedia
campaign running nationally through Sunday's holiday, the ads use
World War II-era ideas of manliness to sell Valentine greetings.
Television spots are shot in black-and-white for a 1940s feel. But
it is the contemporary-looking stud muffin in the illustrated print
ad on the sides of buses and the back of last week's TV Guide that
caused the commotion. The ad was named Image of the Week by
Advertising Age in its Feb. 8 issue. And free postcards of the
buffed Cupid, given away in those take-a-dozen card racks in
upscale restaurants, are all but gone around the city. ``Everyone
is talking about it,'' said Michelle Buckley, the self-described
``Valentine's Day spokesperson'' for Hallmark. ``Men love it. Women
love it. Kids love it. It's so today and with-it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can argue with her when so many mythical characters are
being made over these days? Wander through a Warner Brothers Studio
Store, for instance, and take a look at the DC Comics merchandise.
Superman's abs are more super than ever. The Flash now has thighs
as big as tree trunks. And while Aquaman may have lost a forearm
since we were kids _ he wears a hook now _ he has gained more
muscle mass in recent years than Schwarzenegger in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   These super-duper heroes are a far cry from the crime-fighters
portrayed by George Reeves, television's Superman in the '50s, and
John Wesley Shipp, who played the Flash in 1990. This new Aquaman
looks more like Ariel's strong-finned father in ``The Little
Mermaid'' than Patrick Duffy's skinny 1977 ``Man From Atlantis.''
These superhumans really are.
</P>
<P>
   More startling, however, is the makeover a certain man in red
got last Christmas. An animated advertisement for a local
electronics chain portrayed St. Nick as a superhero with a body
more Stone Cold Steve Austin than North Pole Kris Kringle.
Concurrently, an advertisement for a health club chain suggested
Santa Claus needed to shape up if he was going to ship out all
those toys. The man has been portrayed as a cute fat guy in red
velvet and fur since the 19th century, but for the 21st century he
apparently needs to take steroids and look good in Lycra.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Bacchus will be hawking Slim-Fast.
</P>
<P>
   While undoubtedly provocative, these mythical makeovers elicit
mixed feelings _ titillation but with an underlying discomfort.
``We're living in a time when you can use male bodies as an overt
selling tool,'' said Donald F. Reuter, the author of ``Heartthrob:
A Hundred Years of Beautiful Men,'' a scrapbook of male archetypes
published last year by Universe Publishing. ``It's very current to
take an icon and mature it. A fat little baby-type roly-poly
cherub? Who is that going to attract? This is still the messenger
of love; he's just a little older and cuter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reuter also says there are limits. ``When I saw Santa Claus
with muscles, a waistline and a crotch, that was kind of freaky,''
he admitted. ``That's putting sex into a character who had no
sexuality at all, unless you are a chubby-chaser.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Truly, when even fictional characters need real muscles to be
appealing, some of us lose sleep rather than lose weight. The other
night while watching ``Fosse,'' the stylish celebration on Broadway
of Bob Fosse's choreography, I was struck not only by the sensual
gyrations of the dancers, but also by the rock-hard perfection of
their bodies _ the sculptured arms, the six-pack stomachs, the
pumped-up rumps of the men as well as the women. Sitting there
munching a box of Dots, I tried to remember the afternoon 21 years
ago when, at 16, I took the bus to see ``Dancin','' the
``dance-ical'' that is the stylistic ancestor of this current Fosse
musical.
</P>
<P>
   Those bodies, as beautiful as they were back then, didn't look
anything like the ones now on display at the Broadhurst Theater. We
have raised the bar of physical perfection so very high.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the original ``Star Trek'' episodes currently being run on
the Sci-Fi Channel for proof. William Shatner was considered so
sexy in 1966 that the pioneering space opera wasted no opportunity
to show Capt. James T. Kirk shirtless. Seen today on those shows,
he looks like the Poppin' Fresh Doughboy.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful body is a wonderful thing _ there's no denying that.
And the benefits of exercise are myriad. When I'm feeling
particularly fat, I just leave Manhattan. After a weekend in the
suburbs, where even the good-looking men look like Drew Carey, I
feel 20 pounds lighter. But a gym-rat Cupid and a super Santa?
Hasn't the cult of the body beautiful gotten a little out of hand?

artifacts of the 1960's are enjoying a revival 35 years after
passage of the Fair Housing Act. As a result, even as barriers to
home ownership come down, and the ranks of black homeowners expand,
segregation persists, according to a new study in Chicago. (Todd

LEONARD ARRINGTON, 81, MORMON HISTORIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Idaho, N.Y., Ariz., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard James Arrington, the dean of Mormon historians, died on
Thursday at his home in Salt Lake City. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   An economist by training, Arrington had a notable parallel
career as an economic historian of the American West, especially of
the Utah Territory. His works in that area included ``The Changing
Economic Structure of the Mountain West, 1850-1950'' (1963) and,
with Gary Hansen, ``The Richest Hole on Earth: A History of the
Bingham Copper Mine'' (1963). Both remain in print, as do a dozen
other of his titles.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the history division of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints and from 1972 to 1980 served as church
historian. He was the first professional historian to hold that
office.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure occurred during an interlude when the Mormon Church
allowed outside academics relatively free access to its archives.
But that period came to a close, and he was replaced with a more
conservative scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington wrote ``Brigham Young: American Moses'' (Knopf, 1985),
an authoritative biography of Young, molder of Mormonism and
successor to the faith's founder, Joseph Smith. The book covers a
long stretch of the Mormon experience, and, though it is not
uncritical, some reviewers observed that it skims over some
intriguing aspects of that experience.
</P>
<P>
   Of Young himself, Arrington observed that he embodied ``the
supreme American paradox, not because he contained elements foreign
to American soil but because he united them _ the business genius
of a Rockefeller with the spiritual sensitivities of an Emerson,
the lusty enjoyment of the pleasures of good living with the
tenderness of a Florence Nightingale.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington told the story of his own rich life in ``Adventures of
a Church Historian'' (University of Illinois Press, 1998). Straying
from his usual style of the aloof scholar, he consented to tell in
it of some spiritual experiences as a Mormon that had influenced
his personal life and his work.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Arrington was born in Twin Falls, Idaho, and graduated
Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Idaho in 1939. He also
graduated from the Latter-day Saints Institute of Religion before
serving in the Army in North Africa and Italy in World War II. He
earned a Ph.D. in economics at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the University of Utah from 1946 to 1972, rising to
professor of economic history. Then, until 1987, he was the Lemuel
Redd Professor of Western History at Brigham Young University in
Provo, Utah, and directed the Charles Redd Center for Western
History for some of those years.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, he wrote 21 books on American, Western and Mormon
history and published hundreds of articles in professional
journals. In the late 1950s he was a Fulbright professor at the
University of Genoa, Italy, and wrote ``Introduzione alla storia
economica degli Stati Uniti,'' published in Genoa in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington's first wife, Grace Fort Arrington, died in 1982 after
39 years of marriage. He is survived by his wife, Harriet Horne
Arrington; his sons, James of Orem, Utah, and Carl of Larchmont,
N.Y.; a daughter, Susan Madsen of Hyde Park, Utah; two
stepdaughters, Annette Rogers of Phoenix and Heidi Swinton of Salt
Lake City; and two stepsons, Frederick Sorensen and Stephen Moody
of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Also surviving are five brothers, Kenneth and Donald of Twin
Falls; Wayne of Sacramento, Calif., Ralph of Mesa, Ariz., and Ross
of Vacaville, Calif; two sisters, Marie Davidson of Burley, Idaho,
and Doris Shelley of Twin Falls; nine grandchildren, and 10
step-grandchildren.

FOR SORENSTAM, BEST IS NOT ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ She is arguably the best player in women's
golf, but Annika Sorenstam wants more.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish sensation has 16 victories in a little more than
four years on tour, but the 28-year-old perfectionist feels there
is room for improvement, as if two straight money titles and a tour
record for scoring average (69.99 strokes) indicate a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Her problem, she admitted, is setting such a high standard so
quickly. In 69 starts since turning pro in 1994, she has missed two
cuts and won almost $4 million. She played in 21 events in 1998 and
finished out of the top 10 only four times.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam has won three Player of the Year awards and three Vare
Trophies (for low scoring average) in the past four years and
seemingly can do no wrong on a golf course, but she is far from
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can improve'', she said after shooting a 5-under 67
Friday for the first-round lead in the Valley of the Stars
Championship at Oakmont Country Club. ``It's just figuring out how
I can get better. Is it technique? Is it feel? No one knows what it
is, and I'm always striving to find that out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel like I've have achieved much more than I ever
thought I could. It's been hard to set up new goals.''
</P>
<P>
   One goal she had no problem setting for 1999 is improving her
performance in the majors. She did finish second in the duMaurier
Classic last year, when Brandie Burton beat her by a stroke, and
she tied for seventh in the Nabisco Dinah Shore. But she tied for
30th in the LPGA Championship and tied for 41st in the U.S. Open.
She hasn't won a major since the '96 Open, something which
apparently has been gnawing at her for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I want is to do well in the majors,'' she said. ``A
good major year, so to speak. ``That's what matters to me the most
right now. It's going to be hard to break new records in scoring
average and also winning three awards (Player of the Year, Vare
Trophy and money list). It's very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm just going to go for the majors this year, and
hopefully I'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam considered taking two months off after the tour's
recent Florida swing before coming to Oakmont, which she considers
one of her favorite courses. She said it is getting more and more
difficult to maintain her high level of play, so she liked to take
a break when she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a lot of it is planning, not playing too many
tournaments, and taking a lot of time off for myself and family,''
she said. ``I really make sure that I do that. When I feel tired, I
take time off. When I want to play, I go out and play. I think it's
very important to listen to your body, and I've done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel motivated to achieve new things. I always try to
find a fun thing in what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those was a photo shoot for the Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue. Sorenstam, who is pictured with her husband, David
Esch, said she had a great time although she wasn't sure what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they turned out good, she said of the photographs.
``Both David and I were a little nervous. Being a golfer and maybe
not the fittest person out there, especially because we did the
shoot with Jennifer Montana (wife of former 49ers quarterback Joe
Montana). The picture doesn't reveal much ... I'm glad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you saw her stomach. I was about to get on a
plane and go home. She is as fit as you can find anybody. I was
glad we didn't do it together.''

-- Kathleen Goldsmith, left, a 33 year resident of Ashburn who
moved out three years ago and Reggie Campbell, a current seven-year
resident of the Chicago neighborhood, discuss their experiences of
living in the neighborhood. White flight, blockbusting, racial
steering by real estate agents -- community leaders say these
artifacts of the 1960's are enjoying a revival 35 years after
passage of the Fair Housing Act. As a result, even as barriers to
home ownership come down, and the ranks of black homeowners expand,
segregation persists, according to a new study in Chicago. (Todd

BRUISED BY IMPEACHMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   At last we have come to the end of what Representative Henry
Hyde called ``this melancholy procedure,'' the impeachment trial of
William Jefferson Clinton. All the president's men may call it a
vindication. It is not. The refusal of the Senate to follow the
House of Representatives' lead and remove Clinton from office does
not mean that he has been found innocent of all wrongdoing. It does
mean that the House managers did not prove that Clinton's alleged
crimes were of such a compelling nature that they necessitated
removing the president from office. Clinton may yet be tried for
his lies and his attempts to cover up his lies when he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's decision was never in doubt. There were never
enough votes for conviction. Now the nation can sew up the tattered
coat of purpose and get on with what is left of the second Clinton
administration. The president struck the right note Friday in his
call for ``reconciliation and renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been casualties, and some wounds will not quickly
heal. The impeachment was never popular, and the Republicans who
brought it about will have some fence-mending to do between now and
the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisanship has suffered. There were bipartisan moments,
including the final vote, when enough Republicans, many of them New
Englanders, crossed over to deny the House managers a simple
majority on either charge. But on the whole this was strictly a
party-line impeachment. The Democrats have been largely successful
in defining bipartisanship to mean that Republicans should have
voted more with Democrats, not the other way around. Yet the
Republicans did not cover themselves with glory when they refused
to allow a vote on censure instead of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the branches of government has been
damaged, too. The entire investigative process was deeply flawed
and should not be repeated lest the separation of powers be
breached. The role of independent counsels needs to be redefined so
the excesses of the Kenneth Starr era are not repeated.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that there will be much cooperation
between the White House and Congress in conducting the nation's
business for the remainder of Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy may also have been wounded. Foreign dictators
such as Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic have taken advantage
of the national distraction, and the United States has lost respect
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Civil political discourse has also suffered. Cultural fault
lines are now wider and deeper than before. The Republican right
often seemed like avenging zealots in their pursuit of the
president. But the president's supporters have not been without
fault. Vice President Al Gore went way over the top when he told an
assembly of world leaders in Davos, Switzerland, last month that he
thought the pursuit of the president was akin to the ethnic hatreds
of Bosnia. The ``proportionality'' that former senator Dale Bumpers
so eloquently called for was spectacularly missing on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal has seriously bruised every institution that has
come in contact with it,'' said Connecticut's Senator Christopher
Dodd, ``but none has been battered more than the executive branch
itself.'' At so many turns, telling the truth was the road not
taken by the president of the United States, and this will be the
hardest wound to heal.

AMERICA WEST WALKOUT IN MID-MARCH? ATTENDANTS REFUSE TO ARBITRATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT AND DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ America West flight attendants rejected arbitration
Friday, setting in motion a 30-day countdown to a strike that could
begin as early as March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McGlashen, president of the Association of Flight
Attendants Council 66, announced during a noon rally at Sky Harbor
International Airport that the strike threat will put pressure on
the Tempe-based carrier to present a fair deal to its 2,300 flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the eve of a major dispute . . . because of four
years of foot-dragging by the company,'' McGlashen said, drawing
cheers from dozens of flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   America West would not disclose its position on arbitration, but
said it was not surprised by the union's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects an attitude among its (the flight attendants'
union) leadership that favors confrontation versus negotiation and
responsibility,'' said Greg Garger, vice president of labor
relations for America West.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the airline also said the company is meeting
legal requirements by notifying workers there could be layoffs or a
shutdown of operations in response to a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants and the airline remain $16.5 million apart on
salary and related issues after negotiating for about 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   If the dispute cannot be settled during a cooling-off period, a
mid-March strike would disrupt Arizona's busy spring tourist
season, when Cactus League baseball is in full swing. An extended
strike could hamper travel during spring break and over the Easter
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   America West is the dominant carrier in Phoenix, with 214 daily
departures and 42 percent of Sky Harbor's passengers. Southwest
Airlines is second, serving 26 percent of travelers through Sky
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board has not officially started the
30-day cooling-off period or set the deadline for when a strike
could begin, but it likely will do so within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zack, communications director for the flight attendants'
union, said the mediation board might not start the 30-day
countdown until early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants opted to reject arbitration because it can
be a long, drawn-out process and the union feels it has waited long
enough for an acceptable contract, Zack said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the flight attendants voted for representation by the
union. A tentative contract was rejected in December 1997.
Mediation resumed in March 1998 and talks continued until the end
of January.
</P>
<P>
   The mediation board declared an impasse Monday and asked both
sides to consider arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   With a strike deadline looming in mid-March, the two sides could
still hold last-minute talks to resolve their differences. Both
sides say they would prefer not to strike.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight attendants have been talking about a strike as
far back as March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Airline consultant Mike Boyd said in similar situations the two
sides have agreed on terms of the contract, but the union has felt
obligated to strike for 36 hours just to make the point and to make
the members happy.
</P>
<P>
   This dispute centers on how much America West, the nation's
ninth-largest carrier, can afford to pay flight attendants and
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   America West says that if its labor costs were on par with the
six largest airlines, it would lose $250 million annually and it
would be broke within seven months.
</P>
<P>
   But with total revenue of $2 billion and $108.6 million in
profits last year, McGlashen said, America West can afford the
union's demands and remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   According to union figures, the top of the pay scale for America
West flight attendants is $22,896, compared with $41,184 at
Southwest Airlines. Base pay is $13,779 at America West and $17,145
at United Airlines, the union says.
</P>
<P>
   America West's figures show that on average, its flight
attendants are paid $22,856 annually based on 115 hours per month
of flying time.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants also are seeking per diem pay for time spent
away from their base of operations. The union is asking for the
same $1.80 per hour that pilots are paid.
</P>
<P>
   The $16.5 million figure that divides the union and America West
works out to $3.3 million per year over five years, which is the
length of the carrier's contracts with other work groups.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen said the bottom line is that if the union doesn't get
a fair agreement, it will strike.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA's strike plan includes targeting selected flights in
what it calls CHAOS, which stands for Create Havoc Around Our
System. Alaska Airlines flight attendants engaged in a similar
strike action in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A noon rally of flight attendants is planned today at their
headquarters on University Drive and the Hohokam Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   America West's pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots
Association, support the flight attendants' contract efforts, but a
union leader urged both sides to keep talking to avoid the
financial damage a strike would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage the participants to approach this (cooling-off)
phase with the paramount goal of reaching a fair agreement for the
flight attendants,'' said Donald Steinman, chairman of the master
executive council of ALPA's unit at America West.
</P>
<P>
   The strike countdown for America West comes in the midst of a
sickout by American Airlines pilots that has affected thousands of
flights and about 450,000 passengers in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen flights per day have been canceled this week
in Phoenix. Eight departures were scrubbed Friday. American has
eliminated four flights today, according to Phoenix station manager
Michael Jordan. That includes flights 1432, 1904, 2056 and 762.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes and other work stoppages are brutal on airlines' bottom
lines.
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street analyst cut his profit projections for American
Airlines by 42 percent Friday because of this week's sickout by
pilots over the acquisition of Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the damage is direct _ stranded passengers who have to
be rebooked on other carriers _ while the rest is from passengers
avoiding future bookings because of the strike, according to Samuel
Buttrick of PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The 42 percent drop is a best-case scenario for American, as it
assumes the massive cancellations don't drag on beyond this
weekend's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines start to feel the pinch even before a strike. Last
fall, business travelers began booking away from Northwest Airlines
during the cooling-off period before its pilots' strike.
</P>
<P>
   The strike itself, which lasted two weeks, was devastating for
the Minneapolis carrier. It cost the airline about $600 million and
caused a loss for the last two quarters of 1998. &QL;

AMERICA WEST AIRLINES BIDS TO QUELL SALE FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The focus on America West Airlines turned from a
possible sale to a possible strike this week, but the airline's top
executive still tried to quell community concerns about a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Franke, chairman and chief executive officer of America
West Holdings Corp., sent a two-page letter to about 200 business
and civic leaders on Monday to ``set the record straight'' about
the airline's talks with possible suitors.
</P>
<P>
   The letter came after Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza expressed
concern about an America West sale and its impact on the Valley.
America West has several thousand employees in the Valley, carries
42 percent of the passengers at Sky Harbor International Airport
and donates about $2.5 million a year to 400 Arizona charities.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rimsza delayed an airport parking garage expansion
for 30 days, saying he was convinced that America West is going to
be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Franke didn't rule out a sale in the letter, but said the
airline's game plan has been to remain independent and grow in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that America West has 28 new planes coming into
its fleet over the next three years and will add 100 flights per
day out of Sky Harbor. It currently has 214 daily departures.
</P>
<P>
   ``America West is prepared to remain and prosper as an
independent company,'' Franke wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter's use of such words as ``prepared to'' left Rimsza
still feeling anxious about America West's future as the hometown
airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just saying, `It's an option for us to remain a
prosperous, independent company,' '' Rimsza said. ``It doesn't give
me any comfort in thinking that it's not a real potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Franke's other main points also were troubling, Rimsza said.
They were:
</P>
<P>
   The expressions of interest were not solicited by America West.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing pressure for consolidation in the airline
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has a legal obligation to consider any proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Rimsza likened Franke's letter to a prelude to a ``Dear
John'' letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I interpreted it as kind of a `Look, this marriage is in
trouble but we've spent a lot of good times together, and with a
little luck and counseling maybe we can work it out. But if it
doesn't work out, we've had some good times, and other people have
survived this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``It certainly did not give me or any business person I
spoke with any comfort about America West's commitment to be
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders contacted by ``The Arizona Republic'' said they
didn't receive the letter, or if they did, they wouldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said he understands a sale would be a business decision,
but that it seems at odds with America West officials' recent
aggressive pitch to his office for an expansion of Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials would not comment on the letter Friday.
</P>
<P>
   America West has been mum about a potential sale since it
confirmed last month that it has been contacted by a number of
airlines about a possible sale or other alliance. United Airlines
is the only company to say it's one of the suitors but it, too,
hasn't said a word since. Trading in America West's stock has
settled down, with volume back to normal, and the price has fallen
a few points from its merger-frenzy high. It closed Friday at $20,
up one-eighth point.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and other observers don't think the flight
attendant strife, including a possible strike, will have an impact
on anyone's interest in buying America West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minor issue,'' said Mike Boyd, president of the Boyd
Group, an aviation consulting firm based in Colorado. ``You merge
those people (flight attendants) into your own employee group.''
</P>
<P>
   He said United would probably care the least, as he thinks the
Chicago carrier is more interested in America West's planes than
its flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   An executive with another airline said the flight attendant and
management battle is a moot point because it will be settled long
before any deal could be completed. &QL;

GAUGING IMPACT OF CLINTON-LEWINSKY SCANDAL ON SOCIETY, PSYCHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether people blame President Clinton for his 1960s ``free
love'' attitude and his cover-ups or Kenneth Starr for using big
government to invade a man's privacy, events of the last year have
coarsened American culture.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a career in elective office as a way to serve the
public has been further discredited, as many believe government
institutions have been turned into a Jerry Springer show.
</P>
<P>
   A new symbolic language has been adopted for people discussing
their personal relationships. The American presidency, if it was
ever too much Olympus and not enough fellow citizen, has been
brought to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major change is the president is no longer like a god,''
said Susan Schwartz, a Scottsdale-based Jungian analyst. ``When the
god falls and is just human, what is going to take the place of
that god? There is an opening now for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   People couldn't wait for the impeachment vote, because then this
whole scandal would all be over _ but we're still in the middle of
it, she said. The whole country has been in stress. Now we are
entering post-traumatic stress.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz is among the psychologists, lawyers, professors,
pollsters, religious leaders and experts on sex who believe
significant individual and cultural changes have been sparked in
the past year by the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. &QL; 
NEW SET OF LABELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the scandal has provided people with handy
labels for old behaviors. Schwartz predicts that people undergoing
counseling, during ``self-diagnosing, will now say, `I'm speaking
Clintonese.' That means I'm not telling the truth or skirting
around it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or `I'm like Clinton.' They may be having affairs or are
presenting a superficial face to the world. A lot of what they are
talking about has always been going on,'' said Schwartz, ``but now,
thanks to the scandal, they have quick labels for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage counselors have seen reverberations from the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a new awareness of how very far-reaching our personal
decisions and behaviors can be,'' said Allen D. Butler, who is with
Private Forum, a family mediation group in Tempe. ``Partners are
realizing that the standard, `what she doesn't know won't hurt
her,' just isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a general breakdown of trust. Both men and women
seem to be more suspicious and insecure within their marriage,
particularly where there are already difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   A positive aspect of this past year, Schwartz said, is that
people have been given an opportunity to re-evaluate such values as
loyalty, betrayal, honesty and trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has sharpened people's attitudes to their own weaknesses,''
she said. ``People don't want to be shallow, and they don't want to
mask who they truly are.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has provided an energetic shorthand for discussing
political and personal values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked about it at restaurants, at the water cooler at
work, over the phone with my family back East,'' said Petri Darby,
25, a communications director for an Arizona non-profit company.
``I've talked with my parents and grandparents. It's everywhere. It
has impacted us socially, politically, culturally and personally.
It permeated our discussions.'' &QL; 
FEELING OF BETRAYAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has disheartened Darby politically. He worked on
Clinton's campaigns, putting up signs, getting out the vote and
doing other volunteer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to tell people again that this system is
worth fighting for, worth getting involved with,'' he said. ``At
first, I thought it was ridiculous _ and my tax money was being
spent on this witch hunt. When President Clinton shook his finger
at the camera and told the American people that he didn't have sex
with that woman, I believed him. I felt like the president was
talking to me that night. But then I found out that he lied, and I
couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Darby thought it would be great to have a job on
the staff of the White House. Now he wonders about that. ``I think
the best politics is now local politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the scandal will affect the next presidential
election. But opinions differ regarding the nature of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an emerging consensus that private indiscretions are
not impediments to holding high-level, public, elective office,''
said Aubrey Immelman, a political psychologist at St. John's
University in Minnesota. ``This may favor likely 2000 presidential
candidates Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, both of whom
have admitted to youthful indiscretions, to borrow a phrase from
Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Have male politicians as a group been discredited by the
scandal? It may be easier now for Elizabeth Dole or other female
candidates to make a White House run, said Laura Liswood, a
cofounder of the White House Project, which polled 100,000
Americans to choose five prominent women who could serve as
president. &QL; 
OLD VALUES BEING REPLACED
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the scandal, many writers and commentators have
remarked that it mystifies Europeans and others around the world
who have a more sanguine view of human frailties and the habits of
men and women. The durable majority of Americans who thought that
too much was being made of the scandal may prove that America is
not the place it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are becoming more like foreigners in their attitudes
toward sex,'' said Moriba Jah, a senior at Prescott's Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University who, though an American citizen, has spent
most of his life in Caracas, Venezuela. ``The past year has
uncovered a truth about society _ that we may not be as
wholeheartedly family-oriented as we want to believe we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are becoming more tolerable of these events, much as
they are in other countries. In Haiti, Venezuela, Colombia, most of
the presidents have had scandals, but the conditions of life in
these countries are so harsh that people's interests are directed
toward putting food on the table. I'm not saying this country is
deteriorating, but this scandal was insignificant compared to what
people are worried about in their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona pollster Bruce Merrill believes that shifting population
demographics play a part. The old, largely Anglo, Judeo-Christian
majority may be holding the reins of power in Congress, but they no
longer reflect large portions of the populations.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill expects to see a backlash by voters against both
Republicans and Democrats. During the past year, there has been a
constant reinforcement of the idea that politics is a dirty
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt both parties,'' he said. &QL; 
DAMAGE IN THE COURTROOM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some in the legal profession say they are concerned that
Clinton's successful use of hairsplitting definitions of legal
terms may hurt jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the American public thinks the president lied under oath
and he is getting way with it, I suppose that the oath could be
taken less seriously than it is now,'' said Chris Skelly, presiding
judge for Maricopa County Superior Court's civil division. ``But it
could have the opposite reaction. People may be more careful when
they are under oath. The president was so roundly criticized about
his testimony that it may have raised people's perception and
awareness about the significance of an oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people take it pretty seriously already. The raising of
the right hand is a solemn proceeding. People don't walk away from
it and blatantly lie. They may shade, color, look through their own
lenses at an event, but I don't see out-and-out perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Skelly said the scandal could put jurors on notice to listen
more carefully to the exact words of testimony and to be more
attentive to nuance and the possibility of deceptive language. &QL; 
WHAT DID THE KIDS LEARN? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than one government or civics teacher has said that the
Clinton/Lewinsky saga has had its grand teaching moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are never going to forget the impeachment process,
the powers of Congress, because they have seen it in action,'' said
Jeff Shaw, who teaches at Mountain Sky Junior High in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked his students to do political cartoons on any
topic, about 75 percent of them chose the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
One of them showed Clinton in the middle of a tug of war between
Saddam Hussein and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Rockey, who teaches government at Sunnyslope High School,
couldn't help but notice how far out of sync that attitudes of the
hearings were with the attitudes of his students. For the past five
years, he has conducted a survey on ideological beliefs. The trend
among students, he said, is toward pragmatism and moderation and
away from strict ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher of government, he said, his goal is to create
citizens for a participatory democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder to convince these kids that running for
office is a valid option for their future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never consider being a politician or anyone in the
limelight, because your entire life would be watched and dissected
_ and the the bad accentuated,'' said Mark Miles, 16, a Sunnyslope
junior.
</P>
<P>
   A classmate, Shelley McKenzie, 17, said that politics remains
her passion and that someday she would like to run for office,
though more likely she would prefer politics on the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Did students learn anything about sex?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, &UR; no _ my brother was the teacher in that,'' Mark said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley chimed in that most of the sex mentioned in the scandal
was old news to kids by fourth grade or so. &QL; 
YOUNG ADULTS' OUTLOOK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to their parents' system, this past year was the
end of the rope for the younger adult generation, said Bill
Jamieson, a former aide to former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and
co-owner of a Phoenix political consulting firm. Three years ago,
he moved to Asheville, N.C., where he operates the Institute for
Servant Leadership, a non-profit ecumenical group that teaches
leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   Through their actions, young adults are saying that America
needs a new vision for itself, but they are not expecting that
vision to come from political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a country, we have lost our bearings,'' Jamieson said. ``We
don't have any idea of what we stand for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Udall and Barry Goldwater could disagree on issues, but
they shared a common vision for this country. That vision held our
country together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now a country without a vision, and that has made us a
very individualistic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lack of ties to personal or political values is
part of the unraveling, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bellwether is my daughter, who is 28 and works with
inner-city kids in Raleigh, N.C. She cares passionately. She
understands that public policy has a direct result on lives of poor
people. But she said, `What's the use? It doesn't matter who we
elect. The people in power don't care.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Jamieson said he is seeing something in her
generation _ people ages 25 to 40 _ that gives him hope. At least
for some, a sense of idealism and optimism seems to be coming
back. &QL; 
CHANGES IN THE WORKPLACE? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Workplace consultant Debra Davenport has talked with a lot of
men about how the president's behavior is affecting the workplace,
and she was surprised by their reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I expected to hear some `slap on the back,
atta-boy' comments, but it seems men are truly ashamed of
Clinton,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said she believes that men's attitudes regarding
male-female relationships in the workplace are becoming more
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men I spoke with had very clear and distinct boundaries
regarding their working relationships with women.''
</P>
<P>
   Women whom Davenport talked with echoed men's disapproval of the
president's behavior, but their responses were far less vitriolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the women felt that romantic relationships at
work were OK, and several said they had dated their boss in the
past or would in the future.'' &QL;  ECONOMIC EFFECTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has been a long-standing disconnection between the scandal
and the economy. Shifting attention from the international economic
crisis may even have calmed the markets.
</P>
<P>
   While the financial markets reacted negatively at various points
to the Clinton saga, they essentially shrugged it off. The U.S.
economy remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   The good economy saved Bill Clinton's political hide. A downturn
in the months ahead could parallel an expected deflation of
Clinton's post-trial popularity rating, two trends that might
appear to be more linked than they are. Certainly, the economy will
be discussed by historians as a major condition of the scandal and
of the Clinton presidency. &QL;  WHAT WILL BOOKS
SAY? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noted history professor Tony Edmonds of Ball State University in
Muncie, Ind., suspects that any two- or three-paragraph summary of
Clinton's presidency in history texts will include the name Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll go down side by side. The affair will be an anchor
around his neck,'' he said. &QL;

LIVING IN POST-Y2K WORLD: SCIENCE PROJECT SPURS ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Forget dioramas and paper mache dinosaurs. For his
science project, Jamie Werhanowicz is studying the hypothetical end
of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old, joined by his parents and older brother, have
set the calendar ahead to January 2000 and are spending two weeks
in a self-induced Y2K technology meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   They've turned off the furnace, the water heater and the
refrigerator in their north-central Phoenix home and have opted to
bathe in an outdoor, makeshift shower using water heated by the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   The boys have practiced piano by flashlight. Mom has baked
brownies and biscuits in a cast iron Dutch oven in the fireplace.
And Dad, sporting 10 days' worth of faux Y2K whiskers, has learned
to make tortillas by hand from dried masa.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the boys will do laundry using water from their
grandparents' swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   While Jamie's science project for Valley Cathedral Christian
School is the official reason for the doom and gloom dry run, the
exercise is clearly a full-family endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started playing with Y2K and what we would do to prepare,''
said Jodi Werhanowicz, Jamie's mom. ``Then we thought, instead of
saying `What if,' why don't we see what would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the time that society has had computers, programmers
have used two digits to represent years, for example 1998 would be
recorded as 98. This sets up a problem for New Year's Day, when
2000 begins and computers record 00. Computers that have not been
repaired, reprogrammed or replaced may become confused by the new
date.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty of exactly what will happen when the
date rolls over, people are responding in a variety of ways. Some
have decided to stockpile food, candles and other essentials. Those
setting aside food are convinced there will be chaos and widespread
computer failure. Others aren't sure what will happen, but want to
sock away supplies just in case.
</P>
<P>
   The Werhanowiczs fall in the second category. They have plans
for a church-related trip in January to India and fully expect to
go. But if problems prevent that trip, they'll have lots of canned
chili and snack foods to see them through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (problems) will happen,'' said Victor, who owns a
landscaping service. ``I have faith in the government that there
will still be electricity and water systems. But I will sleep
better knowing that I have stores of food and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing for the worst, and praying for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past two weeks, the family has found a few weak spots
in their Y2K plans.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the books and Internet sites that advocate stockpiling
food and other essentials include the suggestion that people fill
their bathtubs with water to be used for cleaning and other
non-drinking purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Werhanowiczs filled their tub the night before the
experiment began.
</P>
<P>
   By the second day, most of the water had leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It held water good enough for the boys' baths,'' Victor said.
``But we found out that it wasn't good enough for a longer time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starting over with a new plug and a new tubful of
water, they are measuring the amount of tap water they are using so
they can estimate how much to set aside at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of the emergency plan that went down in flames was
the shower. The original plan called for using a household sprayer,
the kind with a pump and a tank that holds a couple gallons of
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sprayed so little water that it evaporated and you froze
before you could rinse off,'' Victor said.
</P>
<P>
   So early on in the adventure, the family headed to a camping
supply store to pick up a solar-heated shower.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Jamie is enjoying his science project, though he said
he'd stockpile a little more snack food next time.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hasn't gotten any reaction from his friends at
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell anyone,'' he said. ``Just my teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Older brother Casey, 12, was a little more forthcoming with his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I'm weird,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The low-water-use, no-electricity lifestyle takes more effort
than anyone imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The family had planned to do laundry at the swimming pool last
weekend, but they were so busy with other things they had to
reschedule it.
</P>
<P>
   As the family nears the end of their two-week experiment, they
say they've enjoyed it more than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's eagerness to return to creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised them I'd take everybody out to dinner,'' Victor
said. &QL;

SORENSTAM LEADS VALLEY OF THE STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Bitter, cold temperatures gave way to
sunshine and blue skies in Friday's first round of the Valley of
the Stars Championship at Oakmont Country Club. They also gave way
to another of Annika Sorenstam's assaults on par.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old missed just one fairway and fired a 5-under-par
67 to lead Stephanie Lowe and Catrin Nilsmark by one stroke.
Another two shots back were Dottie Pepper, who bogeyed two of her
last three holes, Jane Geddes and Luciana Bemvenuti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I felt like I played really good,'' said Sorenstam, who
has been bothered by a cold. ``Most of my drives were in the
fairway, and when you do that, you don't really feel how narrow the
fairways really are. I was never in between clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shoot like that, you can shoot low scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam made one mistake, when she bogeyed the par-5, 482-yard
first hole, her 10th hole of the day. She left the approach shot
seven feet above the hole and wound up three-putting.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, she was close most of the time and had a number
of good opportunities for birdies, although she did need a
four-footer to save par on her final hole.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to playing well at Oakmont, she said, is putting the
ball in the right position, especially on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the key here,'' she said. ``It takes a lot of planning
and selecting the right club into the green. I like to plan my
shots.... I like to think around the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsmark, who finished third in this tournament two years ago,
didn't have to think much thanks to a driver that suddenly started
to find the fairway with more regularity. She did not have a single
bogey and had what she felt were two bad lies all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it a lot easier when you're not in the woods all the
time,'' the 31-year-old from Goteborg, Sweden, said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   It also was easy for Lowe, who was in the third group of the day
and was greeted by temperatures that dropped into the low thirties
and forced a 15-minute delay because of frost.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, however, said the conditions didn't pose many problems,
although she did wear several layers of clothing for most of the
front nine. She hails from Chester, England, in the northwest part
of the country on the border with Wales, and is used to
less-than-ideal weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty miserable there,'' she said. ``You never plan
anything. It's like before you get a tee time, you say, `Well,
shall we? Shall we?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually kicking ice off my soft spikes for a while
today. It was like, `Hit it in the fairway because there's frost in
the rough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe bogeyed her first hole when she two-putted from eight feet
but played solidly the rest of the way. The 35-year-old also said
she likes Oakmont's 6,276-yard test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy this golf course,'' she said. ``It's definitely a
position golf course You want to be aggressive, but you can't
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing that sentiment was defending champion Dale Eggeling, who
was at 2-under 70, a considerable improvement from her
opening-round 74 of a year ago. She played in the afternoon when it
was much warmer, and said Oakmont can yield low numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get it going, it's a good possibility that you could
shoot a really low round,'' she said. ``This is more of a U.S.
Open-type golf course. You have to be patient, and you have to plan
your shots out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you get a little greedy, it's going to grab you and
bite you in the you-know-what.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at 2-under 70 were La Canada's Helen Alfredsson and Leta
Lindley, who made a serious bid for the championship in this
tournament two years ago. At 1-under 71 was a large group that
included Meg Mallon and Liselotte Neumann, followed by the likes of
Hollis Stacy, Michelle McGann and former U.S. Open winner Alison
Nicholas at even-par 72.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, were not as fortunate. Alicia Dibos of Lima,
Peru went 44-40-84. Danielle Ammaccapane had a 43-39-82. Sherri
Steinhauer, who sank the winning putt for the U.S. in last year's
Solheim Cup, had an 80.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one players shot par or better.

VENTURA WARNING: POLITICIANS BETTER WRESTLE WITH ISSUES WE CARE
ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By P.J. ERICKSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Republicans and Democrats and their minions and
managers seem puzzled and confused about what happened last autumn
in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   How in the name of P.T. Barnum did a professional wrestler get
elected governor? A fluke? A blip? The first volley in a voter
revolution? Or simply one more sign that the Apocalypse is upon us,
that phony entertainment and phony politics have become
indistinguishable?
</P>
<P>
   Woe is us, cried the Donkeys and the Elephants; we don't know
what this means.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple, you political wizards: Jesse Ventura got elected
'cuz he ain't one of you.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of you. We're sick of your spin doctors, your
campaign managers, your PR specialists, your trial balloons, your
mindless babbling, and the media advisers who dress you in your TV
shirts and power ties.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of your photo opportunities, your sound bites, your
campaign financing schemes, your junkets and your pork barrels,
your chest-pounding righteousness, and your weaselly, squirming
rationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of your pollsters telling you how we're going to vote
before we've decided. And when your pollsters do tell you something
that we apparently consider ``important'' _ for instance, that a
vast majority wants better gun-control laws, and that we wish you'd
pay much, much, much more attention to issues such as violence, the
environment and education _ you ignore, dismiss, evaluate, review
and appoint committees, until the lobbyists tell you what to do.
</P>
<P>
   We're sick of watching you assign independent counsels to
investigate each other and everyone else in sight. At last count,
some half-dozen of these unaccountable hangmen were running around
investigating stuff on the taxpayers' dime. It's damn near an
industry onto itself. Harvard Law should offer Independent Counsel
101. There was even that lunatic proposal a month ago to have an
independent counsel appointed to investigate the actions of another
independent counsel. Absolute farce. Too bad Peter Sellers is dead.
</P>
<P>
   You anointed Ken Starr to investigate a land deal called
Whitewater. We know you really didn't care about some pipsqueak
real estate scam in Arkansas. If you did, you'd have 50 Ken Starrs,
one for every state, investigating land deals. But in Arkansas _
``right there in his home state'' _ was a chance to implicate a
sitting president in a little bitty land scam, so WHAMMO!
Independent counsel appointed!
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Starr and a cast of thousands investigated Whitewater,
some $40 million worth. Nailed some loan officers and turned a
good-sized forest into a Whitewater Report that hardly mentioned
Whitewater. But no Whitewater charges were filed against the
president, the first lady, the first daughter, Socks the cat or
Buddy the dog.
</P>
<P>
   So the ever-vigilant independent counsel went after the
president's personal life. What, exactly, did Paula Jones and
Monica Lewinsky have to do with Whitewater?
</P>
<P>
   Starr began by investigating a land scam and wound up digging in
a sexual garbage dump. The Republicans waded in with shovels of
their own, then couldn't figure out why they came out covered with
muck. The Democrats ended up having to defend a president awash in
sexual stupidity and perfidy.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins here? And, please, please, don't tell me the winners
are ``The American People.''
</P>
<P>
   We know Bill Clinton lied. We know you lied, too. You said you
would pursue the truth on a bipartisan basis. Sure. We are
``unbelievably'' weary of your constant bleating about
bipartisanship _ from both sides of the aisle _ when you make it
clear by your every yea and nay that blatant partisanship is all
you really intend to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   What you just don't seem to get is this: We don't care about
your partisan agenda. We don't care if one liar calls another liar
a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Your childish insistence on accusing each other, investigating
each other, forcing independent counsels on each other, demeaning
each other, vilifying each other, threatening each other _ and
ignoring us _ makes us want to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   And we're also sick of hearing you tell us what ``The American
People'' want, need, deserve, respect, believe, and/or are entitled
to. If you Beltway bourgeois had a collective clue as to what the
American people want, need and deserve, you wouldn't be confused
and bewildered about the adventures of Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   We need answers to crime, homelessness, domestic abuse, violence
in our streets, drugs in our schools, pollutants in our air,
poisons in our drinking water, inequality and bias and bigotry in
our communities, a decaying infrastructure, AIDS, farm failures,
job flight to foreign shores . . . the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   So enough with the fratricidal back-stabbing and shooting
yourselves in the foot. Our forebears provided us with as good a
system for governing as ever existed. You've turned it into a dirty
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Stop the circus. Start the statesmanship. DO something! &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Reggie Campbell and Kathleen Goldsmith are part &UR;  &LR; of an
American success story, the unprecedented boom of home-buying by
African-Americans in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Only he is black and she is white. When he moved into the
neighborhood, she moved out.
</P>
<P>
   A hoisting engineer for the city, Campbell and his wife used
their two incomes to buy their first home. They chose Ashburn, a
working-class neighborhood of brick bungalows on Chicago's Far
Southwest Side. ``We just wanted a quiet area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goldsmith and her husband, a Chicago policeman, lived in
Ashburn for 33 years, rearing six children. When blacks began
buying in the neighborhood, she said she felt less safe. ``People
just didn't seem as friendly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She moved three miles further out, to a white neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the boom in black home-buying is a success story with
unintended consequences. Instead of increasing integration in
neighborhoods, the boom appears to be hastening segregation here.
</P>
<P>
   The new black homeowners have been funneled into only a few
neighborhoods, according to a study released this week. The
research, which was based on loan records in Chicago, was done by
the Woodstock Institute, a nonprofit group that studies community
development. The records show that most city and suburban
neighborhoods still have hardly any black buyers.
</P>
<P>
   White flight, block-busting, racial steering by real estate
agents _ community leaders say these bogymen of the 1960s are back.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is achieving its stated goal of helping
more minorities go from being renters to being owners. Across the
United States, blacks in this decade have bought their first homes
faster than any other racial group.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by low-interest loans, and with their way cleared by
fair-lending laws, blacks increased their home-buying by 60 percent
from 1993 to 1997, compared with a 16 percent increase by whites.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal of stable, integrated neighborhoods remains
elusive, 31 years after passage of the Fair Housing Act.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, integrated neighborhoods do not stay integrated for
long. In Chicago and its suburbs at the beginning of the 1990s,
only 110 of 1,169 neighborhoods could be described as integrated,
or 10 percent to 50 percent black. . By the middle of the decade,
only 27 of those 110 remained integrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that increasing homeownership, by itself, increases
segregation,'' said Daniel Immergluck, the author of the Woodstock
study. ``But the concentration of this new burst of home buyers
into a small number of communities does. The emphasis on
homeownership has not been accompanied by an equal effort to end
racial steering.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was limited to Chicago from 1990 to 1996, but the
researchers expect that similar patterns exist, particularly in
other heavily segregated cities, like Detroit, Cleveland, New York,
St. Louis and Philadelphia. Few American cities have stable
integrated communities, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders in Ashburn say they want integration. Minority
areas tend to attract fewer shops and movie theaters. Housing
segregation leads to school segregation, which has increased in the
1990s in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   And home values in minority areas tend to rise more slowly, if
only because whites do not bid on houses for sale. In suburbs, many
of the new black communities have weaker tax bases, requiring
higher property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The new black homeowners also find themselves further from work.
In Chicago, blacks have moved south and west, while jobs are moving
northwest, nearer to O'Hare International Airport. This means
longer commuting for workers, and fewer jobs near home for their
teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   On a National Geographic map of Chicago in the 1980s, Ashburn
was colored green, for Irish-Catholic. Its cookie-cutter brick
houses were built after World War II, and it was home to
firefighters and other city workers. In its own way, it was
ethnically diverse, with Germans and Swedes and Irish living side
by side.
</P>
<P>
   That generation is now in its 70s. Those who wanted condominiums
were already beginning to move away. In the early 1980s, the first
blacks moved in, but few whites moved out. Then came the boom of
the 1990s, when many blacks moved to Ashburn, attracted by houses
costing $80,000 to $150,000, quite affordable for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the young black families moved in, ``For Sale'' signs
sprouted. Real estate agents whispered warnings to older whites
that the neighborhood was changing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ashburn is about 60 percent black, and tipping fast. In
1990-91, only 2 percent of home buyers there were black. By
1995-96, 60 percent of newcomers were black.
</P>
<P>
   ``In five years it'll be all black,'' said Steve Pappas, serving
the conventional wisdom and Saturday breakfast to blacks and whites
at his L &AMP; M Starlight Restaurant &UR;  &LR; at 83rd Street and Kedzie
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The way for the home-buying boom was cleared in 1989, when
federal agencies toughened enforcement of laws against racial
discrimination in housing sales, financing and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen action also increased. Under the Community Reinvestment
Act, lenders have promised $400 billion in loans to middle-income
families in 100 cities. Lenders opened branches in cities, hired
minority loan officers and created loan products to extend home
ownership to families without savings. A 3 percent down payment
became common.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with historically low interest rates and rising wages,
these changes significantly expanded the ranks of black homeowners.
But the Woodstock Institute says that more stable integration will
require more fair-housing enforcement by the federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development, and local efforts to welcome
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and whites both say they prefer integrated neighborhoods.
The races do not agree, however, on what is integrated. As blacks
become 20 percent or 30 percent of the residents, whites no longer
call a neighborhood integrated. To many whites, such a neighborhood
is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any outright hostility,'' said Campbell, 38,
the city worker who moved into Ashburn in 1992. ``But one of my
neighbors, he never spoke to me for an entire year. Finally one day
it snowed and I used my snow blower to clean off his sidewalk. He
came over to introduce himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goldsmith said she saw the neighborhood changing. People
did not walk so often to the park, or sit on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black teen-agers would walk by in groups,'' said Mrs.
Goldsmith, who moved out in 1996 but still comes back for Sunday
breakfast and Mass. Twice she added, ``There's good and bad in
every race.''
</P>
<P>
   . Many of the new two-income black families in Ashburn have
higher incomes than the older white residents.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders in Ashburn and neighboring Wrightwood hope to
build housing for the elderly to encourage older whites to stay.
They are also trying to lure a plastics plant with 400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And they sued four real estate companies, accusing them of
frightening whites out of the area to increase business. So far two
companies have settled, denying any wrongdoing but paying $58,000
apiece to the community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more whites are moving out. ``You know, it's not any
safer where I am now, in Oak Lawn,'' Mrs. Goldsmith said. ``We
can't keep running all the time.''

   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay _ World War II and the Spanish Civil War
devastated much of Europe, but this breezy corner of Uruguay's
unspoiled coastline prospered from a flock of well-heeled exiles
who came here to escape the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s and '80s brought death squads and hyperinflation to
the Southern Cone, but when Argentina's rich whisked their capital
out of Buenos Aires they brought it to Punta del Este and sunk it
into the mansions and condominiums that made this sprawling resort
South America's answer to Miami Beach, the Hamptons and the French
Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Samba Effect'' _ as the recent 35 percent fall in the
value of the Brazilian currency, the real, is called here _ appears
to be a different sort of crisis, one that even Punta can't resist.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Brazilian tour groups began canceling hotel
reservations in droves, and condominiums have been forced to cut
their weekly rents by up to 20 percent compared with last February.
Wealthy Brazilians who began to come here in the last five years
with their overvalued reals are canceling their party bashes and
projecting a much lower profile.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign that Brazil's woes are beginning to affect Argentina's
economy and hurt that country's free-spending upper middle class,
the Argentine tourists here are cutting their stays and spending
less money. A growing number of Argentines who used to come to
Punta this year switched vacation plans at the last minute to go to
Brazilian beach resorts like Florianopolis where their strong pesos
now go much farther.
</P>
<P>
   Punta remains a rarified place where American dollars and
Argentine and Uruguayan pesos are exchanged interchangeably in
large denominations. The likes of Julio Iglesias, Omar Sharif and
Pamela Anderson still order bottles of 1990 Dom Perignon at $350 a
pop.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbies drive pastel yellow Mercedes-Benzes, and charge $25 for
a 15-minute ride to the airport. Million-dollar weekend homes
shaded by pine trees and graced by immaculately landscaped tropical
gardens are common in neighborhoods like Beverly Hills, Sausalito
and Parque de Golf.
</P>
<P>
   But Punta's business elite is crying the blues over the fallout
from the Brazilian crisis, made worse by some unusually inclement
weather this beach season. Many express concerns that the slump may
accelerate trends in the hotel and real estate markets that are
bound to change this resort radically over the next 10 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers who used to order French wines are now ordering
much cheaper Uruguayan wine and they are even sharing dishes or not
ordering appetizers,'' said Elizabeth Maserati, the owner of the
Italian restaurant Portofino, which has closed its upstairs terrace
overlooking a dock full of yachts for lack of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here expected the Brazilian real to collapse,'' said
Oscar Rubio Fajardo, who directs the Uruguayan government's tourism
office here. ``It's a bomb that exploded, and nobody knows where
the shrapnel will land.''
</P>
<P>
   Such overwrought language reflects the fact that Uruguay is more
dependent on tourism than any other country in South America, and
Punta del Este is the crown jewel of Uruguayan resorts. Last year
tourism directly generated nearly $800 million in business for this
country of 3.2 million people, and the industry represents about 35
percent of the economy when services and tourism-related
construction are included.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Brazilians who visited Uruguay over the first five
weeks of this year decreased to 25,038 from 28,251 over the same
period in 1998, according to government statistics, and the rate of
decrease has widened every week since the real began to fall on
Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   With beef, rice and dairy exports to Brazil also expected to
decline this year, economists predict that Uruguay's economy could
contract as much as 2 percent in 1999 after several years of steady
growth. Unemployment, which ended last year at 10 percent, could
rise as high as 15 percent, independent economists say.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is not a major problem here yet, but a growing number of
homeowners are installing bars on their windows just in case _ one
of many telltale signs that Punta is changing.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of a modern international airport linking Punta with
Argentina and Brazil three years ago along with the inauguration of
the 300-room Conrad Resort and Casino in 1997 have ushered in a new
era. The real estate boom fueled by Argentine capital flight has
been losing strength for years, and this year it is definitely
over.
</P>
<P>
   The days when Punta del Este could depend on Argentines, who
still represent 70 percent of the visitors here, to rent apartments
and mansions for four to eight weeks summer after summer are coming
to an end. Big hotels will probably mark Punta's future, local
businessmen say, and Hyatt and Sheraton are actively looking to
make investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifestyles are changing,'' said Luis Sader, a leading real
estate broker here. ``People now go to Punta del Este one year,
Miami the next. Our business is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Argentines still love to come to Punta _ in fact visits by
Argentine tourists are up a bit this year _ but they are more
likely to come for stays of a week or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Conrad, which is partly owned by Hilton, reported a 65
percent occupancy rate so far this February, which is below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to rethink the way we do business,'' said Alejandro
Pariente, the Conrad's director of sales and marketing. That means
bringing in conventions and high-rolling gamblers from March to
December, Punta's long off-season, attracting them with sporting
events and high-priced entertainment acts like the Brazilian singer
Simone and samba groups like Banda Eva.
</P>
<P>
   The Conrad is taking advantage of the decline in the real to
increase its advertising in Brazil, since ad space is now at least
a third cheaper in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders are beginning to think about attracting
American tourists _ a rarity here _ with packages including Buenos
Aires as a second destination. The idea is called Mercotur, a
takeoff on Mercosur, the regional trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Punta del Este we're channel surfers,'' said Martin
Castillo, the owner of Galeria Sur, Punta's most prestigious art
gallery. ``The changes can be abrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too abrupt, Castillo hopes. He and other dealers here are
selling fewer works, but Castillo saved his season a few weeks ago
when he arranged the sale of two large paintings by Fernando
Botero, the Colombian artist, to a Brazilian industrialist for
several hundred thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no problem with payment,'' he said, ``but I'm
keeping my fingers crossed.''

VISA VOTES TO CONTINUE AD EFFORT BASED ON ITS BRAND
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of directors of Visa USA voted Friday to keep the Visa
brand name at the center of the credit card group's marketing
campaigns after the banking giant Citigroup left Visa in protest
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which has said it intends to promote increased
awareness of the Citi brand name, contended that Visa's ubiquitous
advertising campaigns undermined that mission. Two Citigroup
executives resigned from Visa's 12-member board last week, reducing
to 11 the number of banks whose executives sit on the board.
Citigroup plans to shift all new business to Mastercard
International.
</P>
<P>
   The Citigroup executives' departure from the board raised
concerns that other major credit card issuers like Bank One Corp.
and BankAmerica Corp. might also leave Visa, which is owned and
financed by member banks.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, it appears that other banks are not planning to
follow Citigroup's lead, meaning that Visa will still command
center stage in marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board believes it is important to maintain the existing
business model,'' Michael Beindorff, Visa's executive vice
president, said after a board meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is whether the Visa logo will be moved to the
back of credit cards to emphasize the brands of member banks. That
topic was discussed at the board meeting Friday, but no final
decision was made. Beindorff said the matter was still being
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If flexibility is desired by our member banks, we'll do
everything we can to give it to them,'' Beindorff said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the placement of the Visa logo has been a matter of
contention for months, particularly with Citigroup, and the fact
that it remains unresolved indicates to some analysts that Visa
feels little pressure to rush that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like this board meeting was when they would have
pulled the trigger on that decision,'' said David Robertson,
president of the Nilson Report, an Oxnard, Calif., newsletter that
tracks the credit card industry. ``The fact that they didn't
indicates that Visa and its member banks have made their peace with
Citigroup leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup declined to comment. Mastercard's board held a
regularly scheduled meeting on Thursday, but the credit card
concern declined to comment on the meeting. Citigroup paid Visa
about $75 million in fees in 1998, or roughly 6.5 percent of the
$1.2 billion in revenue Visa received last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citigroup is definitely a loss for Visa,'' Robertson said.
``But they were also a headache because they demanded so much and
now Mastercard is inheriting that headache.''  &QL;

UNDER FIRE, NEW YORK GOVERNOR ADDS TO SCHOOLS BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Under fire for his proposed education budget,
Gov. George Pataki called Friday for spending an additional $115
million to create a new program to help elementary school children
improve their reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   The program brings the total that Pataki wants to spend on
primary and secondary education to $12.02 billion for the coming
school year, a $269 million increase from the current school year.
Of that increase, $76 million would go to New York City schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the budget he presented last month, Pataki proposed
increasing aid to schools by $154 million to $11.91 billion. But he
came under intense criticism from elected leaders and educators
across the state, including New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and New York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   The reading program was among several changes that Pataki made
to his original budget proposal. Under state law, the governor has
30 days to amend his budget proposal before the Legislature takes
it up for consideration. Pataki submitted the changes to lawmakers
Friday, 14 days before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other changes the governor made were proposals to
provide $53 million for railroad and bus lines in the New York City
region, $2 million in tax credits to encourage the construction of
low-income housing for the elderly and $100,000 to build a memorial
at Smith Point in Suffolk County for passengers who died aboard TWA
Flight 800 in July 1996. He also increased funding for the attorney
general's office, after originally calling for a slight cut.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes, Pataki's proposed total budget of $72.7
billion continues to keep a tight rein on year-to-year spending
increases by limiting the growth of certain programs. Despite the
projected budget surplus of $2 billion, Pataki's proposed budget
provides a modest 1.8 percent increase for the fiscal year that
begins April 1, largely by making substantial cuts to health care
and education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The budget faces opposition from lawmakers in both parties, who
are eager to tap the state's large tax revenue and its surplus to
restore the cuts Pataki is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, issued a statement
Friday afternoon calling Pataki's budget changes inadequate. In the
statement Silver said: ``It is unfortunate that the governor has
failed to use this opportunity to address the needs of children,
senior citizens, college students and working families of New York
State.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Pataki said his budget managed to be
fiscally responsible while meeting the needs of the state. ``This
executive budget along with the 30-day amendment package we are
submitting today will continue to allow us to manage New York's
prosperity with fiscal prudence and open the door to even greater
progress,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pataki's announcement of the reading program was clearly
intended to blunt some of the criticism he has faced as a result of
the relatively small increase he had originally sought in his
education budget. The program is to help first-, second-, third-
and fourth-graders prepare for new rigorous reading exams that
state education officials now require.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's changes did little to mollify his critics. He continued
to be taken to task for eliminating a package of education programs
for very young children, including prekindergarten and expanded
kindergarten offerings, for freezing aid to public colleges and for
sharply reducing tuition aid to poor college students.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Allinger, a lobbyist for the New York City Board of
Education, said that although board officials were pleased with the
new reading initiative, they were still concerned about the money
city schools would lose as a result of other cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome any initiative that will help children achieve
grade-level literacy in the early years,'' Allinger said. ``We hope
this can serve as an opportunity to discuss the full range of our
other needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides defended his record on education. They said that
in the last two years, Pataki and the Legislature had increased
spending on schools, and that the total, when adjusted for
inflation and the number of students, matched highs reached in the
late 1980s.

THIS NEW YEAR IN CHINATOWN, MOCK FIREWORKS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took more than two years, but Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and civic and business leaders in Chinatown have finally
reached a compromise over the use of fireworks in the Chinese New
Year celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they settled on ``mock firecrackers,'' to be
relegated to the middle field of Columbus Park, a patch of land as
big as a football field on Mulberry Street, between Worth and
Bayard streets. The celebration of the Year of the Rabbit will take
place on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the mayor, citing safety considerations,
prohibited fireworks in Chinatown's lunar New Year celebration and
most other parades and street fairs throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Sheldon Silver, speaker of the New York Assembly,
helped bring Chinese-American leaders, the mayor and public safety
officials together, and a deal was struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the mayor to reconsider,'' Silver said at a news
conference in Chinatown on Friday. ``Prior to a budget meeting, I
brought it up. Both sides came together and gave a little and took
a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of traditional fireworks, revelers this year will see
and hear what Assistant Fire Chief Harold Meyers called ``safe
fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Dobo, president of A Pyrotechnic Universe, the company
that is to provide the artificial firecrackers, described them as
flame-resistant, electronically fired red-confetti balls that would
create a sea of red and be accompanied by separate sound bursts
simulating the noise of real firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   But the new site of the celebration, which had traditionally
been held on the streets of Chinatown, is expected to evoke some
bad feelings, as are the fake firecrackers. For decades, thousands
of firecrackers were lighted in Chinatown during dances meant to
expel evil spirits from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be mixed feeling that the celebration is
not on the streets,'' said Jan Lee, chairman of the Committee for
Celebrating the Lunar New Year. ``But I think that some
pyrotechnics is better than nothing. Still, some people will think
that it's too much of a compromise.''
