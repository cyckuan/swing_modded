<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Women Continue to Pursue Political Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of Kuwaiti women,
including some leading women activists, on Tuesday resumed efforts
to seek political rights in the politically male-dominated Gulf
emirate.
</P>
<P>
The women, along with some journalists, took four buses Tuesday
morning heading from the headquarters of the Women's Social and
Cultural Society to several Kuwaiti parliamentary constituencies,
which opened for registration for men aged 21.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's registration was called for by the Interior Ministry
to register new voters or change addresses of the previously-
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
Official Kuwait News Agency said that the first attempt by the
women in Khalidiya district, about five kilometers south of Kuwait
City, was disappointing, as the district's chairman refused to
register for women.
</P>
<P>
But the women residing in another district had their names
registered separately with men only after the district head got a
permission from the Capital Governor.
</P>
<P>
Several women filed a complaint at a local police station later
against the chairman of the Parliamentary Electoral Registration
Committee, who applied the state's law denying women rights of
voting and nomination in the 50-member all-male parliament.
</P>
<P>
While appreciating the new efforts, political activist Loulwa
Al-Qutaimi said although several political demands adopted by
Kuwaiti women had failed during the past three decades, "hopes
would never be severed."
</P>
<P>
Last November, Kuwaiti Parliament rejected an Emiri decree to
grant women rights of voting and being voted in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The decree, which was widely applauded by Kuwaiti women and
welcomed by foreign countries, was vetoed on grounds that it did
not come under the "necessary conditions" listed in the
Constitution, which stipulates decrees be issued by the Emir in
case of urgency.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti constitution grants equal rights and obligations for
women and men. But the election law deprives women of the rights to
vote and run for parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti women, who at present account for a little more than 50
percent of the country's 740,000 citizens, first raised their
demand for political rights 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Several proposals calling for amending the election law were
submitted to the previous parliaments, but none of them succeeded
on the house floor.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Visit Jordan After Talks With Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
will pay an official visit to Jordan on Sunday after holding talks
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, sources at Barak's office
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak will meet on Thursday with Arafat at the Erez checking
point to discuss the latest developments in the final-status
negotiations, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Barak will leave for Amman, capital of Jordan,
to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein in an effort to
push forward the peace process, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Barak paid a brief visit to Jordan last July after he won a
landslide victory in the May 17 elections which brought down his
hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country which struck a peace deal with
the Jewish state in 1994, along with other Arab countries have
pinned hopes on Barak to recommit Israel to peace in the region and
to resume its peace talks with all Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel will send a delegation to Jordan next week for
talks on cooperation in the energy sector, Amman-based diplomatic
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Concerns Austrian Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massiomo D'
Alema said Tuesday that Italy shared the concern of the other 14
European Union (EU) member states over the prospect of the Austria
's hard-right Freedom Party of Joerg Haider entering into a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Italian Radio, D'Alema said that "Europe had the
duty to intervene. The Union is a community linked by economic,
political and financial ties. Europe has criteria and values".
</P>
<P>
Austria, D'Alema continued, "has adopted agreements which are
not just economic in nature. Europe is united and also has values.
If one goes against these values then their relationship with the
European Union will enter a crisis."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema went on to express his hope that the Freedom party will
not enter the Austrian government because this nation would risk "
being placed in a kind of quarantine, under observation."
</P>
<P>
Fourteen out of fifteen EU member states agreed Monday to
ostracize Austria, the EU's fifteen member, in the event Joerg
Haider and his far-right Freedom Party join in a national
coalition government with the conservative People's Party.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Second Largest Food Distributor Files for Bankruptcy Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- AmeriServe Food Distribution
Inc., the United States' second-largest food service distributor,
has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
The company distributes meat, produce, beverages and other
supplies to more than 30 fast-food and casual-dining chains with
about 36,000 restaurants, including Burger King, Pizza Hut, Taco
Bell, T.G.I. Friday's and Red Lobster.
</P>
<P>
"The company intends to carry on its operations and continue to
honor its commitments to customers," Matthew Kleiman, a Chicago
attorney representing the company in the bankruptcy filing made
Monday, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The company's petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington, Delaware, did not list asset and debt figures, but a
quarterly report in November listed assets of less than 2 billion
U.S. dollars and liabilities of more than 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
AmeriServe grew rapidly through acquisitions during the 1990s
and benefited from the dining-out trend among Americans. But by
late last year, AmeriServe was in trouble as the company's net
sales had slipped below year-ago levels.
</P>
<P>
Its chief competitors include Alliant Foodservice, U.S.
Foodservice and SYSCO, which grabbed AmeriServe's best customer,
the Wendy's hamburger chain, in 1998.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi Tuesday said the government is preparing to
relaunch art and crafts schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists at the end of a ceremony marking the
beginning of the 2000 academic year, Mocumbi said the government
has undertaken an evaluation of all vocational schools built
during the colonial period, which were shut down around the time
of independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
It would not be enough simply to re-open these schools, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said also necessary would be coordination with the
productive sector, mainly companies, so that school leavers could
be guaranteed places for apprenticeships and subsequent
employment.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the initiative is aimed chiefly at
inverting the current situation whereby most secondary and high
school leavers, who do not make it into university or other higher
education institutions, are not absorbed into the labour market
and remain jobless.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions Urged to Solve Crisis without Foreign Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati on Tuesday urged Afghan parities and groups to
solve the country's crisis on their own efforts and without foreign
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seventh meeting of the Assembly of Afghan Shiite
and Sunni Scholars, Velayati called on the Afghan factions to opt
for and agree on a single leader from among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been plagued by a bloody civil war since the
Islamic factions toppled the former pro-Soviet government in 1992.
The government headed by President Burhanuddin Rabbani was ousted
in 1996 by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia, who have won
control over 90 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
Clashes are continuing between the Taliban and the Northern
Alliance headed by Rabbani, who enjoyed Iran's support during the
past years.
</P>
<P>
Velayati, currently advisor to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on international affairs, said what has happened in
the war-torn Afghanistan over the past few years taught the Afghans
that they should distrust foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying that Iran does not in the least wish to interfere in the
domestic affairs of Afghanistan and such intervention would not be
justifiable.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan people should solve their problems by themselves and
independent of outside interference, he stressed. But he did not
say by what means this can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
A number of Iranian and Afghan religious scholars attended the
meeting, which opened here Tuesday and would last for three days.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Mount Raids on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Tuesday mounted
air raids with air-ground rockets on the western sector of its
self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday morning, Israeli forces pounded with heavy
artillery fire on some residential districts in the towns of
Hadatha and Eta al Jabal in south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The shelling caused material damage to some houses but no
casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The air raids came a day after three Israeli soldiers were blown
up in an attack by the Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, on Monday, bringing total Israel death toll to four
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Hezbollah, believed to be backed by Syria and Iran,
killed Akel Hashem, the second-highest ranking official of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA), in a roadside bomb attack
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The recent escalation of Hezbollah attacks inside the occupation
area dealt a heavy blow to the SLA and the Israel Defense Force
(IDF). Israel set up the so-called security zone along the border
in south Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the April Understanding Committee
monitoring the cease-fire in south Lebanon is to meet Wednesday in
the border town of Naqoura to discuss complaints lodged by the
Lebanese government against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee, grouping Lebanon, Syria, Israel, France and the
United States, was established under the truce accord reached in
April, 1996 to end a 16-day Israeli blitz of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli army radio said Tuesday that Israel intends
to resort to self-restraint in south Lebanon and shun attacking
Lebanon's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust the 1,
500 Israeli occupation troops and the 2,500 SLA militiamen from
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Barak Sees No Link Between Violence in Lebanon and Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- One day after three Israeli
soldiers were killed in south Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Tuesday sought to lower the heat with Syria by saying that
the tension in Lebanon should not be linked to the peace talks with
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a visit to the northern Israeli
border, Barak said Israel was determined to respond to the
escalating attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, but
the violence there should not hinder the Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that we should at this juncture relate it any
direct way to the negotiations with Syria," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as tensions mounted in the Israeli self-styled
security zone after Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
killings of three Israeli soldiers Monday and of Akel Hashem,
second-in-command of the pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon Army
(SLA) Sunday inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
Barak's comments showed a softening of tones compared with his
remarks Monday soon after the killing of the Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In a warning message to Damascus, the main power broker in
Lebanon, Barak said on Monday that peace negotiations with Syria
would not resume if it did not take actions to curb the activities
of Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Israel cannot hold peace negotiations when
the Syrians are not preventing Hezbollah from attacking the IDF
(Israeli Defense Force) in the security zone," Barak said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Washington appealed Monday to Israel to restrain despite the
latest casualties, saying the best way to resolve the problem is to
reach peace agreements with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of restraint, the Israeli cabinet, which convened an
emergency meeting Monday, rejected the proposals by the army to
stage severe and immediate retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Barak reiterated his promise Tuesday to pull Israeli troops out
of southern Lebanon by July this year, with or without agreements
with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian negotiations, resumed in December after a 45-
month break, were stalled in the last few weeks over disputes on
the agenda of the talks. Lebanon has not restarted the talks with
Israel yet.

The Cyprus official expressed hope that there will be no
restrictions between Greece and Cyprus in the field of air
transport by the end of the year 2001.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Speaker Calls for Withdrawal from Lebanon as Promised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Speaker Avraham Burg called on Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
implement his campaign pledge to withdraw Israeli soldiers from
south Lebanon by the end of July, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk in the Knesset, Burg told reporters that it is
undoubtedly an unhealthy situation that Israel maintains military
presence in the territories of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Burg stated, Barak's election promise to withdraw Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) from the Israeli-declared security zone in
south Lebanon by July, 2000 should be fulfilled as scheduled
despite recent mounting tension in the area.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the killing of three Israeli
soldiers Monday in the security zone should not affect the peace
talks with Syria and Lebanon, which could eventually avoid
additional casualties and ensure peace and security along the
border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Indyk, who recently returned to Israel to serve his second term
as U.S. ambassador, also said that the latest painful casualties
highlighted the need to end Israeli-Arab conflicts once and for all
through negotiations, which will "ensure that this kind of thing
does not happen again."
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers were blown up Monday and four others
wounded in a missile attack by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, which
was the bloodiest attack on Israeli forces since last August.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Hezbollah also killed Colonel Akel Hashem, the
second-highest ranking figure in the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
In a response to these escalating attacks, Barak issued a stern
statement saying that "whoever dares to harm IDF soldiers or
soldiers of the SLA or the northern settlements will pay a heavy
price."
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister still made his position clear,
stating he intends to keep to his self-imposed July 2000 deadline
for an IDF troop withdrawal from the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the buffer zone in 1985 with a self-declared
purpose of protecting its northern border areas from cross-border
guerrilla attacks. Since then, Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant
group, has been fighting against the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Resumption of Multilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry
welcomed the resumption of the Multilateral Negotiations of the
Middle East Peace Process (MNMEPP) in Moscow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is of the position that the multilateral talks
constitute an integral part of the Madrid process and fulfil an
important role in the peace negotiations," the ministry said in a
release.
</P>
<P>
"The renewal of the track will enable the entire region to
prepare the institutional infrastructure required for an era of
regional cooperation," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee of the MNMEPP, in its one-day special
session in Moscow, agreed to officially renew the multilateral
track.
</P>
<P>
The session also set out the dates for the convening of plenary
meetings of the five working groups on water, economic development,
refugees, environment and regional security from April to June this
year.
</P>
<P>
The framework of the multilateral talks between Israel and the
Arab states was established at the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference.
The talks were intended to be a forum for discussing the economic,
social, environmental, and security issues necessary for long-term
regional development.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of this track took place in Moscow in January
1992. since then, the participants, organized into five working
groups, have met formally for seven rounds of talks. There have
been no formal talks since May 1996, although some working groups
have met informally during this period.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland First Minister
David Trimble said on Tuesday that there was no sign of
decommissioning by the paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland and
the suspension of the province's landmark Good Friday accord was
now inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"My expectation is that we will be moving fairly soon to the
suspension of the agreement. I think that is inevitable,"Trimble,
leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),told a news
conference in the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments after General John De Chastelain presented
his paper on disarmament to both British and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
Trimble added he expected the British government to institute a
review of the thorny issue of disarmament while the province's 12-
member power-sharing government of Protestant and Roman Catholic
ministers was put on ice.
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, urgent talks were due to take place later in the day
between British Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson and
Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen about a report from the
province's weapons monitors that was expected to say that the
Irish Republican Army or IRA had not yet disarmed despite a truce
in an anti-British war.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said that "the basis on which we formed the(coalition)
administration had now been falsified".

<HEADLINE> China Pledges Unremitting Efforts in Seeking Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Russia Wu
Tao said here Tuesday that China, as a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council, will continue its unremitting efforts in finding
a final resolution of the Middle East problem, including the issue
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who leads the Chinese delegation to a multilateral meeting
on the Middle East, said Beijing has been following the
development of the situation in the region and has all along
championed a peaceful rather than military, cooperative rather
than confrontational and all-embracing rather than isolationist
approach to the process.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright chaired the meeting, which was also
attended by foreign ministers from Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia and Canada, and senior delegates from Palestine and the

Syria and Lebanon didn't send any representative, citing the
failure in their bilateral talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that China has been invited to the
multilateral meeting.

<P>
The Chinese ambassador stressed that the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of all the countries in the Middle East should
enjoy broad respect and that their security should be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people should
also be restored and respected, and the various peoples in the
region should be living together harmoniously and seeking common
development, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Middle East talks have now entered a crucial stage
when the negotiations confront major difficulties as the various
sides' fundamental and long-term interests are at stake.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the belief that the peace process will achieve
continuous progress, if the sides stick to their strategic choice
of resolving the conflicts through peaceful talks, proceed
positively and pragmatically from an historic perspective and with
an eye toward the future, from the sense of responsibility for the
people of the region and for the generations to come, and on the
basis of the "land for peace" principle and related U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting ended late Tuesday, with Russia and the U.S.
, the co-sponsors of the Middle East settlement, releasing a joint
statement that confirms their resolution to contribute to further

<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- British Airways is planning
thousands of job cuts over the next three years to help finance
its recently announced investment program and restore
profitability.
</P>
<P>
The redundancies, which are currently being negotiated with
unions, could be in excess of 10 percent of the airline's 65000
workforce, according to a Financial Times report.
</P>
<P>
The airline has already announced plans to cut its seat
capacity by 12 to 15 percent by 2003 and switch smaller aircraft
onto routes where they can focus on capturing more business-class
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Financial Times report, A spokeswoman from BA
said "We have said that because of our cuts in capacity we would
expect the number of people to be reduced further than what we
have announced, but we haven't got a figure yet."
</P>
<P>
She said that BA has suffered alongside Europe's other major
airlines such as Lufthansa and Air France, which have seen profits
plummet because of overcapacity and higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
BA has suffered from the serious effects of a strike by cabin
crew two years ago. That dispute was triggered by a previous round
of job cuts and attempts to introduce more flexible working
practices.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Effect Slows Manufacturing Output In UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The UK's manufacturing sector
expanded for the ninth consecutive month in January but the rate
of growth slowed as the millennium effect reduced demand.
</P>
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS)said in
its latest report that its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) had
fallen to 52 from 56.3 to register the slowest growth since June
1999.
</P>
<P>
The decline, which left the January index well below the 56.1
reading economists had forecast, was largely due to a reversal of
pre-millennium stock building.
</P>
<P>
The CIPS said, once it became clear that there was little
disruption, companies cut back on new orders as they used up pre-
ordered stocks. New orders were even weaker, with the index down
to 53.3 compared to 61.2 in December.
</P>
<P>
However, Roy Ayliffe of the CIPS maintained that the underlying
growth was still "buoyant".

ATHENS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday began an
ambitious extension project in the northern port of Thessaloniki,
with the aim of establishing the port as a maritime gateway for
southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an inauguration ceremony of a project to extend the
port's sixth pier by 600 meters, worth 1.6 billion drachmas (about
4.8 million U.S. dollars), Greece's Merchant Marine Minister
Stavros Soumakis said that works will upgrade the port's ability
to handle more cargo and larger vessels, the semi-official Athens
News Agency(ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will raise the pier's total area to 350,000
square meters, is expected to be completed in four years.
</P>
<P>
Funding will be 50 percent covered by the European Union's
Third Community Support Framework and the remaining 50 percent by
the Thessaloniki Port Authority, which will be listed on the
Athens Stock market in the second half of the year through the
flotation of a 49 percent share of its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Thessaloniki port, the largest port in northern Greece and
the second largest in Greece, is expected to be linked with the
Thessaloniki region's road network and the city's airport, as well
as with an improved domestic rail network extending into the

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes U.N. Chief's Comments on Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday welcomed the
comments by the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan concerning the
possible solution to the protracted Cyprus problem within the year.
</P>
<P>
After opening the second round of proximity talks in Geneva
between the two communities on Cyprus, Annan said Monday that he
expected a comprehensive settlement to the long-running Cyprus
dispute within the year.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at a press
briefing that the U.N. chief's comment was "hopeful," adding that
Annan's comment could also serve as a form of pressure on Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who refuses to meet Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides face-to-face unless northern Cyprus is
recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification in the
form of a two-state confederation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the divided island, the two communities on Cyprus
held their first round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks in New
York last month, and the second round of talks began Monday in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Cyprus Republic insist that a federal solution
to the Cyprus issue is the only basis for discussion in line with
U.N.resolutions.

began a debate on the measure.
</P>
<P>
"This bill would mandate a number of new security and military
arrangements with Taiwan that could create dangerous, false and
inaccurate expectations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan military bill were sent to President Clinton in
its present form, his senior advisers would recommend that it be
vetoed, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The measure was sharply condemned by China. In Beijing, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said on Monday that China
has demanded that the U.S. Congress immediately stop their moves
to infringe on China's sovereignty by passing the bill.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the measure is also meant to interfere in China's
eventual reunification with Taiwan, noting that such attempts
posed a "serious threat" to the "relationship across the Taiwan
Straits, the peace and stability in Asia-Pacific region, and the
Sino-U.S. ties."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning said on
Monday: "We strongly urge the U.S. government to take effective
measures to prevent this act from being adopted in the Congress
and to prevent it from becoming law."

<HEADLINE> Over 150 Rebels Killed in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 Chechen rebels
have been killed in the past 24 hours, the Russian federal forces'
headquarters in the North Caucasus said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Federal servicemen and pro-government militia moved closer to
the center of Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic, the Itar-
Tass news agency reported, quoting the press center of the federal
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
This came after reports earlier Tuesday that Chechen rebels
were abandoning Grozny following major losses over the past few
days, but Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev ruled out a
possible breakthrough by the rebels from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
"The events of 1996, when rebels left Grozny and then returned
there, will not be repeated," he told reporters during a trip to
the North Caucasus Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels, seeing that the situation is hopeless, are
accelerating efforts in a bid to get out of town," the minister
said. "These attempts are being curbed by troops, which
successfully carry out the tasks of the operation to liberate
Grozny."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the rebels will not manage either to leave
or to return to the town," the Interfax news agency quoted
Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chechen officials have confirmed reports that rebel
commander Shamil Basayev had been badly wounded and lost a leg in
an explosion, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Lecha Dudayev, the nephew of the first Chechen president and
the mayor of Grozny, was also confirmed killed.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Defense Ministry refuted reports about the
withdrawal of 2,000 rebels from Grozny as "totally untrue."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Starts Probe of Alaska Airlines Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Navy was moving recovery equipment, including
sophisticated sonar gear, from Virginia State to the West Coast to
help search for wreckage and the critical "black boxes," Hall said.
</P>
<P>
No survivors had been found by early Tuesday following the
Monday crash of the Alaska Airlines jet with 88 people from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico. The plane, which plunged into the ocean about 65
kilometers northwest of Los Angeles, was en route to San Francisco,
and then Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Hall said the plane's crew in conversations with air traffic
control had indicated a problem with the jet's horizontal
stabilizer, which keeps the aircraft on an even pitch during
flight.
</P>
<P>
A NTSB team led by safety board member John Hammerschmidt
arrived in Los Angeles from Washington early Tuesday and set up
headquarters at a hotel in Oxnard, California State, near where
the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
Before the plane, a Boeing MD-83, went down, the pilot said he
was having problems with "stabilizer trim," Alaska Airlines said.
</P>
<P>
Problems with the horizontal stabilizer, which on this plane
looks like a small wing mounted on top of the tail, could have
prevented the pilots from controlling whether the plane's nose
pointed up or down at the proper angle, leading to an
uncontrollable dive.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the NTSB, the Federal Aviation
Administration and Boeing have been checking their records for
reports of any similar problems with the MD-80 series.
</P>
<P>
Recently the safety board has been investigating EgyptAir
Flight 990, a Boeing 767 that crashed on October 31 last year into
the ocean 90 kilometers south of the Massachusetts island of
Nantucket in the United States, killing all 217 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Enhance Primary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has recruited 21, 000
teachers to enhance the country's Universal Primary Education
(UPE) program launched in January 1997, a senior official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Primary Education Geraldine Naamirembe
Bitamazire said the government would also consolidate the UPE
program by constructing more classrooms for the rising number of
pupils, according to Radio Uganda report.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's primary school enrolment has increased from 2.5
million before the inception of the UPE program to six million
now. However, the country has only 10,000 primary school teachers,
resulting in poor education quality especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
UPE program offers free primary education for four children of
each family as well as orphans and disabled children in line with
the government' s policy to improve the quality of population and
reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
Education gets a lion's share in the budget with primary
education accounting for 60 percent of the total fund for
education.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Optimistic About Implementation of Trade Deal With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki said on Tuesday he was confident that the South
Africa-European Union (EU) Free Trade Agreement would be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his return from the annual meeting of World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mbeki said "a whole number
of" EU countries were determined that the deal should go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a single European country that has said to us it
does not want this important agreement implemented," Mbeki told
reporters at Waterkloof Air Base outside Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The trade pact was signed last October in Pretoria after four
years of difficult negotiations and should have come into force on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy and Greece threatened not to ratify the deal if
South Africa did not stop using the trademarks of grappa (a liquor
made in Italy) and ouzo (a liquor made in Greece) for the spirits
produced in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the EU itself was to blame for the last-minute
complications because the European Commission had ignored the
concerns of some member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The obligation is on the Europeans to solve the problem
themselves. It' s a European thing," Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> US Justice Department Official Refuses to Meet De Beers' Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Attorney
General Joel Klein refused to meet De Beers' chairman to discuss
anti-trust laws that stop the South African diamond giant from
directly selling on the American market, South African Press
Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
De Beers chairman Nicky Oppenheimer wanted to meet Klein at the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss a 1994
indictment against De Beers for price-fixing in the U.S. which
stopped the company's executives from travelling there, De Beers
spokeswoman Tracy Peterson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They were both in the same place at the same time, so Nicky
Oppenheimer saw an opportunity to discuss the U.S.' anti-trust
legislation and how it affects us," Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to see if there was any opportunity to lift the
restrictions because the U.S. is such an important market for us.
But the U.S. Justice Department turned down our request."
</P>
<P>
De Beers has neither held assets in the United States nor
traded openly on its diamond market for fear of prosecution under
strict anti-trust laws since the Second World War ended.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest diamond producer markets 65 percent of the
world's diamonds and there has been various attempts in the U.S.
to prosecute it for monopolizing the market.

<P>
ABU DHABI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Britain on Tuesday expressed their satisfaction with bilateral
defense cooperation and discussed ways to enhance such ties, the
official WAM news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between visiting Britain's Secretary of State
for Defense Geoff Hoon and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy
Supreme Commander of UAE Armed Forces Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-
Nahyan, they reviewed bilateral ties of cooperation, particularly
in the military field, WAM said.

during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The British defense secretary arrived here on Monday as part of
a short Gulf tour. He is expected to leave the UAE for Kuwait later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
The visit aims at enhancing Britain's ties with the ruling
families and underlining Britain's continuing and substantial
commitment to the security of the Gulf, said a statement from the
British Embassy here earlier.
</P>
<P>
Britain enjoys a particularly close defense relationship with

<HEADLINE> Workshop Discusses Global Energy Issues at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An international
workshop Tuesday kicked off at the U.N. Headquarters in New York
for discussion of global energy issues, emerging technologies and
power purchasing in the deregulation environment.
</P>
<P>
The series of educational sessions, slated for February 1-2,
will attract a roster of experts representing both international
and national organizations, including a special presentation by
futurist David Pearce Snyder, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Teaming together to co-host the two-day workshop, both the
United Nations and the United States General Services
Administration (GSA) are recognized for their efforts and interest
on energy issues.
</P>
<P>
Concurrent workshops at the conference will follow two tracks.
One track will concentrate on issues surrounding deregulation and
the other on energy efficiency and clean energy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the workshops, 22 exhibitors representing
energy organizations and power companies from the United States,
the United Kingdom and the United Nations will have display
available here.
</P>
<P>
Attending the workshop are expected to include architects,
engineers, energy managers, facilities managers, local and
international energy policy makers, students, academics,
nongovernmental organizations and diplomatic personnel, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is investigating the use of fuel cells,
solar power and geothermal power for use at its facilities around
the world. By installing energy-efficient equipment and lighting
and improved operations and maintenance, United Nations
Headquarters is already saving approximately 15 percent in
electric costs compared with 1995 levels.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the United Nations expects to save an
additional 30 percent in electric and steam costs.

<P>
Wahid is paying the visit "in the light of the close

JINAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River embankments in
east China's Shandong Province have sustained a high-level of ice
run for the past two months, and so far no threats of breaches
have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government today organized thousands of people
from all over the province into emergency teams, and supplies of
detonators are at hand in case ice-breaking becomes necessary if
the danger of blocking develops.
</P>
<P>
The 300-km-long section of the river in the province has been
frozen, with a 20-cm-thick ice layer covering the water, according
to a local official.
</P>
<P>
This year's icing of the country's second-longest river will
create difficulties for local residents when the frozen water
turns to icy floods in the warm March weather, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has warned of the potential danger of
breaches along the embankments that may develop with the coming of
spring.
</P>
<P>
The 5,400-km-long Yellow River originates in the Qinghai-Tibet
plateau in northwest China, runs through nine provinces and
autonomous regions, and flows into the Bohai Sea in east China.

<HEADLINE> mee0201 hke -- No Immediate Revenge Demanded by SLA: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army (SLA) didn't demand an immediate retaliation by
Israeli forces against Hezbollah for recent assassinations, a
senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with SLA Commander General Antoine Lahad Tuesday
morning, Israeli Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said both
sides agreed that the decisions about the revenge operations will
be made by the Israeli government alone, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim guerrilla, is leading
a war of attrition to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA
militiamen from the south Lebanon in which Israel set up a security
zone in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern border areas from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Three Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were blown up Monday
and four others injured in a Hezbollah missile attack, which
brought the death toll of the IDF inside the security zone since
the beginning of this year up to four, as compared with 13 for the
year 1999.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Hezbollah detonated a roadside bomb, instantly
killing Colonel Akel Hashem, the second-highest ranking commander
in the SLA.
</P>
<P>
A few hours after Monday's incident, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak held an emergency cabinet meeting, with IDF Chief of Staff
Shaul Mofaz and other top IDF officers.
</P>
<P>
Although rejecting the IDF's call for stern and immediate
retaliation, the cabinet authorized Barak to respond to Hezbollah's
attacks at his own discretion.
</P>
<P>
Some IDF officers worried that if Israel didn't take quick
reactions, the SLA fighters would fill the vacuum, thus triggering
a large-scale flare-up on the northern border.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts believe the Israeli-Lebanese and the
Israeli-Syrian peace prospects would be dampened if Israel took
real revenge.
</P>
<P>
Barak had already issued a stern warning Monday evening that
peace negotiations with Syria, who allegedly controls some supply
routes of Hezbollah, would resume unless Syria reined in the
guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and Syria have been postponed
indefinitely after two rounds since December because of the
disputes over the Israeli pullout from the Golan Heights which was
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Ready for Talks With Opposition: Rabbani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Tuesday agreed to Pakistan's proposal for the resumption of talks
with the northern opposition alliance to peacefully resolve the
protracted crisis in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"There was a proposal from the Pakistani side for talks with
the northern alliance. We told them that we have always been
willing to hold talks and we are ready to begin talks," Mullah
Muhammad Rabbani, chairman of the Taliban's Council of Ministers,
said.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani was addressing a press conference here after meetings
with Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar and Chief Executive General
Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions concerning the alleged terrorist Osama
bin Laden, Rabbani, who ranks second in the Taliban's hierarchy,
said the Saudi millionaire had been deprived of all communication
facilities and "he can't carry out any activity against any
country."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Osama was not involved in the 1998 bombings
of U.S. embassies in East Africa. "We have found that he was
neither involved nor did he participate in the attacks on the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Osama is our guest and will continue to enjoy this status.
However, we have banned all of his activities after he was accused
of involvement in terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Osama issue should be resolved through
talks and "not through other means."
</P>
<P>
The United States had imposed economic sanctions on the Islamic
militia and then the United Nations also followed suit, in a bid
to pressure the Taliban to hand over Osama for trial.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, heading a 17-member high-level delegation, Monday
arrived in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar by road due
to a U.N. ban on air connection with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the killing of nine Iranian diplomats during
the seizure of the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif by the
Taliban troops, the Taliban leader said investigation into "the
unfortunate incident" was still in progress.
</P>
<P>
He said the perpetrators of that crime had not yet been
identified. However, he assured that the Taliban regime would make
the report of investigation public.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said the Taliban's relations with Iran had considerably
improved.
</P>
<P>
He cited the opening of the Islam Qila border by Iran for
transit trade in western Afghanistan, the re-opening of the
Iranian consulate in Herat and the recent visit of an Iranian
delegation to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in his opening statement, Rabbani said his visit to
Pakistan was aimed at further cementing the bilateral relations
between Islamabad and Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the results of his two-day official visit, he said
the Pakistani authorities had agreed to release all consignments
of Afghan transit trade stranded at Karachi port "without any
charges."
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides also agreed that there would be no
restriction on the transit trade and both sides would work
according to the existing Afghan Transit Trade Agreement between
them.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of terrorism, he said Afghanistan condemned all
kinds of terrorism. "We could not allow anybody to carry out
terrorism inside Afghanistan. We would also not permit anybody to
use Afghan territory for terrorist activities against anybody or
any other country."
</P>
<P>
He said Islam abhorred terrorism because "it is against human
rights."

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Mass Rebel Flee From Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian president aide Sergei
Yastrzhembsky denied on Tuesday the allegations that mass rebels
have been fleeing Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic
Chechnya, after the federal troops captured the Minutka Square in
the center of the city on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Reports of 2,000 rebels escaping from Grozny and field
commander Shamil Basayev is undergoing a medical operation in
Alkhan-Kala cannot be considered reliable, the aide told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"If they left Grozny, we should have informed you by all means,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said fierce fighting is still raging in Grozny and the
Russian military expects rebels to make bids to break out of the
besieged city.
</P>
<P>
A group of rebels have been surrounded and are being wiped out
in a planned operation near Alkhan-Kala.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said that the reports of rebel escapes and
Basayev's operation "are very often circulated by the rebels
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malik Saidullayev, head of the pro-Moscow Chechen
State Council, confirmed reports that some 1,000 rebels have
escaped Grozny over the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
They fled in small groups in the area of Yermolovka station and
headed for the mountains.

<HEADLINE> France Rejects Demand for Arrest Warrant Against Gaddafi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- France rejected Tuesday the
demand by a civil group to issue an international arrest warrant
for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for his alleged role in a
bombing attack against a French passenger plane in 1989.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
Colonel Gaddafi is considered a head of state "by his peers and by
the international community," and thus enjoys immunity reserved
for all heads of state.
</P>
<P>
"Colonel Gaddafi, in power since 1969 with the title of 'guide
of revolution' has assumed, and continues to assume, the functions
and responsibilities of a head of state," added the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The civil group SOS-Attentats, which protects the victims of
terrorist attacks in France, has asked a French judge in charge of
terrorist files to launch an international arrest warrant against
Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
It accused the Libyan leader of involving in the bombing attack
against a DC-10 passenger plane of France's UTA air company in
Niger in September 1989, in which 170 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The group argued that Gaddafi does not hold the title of "head
of state" and "does not by consequence benefit from the immunity
reserved for heads of state."

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Hails Crucial Change in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military hailed
Tuesday its full seizure of the Minutka Square in central Grozny,
capital of the breakaway republic Chechnya, calling it a "great
breakthrough and significant turn" in the decisive and final phase
of the anti-terrorist military operation in the rebel province.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, speaking to reporters
in Mozdok, Northern Ossetia, said, "the operational situation in
Grozny changed critically after the Russian forces established
control over the Minutka Square in Grozny."
</P>
<P>
"Minutka square is a strategic key position, the intersection
of six thoroughfares. With the establishment of control over it,
the state of the operational situation in the city changed
significantly for the better," he said, cited by the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
"A crucial change in Grozny has taken place, judging by the
reports of the federal force headquarters and in my own opinion,"
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said the federal forces would not give the militants a
chance to escape from the besieged city. "That would run counter
to the aims of the anti-terrorist operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will ever allow the rebels to leave the city other than
under a white flag and after laying down their weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another high-ranking Russian officer Viktor Kazantsev,
Commander of the Combined Federal Grouping in the North Caucasus,
said in an interview with Russian ORT television Tuesday that "the
rebel resistance will be broken shortly."
</P>
<P>
"Radical changes can be seen. The operation is developing
according to our plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now the taking of Grozny from rebels is a matter of days," he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the rebels still control the mountainous
districts. "I think they still control a couple of districts,
primarily the Shatoi district," Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that this district, half of which is held by the
federal forces, will be liberated from rebels very soon.

<HEADLINE> Marconi Wins Chinese Rail Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) - The Shanghai-based joint company
owned by Britain's Marconi Co. Ltd. has beaten off competition
from international equipment suppliers to win a new batch of
orders for Chinese railway operators, Marconi announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest contracts include equipment for the World Bank 7
project -- the latest in a series of initiatives by the Chinese
Ministry of Railways to upgrade communications in dozens of
regional rail companies.
</P>
<P>
It follows orders worth 10 million U.S. dollars won by Marconi
last year for "the Sixth Railway Project," also backed by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Beating other suppliers, the joint venture, Shanghai GPT, also
won a separate contest to supply equipment for the Chengdu Railway
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GPT was set up in 1996 between Marconi and the
Shanghai Railway Communications Equipment Factory, the state-owned
manufacturer of telecoms equipment.
</P>
<P>
With around 45,000 employees worldwide and sales in over 100
countries, London-based Marconi is listed on the London Stock
Exchange and appears in the FTSE-100 Index.
</P>
<P>
"We beat more than 10 bidders around the world to win the World
Bank 7 contract," said James Chiu, president of the Marconi
Communications (Asia-Pacific).
</P>
<P>
"The bid showed that we are not only extremely price-
competitive, but able to meet the stringent technical and quality
requirements of the Chinese rail industry," he added.

PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said on Tuesday that the pressure being exerted by the
European Union (EU) on Austria is "absolutely necessary."
</P>
<P>
Jospin told the French National Assembly that the objective of
the EU pressure is to "interrupt the project of alliance between
the conservative party and the extreme-right Freedom Party" led by
Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to make sure that the awareness (of the
consequences) will increase in Austria and that this project (of
alliance) be interrupted," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that France will "take all the measures so
that the Austria of Mr. Haider and Mr. (Wolfgang) Schussel be
politically isolated in Europe" when Paris takes over the EU
rotating presidency in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Schussel, the leader of the Austrian conservative party, and
Haider are in the process of establishing a coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a poll published on Tuesday said that 55 percent of
the French people are against the establishment of a government in
Austria with the extreme-right in it.
</P>
<P>
The poll, made by the CSA institution and published in the

want Austria expelled by EU if the extreme right enters government.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snow Causes Damage in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 1 (Xinhua)-- A heavy snowfall that began at
eight o'clock last night has caused some damage in this capital
city of Jiangxi Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, Jiangxi has been affected by an unexpected
cold snap, which brought today's snow. Most regions in Jiangxi
have seen temperatures of -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, according to
the provincial meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
Electrical wires in many cities in southern Jiangxi were frozen
by the snow, affecting local communications. The snow has also
caused some traffic accidents, but no severe casualties have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
Local agriculture is also being hurt by the freezing weather,
harming crops, which have frozen three times in the past two
months, said Cheng Jin, deputy director of the provincial
agricultural department.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, 180,000 hectares of oranges and nearly 34,
000 hectares of vegetables were damaged by the cold spell.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi is not the only place in China affected by this winter'
s heavy snows.
</P>
<P>
Snows snarled traffic in Beijing, Shanghai and south China's
Yunnan Province last month. The heavy snowfall on January 17 in
Inner Mongolia in north China killed 36,000 domestic animals and
affected 900,000 people, bringing economic losses of nearly 40
million yuan (about 3.6 million U.S. dollars). The Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region also reported nine death and four injuries since
the start of a continuous snowfall in the northern part of the
region on January 13, according to a local government official.
</P>
<P>
Local departments in the snow-stricken areas have organized
people to help minimize snow damages, with great efforts being
made to save crops and prevent further losses.

exports and domestic exports fell by 0.8 percent and 1.8 percent
respectively while import prices rose by 0.5 percent.

<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today
that China hopes the United States government will honor its
commitment concerning China's accession into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
China has taken note of the fact that the U.S. government has
stated clearly that it will try to grant the normal trade status
to China, he said, adding that the Chinese side hopes that the U.S.
side will honor its commitment in real earnest and with concrete
steps.
</P>
<P>
China-EU WTO Talks, Human Rights issue Separate
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao said that the differences on human rights between
China and the European Union and the talks on China's entry into
the World Trade Organization between the two sides are separate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China hopes that the EU will conduct substantial
dialogue with the Chinese side on the basis of equality and mutual
respect, and stressed that confrontation will lead to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
 Espionage report were fabrication
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao elaborated on the reports carried by the Globe and
Mail on the so-called China's espionage of Canadian nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reports were sheer fabrications with ulterior
motives, and aimed at undermining relations between China and
relevant countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China's miniature neutron source reactor was
completely researched and developed by China, therefore, there is
no need for China to steal other's technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that some anti-China forces in Canada have tried
every means to hamper the growth of relations between China and
Canada and stressed that their attempts are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
 Anti-China Act Urged to Stop
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on an anti-China act, Zhu also said
that China has demanded that the U.S. Congress immediately stop
their moves to infringe on China's sovereignty by passing the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
A few U.S. Congressmen have pledged their full support for the
approval of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, he said, adding
"The nature of their moves is to first broaden U.S. domestic laws
so as to form a legal basis for providing all manner of advanced
weaponry systems to Taiwan and building up and expanding direct
contacts between the armed forces of U.S. and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He said that their actions are also meant to interfere in China
's eventual reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that such attempts posed a "serious threat" to
the "relationship across the Taiwan Straits, the peace and
stability in Asia-Pacific region, and the Sino-U.S. ties."

Japan Donates 1.23 billion yen to China
</P>
<P>
China and Japan today signed an official document here on a 1.
23-billion-yen aid contribution from the Japanese government to

respective governments.
</P>
<P>
The financial aid program provides chemical fertilizer,

 FM Spokesman on Huangyan Island Event
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here that
China cannot accept the Philippine attempt to "distort facts and
confound right and wrong" by claiming its sovereignty over a
Chinese island.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine side recently disregarded China's sovereignty
over Huangyan Island and randomly interfered in the normal fishing
operations of Chinese fishermen. "Their moves even developed into
forcefully boarding Chinese ships for checkups and robbing them of
their property," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Monday Inflict 100 Casualties in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Almost 100 people were killed or
wounded in a string of road accidents in Turkey on Monday, reported
the Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were killed and 20 others injured in a chain
accident in Aksu, south Turkey. The accident happened when a bus
traveling from Gaziantep to Antalya crashed into a service minibus.
The bus was being quickly followed by a Manavgat-bound bus which
struck the same minibus. The injured were rushed to various
hospitals in Antalya.
</P>
<P>
Another accident took place 96 kilometers along Konya-Ankara
Highway when a bus and a truck collided, killing seven people and
injuring 20 others.
</P>
<P>
One more accident occurred in Konya when a minibus flipped. One
was killed and another wounded.
</P>
<P>
In Amasya, northeast of Ankara, a tourist bus turned over,
killing three of its passengers and wounding 23.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a road accident-prone country likely due to its tough
terrain. But the authorities say that the most common cause of
traffic accidents in the country is error by the driver, which is
followed by error of the pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 4,606 people were killed and 113,656 others
injured in a total of 441,693 traffic accidents, Anatolia reported,
quoting police traffic director Nihat Kurtic as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Rains and flood waters battering
Mindanao in the southern Philippines for five days have already
left l8 dead, the Philippine government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Office of Civil Defense, the
provinces of Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte and Davao Oriental
are the most affected areas where the property damage has already
amounted to 200 million pesos (5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has ordered the National
Disaster Coordination Council to extend sustained assistance to
victims.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense,
who also chairs the council, reported that the floods in these
areas have started to subside.
</P>
<P>
He said in a radio interview that improved weather conditions
have allowed many residents to be taken to evacuation centers or
start returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mercado made an aerial survey of the affected areas
and took some aid to the victims such as rice and other relief
supplies.
</P>
<P>
"We brought 1,000 bags of rice and relief goods through a C-130
cargo plane upon the order of the president. So far, relief
operations are going smoothly," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the forest denudation in these areas as one of the
causes of the floods, Mercado urged the congress to approve a
measure that would impose a total logging ban to prevent a repeat
of such calamities.
</P>
<P>
"So I think it is known to most people. It is clear that we are
now paying for the sins of loggers in the past," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Visit India in March: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will pay a five-day visit to India starting from March 20, an
Indian Foreign Office spokesman announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The visit of the U.S. president is expected to pave the way
for a qualitatively new and closer relationship between the two
democracies," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton is coming at the invitation of Indian President
K R Narayanan and will stay in the country for "approximately five
days." Clinton's wife, Hillary, and daughter Chelsea have also
been invited.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's trip to India will be the first by a U.S. president
since 1978, when the then U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited the
country.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Clinton would also visit Pakistan during his
South Asia trip, the spokesman declined to comment, saying only
that it would not be appropriate for him to comment on the U.S.
president's visit to a third country.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question whether the issue of India's signing
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would be part of the agenda
of Clinton's talks with Indian leaders, he said, "It will be a
mistake to link the visit with any specific issue or subject."
</P>
<P>
Though details of the tour are still being worked out, the U.S.
president is expected to visit one or two Indian cities other than
New Delhi, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Stabilize Prices of Basic Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Tuesday allayed fears that prices of basic commodities will
increase as a result of the recent rise in the prices of oil
products.
</P>
<P>
After holding steady for the last three months, pump prices of
petroleum products rose by an average of 50 to 70 centavos (1.25
to 1.75 U.S. cents) per liter starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zenaida Maglaya, assistant secretary of the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI), said in a statement that the oil price
adjustments will only have minimal impact on the prices of basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Maglaya said prices of basic goods have remained stable last
year despite seven price adjustments made by oil firms. In fact,
prices of dressed chicken dropped by 15 percent and sugar by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
This is because that fuel, light and water taken as one item
only comprises 5.4 percent of the consumer price index, the
measure of prices at the consumer level for a fixed basket of
goods and services, she said.
</P>
<P>
Maglaya said several measures aimed at keeping prices of basic
goods and the costs of utilities stable are already in place to
cushion the impact of the latest oil price increase on consumers.
</P>
<P>
These include assurances from major transport groups that they
would not seek fare increases, and big manufacturers and retailers
of prime commodities that they would maintain prices of their
products at present levels despite the latest oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
She also assured consumers that her department will
continuously monitor prices in the markets to ensure that traders
will not take advantage of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges to Boost Middle East Peace Progress, European Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President
Vladimir Putin called on the international community Tuesday to
give a new impetus to the prolonged Middle East peace process and
to strengthen the brittle stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Arab-Israeli settlement talks are reaching a new and important
stage and "there is a strong chance to pave the way for a new
standard of bilateral relations," Putin said at a Moscow
ministerial conference on multilateral talks in the Middle East,
which was initiated by Russia and the United States and attended
by foreign ministers of 15 countries including the two sponsor-
nations.
</P>
<P>
He praised the role the European Union, the United States,
Egypt, Jordan and Norway are playing in the peace process and said
that Russia promotes it as a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
Putin emphasized the importance of collective security and
cooperation in the region, vowing that Russia will continue
contributing heavily to the process.
</P>
<P>
He said that international relations are going through a period
of deep transformation at the birth of the 21st century and there
is a qualitative change for the better evident in the global
foreign policy dimension, while globalization opening up
possibilities for many-sided integration is gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
However, there remain some unresolved problems, such as the
threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
international terrorism and organized crime, which are growing
into increasingly topical subjects, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The international community must find effective responses to
all these challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, Putin stated that Russia consistently favors the
formation of a stable and indivisible Europe.

<P>
PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday called on Israel
to exercise restraint after three Israeli soldiers were killed by
pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal for restraint and hope that in the field our appeals
will be heard, and we hope that (Syria-Lebanese) talks could
resume as early as possible," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that France calls on all the parties in southern
Lebanon to abandon military operation which could endanger the
civilian population and destroy civilian infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the international monitoring group on truce
in southern Lebanon, which is co-chaired by France and the United
States, will meet on Wednesday to study the "complaints" by both
Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The tension in southern Lebanon rose abruptly after the pro-
Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas made several attacks against Israeli
troops and their ally, the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
Israel retaliated by making air raids against Hezbollah targets
Sunday night and Monday morning. It promised more raids and raised
the possibility of suspending peace talks with Syria after three
Israeli soldiers were killed on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army Start Manoeuvre to Mark Revolution Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The ground force of the Iranian
army on Tuesday kicked off a military exercise code-named "Zolfaqar
of Velayat 1" in the southwestern part of the country to mark the
21st anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian state-run television showed the military aircraft
and helicopters were busying at boarding troops to be dispatched to
the manoeuvre zones in southwestern border areas.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvre was launched at a time when massive rallies were
being held throughout the country to mark the return of the late
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini from France in
1979.
</P>
<P>
The "10-day Dawn" celebration will last for 10 days and will
culminate with a massive rally on February 11, the Day of Victory
of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The deputy commander of the ground force, Ebrahim Ashtiani, said
on Sunday the ground force will launch two manoeuvres entitled as "
Zolfaqar of Velayat 1 and 2" in southern and western parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ashtiani said the manoeuvres were designed to boost rapid
deployment of the ground force.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first manoeuvre, troops of the ground force
will be dispatched from northwestern Iran to three areas of Ahvaz,
Dezful and Abadan in the southwestern province of Khuzestan and
then lifted by choppers to the southern borders to go on the
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the second exercise in western Iran will
include dispatching parachute troops on board C-130 aircraft from
Shiraz, the southern Fars province to the western towns of Mehran,
Salehabad and Ilam in the border province of Ilam.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator: No Progress in Final-status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing intensive
Palestinian-Israeli talks have made little headway toward
settlement of final-status issues, said a senior Palestinian
official Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators of the two sides have met twice since Sunday, but no
substantial progress was made, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Erekat asked Israel to take a positive attitude toward the talks
so as to meet the deadline of February 13 that the two sides set
for a framework agreement on the final-status issues, such as
borders, the Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlers and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also obliged to seal a final peace treaty by
September this year, according to the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum
signed in Egypt last September.
</P>
<P>
The current intensive talks will last for about ten days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian side announced Tuesday that
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will hold talks Thursday at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Palestinian side said, Arafat will ask
Barak to carry out Israel's third phase withdrawal from the West
Bank, among other things.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to transfer another 6.1 percent of the West Bank
territories to the Palestinians during the third withdrawal, which
has been postponed since January due to differences over what areas
are to be handed over.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Advised to Function as Gateway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has been advised to
position its financial sector as a gateway to the region and the
world and move well beyond the domestic market so as to sharpen
its competitive edge, according to the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS).
</P>
<P>
This advice was contained in a package of suggestions by MAS
International Advisory Panel (IPA) which ended its one-and-half-
day meeting Tuesday designed to identify challenges and
opportunities for Singapore in the new financial landscape.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Singapore cannot compete on the basis of cost, IPA
pointed out that the city-state has to continue to develop an
environment conducive to financial institutions to innovate and
provide higher-value services and build an environment that will
attract and retain a cross-section of international talents who
are highly mobile.
</P>
<P>
IPA agreed that deregulation, globalization and increased
competition arising from the provision of financial services
through new technology has led to consolidation in the global
financial industry which will drive down costs by capitalizing on
economies of scale, promote business synergy, enhance the capital
base and increase the institutions' capacity to manage risk.
</P>
<P>
IPA said Singapore should continue to build its strength and
capitalize on the synergy between the various financial activities
by implementing the financial sector reform measures undertaken in
the past year aimed at enhancing the operating environment,
aligning its supervisory regime with best international practice
and liberalizing its banking, insurance and securities industries.
</P>
<P>
IPA suggested that Singapore make efforts to attract some of
the major
financial and non-financial institutions to consolidate their
treasury operations in Singapore and draw foreign intermediaries
to locate fund management in the city state.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Singapore is also urged to apply the Internet and
other technologies within the financial institutions as a way to
reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the encouraging near-term prospect of a
sustained Asian economic recovery, IPA members also noted that
uncertainties remain over the medium term, referring to continued
progress in the needed structural reforms, sustainability of
growth in the United States and implications of the large fiscal
deficit and public debt burden in Japan.
</P>
<P>
IPA, a consultative group of about a dozen members, was set up
to review the country's financial situation and make suggestions
to MAS which aims to make the country a regional financial hub.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Sets Walking Backward Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian Tuesday set a
record for walking backward on a staircase, the first attempt in
the country.
</P>
<P>
G. Deo earned himself a name in the Malaysia Book of Records
when he successfully made an attempt to climb backward non-stop
the 2,058 steps of the Kuala Lumpur Tower in the downtown in 24
minutes and 15 seconds against his targeted time of one hour,
according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time Deo has carved his name in the
Malaysian Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
Deo's previous three feats are walking non-stop from Kuala
Lumpur to Ipoh covering a distance of 222 kilometers in 51 hours,
walking backward at the Kampung Pandan Sports Complex over a
distance of 30 kilometers in five hours and walking from Padang
Besar, Perlis in the north to Tanjung Puteri, Johor in the south,
covering a distance of 912 kilometers in 13 days.
</P>
<P>
Deo, a 41-year-old security assistant, said he walked up and
down his six-story office building 10 times after work every day
in the last three months to prepare for Tuesday's event and he was
happy because his feat proved that determination could make anyone
achieve his goal.
</P>
<P>
Deo said he would attempt to make a backward climb of the
Petronas Twin Towers, the world's tallest building in Downtown
Kuala Lumpur, in either mid-August or December.
</P>
<P>
Deo, who came from an orphanage, said he had been staging
charity walks from the age of 19 with the proceeds going to
orphanages.

DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Science and
Technology Minister Mohammad Nooruddin Khan Tuesday stressed the
need for equipping all factories irrespective of sizes with
pollution-control devices.
</P>
<P>
Each factory should have waste-water treatment plant so that
environmental pollution could be kept minimum, or be controlled to
a reasonable extent, the minister told a national workshop held
here.
</P>
<P>
The four-day national workshop on "Waste Water Treatment in SME
(small and medium enterprises)" is jointly organized by the Asian

Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Nooruddin Khan emphasized the need for involving all concerned
entrepreneurs in such an important workshop so that experiences
gathered here could be utilized for proper disposal of waste water
in factories. He also stressed the importance of the proper use of
the existing legal measures in this context.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Lawyer Rejects Human Rights Commission Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
rejected on Tuesday a report of the National Commission on Human
Rights (Komnas HAM), which accused TNI generals of involvement in
human rights abuse in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Describing the report as baseless, Chairman of the TNT Advocacy
Team Adnan Buyung Nasution said, "We strongly reject the KPP HAM's
Monday report, which said scores of TNI officials had been
involved in human rights abuse in East Timor."
</P>
<P>
"We strongly protest the announcement and disclosure of the
names of high-ranking TNI officials or personnel in the report,"
Nasution said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, based on the report of the Commission of Inquiry on
Human Rights Violations in East Timor (KPP HAM), Chairman of
Komnas HAM Djoko Soegianto announced the result of KPP HAM
investigation on the involvement of TNI officials in human rights
abuse in the breakaway province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The report listed 33 people (including six military officials)
who were believed to have been involved in atrocities in East
Timor, including incumbent Coordinating Minister for Politics and
Security Gen. Wiranto who was then the TNI chief.
</P>
<P>
The KPP HAM report accused Wiranto as the person responsible
for the atrocities in East Timor, which left thousands of
civilians (most of whom from the pro-independence camp) dead
before, during and after the U.N.-sponsored direct ballot at the
end of August last year.
</P>
<P>
The report also charged that in East Timor there was a crime
against humanity in the form of scorched earth policy, genocide,
sexual slavery, rape and abductions as well as disappearances
against pro-independence East Timorese and it was committed by the
anti-independence group and organized and backed by the TNI.
</P>
<P>
However, Nasution said the announcement of the result of KPP
HAM investigation, which was handed over to the attorney general
for further investigation, had violated the principle of law and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Nasution also said the KPP HAM report was politically-oriented
to discredit the TNI and its members.
</P>
<P>
"The whole report (of KPP HAM) didn't fulfill the investigation
standard based on the principle of criminal law," he charged.
</P>
<P>
But Attorney General Marzuki Darusman on Monday said he would
soon follow up the KPP HAM report and launch a comprehensive
investigation and bring to justice those who had been involved in
crime against humanity in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Wiranto's involvement in human rights abuse
in East Timor has triggered speculation on his resignation from
the cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
But Muladi, a member of the Advisory Committee of the TNI
Advocacy Team, said his committee supports the statement of
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, which said that Wiranto
would resign if only he is found guilty by the court.
</P>
<P>
So far, no comment is available from Wiranto on the KPP HAM
report.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Economy Affected by Involvement in Congo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said here Tuesday that his country's military involvement
in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has
not made adverse impact on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"Our involvement in Congo has only affected our budget, not
affecting the growth of economy," the president told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the national economy has been growing at a rate of over
six percent since the National Resistance Movement came to power
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He said the European Union's ban on Ugandan fish export and
terrorism have to some extent affected the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The fish ban makes our country lose 60 million U.S. dollars
annually. The terrorism, typically that which occurred in Bwindi
national park last year, tarnished our image abroad and stop
foreign investors to choose Uganda as their destination of
investment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The recent sharp depreciation of shilling is a clear indication
of Uganda's lack of foreign investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The budget allocated 130 million dollars to military expenses.
However, the real military spending, which has never been made
public, is widely believed to have gone beyond the figure,
inviting mounting pressure from donor countries to slash the
defense expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army In Better Position to Fight Rebels: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said that Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) is now in
a better position to dislodge and fight rebels operating from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at State House here Tuesday
morning, Museveni said that the UPDF is now better equipped to
cope with various challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have 100,000 soldiers when fighting dictators like
Obote and Amin. Then we found our army was poorly equipped and we
reduced the manpower in the army to save money for the better
equipment," Museveni said during the two-hour press conference.
</P>
<P>
The number of government soldiers was reduced to the present
40,000 but the army's capacity was built up with better weapontry
and better training,
</P>
<P>
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the rebels had shifted their aim from
regaining political power to terrorizing the population in rural
areas in their so- called publicity attacks aimed at tainting the
image of the government.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what the biggest challenge is to the UPDF in
fighting the rebels in the northern and western parts of the
country, the 55-year- old president said that lack of
infrastructure is the biggest problem for his troops.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot find footpath in some areas in these regions,
forget about roads. We need to build infrastructure to move our
equipment," he stressed, adding that a new network of roads is
being built along the border to facilitate movement of troops and
development of the regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels in the north and west have no fresh
supplies and the UPDF is currently tightening the screw on these
rebels. People in the western district of Bundibugyo would soon
go back to their villages with rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces fleeing the Rwenzori mountains.
</P>
<P>
He called on the rebels to take advantage of the Amnesty Law
and surrender to the government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in the western and northern parts of Uganda entered
Uganda from Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to
destabilize and kill. A new spate of attacks by the rebels have
so far been repelled by the UPDF and local defense units.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Concerned at S.Africans' Help to Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela on Tuesday expressed serious concern over
alleged help given by certain South Africans to the Angolan rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was speaking after meeting with Peter Hain, British
Foreign Affairs Minister for Africa at his Johannesburg office.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters that they discussed steps to be taken to
prevent South Africans from assisting Savimbi's National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) declared
Savimbi a war criminal in a 1998 summit in Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
"We view seriously the fact that some South Africans are
helping him," Mandela said. "I do not know how the government is
dealing with the matter," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hain said action had to be taken against those assisting
Savimbi wherever they were in the world.
</P>
<P>
"UNITA must be starved of the weapons they are using in this
war," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Austria of Threat of Far-Rightists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC),
the executive body of the 15-nation European Union, Tuesday warned
Austria of the danger of the far-rightist Freedom Party which is
seeking access to the government.
</P>
<P>
The EC made the remarks 24 hours after the Portuguese
government issued a three-point warning on behalf of the EU member
states. Portugal took the rotating presidency of the EU in January.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the EC said it will continue to fulfill its
duty as guardian of the provisions and values set down in the EU
treaties, which provide that the union is founded based on the
principles of liberty, democracy, respect of human rights and
fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The EC, however, said the working of the European institutions
is not affected at this stage but the commission will carefully
follow the development in Austria.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government said the 14 EU member states except
Austria have agreed not to promote or accept any bilateral
official contacts at political level with an Austrian government
integrating the extreme rightists.
</P>
<P>
If the far-rightists are included in the Austrian government,
the EU will not support Austrian candidates in seeking positions
in international organizations while Austrian ambassadors to the
EU countries will only be received at a technical level, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was mildly worded only to say that it shared the
concerns which underline the decision taken by the Portuguese
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The EC press service said the commission wants to ensure that
community laws will be fully and properly applied and that
European institutions can work properly.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil is due to give his decisive
say Wednesday on whether the far-rightist Freedom Party could join
the conservative People's Party in forming a coalition government
which will end a 30-year rein in the country by the Social
Democrats.

areas would not affect traffic linking up France to other EU
member states and it gave France five days to respond to the

France is subject, the commission warned, to facing
compensation actions by the commission should the country fail to
redress the problem now already affecting countries that border
France.
</P>
<P>
Truck drivers have set road blocks along highways leading to
Belgium and Luxembourg, protesting the application of 35-hour

LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Danny Wilson, manager of English
premier league soccer club Sheffield Wednesday, won a manager of
the month award on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has been under attack from fans and
parliamentarians, finally brought Sheffield Wednesday out of the
bottom of the table in January after the worst start to a seaon in
premier league history in which they just won once in 17 matches.
The club now stands second from bottom on 16 points.
</P>
<P>
Four Sheffield members of parliament, including Education
Minister David Blunkett, called for Wilson to be axed in mid-
January to help the club fight relegation.
</P>
<P>
After that, Wednesday beat Bradford City 2-0 and Tottenham
Hotspur 1-0 in the league. They also beat Wolverhampton Wanderers
on penalties in the F.A. Cup.
</P>
<P>
That run ended at the weekend when they lost 3-1 to second
division Gillingham in the fifth round of the F.A. Cup.
</P>
<P>
That defeat has prompted some angry fans to renew the calls to
fire the manager.

LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese women swimmer Yang Yu

400 meters freestyle heats in the third-fastest overall time.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe clocked 49.05 seconds in the 100, comfortably faster
than Americans Dan Phillips and Jarod Schroeder (49.91), and
settled for an unhurried three minutes 50.77 seconds in winning
his heat in the 400 -- more than 15 seconds slower than his best.

American Chad Carvin led the way in the 400, winning his heat

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, China's top
legislator, has urged south China's Guangdong Province to take the
national lead in democratic and legal construction.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection tour to Guangdong from January 26 to 31,
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), said that a developed economy and science and
technology call for a complete legal system and normalized
economic services.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as Guangdong's economy has attained a relatively
high level, its legal construction should take lead in China.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made inspections in the cities of Zhuhai, Zhongshan,
Dongguan, accompanied by Li Changchun, a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and secretary of the Guangdong Provincical Committee of the

<HEADLINE> Handwriting Input System to Help Chinese Use Computer: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese are now able to input
more conveniently words into their computers with a new
handwriting system instead of typing words into them.
</P>
<P>
The system, especially designed for Chinese character, consists
of an electronic pen and a 20-centimeter-long square electronic
pad, which are connected to the computer with a wire. With this
device, created about ten years ago and updated annually, computer
users can say bye-bye to conventional input methods based on
computer codes.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yiliang, 62 and a retired teacher, bought one of these
handwriting devices a half year ago, and said, "I have been
writing with pens for decades and could not get familiar with the
keyboard. But I learned the handwriting system in no time."
</P>
<P>
Lu Jianying, software engineer with the Beijing Hanwang
Technology Company (BHTC), a leading provider of this handwriting
device, told Xinhua that despite the amazing development of
computers in China, most computer users remain mostly well-
educated young people, and the elderly still feel strange when
confronted with a keyboard. For more than 120 million Chinese
older people, the handwriting system can be good news, she added.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yingjian, president of BHTC, said that he started research
on a handwriting input system in the early 1980s, and now has made
substantial achievements. This system can recognize handwritings
as soon as people complete writing on the pad, and the latest 8.8
version of the Hanwang handwriting input system has about 70
percent of the Chinese domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Although many people can input about 50 to 60 Chinese words per
minute on the keyboard, and a skilled typist can input more than
100 per minute, handwriting provides more Chinese with an input
method closer to their writing habits, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Education reveals
that the tendency of incorrectly writing words is rising among
college students, and experts say the computer is partly
responsible for this. Most students type Chinese using the method
of Pinyin, similar to phonetic symbols in English, and tend to
misuse homophonies which have same pronunciation but different
meanings and forms.
</P>
<P>
Experts say parents are now eager to have their young children
learn about computers, and many young kids are good at playing
games on them, but do not know much about the radicals and strokes
which constitute the structures of Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Wu Meiyun, who teaches at a Beijing primary school, fears that
future generations will know less and less about Chinese
characters, which carry thousands of years of traditional Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yingjian, president of BHTC, said he doesn't think that
scientific development must sacrifice traditional culture, and the
handwriting input system is an attempt to keep Chinese writing
habit fit even in a high-tech era.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Expects Sudan to Do More to Normalize Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said here Tuesday that his government is expecting Sudan
to do more to normalize bilateral relations severed since April
1995.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told reporters at State House that he was not
satisfied with what Khartoum had done so far to normalize
bilateral ties, yet he is sure that the situation would change for
the better.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord he signed with Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir in Nairobi in last December, Sudan should repatriate
all Aboke girls abducted by Joseph Kony's rebels who are based in
southern Sudan, disarm and relocate Kony as well.
</P>
<P>
"Khartoum has not yet honored their promises. So far I do not
have faith the peace accord and I expect they would do more to
show us that they are serious, " the president said.
</P>
<P>
Although Khartoum lags behind in implementing the peace
accord, Kampala is still observing the agreement and still thinks
the accord is still binding, he explained.
</P>
<P>
On the recent release of the last batch of 72 Sudanese
prisoners of war,
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that his government set free the POWs just to show
the world that it is serious about the matter.
</P>
<P>
"We sympathize with the families of the POWs and they (when
released) may spread a good word for us," Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Sudan have been accusing each other of backing each
other's rebel groups. They have tried several times to mend their
relations but with little success. The Nairobi agreement is their
latest effort made towards restoration of full diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
The accord said that they plan to restore diplomatic relations
by end of February if the accord is satisfactorily carried out.
Presently, a joint ministerial committee has been set up to pave
the way forward.

LUANDA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebels launched a road
ambush on a 10-vehicle convoy in the central coast Kwanza-sul
Province, killing six people and injuring six others, a military
source said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ambush occurred when the passengers of vehicles were on
their way to the Waco-Cungo district, some 350 kilometers
southeast of capital Luanda, the unidentified source said, adding
that among the six victims are three government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1999, the rampant military conflicts and the rebel
activities have cut off the Waco-Cungo district from the rest of
the Kwanza- sul Province.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) have tried to destroy bridges over the Nhia River
on the road linking with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the rampant rebel activities around the country, the
Angolan government and even opposition leaders are optimistic over
the current political-military situation in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Repentant rebel leader Eugenio Manuvakola said in Paris Monday
that " time is running out" for Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi
and his war against the government.
</P>
<P>
According to Manuvakola, the offensive launched by the
government troops starting from last September has destroyed
Savimbi's "semi-conventional capacity".
</P>
<P>
This means that the Savimbists have lost their logistical
capacity to use big units for big operations, Manuvakola said,
forecasting that the government's military advantage over the
rebels would allow it to crush the rebels "in the next few
months", though the guerrilla-style actions could continue for
some time.
</P>
<P>
Apparently signalling his optimism, Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos announced in late January that his country will
hold general elections in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said that the presidential and legislative elections
next year will surely help consolidate peace and order in Angola
which suffered a over-25-year civil war between the government
troops and the UNITA rebels.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Diamond Output Rises by 26% in 1999: Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government-owned
enterprises have produced some 2.27 million carats of diamond in
the year of 1999, marking a 26 percent increase over the 1.174
million carats in 1998, an official document said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mineral Society of Catoca, a multi-national joint-venture
located in the resourceful Lunda-sul Province, had an output of
1.585 million carats in1999, accounting for 70 percent of the
country's total production.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the diamond output of the Mineral
Society of Catoca, Angola's largest diamond-producing company, has
increased by 35 percent in 1999 from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Among other large-scale diamond-producing companies are the
Mineral Society of Lucapa (320,000 carats) in Lunda-norte
Province, the project of Tchitotolo (136,000 carats) and the
Society of Mineral Development (186,000 carats).
</P>
<P>
Angola, the once fourth largest diamond-producing country in
the world, saw its biggest output in 1974 with a total production
of 2.413million carats.
</P>
<P>
But in the following years until 1998, the country's diamond
production has experienced a stagnant period with the annual
production far smaller than two million carats, mainly due to the
resumption of the civil conflicts between the government troops
and the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army In Better Position to Fight Rebels: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said that Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) is now in
a better position to dislodge and fight rebels operating from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at State House here Tuesday
morning, Museveni said that the UPDF is now better equipped to
cope with various challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have 100,000 soldiers when fighting dictators like
Obote and Amin. Then we found our army was poorly equipped and we
reduced the manpower in the army to save money for the better
equipment," Museveni said during the two-hour press conference.
</P>
<P>
The number of government soldiers was reduced to the present
40,000 but the army's capacity was built up with better weapontry
and better training,
</P>
<P>
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the rebels had shifted their aim from
regaining political power to terrorizing the population in rural
areas in their so- called publicity attacks aimed at tainting the
image of the government.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what the biggest challenge is to the UPDF in
fighting the rebels in the northern and western parts of the
country, the 55-year- old president said that lack of
infrastructure is the biggest problem for his troops.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot find footpath in some areas in these regions,
forget about roads. We need to build infrastructure to move our
equipment," he stressed, adding that a new network of roads is
being built along the border to facilitate movement of troops and
development of the regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels in the north and west have no fresh
supplies and the UPDF is currently tightening the screw on these
rebels. People in the western district of Bundibugyo would soon
go back to their villages with rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces fleeing the Rwenzori mountains.
</P>
<P>
He called on the rebels to take advantage of the Amnesty Law
and surrender to the government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in the western and northern parts of Uganda entered
Uganda from Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to
destabilize and kill. A new spate of attacks by the rebels have
so far been repelled by the UPDF and local defense units.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Cargo Spaceship for Mir Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday morning
successfully launched a "Progress M1-1" cargo ship for the Mir
orbital station with a Soyuz booster from Kazakhstan's Baikonur
cosmodrome, said the Russian Aerospace Agency.
</P>
<P>
This is the first launch of an aircraft by Russia from the
Baikonur this year after a long interval since a rocket-blast
accident there in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
The supply spacecraft was sent up on schedule and without any
hitches at 9:47 a.m. Moscow time (0647 GMT) and separated from the
booster rocket at 9:56 a.m. Moscow time (0656 GMT). Subsequently
the spacecraft is to begin maneuvering toward rendezvous with the
station Mir.
</P>
<P>
Now the cargo aircraft has reached its intended orbit,
announced the Mir space station mission control center near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The spaceship is carrying an increased load of rocket fuel (2
tons), as well as water, food, spare parts and other materials
needed to reactivate the Mir.
</P>
<P>
The "Progress M1-1" is equipped with an additional turbo system
to increase the air pressure inside the station. Air continues to
leak from the station and the causes of the leak have not been
found out, said the control center.
</P>
<P>
The spaceship will dock with the Mir at 10:59 a.m. Moscow time
(0759 GMT) on Thursday. The arrival of the cargo ship will mark
the beginning of the final preparatory stage for the 28th mission
to the Mir station. If everything goes as it should, the mission
should be launched on March 31.
</P>
<P>
However, if for some reason the automatic docking system for
the "Progress M1-1" and the Mir fails on Thursday, cosmonauts
Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kalery will have to leave on an
emergency mission on February 17. They will have to dock to the
station and then manually moor Progress to Mir.
</P>
<P>
The 28th mission will last at least 45 days. If the necessary
funds can be raised, the mission may be extended until August and
may be followed by a 29th mission.
</P>
<P>
The mission control center says that the manned operation of
Mir should ideally be extended until the "Zvezda" service module
for the international space station is lifted into orbit, probably
in July-August, and the new station is finally manned.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Involved in East Timor Atrocities, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- At least six Indonesian
Military (TNI) officers including former TNI chief General Wiranto
were believed to had been involved in human right abuse in East
Timor, leaving thousands of civilians of the pro-independence
group dead, the National Commission on Human Right (Komnas HAM)
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing an investigation report on human right abuse in the
breakaway territory at a press conference, Chairman of the Komnas
HAM, Djoko Soegianto, said that after the Komnas HAM received
report from the Commission of Inquiry on Human Right Violations in
East Timor (KPP HAM), he concluded that at least 33 people
including TNI personnel and civil officers were believed to be
responsible for atrocities and genocide act as well as sexual
slavery and rape in East Timor during January-October 1999.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in East Timor, there was a crime against
humanity for which Wiranto have to be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
"The Komnas HAM demands Attorney General Office to launch
further investigation and bring to justice against those
responsible for such a crime," Soegianto said.
</P>
<P>
Soegianto added that crime against humanity which took place in
East Timor had been conducted systematically and well prepared
involving the pro-integration camp, and backed or organized by TNI
as well as Indonesian Police (Polri).
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Indonesian government and the House of
Representatives (DPR) to soon establish a human right tribunal to
bring to justice the human right violators in the former
Indonesia's province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of KPP HAM Albert Hasibuan mentioned that
beside Wiranto, who had been involved in such a crime, there were
also five other TNI officials, namely Brig. Gen. Timbul Silaen (
the former chief of East Timor Police), Col. Tono Suratman, Maj.
Gen. Zaki Makarim (the former chief of Intelligence) and Col. Nur
Muis.
</P>
<P>
Former East Timor Governor, Abilio Soares, and some chief of
regency in East Timor province were also responsible for the
atrocities and human right abuse there, Hasibuan added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said that
after his office received the report from the commission, he would
launch a comprehensive investigation against those who were
believed to be involved in human rights abuse in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We will launch an investigation as soon as possible. We will
soon establish a coordinating investigation team to follow up the
report," he said, without elaborating a deadline when the
investigation will be started and ended.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the investigation result by the Komnas HAM,
however, have put an end to the speculations on the involvement of
TNI officials in human right violations in East Timor which
triggered condemnation from international community.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Wiranto, the coordinating minister for politics and
security under President Abdurrahman Wahid's administration, is
likely to be the highest ranking TNI officials who have to face
human right tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Previously, TNI headquarters had denied that its soldiers had
committed atrocities and genocide acts in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"No clear evidence was found to show that TNI soldiers and
members of police were involved in acts of violence that resulted
in the death of thousands of people," it said in a journal on
January 28.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today that China hopes the United
States government will honor its commitment concerning China's
accession into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
China has taken note of the fact that the U.S. government has
stated clearly that it will try to grant the normal trade status
to China, he said, adding that the Chinese side hopes that the U.S.
side will honor its commitment in real earnest and with concrete
steps.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the differences on human rights
between China and the European Union and the talks on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization between the two sides are
separate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China hopes that the EU will conduct substantial
dialogue with the Chinese side on the basis of equality and mutual
respect, and stressed that confrontation will lead to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman elaborated on the reports carried by the Globe
and Mail on the so-called China's espionage of Canadian nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reports were sheer fabrication and with
ulterior motives, and aimed at attempting to undermine relations
between China and relevant countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China's miniature neutron source reactor was
completely researched and developed by China, therefore, there is
no need for China to steal other's technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that some anti-China forces in Canada have tried
every means to hamper the growth of relations between China and
Canada and stressed that their attempts are doomed to failure. (

<P>
China cannot accept the Philippine attempt to "distort facts
and confound right and wrong" by claiming its sovereignty over a
Chinese island, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a
regular press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine side recently disregarded China's sovereignty
over Huangyan Island and randomly interfered in the normal fishing
operations of Chinese fishermen. "Their moves even developed into
forcefully boarding Chinese ships for checkups and robbing them of
their property," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Some senior Philippine officials also made irresponsible
remarks, claiming that the Chinese ships infringed upon the so-
called sovereignty of the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to such acts, Zhu said that China's Foreign
Ministry has sent two notes to the Philippine embassy in China, in
which it expressed deep concern over recent affairs and lodged
protests over the illegal acts taken by the Philippines, according
to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterated that Huangyan Island has been an inalienable
part of the Chinese territory. "It is a fact universally
acknowledged by the international community," he stated.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines has no sovereignty or any sovereign rights
over Huangyan Island and its surrounding waters, nor any
administrative right over the waters," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the anti-China act, Zhu also said
that China has demanded that the U.S. Congress immediately stop
their moves to infringe on China's sovereignty by passing the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
A few U.S. Congressmen have pledged their full support for the
approval of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, he said, adding
that "The nature of their moves is to first broaden U.S. domestic
laws so as to form a legal basis for providing all manner of
advanced weaponry systems to Taiwan and building up and expanding
direct contacts between the armed forces of U.S. and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He said that their actions are also meant to interfere in China
's eventual reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that such attempts posed a "serious threat" to
the "relationship across the Taiwan Straits, the peace and
stability in Asia-Pacific region, and the Sino-U.S. ties."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people from the very beginning
expressed utter condemnation and firm opposition to such acts, Zhu
said, adding that China has repeatedly made serious and principled
representations to the U.S. on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that if the U.S. government wants to avoid
irreparable damage to the Sino-U.S. relationship, it must adhere
to the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant commitments
made by the U.S. side, fully understand the deviousness of such
actions, and take swift and concrete measures to stop the approval
of the act.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman Refutes Canadian Anti-China Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The reports of China's so-
called espionage of Canadian nuclear technology were based on
sheer fabrication and made with ulterior motives designed to
undermine relations between China and other countries, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the reports carried by Canada's Globe and
Mail newspapers recently, which made slanderous accusations that
China once sent a spy to Canada to steal nuclear technology, Zhu
said that China's miniature neutron source reactor, mentioned in
the reports, was completely researched and developed in this
country, so there is no need for China to steal technology from
any other source.
</P>
<P>
The reactor is a project approved by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes, he noted, adding that its export was also supervised by
the IAEA, and the project was partly carried out with financial
aid from the IAEA.
</P>
<P>
It must be pointed out that Sino-Canadian relations have
maintained good development momentum in recent years, and the two
countries have further promoted economic and trade cooperation,
especially nuclear energy cooperation, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that some anti-China forces in Canada have tried

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: Chinese FM Spokesman's Remarks (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reiterating China's stance on the Taiwan issue, Zhu said that
the Chinese government and people will absolutely not tolerate the
separation or independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He asked the press to "pay attention" to a speech made by
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen on January 20 at a meeting to
commemorate the fifth anniversary of the publication of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's speech in which he put forward an eight-
point proposition on the reunification of the motherland. In the
speech, Qian once again made clear China's guiding principles and
policy on the complete reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The election in Taiwan is a local event, he said. "Whatever the
result is and whoever wins the election, it should not lead to the
separation of Taiwan from the motherland or the independence of
Taiwan," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He said the post-election situation in Taiwan should be "
conducive to the development of relations across the Taiwan
Straits and the eventual peaceful reunification."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affairs, and
China has noticed that certain foreign forces have taken "new and
dangerous" steps to interfere in the Taiwan issue and impede China
's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
China is firmly opposed to the sale of any advanced weapons and
equipment to Taiwan by foreign forces, such as the sale or
transfer of the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system-related
technologies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope all countries in the world will respect the feeling
and aspiration of the Chinese people, including those compatriots
in Taiwan, and not take any move that may lead to the tension
across the Taiwan Straits," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that China is opposed to setting up a
tribunal or an investigative committee on East Timor's human
rights record, adding that such a stance "is known to all" and "
remains unchanged."
</P>
<P>
He said that China and a majority of countries in the Asia-
Pacific region are not in favor of the establishment of such a
tribunal or committee on the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China is aware that the Indonesian government has
already set up a committee to look into the human rights record in
East Timor, adding that investigations are "already underway."

<HEADLINE> No New Steel Makers to be Set Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China will not approve the
establishment of any kind of new iron and steel manufacturers as
the government is determined to put the general output of iron and
steel under tighter control.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued by the State Economic and Trade
Commission, restricted manufacturers include factories that are
engaged in casting and rolling of iron and steel, casting of
ferroalloy, and coking.
</P>
<P>
Existing iron and steel companies are encouraged to merge with
other industries, and measures will be taken to shut down small-
size manufacturers and eliminate outdated production lines and
equipment, the document says.
</P>
<P>
This year the country will reduce its steel output by 12
million tons, while the imports of rolled steel and steel billet
will not exceed 10 million tons, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
A leading group formed from the commission has been set up to
control the output of iron and steel in the country. Leading
officials of provincial-level governments have been put on charge
of the issue.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Logistics Reform in Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has approved
proposals jointly raised by six ministry-level central government
departments for accelerating logistics reform in higher learning
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The six departments are the Ministry of Education, the State
Development Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Construction, the People's Bank of China, and the
State Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
It will take three years to implement the reform that would
separate logistics departments from universities and let them
operate in accordance with the market law.
</P>
<P>
The reform will mainly be accomplished through restructuring
the existing logistics resources including materials, the labor
force and funding.
</P>
<P>
Companies specializing in logistics services will be
established for universities. Meanwhile, the government will
continue to finance the construction of facilities such as
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
The existing logistics system in universities has hampered the
development of the schools, the document says, stressing that the
reform is of great importance and will have far-reaching effects
for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The reform is a major part of the current reform of
universities, it says.

<HEADLINE> Retail, Insurance Top Profit Rise in Israel: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Retailers, insurance companies
and textile makers are estimated to have taken the lead in an
overall rise in earnings in the fourth quarter of 1999 among
companies listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), according
to a bank survey published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Financial reports for all of 1999 are expected to show improved
profitability in most industries, compared with 1998. This trend
will be especially prominent in the fourth quarter of 1999," Bank
Hapoalim, the biggest in Israel, said in the survey report.
</P>
<P>
The combined profit of the 165 companies publicly traded in TASE
rose to 1 billion shekels (about 243 million U.S. dollars) in the
July-September period of 1999, from 580 million shekels (about 140
million dollars) in the second quarter, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the improvement to rising demand both
domestic and overseas and various efficiency measures taken by the
companies in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the retail sector should have seen
increasing gains led by higher sales of non-food products and
private-label brands, which generate higher profits, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies' earnings should have been pumped up by
higher share prices and from a sharp drop in car thefts, the report
said, adding that a change in accounting methods will lead to
higher profits from new life insurance polices.
</P>
<P>
Textile manufacturers have enjoyed both higher export revenues
and improved profitability as they expanded into luxury products,
where prices were higher and competition was less sharp, according
to the survey. In addition, the sector would also have benefited
from lower cotton prices.
</P>
<P>
Although Israeli companies traded in the stock exchanges in New
York, the United States, have begun publishing their performance
results of the fourth quarter and the full year of 1999, most TASE-
listed firms will only start publishing their annual reports next
month.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Bombs Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes shelled
suspected guerrilla positions in al-Botum hills in southern Lebanon
on Tuesday, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Casualties in the attack are not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raid came a day after three Israeli soldiers were
killed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in the Israeli-
occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Hezbollah killed Akl Hachem, the second-highest
ranking official of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army(SLA), in
a roadside bomb attack in the region. Two Hezbollah guerrillas were
killed in a clash with SLA troops in southern Lebanon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces have also stepped up attacks on southern Lebanon
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in southern Lebanon in
1985 to protect its north from attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been leading a guerrilla war
to oust the 1,500 Israeli occupation troops and the 2,500 SLA
militiamen out of southern Lebanon.

<P>
KATHMANDU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai appointed Ram Chandra Poudel as deputy prime
minister, who is also in charge of the Ministry of Information and
Telecommunication in a cabinet reshuffle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Nepal, the new change also includes Finance

</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat will take over the post
of finance minister as well.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle has been much talked in recent days, but
the prime minister had much hesitation on making the decision
because of the differences within the ruling Nepali Congress.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet led by Bhattarai has been in power since May, 1999

SINGAPORE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Share prices ended mixed on
the Singapore Stock Market Tuesday on caution ahead of the U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) inched up 0.11 points

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Air Crash Probe Starts in Abidjan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways said here Tuesday
that the investigation into the crash of its Airbus A310 in the
sea off Cote d' Ivoire on Sunday night was under way.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan civil aviation officials and airline engineers arrived
in Abidjan Tuesday to join Airbus officials from Paris and Abidjan
civil aviation officials in the inquiry effort.
</P>
<P>
Abidjan officials were responsible for the investigation and
Kenyan personnel would facilitate their operation, Kenya Airways
technical director Steve Clarke told a press conference in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
There has been no clues to the cause of the crash, said Clarke.
 The plane's black box is still missing.
</P>
<P>
"The identification process of the passengers has not been
completed," said Clarke.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya ;Airways official said that the airline is making all
efforts to arrange a trip for relatives of the victims to Abidjan
and the government of Cote d'Ivoire has promised to provide
assistance in granting visas and travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Clarke did not specify the exact time for the trip, but he said
that the trip would start as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The plane plunged into the sea shortly after its take-off from
the Abidjan International Airport. It was heading for Nigerian
commercial hub Lagos.
</P>
<P>
So far, 10 survivors have been found. All of the 11 crew
members were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 168 passengers on Flight KQ431 were Nigerians.
Other travellers were from the United States, Canada, western
Europe, Kenya and other countries.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a Kenya Airways plane had crashed since
the airline was formed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The airline has 10 aircraft including three other Airbus-310s
serving 25 destinations in Africa, the Middle East, India and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Before the tragedy, the Kenyan national carrier was reportedly
considering gradually replacing the existing Airbus A310 fleet
with Boeing 767-300 aircraft.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Politicians Appeal to Hollywood Over Sex, Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
spearheading an initiative for the entertainment industry to rein
in its depiction of sex and violence, said Monday that Hollywood
risked losing artistic freedom if it failed to act responsibly.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't use your rights with some sense of responsibility
... there is a danger that those very rights will be endangered,"
the Connecticut Democrat told a forum sponsored by The Creative
Coalition, the entertainment industry's leading social and
political advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman launched the "Appeal to Hollywood" campaign last July
along with Republican Sen. Sam Brownbeck of Oklahoma with the aim
of getting the film, television, music and video game industries
to adopt voluntary codes curtailing depiction of sex and violence
in the media.
</P>
<P>
He told the forum, which was the first public meeting between
the "Appeal to Hollywood" backers and industry leaders, that "
behind us" there were more extreme, hard-line advocates, and said
the entertainment industry needed "to reduce the harmful
influences coming out of it."
</P>
<P>
But Lieberman, who earlier Monday met several top executives
along with Brownbeck, Creative Coalition president William Baldwin
and former Education Secretary and co-director of Empower America
William Bennett, urged the film industry to produce "more family-
friendly programming."
</P>
<P>
Baldwin criticized Hollywood films such as the "Scream" series
of slasher films which carry the restrictive "R" rating but are "
not only marketed to, but are basically made for, 14-year-olds,"
although he added that this was the case with only a small
minority of R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said the industry essentially agreed that more and
better adherence to early evening family-hour viewing was needed.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, President Bill Clinton proposed in his State of
the Union address that the film, television, music and video
industries implement a single content code to help parents screen
sex and violence in popular culture.

<HEADLINE> Ministerial Meeting on Mideast Opens in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright, was initiated by
Russia and the United States to restart and accelerate the
multilateral peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address
the meeting. Wu Tao, head of the Chinese delegation and Chinese
ambassador to Russia, is also present and will take the floor at
the session.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side is convinced that the ministerial meeting will
have a positive impact on the peace process in the region, Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister and presidential envoy to the Middle East
Vasily Sredin told the press before the beginning of today's
session.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the session will be held at the foreign
ministers' level, which gives special political weight to the
event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sredin said he is certain that participants, including the
foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia
and Canada as well as senior representatives from Palestine, Japan,
Switzerland and the European Union, will not limit themselves to
technical work and will exchange opinions on all aspects of the
Middle East settlement, in addition to planning joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Moscow meeting was convened at the wish of
"the majority of countries participating in the multilateral talks.
" Syria and Lebanon are not involved in current negotiations
because they consider it pointless to join the multilateral talks
before significant progress is made in the bilateral formats and
dialogue with Tel Aviv, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow understands their arguments, Sredin said, and Russia "
will continue working to increase, not to weaken the attention
paid to the Syrian and Lebanese positions."

</P>
<P>
-- Britain's most prolific serial killer for at least a century
was put under guard in Strangeways jail Monday night, leaving
police and his victims' families grappling with the thought that
he probably had killed more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union Monday night took the unprecedented step
of intervening in the formation of one of its member governments,
warning Austria it would take harsh measures against an
administration that includes the far-right Freedom party.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The campaign to promote British membership of the single
European currency was in disarray Monday night after the
government confirmed that it wanted to put the issue on hold until
well after the general election.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Crunch Time Comes for N. Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First
Minister David Trimble said Tuesday he wants to see the report on
the decommissioning of paramilitary arms before deciding his next
move.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments received the report prepared
by Canadian General John de Chastelain late on Monday night amid
growing fears it could plunge the peace process into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson is to meet Irish
Foreign Minister Brian Cowen in Dublin to discuss the report. The
general heads the International Commission on Decommissioning
which is overseeing the process of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster, Trimble said, whatever the report
contained, it did not alter the fact that republicans had
defaulted on their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement
signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Continuing in government with Sinn Fein linked organically to
a terrorist group that has not changed would be to destroy the
agreement- I'm not going to do that, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist leader said he would not resign before
seeing the contents of the report and said the suspension of
devolution was now an option for the Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein Chairman Mitchell McLaughlin said he understood a
majority of people favored decommissioning by the paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
"But if you were to ask those same people do they believe we
should destroy the political structures we built up now over guns
that are silent, then you would get a similarly high percentage
people saying no, no, that's not what we want at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the report will be discussed at Tuesday
afternoon's meeting in Dublin before it is handed over to the
Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labor
Party.
</P>
<P>
However, it could be Wednesday before it is made public.
</P>
<P>
If the report concludes that the IRA in particular has not
moved toward disarmament, the future of the power-sharing
executive could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein have said the contents should not threaten the new
political institutions, but unionists believe there is no
alternative if there has been no progress on the decommissioning
issue.
</P>
<P>
Trimble could be forced by his party's ruling council to honor
his November pledge to resign from the executive if General de
Chastelain has not reported the start of decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government could instead suspend the
executive and temporarily resume direct rule.
</P>
<P>
Reports said former U.S. senator George Mitchell, who chaired a
10-week review of progress in the Good Friday Agreement which led
to a peace deal in November, has been in contact with the key
players in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But it would appear that so far he is resisting any close
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Late on Monday night, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said
there was a "great deal of concern and a great deal of worry" over
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to debate on the report on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Hezbollah Victims Up in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- During operations across Turkey
against the outlawed radical Islamic terror group Hezbollah, police
interrogations resulted either in uncovering of more dead bodies or
arrest of more suspects.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a total of 47
bodies murdered by the group have been unearthed so far, among them
22 bodies were identified, Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that during the operations, 938 suspects of
the group were detained in 44 cities throughout the country. Of
these, 437 are facing trial and 221 formally charged.
</P>
<P>
In Ankara, operations led to capture of 27 suspects. Ankara
Public Security officials said that with the help of confessions of
27 arrested Hezbollah militants, they had uncovered every military,
political, financial and training cell of the group in the capital.
</P>
<P>
They added that three dead male bodies were found in a site of
the group in Ankara, but these bodies had not yet been identified.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, previously aiming to attack separatist Kurds and
their sympathizers in southeastern Turkey, reportedly sought to
turn politically secular but overwhelming Muslim Turkey into a
strict Islamic-ruled Sharia country by means of violence and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government has been blamed for having backed Hezbollah
in its campaign against the Kurdish Workers' Party rebels, who
sought autonomy in the poor southeastern area.
</P>
<P>
Now Turkey accused its neighbor Iran of supporting the group,
but the charge was refuted by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi who visited Turkey three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no evidence that proves Hezbollah in
Turkey has direct or indirect links with Iran or Iranian-backed
Hezbollah (Party of God) in Lebanon.

<P>
ANKARA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The Hezbollah suspects, who were on trial in Turkish State
Security Court, confessed on Monday to having committed murder,
kidnapping and blackmail, saying they aimed to set up a strict
Islamic-rule regime in secular but overwhelmingly Muslim-populated
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Turkish Security Force launched massive campaigns
against Hezbollah, a radical Islamic terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish National Security Council issued a harsh
statement on Monday, condemning the claims that there were links
between the government and the Hezbollah group as a plot to "
protect and hide the real criminals" who had masterminded the
Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
After the atrocities committed by the Hezbollah were unearthed,
some people, including the main opposition pro-Islamic Virtue
Party, reportedly accused the government of having used the
Hezbollah to combat the outlawed separatist Kurdish Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said, during the second
round of United Nations-sponsored Cyprus proximity talks starting
Monday in Geneva, that "if you believe that a solution will
materialize in the island under the dominance of Greek Cypriots,
you are dreaming."
</P>
<P>
This round of talks is scheduled to last 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Economic Growth to Slow Down Early This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth in Israel
in early 2000 is likely to slow down due to the one-time factors
that led to the surge in economic activity in the second half of
1999, the Treasury said in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We would warn against excessive optimism generated by the very
positive indicators published in the past half year and by progress
in the diplomatic process," the report added.
</P>
<P>
"The hoped-for economic turnaround is here and real, but it is
unreasonable to think that this fast rate of growth in economic
activity will continue over a very long period," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report came to the conclusion that Israel will see a lower
growth in economic activity in the first few months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report received some backing from the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) which said in a round-up of economic indicators
that there was continued strong growth in demand in the last two
months of 1999 but that was balanced by lower growth in exports and
industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The CBS said retail sales grew at an annualized 6-percent pace
in November but growth in merchandise exports was lowered to 6
percent in December from a pace of 11-32 percent from March to
December. The industrial production index grew 4 percent in
November, down from 6 percent in September-October.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate was held steady at 9.2 percent of the labor
force in November.
</P>
<P>
The treasury cited three one-time factors that led to a surge in
growth at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
One was the high spending, which was estimated at hundreds of
millions of U.S. dollars, in the correction of Y2K computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
Another was the fears that the Israeli currency shekel would
depreciate sharply toward the end of 1999, which caused a big jump
in imports of durable consumer goods, thereby boosting government
customs revenues.
</P>
<P>
The treasury also warned against extra spending in the future,
saying such spending would hurt renewed economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Urges Israel not to Build Nuclear- Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Greenpeace International
called on Israel Tuesday to abandon plans to build a nuclear
reactor for energy production and to focus its attention on
renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
"When considering developments made in the field of renewable
energy sources and comparing it to the demise of nuclear power
worldwide, the option of nuclear energy simply does not make
sense," Ofer Ben-Dov, Greenpeace Mediterranean campaigner in Israel
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The number of nuclear accidents worldwide and their devastating
impact should stand as a warning to decision-makers who risk
endangering the lives of others, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an energy conference held last week, Israeli
National Infrastructure Minister Eli Suissa said that he would
travel to France to learn about the French energy market and that
Israel is interested in building a nuclear reactor for energy
production as part of an overall plan to expand its electricity
production means.
</P>
<P>
"Alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and wave power
are the energy sources of the 21st century and it is about time
that Israel realizes this and gets into the game," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace, founded in 1971, aims to halt destruction of the
biosphere, to end nuclear testing and to defend the environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Peace negotiations with Syria will not be resumed if tensions
in southern Lebanon escalate any further, Israeli Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned Syria Monday following the
Hezbollah attack which killed three Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
While avoiding directly blaming Syria for the attack, Barak did
more than hint that Damascus could and should do more to rein in
Hezbollah, and that it was only a matter of will on the part of
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Three Israeli soldiers were killed Monday morning in a
Hezbollah missile attack in southern Lebanon. Three others were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Top military officers said the Iranian and Syrian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has escalated its anti-Israel activity
in recent weeks, and so "the Israeli Defense Force is now obligated
to act, and restrain it."
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak held an emergency cabinet
meeting Monday a few hours after three soldiers were killed in
southern Lebanon. There was heated debate in the meeting over the
army's request to respond harshly for the Hezbollah attack.
</P>
<P>
Senior military officers criticized some cabinet ministers
for "tying the hands of the army."
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin and Education Minister Yossi Sarid
were among those who were opposed to giving the army a free hand in
responding to the Hezbollah attack.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet rejected the army's demands for severe
retaliation against Hezbollah. Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said
the solution to the Lebanon quagmire is not renewed escalation, but
rather a military pullout from the so-called security zone which
Israel occupied in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After Monday's Hezbollah attack, the United States appealed to
Israel to maintain restraint.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Wins DGA Lifetime Achievement Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Steven Spielberg, whose
film legacy includes 1990's list-topping films Schindler's List
and Saving Private Ryan, will receive the Directors Guild of
America's (DGA) Lifetime Achievement Award, it was announced here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spielberg is a three-time winner of the guild's award for
outstanding directorial achievement in a feature film -- for "The
Color Purple" (1985), "Schindler's List" (1993) and "Saving
Private Ryan" (1998). The two latter films each earned Spielberg
an Oscar as best director.
</P>
<P>
The DGA's Lifetime Achievement Award will be presented to him
on March 11 during the 52nd annual DGA Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Spielberg is the 29th winner of the honor first presented in
1953 for an individual's "distinguished career achievement in
motion picture directing."
</P>
<P>
Francis Ford Coppola was the last recipient, getting his in
1998. Other past winners include Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Capra,
Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, and Stanley Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
"It is truly astonishing that Steven Spielberg, with so many
great films still ahead of him, is already such a perfect choice
for that ultimate directorial honor," DGA President Jack Shea said.
The prolific director isn't up for a competitive DGA award this
year; his last film was 1998's Saving Private Ryan.
</P>
<P>
Recipients of the DGA's lifetime honor, formerly known as the D.
W. Griffith Award, are chosen by a panel made up of current and
past presidents of the DGA. The guild voted just last year to
change the name of the award, because of movie pioneer Griffith's
racist elements in his film Birth of a Nation.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Capture Strategic Square in Central Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- After over a week of intense
battles, Russian federal troops have taken full control of Minutka
Square in central Grozny, capital of the rebellious republic of
Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The advance federal units fighting against militants in the
Oktyabrsky district of Grozny have established full and firm
control of Minutka square in the center of the city and captured
the building of a key auto station by Tuesday morning, the Itar-
Tass quoted the temporary press center of the Russian Combined
Force in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the square is seen as an important symbol of
strategic significance in the key and final phase of the underway
anti-terrorist military operation by Russia in the rebelling
province. It could be a significant boost to the campaign to take
the capital.
</P>
<P>
"After taking this square, I can say that we can totally
control the city," a Russian commander, Yevgeny Kurkarin, told the
Russian NTV (Independent TV station) channel. Minutka square is
adjacent to several of Grozny's main thoroughfares and could be a
staging point for a drive into the deeper center.
</P>
<P>
The Russian advance came under withering sniper fire from
rebels in battered high-rise buildings along the streets that
approach the square -- attacks that sometimes brought the Russian
drive to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Rebels elsewhere in the city have put up fierce resistance,
and the rebel command shows no sign of backing down. In the
northern part of the city, radicals have set up substantial
defenses in the old university complex, the Interfax news agency
said, citing Russian military sources.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting continues in the Leninsky and Central districts
of Grozny where Russian troops have rebuffed three attempts by
militants to break through federal cordons, said the Russian
temporary press center.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Tax Revenues Hit 62 Billion Dollars in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's tax revenues,
excluding local and customs taxes, hit 70.27 trillion won or 62.46
billion U.S. dollars in 1999, the highest in history of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The figure showed an increase of 10.6 percent over the
previous year, said the National Tax Service Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rise was led by indirect tax which grew 6.6 trillion won
due to increased spending in the private sector and the bullish
stock market.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from value-added tax reached 20.19 trillion won, up
28.6 percent over 1998 while exercise tax revenues jumped 21.5
percent to 2.68 trillion won.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, liquor tax increased 14.5 percent to 2.77 trillion
won and stock trading stock tax skyrocketed 458.2 percent to 1.35
trillion won.
</P>
<P>
South Korea enjoyed an 82.8 percent stock price rise due to
the faster-than-expected economic recovery, the highest among
Asian countries in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, direct tax revenues fell 1.97 trillion won due to
worsened corporate profitability, income tax breaks for low-income
earners and a drop in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Corporate tax revenues decreased 13.1 percent to 9.36 trillion
won and income tax declined 7.8 percent to 15.85 trillion won.
</P>
<P>
As a result, indirect tax income accounted for 50.3 percent of
national tax revenues, up 42.1 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The National Tax Service attributed the rise of indirect tax
to the tangible decrease in direct one resulting from the lagging
corporate performance in 1998.

BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The differences on human rights
between China and the European Union and the talks on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization between the two sides are
separate, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here today at the regular press conference
in response to a question about whether the recent EP resolution
on China's human rights would have any impact on the China-EU
talks on China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two issues are not directly related, adding
that the two sides have made substantive progress in the talks
concerning China's WTO bid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the human rights issue, he commented that China
hopes that the EU will conduct substantial dialogue with the
Chinese side on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and
stressed that confrontation will lead to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the two sides will continue the WTO talks in
Beijing this month and that China hopes for an early conclusion of
an agreement in this regard, and that it will be helpful to the
further development of Sino-European trade relationship.

<HEADLINE> China Urges U.S. Congress to Stop Anti-China Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China has demanded that the U.S.
Congress immediately stop their moves to infringe on China's
sovereignty by passing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a question on the anti-China
act at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
A few U.S. Congressmen have pledged their full support for the
approval of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, he said. "The
nature of their moves is to first broaden U.S. domestic laws so as
to form a legal basis for providing all manner of advanced
weaponry systems to Taiwan and building up and expanding direct
contacts between the armed forces of U.S. and Taiwan," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that their actions are also meant to interfere with
China's eventual reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that such attempts posed a "serious threat" to
the "relationship across the Taiwan Straits, the peace and
stability in Asia-Pacific region, and the Sino-U.S. ties."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people from the very beginning
expressed utter condemnation of and firm opposition to such acts,
Zhu said, adding that China has repeatedly lodged complaints with
the U.S. on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that China took note of the fact that the U.S.
government opposed approval of the act by Congress.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that if the U.S. government wants to avoid
irreparable damage to the Sino-U.S. relationship, it must adhere
to the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant commitments
made by the U.S. side, fully understand the deviousness of such
actions, and take swift and concrete measures to stop the approval
of the act.

<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua)-- China hopes that the United
States government will honor its commitment concerning China's
accession into the World Trade Organization, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question at today's press conference, Zhu said
that the Chinese side has noticed that many U.S. congressmen and
people from the business community have expressed their support
for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China has also taken note of the fact that the U.S. government
has stated clearly that it will try to grant the normal trade
status to China, he noted, adding that the Chinese side hopes that
the U.S. side will honor its commitment in real earnest and with
concrete steps.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreement on China's accession into the WTO
reached between China and the U.S. late last year is a "win-win"
deal that will be helpful to China's reform and opening-up, the
smooth development of Sino-U.S. trade relations and overall
bilateral ties, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Separation or Independence Absolutely Intolerable: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people will absolutely not tolerate the separation or independence
of Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said at a regular press conference that China's stance on
the issue has been clearly stated time and again.
</P>
<P>
He asked the press to "pay attention" to a speech made by
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen on January 20 at a meeting to
commemorate the fifth anniversary of the publication of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's eight-point speech on the reunification of
the motherland. In the speech, Qian once again made clear China's
guiding principles and policy on the complete reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The election in Taiwan is a local event, he said. "Whatever the
result and whoever wins the election, it should not lead to the
separation of Taiwan from the motherland or the independence of
Taiwan," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He said the post-election situation in Taiwan should be "
conducive to the development of relations across the Taiwan
Straits and the eventual peaceful reunification."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Taiwan issue is the internal affair of
China. Also, China has noticed that certain foreign forces have
taken "new and dangerous" steps to interfere in the Taiwan issue
and impede China's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
China is firmly opposed to the sale of advanced weaponry to
Taiwan by foreign forces, such as the sale or transfer of the
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system-related technologies.
</P>
<P>
"We hope all countries in the world will respect the feeling
and aspiration of the Chinese people, including those compatriots
in Taiwan, and not take any move that may lead to the tension
across the Taiwan Straits," he stressed.

AMMAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Criminal Court of Amman has
sentenced a 32-year-old man to 15 years in prison with temporary
hard labor for killing his brother over an argument on which TV
channel to watch, court sources said Tuesday.

dropped charges against him.

<P>
The verdict, handed down by Judges Ahmad Mahadin, Mohammad
Ibrahim and Zahi Shalabi, will be automatically reviewed by a
higher court within 30 days.
</P>

brother in the chest.
</P>

The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital where he recounted to
police before dying how his brother stabbed him over the quarrel.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks Loan Rescheduling from Saudi, UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has requested Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and some other non-Paris
Club creditors to reschedule their long term loans, a local report
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The private News Network International here quoted official
sources as saying that except China all other non-Paris Club
creditors are reluctant to roll over their debts for a long term.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement with the Paris Club, Pakistan is
going to finish its debt rescheduling process with Paris Club
members with rescheduling of 2.45 billion dollars with 14
countries already completed.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and some other countries have told
Pakistan that they are not the members of the Paris Club and they
will not accept the conditions the Paris Club countries were
enforcing.
</P>
<P>
These countries have objected to long-term loan rescheduling,
but agreed to roll over their debts for short term, said the
official sources.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Seeks More Sugar Export to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
pressing to have its sugar export quota to the European Union (EU)
market restored and increased, the East African Standard newspaper
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The discussion on the issue would form part of the fourth
EU-African, Caribbean and Pacific negotiations which will open in
Brussels Friday, Kenyan Planning Minister Gedion Ndambuki said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's export quota of 5,000 tons of sugar to the EU market
was withdrawn and spread to other sugar producing countries after
Kenya failed to meet the allotment.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is confident that the current sugar
production capacity, reportedly at 100,000 tons annually, is
enough to meet the demand on the EU market, Ndambuki was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that his government is negotiating with
EU and those in charge of the sugar protocol, not just to get back
the quota but increase it.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has retired about 2,400
wildlife workers and removed them from the government payroll,
according to the latest issue of the Financial Mail weekly.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken following the last November transformation
into Zambia Wildlife Authority of the Department of National Parks
and Wildlife Services.
</P>
<P>
The government has since constituted a 60-man task force to
work on the retirement benefits and help smoothen the
transformation, Tourism Ministry spokesman Gabriel Tembo was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
About half of the workers of the former Department of National
Parks and Wildlife Services would be retained by the new wildlife
authority, according to the tourism official.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the Zambian government will stop paying
the workers of the newly established wildlife authority and the
authority itself will pay them instead.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Completely Ban Wheat Importation: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government cannot
completely ban wheat importation because it could lead to possible
severe shortage, a senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Commerce Norman Chibamba said "a complete
ban on wheat may lead to shortages."
</P>
<P>
Zambia still needs to import wheat because the crop is mostly
grown by commercial farmers, the Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday quoted
the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In the area of wheat, we actually have few farmers growing the
crop," the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
But "the number will eventually grow and production would
increase," he added.

<HEADLINE> Gangsters Rob Bank in Kenya's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ten armed gangsters earlier
Monday morning robbed more than 140,000 U.S. dollars and injured
employees in a bank in Kenya's capital Nairobi, local media said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The robbers, armed with guns, struck between 6 and 6:30 a.m.
and forced their way through the back entrance of the Bank of
India in downtown Nairobi, the Daily Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Bank manager K. Kalyanaramau said the robbers roughed him up
before ordering him to produce the keys to the bank's vaults and
made away with over 140,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The robbers beat up the guards at the back entrance before
forcing them to take off their uniforms which they then took and
wore, a guard said.
</P>
<P>
The employees said they suspected nothing because it was normal
for guards to be shuffled within the bank offices, adding that
the robbers ordered them to lie on the floor as they entered the
bank.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
ordered striking doctors in the country's biggest hospital to
resume their work immediately or face dismissal, the Zambia Daily
Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister David Mpamba said he has a report that about 25
out of 39 senior doctors have started trooping back for work since
they lost their case in the High Court last week.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the rest to resume work immediately, saying
that those who do not want to go for work can stay and be fired.
</P>
<P>
Junior doctors in University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka went
on strike on December 21 last year, demanding an increase of
salaries and allowances and protesting against lack of essential
drugs, medical and surgical supplies.
</P>
<P>
On January 4, the striking doctors were dismissed and three
days later the senior went on a five-day break but refused to
resume work until the fired junior doctors are reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in other parts of the southern African country have
also been affected badly by similar actions of the doctors there.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea posted a trade
deficit of 400 million U.S. dollars in January, putting an end to
the 26-month surplus since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry said the trade
deficit came from seasonal reasons.
</P>
<P>
South Korean exports amounted to 12.23 billion U.S. dollars in
January, up 32.1 percent from the same period last year while
imports soared 46.3 percent to 12.63 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said the nation's trade will not suffer
structural deficit and that a trade surplus will begin to appear
this month.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the country will enjoy a trade surplus of
between 1 and 1.5 billion dollars in the first season this year.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has set a trade surplus target of
12 billion dollars for this year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade volume stood at 246 billion dollars in 1999,
with exports hitting 144.2 billion dollars and imports 119.7
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves rose to 76.79 billion U.S. dollars at the end of January,
up 2.74 billion over last year, said the Bank of Korea Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the foreign exchange reserves came from the
repayment of foreign currency deposits by domestic banks and
financial institutions to the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange reserves stood at four billion
U.S. dollars when Seoul borrowed 58 billion U.S. dollars from the
International Monetary Fund in December 1997 after the nation was
gripped by a financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign exchange reserves increased to 48.51
billion U.S. dollars in December 1998 and then to 74.05 billion at
the end of last year along with the economic recovery in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the South Korean government announced that it will
raise its foreign exchange reserves to 90 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate hit a
record high of 4.7 percent in 1999, up 0.6 percentage point from
the previous record in 1998, the Management and Coordination
Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate in 1999 started at 4.4 percent in January,
peaking at 4.9 percent in June and July, a record high for any
single month since 1953, when the Japanese agency started
compiling jobless data.
</P>
<P>
For last December alone, the jobless rate came to 4.6 percent,
up 0.1 percentage point from the previous month for the first rise
in half a year.
</P>
<P>
The average number of unemployed workers in the year exceeded
three million for the first time, rising to 3.17 million, up 380,
000 over 1998, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The number of employed averaged 64.62 million, down 520,000
from the previous year for the second straight year of decline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Ministry said in a separate report that
the ratio of job offers to job seekers was 0.48 in 1999, or 48
jobs for every 100 job seekers.
</P>
<P>
The ratio is the lowest since 1963, when the ministry started
compiling the data under the current statistical formula.
</P>
<P>
Following the release of the jobless data, Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa urged vigilance about the matter, saying
the government should continue to guard against any further
worsening of the job situation.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Works out New Strategy for Fishery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China's expected entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) may pose challenges to fishery in
Jiangsu, but the province is mapping out a strategy to help the
industry survive.
</P>
<P>
The eastern province, with a coastline of more than 1,000
kilometers and a web of rivers and lakes, is a major producer of
aquatics in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the economically-developed province turned out 2.97
million tons of aquatic products, earning 200 million U.S. dollars
from more than seven tons of exports. More than 300 joint ventures,
with a total investment of 300 million U.S. dollars, are involved
in the fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
"WTO may threaten us after foreign aquatic products flow into
the Chinese market, but may at the same time bring us huge
business opportunities," said Li Guoping, head of the provincial
Aquatics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Li said after China joins the WTO, more Chinese aquatic
products could enter the international market as well. "What we
should do is produce aquatics needed by foreigners, especially
Americans and Europeans," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said the province plans to establish a number of
export-oriented fishery development bases in the Taihu Lake, Lixia
River and coastal areas. International aquatics producing
standards and state-of-the-art production and processing
technologies will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
"We will increase exports of clams, laver, river crabs, prawns
and lobsters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the province will also take part in ocean fishing to
compete with foreign rivals, hoping to send 110 oceangoing boats
by 2005, compared with 45 this year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province plans to export over eight tons of
aquatics with exports worth 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bureau chief said, the government will take
measures to encourage foreign businessmen to set up more joint
ventures and put more investment in the fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the province plans to attract 500 million U.S. dollars
for the industry, 200 million more than 1999's figure, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Poverty-Relief Fund by 1 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Central Government
will increase its poverty-relief fund by one billion yuan this
year to meet its goal of wiping out rural poverty by the end of
2000, an official with the State Council's leading aid-the-poor
group said today.
</P>
<P>
The fund,added to the planned investment for the year,will put
the Central Government's total spending on poverty elimination at
nearly 26 billion yuan (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The added money will go to relocating poor farmers and the
poverty-relief efforts in remote areas as well as in regions
inhabited by ethnic minorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
China launched an ambitious plan in 1994 to help its then 80
million needy farmers out of poverty by the end of 2000; since
then, 46 million poor farmers have been helped to better lives.
</P>
<P>
To hit the target, China has to provide adequate food and
clothing for another 10 million needy farmers by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
"The task is extremely difficult," the official said, "as most
of the remaining poor farmers live in remote regions and outlying
mountainous areas."
</P>
<P>
To raise more funding for poverty relief, the Central
Government has asked local governments to allocate funds
equivalent to at least 30 percent of the state input.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics indicate that last year's spending by local
governments on poverty relief rose by 1.78 billion yuan, up 20
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the efficiency of the poverty-relief fund
distribution, the government will stick to the principle of
targeting individual villages and families, supporting them to
improve basic production conditions and investing in projects that
meet market demand.

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Entry A Strategic Choice for Globalization: People's Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China's accession into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is a strategic choice to ensure the
country's participation in future international cooperation,
according to a commentary carried by today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Headlined "Merge in the Tides of Economic Globalization," the
front-page editorial run by China's leading newspaper claimed that
China's overall economic strength has seen remarkable improvement
thanks to 20 years of fast-paced development. "China now is
capable of participating in international competition in many
fields," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade volume expanded 16-fold during the past
20 years, with its world rank up from 32nd to 10th. Direct foreign
capital used by China also increased from less than 2 billion U.S.
dollars in the early 1980s to the current 40 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"China's active participation in global cooperation has spurred
innovation in its domestic industries, created an abundance of new
jobs, improved efficiency of economic operation, and strengthened
the overall economic power, enabling the country to play an even
more important role in the world political and economic affairs,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The multi-lateral trade system not only meets the requirements
of economic globalization, but also pushes forward the
globalization process. "The unbiased, more free, foreseeable and
competition-encouraged principles observed by the multi-lateral
trade system set the direction for the development of global trade,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary indicated that a stable international economic
environment is necessary if China is to benefit from the economic
globalization. However, it emphasized, China is still blocked out
of such a system.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing country, China has to depend
largely on bilateral consultation and collaboration to adjust its
external foreign trade and economic relations. Time and again
Chinese enterprises and commodities have met with "prejudiced and
unfair treatment" when entering the international market, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
Even under the bilateral agreement, in which China and its
major trade partners grant each other most-favored trading status,
normal trade relations are sometimes adversely affected by
political factors.

<TEXT>
<P>
A new round of WTO negotiations is approaching. Given that
China, the largest developing country, cannot participate in the
talks, it can only wait for the outcome of the future negotiations
and therefore is at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
China can enjoy the benefits of trade liberalization already
resulting from the development of the multi-lateral trade system.
In the meantime, it should also "undertake the obligations of the
open market," the article stressed, describing this as "a
reflection of the balance of rights and obligations."
</P>
<P>
However, China's need to make certain reforms in accordance
with international practices after the WTO entry. The reforms
generally correspond with China's aim of economic restructuring.
Such reforms will sharpen the government's edge to manage and
adjust the economy, it said. Also, the reforms will hone the
competitive edge of Chinese enterprises, winning advantages for
China amidst acute global competition.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental guarantee to meet the challenges of economic
globalization requires China to deepen reform, adjust structure
and improve the competitiveness of its enterprises and commodities,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
Only by such combined efforts can China be a winner in the
economic globalization, the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urged Not to Create More Disturbance over Chinese Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China cannot accept the
Philippines attempt to "distort facts and blur the distinction
between right and wrong" by claiming its sovereignty over a
Chinese island, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a
regular press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine side recently disregarded China's sovereignty
over Huangyan Island and randomly interfered in the normal fishing
operation of Chinese seamen. "Their moves even developed to
forcefully boarding Chinese ships for checkups and robbing them of
their property," Zhu told the press.
</P>
<P>
Certain Filipino senior officials also made irresponsible
comments, claiming the Chinese ships infringed upon the so-called
sovereignty of the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to such acts, Zhu said that China's Foreign
Ministry has sent two notes to the Philippine embassy in China, in
which the Chinese expressed deep concern over recent affairs and
lodged protests over the illegal acts taken by the Philippines,
according the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterated that Huangyan Island is an integral part of the
Chinese territory. "It is a fact universally acknowledged by the
international community," he stated.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines have no sovereignty or any sovereign rights
over Huangyan Island and its surrounding water," he stressed,
adding that the country has also "no administrative right" over
the water.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side urged the Philippine side to respect the
sovereignty of China and the basic norms of the international laws,
observe the understanding and consensus already reached by both
sides, and stop any illegal acts that encroach on China's
sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
They should not create any new disturbances in the region, he
warned.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Launch Mass Cleanup Drive for Olympic Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of nearly 50 newspapers
and enterprises in Beijing will jointly launch a mass
environmental-cleanup campaign to tackle the pollution problem in
the capital city and increase its chances to host the 2008
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The Green Campaign for the Olympics," to be initiated tomorrow,
first will galvanize the public by gathering 100,000 signatures
from Beijing residents pledging to keep their city clean, said Guo
Jinglong, one of the organizers for the non-governmental campaign.
</P>
<P>
Two high-level academic forums will be held to discuss Beijing'
s environment, Olympic bidding and the sustainable growth of China
's sports industry, according to the China Sports News, the chief
sponsor of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided last year
that potential host cities for the games must meet environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
When making the decision to apply for the chance to host the
2008 Olympic Games, Beijing last year launched 18 urgent air
pollution control measures and another 28 measures for improving
air quality, and banned the use of high-sulphur coal in the city
proper.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government last year also set aside 46 billion
yuan to substantially improve the air quality of Beijing in the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
"All this indicates the determination of the government to win
the bid, but it still needs support from the general public. That
is why we are here," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
On April 7, 1999, the Beijing Olympic Bid Committee formally
presented Beijing's bidding report to Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the (IOC) at IOC's Lausanne-based headquarters.
Beijing's rivals now include Osaka, Paris, Toronto, Istanbul,
Seville, Buenos Aires, and others.

<HEADLINE> Labor, Economy, Housing Remain Top Concerns in HK: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Labor, economy and housing
related problems have remained the top three problems in Hong Kong,
according to the latest bimonthly telephone opinion survey
conducted by the Home Affairs Bureau (HAB) of Hong Kong in January
this year.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the results Tuesday, an HAB spokesman said: "The
percentages of those who mentioned the problems which affected
them most have also remained relatively unchanged."
</P>
<P>
Labor-related problems were mentioned by 51 percent of the
respondents, up slightly from the 47 percent recorded in the
November survey. Difficulty in finding jobs, layoffs and
underemployment were the reasons given by 95 percent of them,
whereas low wages and pay cuts were mentioned by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economy-related problems, mentioned by 42 percent of the 1,684
interviewees, ranked second again as in the last survey. Among
them, 52 percent of them showed concern about the job market while
42 percent expressed concern about the "economic depression or
weak economy."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one percent of the respondents were bothered most by
housing-related problems. Among them, 27 percent were worried
about the high price of private housing.
</P>
<P>
Another significant finding is that 44 percent of the
respondents were satisfied with the present situation, and 36
percent expected the situation to improve in the next 12 months.
The figures were down from the 49 percent and 39 percent of the
previous survey.
</P>
<P>
The same 67 percent of respondents expressed confidence that
Hong Kong would continue to be prosperous and stable.
</P>
<P>
The survey is the 86th in the series which began in January
1983. It was carried out by telephone interviews with respondents,
aged 15 to 64, chosen at random from the residential telephone
directories.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Involved in Atrocities in  E.Timor: Rights Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- At least six Indonesian
Military (TNI) officers including former TNI chief Gen. Wiranto
were believed to have been involved in human rights abuse in East
Timor, which left thousands of civilians of a pro-independence
group dead, the head of the National Commission on Human Rights (
Komnas HAM) said.
</P>
<P>
Announcing an investigatory report on human rights abuse in the
breakaway territory, Djoko Soegianto said that after the
commission received the report from the Commission of Inquiry on
Human Rights Violations in East Timor (KPP HAM), he concluded that
at least 33 people including TNI personnel and civil officers were
believed to be responsible for atrocities and genocide acts as
well as sexual slavery and rape in East Timor during January-
October 1999.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference late on Monday that in East Timor,
there was a crime against humanity and Gen. Wiranto had to be
responsible for that.
</P>
<P>
"The Komnas HAM demands the Attorney General Office launch a
further investigation and bring to justice those responsible for
such a crime," Soegianto said.
</P>
<P>
He said the crime against humanity which took place in East
Timor had been conducted systematically and in a well-prepared way,
involving the pro-integration camp, and backed or organized by TNI
as well as Indonesian Police (Polri).
</P>
<P>
He urged the Indonesian government and the House of
Representatives (DPR) to establish a human rights tribunal soon to
bring to justice the "human rights violators" in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KPP HAM Chairman Albert Hasibuan said that besides
Gen. Wiranto, there were five other TNI officials involved in such
a crime.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said his
office would launch a comprehensive investigation into those
believed to be involved in human rights abuse in East Timor after
receiving the report from the commission.
</P>
<P>
"We will launch an investigation as soon as possible. We will
soon establish a coordinating investigation team to follow up the
report," he said, without specifying when the investigation will
start and end.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Wiranto, the coordinating minister for Politics and
Security under President Abdurrahman Wahid's administration, is
likely to be the only top ranking TNI official to face a human
rights tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the TNI headquarters had denied its soldiers had
committed atrocities and genocide acts in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"No clear evidence was found to show that TNI soldiers and
members of police were involved in acts of violence that resulted
in the death of thousands of people," TNI said in a journal
released on January 28.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- At least five Ugandans are
feared to have perished in the Kenya Airways plane crash off the
Atlantic Ocean shore of Cote d'Ivoire on Sunday night, the New
Vision newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni Monday sent a message of
condolences to his Kenyan counterpart Daniel arap Moi, extending
his sympathy to the victims on the crashed plane.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan plane, KQ431 flight, carrying 179 people altogether,
plunged into the sea soon after its take-off in Abidjan. It was
heading for Nigerian commercial hub Lagos.
</P>
<P>
So far, 10 people have survived the tragedy and rescue teams
are still searching for possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
The plane's black box is missing and the cause of the crash is
not known yet.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an 18-member Ugandan delegation, who had
planned to embark on the ill-fated plane, escaped the crash by
switching to another flight.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, on their way to Ghanaian capital Accra for a
study tour, left Uganda's Entebbe International Airport on the
Kenyan plane via Nairobi to Lagos where they were expected to
catch a connecting flight to Accra.
</P>
<P>
However, the ill-fated plane could not land at Lagos because of
bad weather and the flight was re-routed to Abidjan where the
Ugandans decided to board a Ghana Airways plane to Accra instead
of returning on the Kenyan aircraft to Lagos for their connecting
flight to Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Committed to Signing SADC Trade Protocol: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is committed to signing
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) trade protocol,
Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry William
Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
SADC member countries will start implementing the trade
protocol but there are specific issues on rules of origin in
sugar, textiles, leather and motor spares which need to be
resolved, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has sent a delegation of experts to a SADC expert
meeting in Mauritius to try to resolve the stalemate over the
ratification of the trade protocol which seeks to create a free
trade area, the Financial Mail weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
Harrington hoped the meeting will resolve the outstanding
issues. But Zambia does not want to ratify the agreement without
ironing out these problems, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the ministry Austin Sichinga also said
that Zambia cannot ratify the agreement at this stage because it
will not be in the interest of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
SADC Acting Executive Secretary Preg Ramsamy announced recently
that the long-waited SADC free trade protocol will be implemented
in April this year to accelerate the economic development in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed in July 1999, a free trade
area should be established before 2004, and by 2008 tariff imposed
on non-sensitive commodities should be removed between the SADC
member states.
</P>
<P>
The pact has been signed and ratified by 10 countries
--Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia,Tanzania, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
So far, Angola and Zambia have not ratified the pact yet, while
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Seychelles are expected
to automatically accede to it when it is implemented.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that before being implemented, the pact has to be
signed and ratified by a two-thirds majority of SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the two-thirds majority requirement has been met, the
agreement will be binding on all 14 member states, no matter
Angola and Zambia ratify it or not, Ramsamy said.

<HEADLINE> Flower Production Down Following Snow in Kunming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The unexpected snow which fell
on this capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province on Sunday has
reduced the city's flower output and is expected to affect the
flower markets across the country.
</P>
<P>
Puhong, head of Dounan Flower Production Base, the largest
wholesale market in the "spring city", told Xinhua that their
production has been reduced sharply due to the snow, the first and
heaviest in the city since 1983.
</P>
<P>
"Sunday's snow and the recent frost have reduced greatly our
flower production and we almost stopped our business on Monday,"
he grumbled.
</P>
<P>
Fewer people were seen today in the market which usually draws
thousands of customers and retailers from across the country.
</P>
<P>
Flower prices soared following the snow and the reduction in
flower numbers in major bases.
</P>
<P>
"Since Sunday, prices for some kinds of flowers have doubled or
tripled, even 10 times higher than usual," said Liao Jiaming,
manager of a downtown flower shop.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to the snow and the drop in output,
the upcoming Spring Festival holiday period has also increased the
demand for flowers, thus pushing up the prices.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the flower prices will continue to rise and flower
output to drop because frost usually follows a snow.
</P>
<P>
As an important flower production and wholesale center in China,
Kunming sells its flowers to more than 20 provinces and cities
nation-wide.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom, China's largest
telecommunications company, opened a new International Direct
Dialing (IDD) service nationwide today.
</P>
<P>
The new service, "Yitong," uses Internet Protocol (IP)
technology and is operated on an independent telephone system
composed of special international telephone lines. The two
advantages provide faster connection speed and better
communication quality than IP service with lower charges than
ordinary IDD service.
</P>
<P>
With approval by the Ministry of Information Industry, China
Telecom began trial application of the service last May in a
number of large cities in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou. The service received an enthusiastic response from
local consumers.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing demand of Chinese consumers nationwide,
China Telecom decided to promote the service in all cities in
China. Customers only need to buy a Yitong Card to be eligible for
the service.
</P>
<P>
From February 1 to March 20, Yitong will reduce charges for
international calls from China to foreign countries and to Hong
Kong, Taiwan and Macao.

BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan today signed an
official document here on a 1.23-billion-yen aid contribution from
the Japanese government to help Chinese farmers increase grain
production.
</P>

Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), and Japanese Ambassador

The financial aid program provides chemical fertilizer,
pesticide and agricultural machinery for farmers in China's Hubei,
Hunan, Hebei and Anhui provinces, all located in China's
underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
The program will help accelerate China's rejuvenation of its
central and western areas, which have been lagging far behind the
nation's better cultivated areas in economic development. The
Chinese government has put a premium on boosting local economy in
these central and western regions.

<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- January will go on record as
Beijing's coldest month in 23 years, with the average daily
temperature hovering at minus-6.7 degrees centigrade and the
lowest at minus-14.9 degrees.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics from Beijing Meteorological
Bureau, Beijing has been blasted three times since mid-December by
strong cold air currents from Siberia, bringing about sub-zero
temperatures as low as minus-14.9 degrees centigrade and rarely-
seen snow.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zhenguo, a meteorologist with China's National Climate
Center, said today that the La Nina phenomenon is the culprit
behind the bitter cold in Beijing and other part of northern China.
</P>
<P>
He said the current La Nina occurrence started in the fall of
1998, when the warm waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean turned
cold, triggering atmospheric abnormalities in Asia and frequent
cold currents from Siberia, where a cold air mass broke up and
moved south.
</P>
<P>
The cold winds met with warm, wet southeasterly currents in
northern China, resulting in an abrupt drop in temperature, snow
in the north and other parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Banks Earning Robust Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's big banks are
continuing to earn robust returns on their investments, a study by
local Massey University showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Five of the big banks, whose business is predominantly retail
banking, achieved the international benchmark return on assets of
one percent in the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
They were Australia-New Zealand Bank (ANZ), Bank of New Zealand
(BNZ), WestpacTrust, National Bank and Taranaki Savings Bank. The
only big bank that did not reach a one percent return on assets
was the ASB.
</P>
<P>
The study, by banking specialist David Tripe, said profits have
now been above the one percent level for four successive quarters.
</P>
<P>
The six banks account for 88 percent of the banking system's
assets as at September 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income is the most important single source of
income as the primary focus is lending for New Zealand banks.
Other non-interest income is considerably smaller.
</P>
<P>
WestpacTrust has the highest level of net interest income
relative to its assets and the BNZ has the lowest.
</P>
<P>
But the BNZ was the most profitable bank for the third quarter
measured by return on assets and return on equity.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Argues Against Japan's Stance on Whaling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of
Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff said here Tuesday that New
Zealand and Japan will continue to have "different viewpoints on
the issue of Whaling."
</P>
<P>
He was commenting in response to a letter issued Monday by
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono.
</P>
<P>
"The New Zealand Government and public remain unconvinced that
Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, undertaken
in the name of scientific research, is necessary," Goff said in a
media release.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it involves the killing of large numbers of
minke whales in a part of the globe, designated as a sanctuary, is
distressing to many people in New Zealand and in the wider world
community.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand has consistently argued against lethal means of
scientific whaling. With modern techniques all the information
needed for the management and conservation of whales can in our
view be obtained by non-lethal methods," the New Zealand minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our view on whaling is absolutely clear. New Zealand will
continue to promote an end to the hunting of whales within the
International Whaling Commission," he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Z. Has 3,825,700 Residents at End of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's resident
population was estimated to have been 3,825,700 at December 31,
1999, Deputy Government Statistician Dianne Macaskill said Tuesday
when releasing the latest population estimates.
</P>
<P>
During 1999, New Zealand's population grew by an estimated 20,
200 or 0.5 percent, Macaskill said.
</P>
<P>
Permanent and long-term departures exceeded arrivals by 9,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
The current population of the country is 4.8 times larger than
the estimated population of 796,400 at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
One hundred years ago, half the population was below 23 years
of age. Men outnumbered women, as the sex ratio was 90 women for
every 100 men.
</P>
<P>
Now, New Zealand becomes a mature country demographically with
an aging population, a median age of 34.1 years, and a sex ratio
favoring women at 103 women to 100 men.
</P>
<P>
At December 31, 1999, there were an estimated 876,000 children
under 15 years, and 448,000 people aged 65 years and over.
Respectively, they made up 22.9 and 11.7 percent of New Zealand
residents, compared with 34 and four percent in 1901.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the last century, children outnumbered elderly
by eight to one but now the ratio is about two to one.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Give Guarantee of Legal Certainty to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will give a legal
certainty guaranty to those who invested in the country, said Vice
President Megawati Soekarnoputeri when opening the Ninth CGI (
Consultatives Group on Indonesia ) meeting here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need to convince investors that the guarantee of legal
certainty exists which will protect their contracts and that
methods of settling disputes in a just fashion prevail should
disputes arise," she added.
</P>
<P>
At the CGI meeting under the coordination of the World Bank,
Indonesia is expected to get funds amounting to 4.2 billion U.S.
dollars from donors to meet the deficit of the state budget of the
2000 fiscal year 2000 starting in April.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first ever held in the country since
president Abdurrahman Wahid took office in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also said that Indonesia needs help from
donor countries and international community to overcome the
economic problems faced by the country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that through the discussions in the CGI sessions to be
started today, you will pay attention to programs of ours," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that Indonesia's economic growth should enhance the
quality of living of all the Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
"It shall not be enjoyed by only a small number of the people.
For that purpose we will pay more attention to the development
programs which will create job opportunities for the people at
large," she said.
</P>
<P>
Megawati said that Indonesia would continue to direct a
globally oriented economy in accordance with the advancement of
technology as well as the enhancement of its abilities and
competitiveness based on its comparative advantages.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth CGI Meeting are being attended by 168 participants
who represent 20 donor countries and 14 international institutions.
The meeting will continue through Wednesday, at which the donors
would make commitment to the country's loan disbursement.
</P>

with which the donors had shown concern.

<HEADLINE> India's Fiscal Deficit Surges in 1st 3 Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- India's fiscal deficit has
reached 670.82 billion rupees (15.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the
first three quarters of the 1999-2000 fiscal year, or April 1 to
December 31 of 1999, up by nearly 25 percent over the same period
of the previous fiscal year, sources with the Ministry of Finance
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This figure indicated that the Indian government has already
used up more than 80 percent of the total budgeted fiscal deficit
for the full year, which is 799.55 billion rupees (18.59 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Financial experts here estimate that with three more months to
go, the fiscal deficit might reach 850 billion to 900 billion
rupees (19.76 billion to 20.93 billion dollars) at the end of the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit for comparative purposes during the April-
December period of 1998 was 538.56 billion rupees (12.52 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the Financial Ministry sources, the main reasons
for the increase of the fiscal deficit are expenditure overruns on
account of post-budgetary commitments, such as the Kargil conflict,
general elections and the increase in dearness allowance for
government employees and pensioners.
</P>
<P>
The total receipts and total expenditure for the Indian
government during the first three quarters of the 1999-2000 fiscal
year were 1.23178 trillion and 1.90260 trillion rupees (28.64
billion and 44.24 billion dollars) respectively.

<HEADLINE> Bobby Jackson Lifts T'Wolves Past Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Jackson, filling in
for injured point guard Terrell Brandon, posted his first career
triple-double and taught flashy Sacramento Kings playmaker Jason
Williams a lesson on Monday in their Minneapolis home court.
</P>
<P>
While Brandon nursed a sprained left ankle, Jackson took
Williams to school, collecting 17 points, 11 rebounds and 12
assists to lead the red-hot Minnesota Timberwolves to a 105-90
rout of the Kings.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't planning on getting a triple-double when I started
tonight," Jackson said. "I just wanted to go out and play my game,
get everyone involved and try to contain Jason Williams."
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a third-year player out of Minnesota, was 7-of-11
from the field, made 3-of-4 free throws and had two steals while
playing 43 minutes. More importantly, he held Williams to a season-
low two points in 25 minutes as the Timberwolves coasted to their
seventh win in eight games.
</P>
<P>
"It's nice when your backup point guard comes in and gets a
triple-double," Minnesota coach Flip Saunders said. "He has really
come on and I'm very impressed. He knows the offense and he's more
comfortable running things now. He's made a lot of progress and
adjusted well."
</P>
<P>
Superstar forward Kevin Garnett had 31 points and 12 rebounds
for Minnesota. "KG was great," Saunders said. "We've come to
expect what he does as the norm. I've always said the two best
players in our conference are Kevin Garnett and Chris Webber."
</P>
<P>
Webber led seven players in double figures with 14 points for
the Kings, who suffered their third loss in four games and slipped
to 2-3 on an eight-game, 16-day road trip.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to lose," Webber said. "Give KG credit, along
with his team. They deserved to win. It's a testament to coach
Saunders. He has them playing really well."
</P>
<P>
In Miami, playing without leading scorer Grant Hill, the
Detroit Pistons fell behind in the second quarter and were not
competitive thereafter as they suffered their seventh loss in
eight games, 104-82 to the Heat.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who returned from a five-game absence on Saturday and
scored 12 points to help the Pistons edge Philadelphia, was unable
to dress for Monday's contest due to a hip contusion.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you go up against a team like Miami without a loaded
gun, you're going to lose," Detroit guard Michael Curry said.
</P>
<P>
Jamal Mashburn scored 23 points and Alonzo Mourning added 20
for the Heat.
</P>
<P>
In Orlando, Penny Hardaway made a triumphant return in his
first game against his former team, scoring 21 points as the
Phoenix Suns nearly blew a big second-half lead before holding on
for a 117-113 victory over the Magic.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway, who was booed throughout, spent his first six seasons
with the Magic before forcing a trade with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway played 40 minutes, connecting on 5-of-14 shots from
the field and 11-of-14 free-throw attempts while adding four
assists and four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Cliff Robinson scored 22 of his 28 points in the second half
for Phoenix, which led by as many as 25 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Jason Kidd collected 20 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists
for the Suns, who concluded a 2-3 road trip.
</P>
<P>
Tariq Abdul-Wahad scored 19 points and Darrell Armstrong had 14
and eight assists for Orlando, which lost for only the second time
in its last six games.
</P>
<P>
In Denver, George McCloud hit a key 3-pointer and Nick Van Exel
made two free throws in the final 25 seconds, lifting the Nuggets
to an 83-80 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
Allen Iverson scored 29 points for the Sixers, who have lost
four of their last five, including the first two on a four-game
road trip.
</P>
<P>
In Vancouver, Glenn Robinson scored 11 of his 25 points in the
fourth quarter as the Milwaukee Bucks dominated the final period
to overtake the Grizzlies, 92-87.
</P>
<P>
Robinson was 10-of-19 from the field, made all five of his free
throws, grabbed six rebounds and handed out three assists for the
Bucks, who posted their third win in four games.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 29 members from three
anti-government armed groups surrendered to the Myanmar government
last December, the New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper said the members of the Kayin National
Union (KNU), All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the
New Mon State Party (NMSP) "exchanged arms for peace" at coastal,
southern and triangle region command areas respectively.
</P>
<P>
They brought along 69 rounds of ammunitions and some launchers,
shells and grenades.
</P>
<P>
The ABSDF is an anti-government students' armed organization
operating on the Myanmar-Thai border, while the NMSP was a similar
Mon ethnic armed organization which made peace with the government
in June 1995, and the newly surrendered were its remnant members.
</P>
<P>
The KNU has been operating for over five decades since the
early days of the country's independence and has not made peace
yet with the government although four rounds of peace talks have
been held between the two sides since December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as
the Mong Tai Army, led by former drug warlord Khun Sa, have made
peace with the government with cease-fire agreements reached
between them.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Exports Dropped by 0.73 Pct Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's exports and imports
in 1999 dropped by 0.73 percent and 12.51 percent to 48.49 billion
U.S. dollars and 23.92 billion dollars respectively as compared
with the previous year, the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) said.
</P>
<P>
While oil and gas exports in 1999 rose by 24 percent to 9.76
billion dollars, non-oil and non-gas exports dropped by 5.48
percent to 38.73 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase in crude oil exports to 4.52 billion dollars from
3.35 billion dollars contributed a lot to the country's foreign
exchange coffers last year, BPS Chief Sugito Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the oil price boom in the world market as the main
reason for the increase in crude oil's contribution to the country
's total export.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil was priced at an average of 12.5 dollars per barrel
throughout 1998 but it rose to 17.52 dollars per barrel last year.
</P>
<P>
"Even in December 1999 alone, the oil price reached a record
high of 24.02 dollars per barrel," Sugito was quoted by Antara
News Agency Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said non-oil and non-gas exports in 1999 accounted for 79.87
percent of the total exports, while the oil and gas exports
represented 20.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade throughout last year recorded a surplus of
24.57 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said the drop in non-oil and non-gas imports lowered the
country's total imports last year.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil and non-gas imports dropped by 17.71 percent to 20.31
billion dollars last year, while the oil and gas imports rose by
35.78 percent to 3.61 billion dollars, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Tourist Arrivals Up 4.13 Pct Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 3.92 million foreign
tourists visited Indonesia last year, a 4.13 percent increase over
1998, according to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS).
</P>
<P>
BPS Chief Sugito Suwito said the tense political situation,
social unrest and riots in several parts of the country had a
counter-productive effect on the number of tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the riots that affected Bali in October
last year had an adverse effect on the number of tourist arrivals
to the world-renowned tourist resort for three consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the number of tourist arrivals in Indonesia in the
past five months showed a downward trend because of the unstable
security situation.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, more than 326,400 tourists visited
Indonesia compared to 379,500 last July, Sugito was quoted by
Antara News Agency Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia suffered a major setback in the tourism industry
after a series of riots erupted in the country in 1998, causing
some countries to issue travel advisories, advising their citizens
not to travel to Indonesia if unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 3.76 million tourists visited Indonesia, compared with
6.6 million in 1997. The number of foreign tourists visiting
Indonesia is projected to reach 5.5 million in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> 14 Die as Floods Sweep Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people died while
thousands of families were displaced by heavy rains that hit most
parts of Mindanao in the southern Philippines in the last few days,
the local ABS-CBN TV station reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted sources from the Office of the Civil Defense (OCD) as
saying that 11 people were still missing after heavy rain poured
over the Mindanao region for almost a week.
</P>
<P>
The OCD said rains damaged crops and infrastructure, forcing
about 6,000 families to leave their homes for safer ground.
</P>
<P>
Most of the schools in the region were affected by the flood,
with gymnasiums and schools situated on higher ground turned into
evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
About 200 million pesos (5 million U.S. dollars) worth of
infrastructure, crops and properties have been destroyed, the ABS-
CBN said in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, three provinces and two cites in
Mindanao are about to be declared calamity areas, upon the
recommendation of Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado to President
Joseph Estrada
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical
Services Administration (Pagasa) said severe weather conditions in
Mindanao were being caused by the northeast monsoon in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Pagasa said the northeast wind is likewise affecting Luzon
and Visayas, the country's other two main regions, causing
temperatures to drop.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said it would take at least four days before the
water subsides, but added that rains may continue to pour.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Unveils Emblem, Slogan for 2008 Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- "New Beijing, Great Olympics."
This has become the official slogan for Beijing's bid for the 2008
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony here on Tuesday, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games
Bid Committee approved the official emblem, designed jointly by
experts from Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The emblem resembles in a five-pointed star in the same colors
as the Olympic rings. It is modeled after the "Chinese knot", a
traditional Chinese handicraft, and symbolizes unity, co-operation,
exchange and development by peoples of the five continents working
in unison to build a better future in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The star is in the shape of a person practicing traditional
Chinese Wushu routine Taijiquan (shadow boxing). It is also meant
to bring out the essence of China's long-standing traditional
sports culture.
</P>
<P>
"Smoothness, harmony, vitality and mobility characterize the
design, a symbol of the Olympic spirit -- Faster, Higher and
Stronger," explained a Committee statement.
</P>
<P>
The Committee also launches its Internet website www.beijing-
olympic.org.cn, to promote the image of Beijing and provide up-to-
date information of its Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding on September 6 last year, the Committee has
received more than 2,000 design proposals for the emblem and over
30,000 proposed slogans from across the country, including Hong
Kong, Macao and Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Committee officials said that the slogan "New Beijing, Great
Olympics" fully signifies that Beijing, a city with a history of
over three thousand years, has stridden into the new millennium
with a new outlook resulting from the policies of reforms and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"If the 2008 Olympics is held in China, a country with one
fifth of the world's population, it would be a further boost to
spread the Olympic spirit and a new chapter will be opened in the
Olympic movement," said Liu Qi, president of the Committee.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Posts 1.32 Pct Inflation in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's national inflation
rate stood at 1.32 percent in January, the Antara News Agency
reported on Tuesday, quoting the Central Statistics Agency (BPS).
</P>
<P>
"The rising of prices of various basic needs in the New Year
2000 and approaching Idul Fitri festivities (on January 8 and 9)
caused the jump early in 2000," Chairman of the BPS Sugito Suwito
said.
</P>
<P>
The Idul Fitri is the feast to celebrate the success of Muslims
in adhering to Islamic principles during Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sugito said, an increase in the standard prices of
public transportation several days before and after Idul Fitri
festivities also contributed to the rises in inflation last month.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven categories of consumer goods mentioned in the
Consumer Index Price, six were in the grip of inflation, while
another one recorded deflation.
</P>
<P>
The inflation-hit six groups included food stuffs with 0.89
percent, processed food, drinks, cigarettes and tobacco 0.07
percent, housing 0.12 percent, clothing 0.15 percent, health 0.01
percent and transportation and communications 0.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Deflation occurred only in education, recreation and sports
with 0.01 percent," Sugito was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Mexico-Brazil Trade Accord to Be Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A coming trade accord between
Mexico and Brazil will be effective for only a short term, about
one or two years, to allow Mexico access to a wider trade accord
with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), which includes Brazil,
Brazilian Ambassador Francisco Junqueira said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mexican and Brazilian officials plan to begin negotiations next
Wednesday on the trade agreement. The terms of the treaty, the
rules of provenance, and the products to be covered are central
points of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's private sector considers the accord with Brazil a key
for a wider treaty with Mercosur in three or four years, but as
for now the two countries' economies are more competitive than
complementary.
</P>
<P>
Junqueira said he expected that the short duration of the
bilateral accord would allow Mexico to agree to a wider trade
accord with Mercosur countries.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is the biggest free trade bloc in Latin America and is
made up of Brazil and Argentina, the two largest economies in
South America, as well as Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Mercosur failed to reach a trade agreement in 1999.

<HEADLINE> KFOR Arrests Ethnic Albanians on Terrorist Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peacekeeping
forces in Kosovo (KFOR) Monday arrested 14 ethnic Albanians
suspected of attacking international institutions in Kosovo,
acting out of their normal slowness in combating violence and
terrorism there, Yugoslavia's state news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The arrested included two ethnic Albanians suspected of
throwing grenades at the Kosovo office of the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and nine for alleged
burglary in the dormitories of U.N. police forces, said a bulletin
from the U.N. special mission.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug noted that KFOR's high efficiency in handling these
cases was in sharp contrast with its perfunctory manner in
implementing the U.N. Resolution 1244, which bans all acts of
violence and terrorism against any ethnic community in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Since the peacekeeping troops and the U.N. special mission
entered Kosovo on June 12,1999, in the wake of NATO's 78-day
bombing against Yugoslavia, ethnic Albanian terrorists have been
responsible for 3,688 acts of terrorism against local non-Albanian
residents, killing nearly 800. But the peacekeeping troops have
been turning a blind eye on the atrocities without taking any
effective measures to stop them, Tanjug stated.

<HEADLINE> Students Groups Continue Confrontation in Mexico's Top University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Groups of students for and
against the nine-month long strike in Mexico's top university
continued to confront each other with stone throwing and blows on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some students, attempting to end the strike, tried to tear down
barricades set by strikers and drive them out of the two biggest
buildings on campus of the Autonomous National University of
Mexico, popularly known as UNAM.
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously hurt and the police did not intervene in
the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, following similar blows, striking students were
ousted from the movie and infirmary buildings, which are now under
police control.
</P>
<P>
The strike began April 20 last year to protest administrators'
plan to raise annual tuition from a token figure to about 140 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though the university subsequently dropped the increase
proposal, a radical body named the General Council of Strike (CGH)
that emerged in the course of the strike continued to occupy the
campus, calling for greater student control and sweeping policy
changes.
</P>
<P>
On January 20, students, teachers and staff had voted in favor
of ending the strike. However, five days later, the UNAM rector
was blocked by strikers from entering the campus when he intended
to announce the official vote results.
</P>
<P>
The situation became tense Saturday when more than 20,000
students, unionists and leftist supporters took to the street,
pledging to continue the strike.

LOS ANGELES, January 31 (Xinhua) -- An Alaska Airlines jet with
at least 60 people on board a flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico,
to San Francisco, crashed in the Pacific Ocean northwest of Los
Angeles late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It crashed 32 kilometers off the coast of Point Mugu, south of
Santa Barbara, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The plane is a twin-engined MD-80 instead of a Boeing 737 as
earlier supposed, said U.S. Coast Guard officials. A MD-80 can
carry more than 460 passengers.
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter, a Navy plane, and several small boats
are searching a large field of debris in the sea, but have not yet
found any survivors.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the plane, Alaska Airlines Flight 261, had
reported trouble and asked for landing at Los Angeles
International Airport shortly before the crash.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's KONI Does Not Plan Extra Discipline for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Olympic
Committee (KONI) brushes aside the possibility of adding any
discipline to already-confirmed events Indonesia's going to take
part in at this year's Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has decided on a plan to compete in nine events,
including swimming, diving, athletics, badminton, taekwondo,
weightlifting, archery, surfing and tennis.
</P>
<P>
"Those nine events are our focus and we will prepare as well
aspossible. Should there be any other discipline preparing for
the Olympics, that is definitely out of our program," said Arie
Sudewo, chief of the Indonesian training camp program.
</P>
<P>
The training camp, which sees an initial 55 athletes on the
lookout, begins on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The number is likely to rise because we have to wait for other
events to finish their qualifications," Arie was quoted by Tuesday
's Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Judo and wrestling are two events outside the nine reported to
be vying for slots at Sydney Olympics. Arie said he was not aware
of any Olympics plan for the two.
</P>
<P>
"I only do my job as outlined by KONI. KONI has programed only
nine events," he said.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Olympic
Committee (KONI) discussed the Olympics training program with
officials from the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) in a
meeting here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soemarjono, a PBSI official which was appointed project manager
for the Olympics, said KONI had offered to co-operate with the
association to help maintain their tradition of Olympic gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
"We are very proud to be invited to the discussion. KONI
offered the routine meeting with PBSI officials, shuttlers and
KONI officials to explain the training guidelines arranged by KONI.
Those shuttlers need a motivation boost from KONI besides
improvements in their technical skills and tactics," he was quoted
by Tuesday's Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Hadi Nazri said the shuttlers would compete in the
Thomas and Uber Cups finals, the All-England, the Swiss Open and
the Japan Open before deciding who would go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"On May 1, there will be the selection of the shuttlers for the
Olympics. We are now focusing on the preparation for the Cups,
which will take place in May in Kuala Lumpur," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cash Problem May Deter Indonesian Windsurfer's Olympic Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Financial shortage may spoil
Indonesian windsurfer Oka Sulaksana's medal chance in this year's
Olympics Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Kotambunan, an official of the Indonesian Yachting and
Windsurfing Association (Porlasi) in charge of athletes
development, said Oka needed around 700 million rupiah (94,000 U.S.
dollars) to hire a foreign coach, to compete in a series of
competitions in Europe to improve his world rankings and to live
in Sydney for three months for climatic adjustment ahead of the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said Oka ranked 81st in the world after competing in four
out of seven competitions in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
"If he can improve his world ranking and join the world's top
30, he has a greater chance of medals in the Olympics. He can
improve his ranking if he competes in Europe, because about 70
percent of the world's top 30 windsurfers will test their skills
there before competing in the Olympics," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post on Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The European competitions are to be held from April to June in
Spain, French, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Oka, the gold medalist in the IMCO heavy division in the
Bangkok Asian Games, finished 13th in his Olympic debut in Atlanta
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Raymond said that Porlasi had asked for financial support from
the National Sports Council but it had yet to respond.
</P>
<P>
He said Oka found his own sponsors to fund his qualifying round
for the Olympics last year. Oka was now training using a
physicalprogram devised by world-class windsurfing coach Amith
Inbar of Israel, who supervised Oka's training when he competed in
the world championships in Noumea, New Caledonia, last November.
</P>
<P>
Porlasi has delayed its plan to hire the coach because it can
not afford the cost of 1,500 U.S. dollars a week. Raymond said
that Oka was now training with local coaches.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Reports High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouses, generated 766.23
billion yuan in gross domestic product last year, up 10.1 percent
form 1998, three percentage points more than the national figure.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth consecutive year the province has maintained
double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the upward trend to the increase in
investment and the smooth industrial and agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Shandong spent a total of 224.5 billion yuan in fixed assets in
1999, up 9.2 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The province significantly increased investment in new and high-
tech industries while closing many small plants and mines that had
caused serious pollution and consumed excessive resources.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial added value rose 13.1 percent to top 202.7
billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong also stepped up efforts to apply advanced technology
to agriculture and maintained its leading status in the production
of major farm products.

<HEADLINE> Stringent Regulations to Pave Quality Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Tougher regulations to ensure
that road construction is not substandard are expected to be
introduced this year, sources with the Ministry of Communications
say.
</P>
<P>
The measures are expected to include requiring construction
companies to meet certain ministry-established qualifying
standards if the firms are to bid on State road construction
projects, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The new rules on regulating road construction projects as well
as tightening bidding procedures are expected to be promulgated
later this year. Details on the rules are not available so far.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, meanwhile, acknowledged in a departmental
document that corruption has been a problem in recent years as
China moved from a planned economy towards a market economy. It
called for firm measures to fight corruption in road construction.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources said stricter supervision will be imposed soon,
but they did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
This year, the ministry plans to improve the operation of road
and water transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises will be encouraged to participate in
the project, particularly on transportation routes crucial to the
country's security.
</P>
<P>
With China's entry into the WTO highly likely, transportation
companies will soon be facing fierce competition from foreign
companies. To ensure fair competition, China needs to formulate
new laws on transportation, the official sources said.

<HEADLINE> Iron Fist to Slam Deceptive Ads: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Industry and Commerce will renew its efforts to crack down on
misleading and false advertisements, says today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Deceptive ads, particularly those involving medical products,
health supplements and job opportunities for laid-off workers,
will be dealt with harshly, said Wang Zhongfu, director of the
administration, at a Beijing symposium Monday commemorating the
fifth anniversary of the Law on Advertising.
</P>
<P>
Bureaux of industry and commerce across the country have
identified more than 160,000 advertisements that violated the law
since it went into effect. Fines totaling 450 million yuan (about
54.2 million U.S. dollars) have been imposed on manufacturers and
media.
</P>
<P>
Wang said print and broadcast advertisements for real estate
and medical products were among the main sources of consumer
complaints in recent years, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of 1999, there were 4,350 complaints
about misleading advertisements filed with the China Consumers'
Association, more than double what was reported in the
corresponding period in the previous year, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The administration has issued more than 30 rules to supplement
the advertising law.
</P>
<P>
Some symposium participants said the law needs to be revised to
make it applicable to present-day conditions.
</P>
<P>
Punishment for deceptive advertising should not be based on the
amount of money involved, but on the negative impact on the public,
said a legal expert from the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Protect Prized Yellow Wine: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Quality and Technical Supervision Administration gave
the rice-and-wheat drink its status so companies outside the
Shaoxing area will not use the famed name to label similar
products, vice-director Zhu Mingxian was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Large quantities of "Shaoxing Wines" on the international
market today are produced in Japan. If China joins the WTO, the
Product of a Region of Origin status would stop companies
worldwide from duplicating the product.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, we will suffer a huge loss when we pledge to
protect foreign products according to international treaties,
while they will not protect ours because we have no rules of our
own." Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Shaoxing Wines must then be only those made from raw materials
and with traditional techniques that originated in Shaoxing, an
area of east China's Zhejiang Province, according to "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"We want the brand to really help maintain the products' high
qualities and reputations." Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The products of Regions of Origin designation will also help
prevent the degradation of the best wines, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
And the Shaoxing announcement lets the administration begin to
implement its Regulations for the Protection of Products of
Regions of Origin, rules that were passed on August 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
These rules were written to be compatible with international
business and China's pending WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
Yellow wine, the Shaoxing product's generic name, was invented
in China. And Shaoxing Wines, with a history of 6,000 years and
more than 100 varieties, have long been recognized as the
representative of Chinese yellow wines.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A ship with 186 people on
board remained trapped Monday by ice generated in the Atlantic
Ocean, said a communique from Argentina's Army.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, cruiser "Clipper Adventurer,"
belonging to a U.S. tourist firm, remained motionless south of
Matha Strait, west of Antarctic Peninsula, about 1,400 kilometers
south of Ushuaia.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser was sailing between Belgrano and Liard islands,
separated by Matha Strait, when a sudden change in wind direction
pulled ice to the strait and trapped the ship, which is 100 meters
long and 16 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the situation did not amount to a danger to
the people aboard the cruiser.
</P>
<P>
Ice breaker "Admiral Irizar" of Argentina's Army, has left for
Matha Strait to help, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser left Ushuaia port last Friday, with 115 American
and Canadian tourists and 71 crew members, most of whom are
Americans, Germans and Filipinos.

<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras, winner of 12 Grand
Slam tennis tournaments, and Todd Martin have withdrawn for health
reasons from the U.S. Davis Cup team that will face Zimbabwe this

Woodruff, who will make his Davis Cup debut, and Leach, who
will be playing in the Davis Cup for the 10th time, join
Australian Open champion Andre Agassi and Alex O'Brien.

sustained during his semi-final loss to Agassi at the Australian
Open. Martin withdrew because of a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Zimbabwe match set to be played Friday-Sunday at the

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Criticizes Davis Cup Scheduling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Davis Cup captain John
McEnroe slammed the scheduling of the competition on Monday,
saying major tournaments should not be slotted so close together.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said the scheduling had been a major reason for the
withdrawal from the world group tie against Zimbabwe here this
week of Pete Sampras and Todd Martin. The two played the
Australian Open that ended on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Davis Cup schedule needs to be changed, there's no doubt...
and the sooner the better for the sport in general," McEnroe told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should have something that I'd like to
consider as important as the Grand Slams a week after a Grand Slam.
It doesn't make sense, the sport needs a break."
</P>
<P>
McEnroe earlier predicted on Monday his team would find it
tough in the first round tie against Zimbabwe with Sampras and
Martin absent.
</P>
<P>
Sampras withdrew from the Harare match due to a hip-flexor
injury sustained during his semi-final loss to compatriot Andre
Agassi in the Australian Open on Thursday. Martin quit the tie
because of a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said the pair had been replaced by the "equally
competent" Chris Woodruff and doubles specialist Rick Leach.
</P>
<P>
Making his debut as the captain of the U.S. Davis Cup captain,
McKenroe had to face a hard match ahead. "Every captain always
has a plan B but it's a tough blow for us because Sampras is one
of the greatest players that ever lived and Martin is a top 10
singles player, so their absence certainly makes things
complicated," he said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Donates Money to Build Bombing Memorial Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwanese businessman in
Chongqing has donated 500,000 yuan (60,200 US dollars ) to build a
memorial wall in the city to mark the bombing of an air-raid
tunnel by Japanese invaders in 1941.
</P>
<P>
Cai Deyi, president of association of Taiwanese investors in
Chongqing, said a bronze relief wall will be erected soon near the
site of the tunnel, in which over 2,500 civilians suffocated after
Japanese soldiers bombed the tunnel on June 5, 1941.
</P>
<P>
He said the eight-meter-long and 7-meter-high wall features
abstract art to show the bombing and expose the atrocities
committed by the Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
Born in Taiwan in 1949, Cai said he still remembers the bombing
stories told by some of his primary school teachers who were
witnesses to the attack.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, Japan launched 6,800 air-raids
against Chongqing between January 1938 and August 1943, killing or
injuring more than 20,000 people and leaving over 60,000 buildings
in ruins.
</P>
<P>
"History can never be changed or reversed. Both the Chinese
people and Japanese people should learn from the past," Cai added.
</P>
<P>
The area of Chongqing, now China's largest and youngest
municipality, has a history of more than 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1940, Chongqing was made a "wartime capital" by the
Kuomintang government and at the time was the political, economic,
commercial, financial transportation, cultural, and diplomatic
center of the country.

NANJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouses, achieved more than 770
billion yuan in gross domestic product in 1999, an increase of 10.
1 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth is three percentage points higher than the national

More than 60 percent of the province's state-owned enterprises
have established modern management systems, greatly helping the
industrial sector improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the province increased 17 percent to reach 18.31
billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has set its growth target at 10 percent this year, and

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The government in northwest
China's Qinghai Province has gathered 31.87 million yuan-worth of
goods for local disaster-struck people, and the local civil
affairs departments have delivered 11.43 million kg of grain to
them.
</P>
<P>
Many local people are suffering from a grain shortage problem
in Qinghai Province brought on by natural disasters that have
plagued the province since last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Qinghai was struck with its most severe natural
disasters, including drought, floods, hailstone and snow storms,
in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Some 246,000 ha of farmland in Qinghai was affected by natural
disasters in 1999, said provincial Deputy Governor Bai Ma, and 37,
300 ha of farmland produced nothing.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the famous Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the "roof of the
world," Qinghai is among the provinces which are most vulnerable
to natural disasters such as floods, snow storms and drought.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of China has recently sent a delegation
to distribute 100,000 tons of flour, 10,000 kg of rapeseed oil and
7,000 pieces of clothing to over 1,000 households in two counties
in Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang Shengwen, deputy secretary-general of the
society and head of the delegation, the society has allocated 200,
000 yuan for disaster-relief efforts in the province.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 20 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions in China were hit by droughts, floods,
earthquakes, typhoons and other natural disasters last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Fishery has changed its role
from a farm sideline to become a key part of the agricultural
economy in coastal Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu produced 2.97 million tons of aquatic products last
year and thus generated an estimated 31 billion yuan in output
value in fishery, which accounts for 16.5 percent of local
agricultural total.
</P>
<P>
Some 67 percent of aquatic products produced locally are now
bred artificially. Jiangsu has also further improved the industry
involved in the deep processing of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Last year Jiangsu earned more than 200 million U.S. dollars-
worth of foreign currency by exporting more than 70,000 tons of
aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 89 trading markets for the wholesale of aquatic
products have been built up across the province, handling 13.7
billion yuan in transactions last year.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Global Vaccination Program for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) on Monday launched a global vaccination program,
"The Children's Challenge," at the 30th annual meeting of the
World Economic Forum (WEF) in the eastern Swiss town of Davos.
</P>
<P>
The new program aims to achieve universal immunization of
children against polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis, whooping cough,
measles and tetanus.
</P>
<P>
"Today, 30 million children do not receive basic immunization,
which may eventually lead to the deaths of three million dying of
a vaccine-preventable disease," WHO Director-General Gro Harlem
Brundtland said when launching the new program.
</P>
<P>
She said that immunizing all children made economic as well as
humanitarian sense: "The campaign will lay the foundation for
personal development, social development and, eventually, economic
development for entire societies."
</P>
<P>
Diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis, said the WHO chief, have
devastated developing economies through lost productivity. Poverty
and ill-health, she noted, have overtaken territorial disputes as
the biggest threats to global stability.
</P>
<P>
A WHO official in charge of the global program said the
campaign also intends to correct imbalances between industrialized
and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The program is sponsored by the Global Alliance for Vaccines
and Immunizations (GAVI), a group of international organizations,
development banks and private donors.
</P>
<P>
Much of the funds needed comes from the foundation set up by
the founder of the Microsoft Corporation, Bill Gates, and his wife,
Melinda. In 1999, they donated 750 million U.S. dollars to help
start up the GAVI campaign over five years.
</P>
<P>
Gates told delegates in Davos that businesses, governments and
philanthropists should work together to provide the life-saving
vaccines that are often taken for granted to children around the
world.
</P>
<P>
"It's a priority that comes even before how everyone should
have access to the Internet. More important is that everyone
should have basic health rights. That means all of these vaccines
ought to be available worldwide," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Name Walker to Replace Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Darrell Walker was reunited
with Michael Jordan on Monday when he officially was named to
replace Gar Heard as coach of the struggling Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
Walker and Jordan were teammates on the Chicago Bulls in the
second half of the 1992-93 season and have remained close friends.
Walker also spent four seasons as a player in Washington from 1987-
91.
</P>
<P>
His hiring is the first move made by Jordan since the former
Bulls great was named president of basketball operations on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
"Any time you can coach in the NBA, it's a golden opportunity,"
said Walker, who had been coaching the Rockford Lightning of the
Continental Basketball Association. "It's like a dream come true.
I played here, I played hard here. Hopefully, I can be the guy to
get things turned around here."
</P>
<P>
Walker has previous NBA coaching experience with the Toronto
Raptors, but will have his work cut out in Washington. He takes
over a team that has gone through five coaches since 1996 and has
not won a playoff game in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
"The thing I know about Darrell is his leadership and straight
forwardness to get the best out of his players," Jordan said. "
The thing I know about this team is they have underachieved for a
long time. I hope by getting Darrell here it's going to turn some
of those losses into wins."
</P>
<P>
Heard endured a tumultuous season in Washington and was fired
on Saturday by Jordan, who minced no words in explaining his
reason for the move.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of respect of the players, I think he lost that,"
Jordan said. "Unfortunately, that happened before I was here. A
change had to be made."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, the Wizards announced that Rod Higgins,
another former teammate of Jordan and assistant coach with the
Golden State Warriors, would be named interim coach. But that
never came to fruition.
</P>
<P>
ESPN reported those negotiations hit a snag when the Warriors
refused to release Higgins from his contract after Washington
declined to alter the terms of a 1994 trade that could involve the
Wizards in this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
Walker's status will be re-evaluated at the end of the season
and Jordan offered no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"I told him he has an opportunity to coach this team and at the
end of the year we'll evaluate coaches and players," Jordan said.
"If we have to make changes, we'll make changes. Until we get
this back on track I'm not going to make many guarantees."
</P>
<P>
A hard-nosed, defensive-minded player, Walker directed the
Raptors from 1996-98, compiling a 41-90 mark before being replaced
by Butch Carter on February 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This is a guy who gave it his all every minute on the court,"
Wizards owner Abe Pollin said. "He's a winner, a leader, and I
know he will get his guys to play hard and get this thing turned
around."
</P>
<P>
After a 10-year career as a player, Walker worked for the NBA
Players Association before becoming an assistant to Brendan Malone
on the Raptors' inaugural 1995-96 team. After leaving the Raptors,
he moved into broadcasting before becoming coach of the Lightning
on October 1.
</P>
<P>
One of his first tasks with the Wizards will be trying to
instill a winning attitude. Washington is in last place in the
Atlantic Division and has not won consecutive games in more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes as players you can just learn to accept losing," he
said. "I don't want our guys to accept that. All I want to do is
instill some intensity, (have them) come out and play hard,
communicate on the court and have some fun. You got to get back
to having some fun."
</P>
<P>
However, he also issued a challenge to his players.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't want to play hard for me, you can come sit next
to me (on the bench), and I don't mean that as a threat," Walker
said. "I just want our guys to play hard. I think I'll have a
good rapport with my players. I want that reputation back where
no one wants to come in here and face the Wizards night in and out
and I'm gonna get that back."
</P>
<P>
Heard, 51, became Jordan's first victim following Saturday's
103-98 home win over Cleveland. He had guided the Wizards to just
a 14-30 mark, including a 2-3 record since Jordan took over.
</P>
<P>
Heard is believed to have two-plus years left on a three-year
deal he signed last June. He was chosen by Wizards general manager
Wes Unseld, who no longer has the final say on personnel decisions
but made Saturday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
Assistants Butch Beard and Mike Bratz also were fired. Tree
Rollins was retained and apparently will assist Walker.
</P>
<P>
The firings were not unexpected. When Jordan was introduced as
part-owner and president of the floundering franchise, he said, "
Until we get on track, everyone is disposable to some degree."
</P>
<P>
The Wizards have had four coaches in less than a year. Bernie
Bickerstaff began last season's lockout-shortened campaign but was
fired and replaced by assistant Jim Brovelli.
</P>
<P>
Heard adopted a stern stance and feuded with players Juwan
Howard and Rod Strickland. Following a 130-129 double-overtime
loss in Milwaukee on January 11, Heard and Howard reportedly had
heated words in the locker room. Players and coaches intervened
and when Rollins spoke up on Heard's behalf, Howard reportedly
went after Rollins.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January (Xinhua) -- Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday scored a
surprising 2-0 victory over highly fancied co-hosts Ghana in Ghana
's capital Accera, but the victory failed short of one addational
goal to qualify it for the quarter-finals of the African Cup of
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaians had opportunities in the first-half, but Otto
Addo and Augustine Arhinful just failed to covert them into goals.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian defence was soon left wide open for the
Netherlands-based Ivorian international Bonaventure Kalou to score
with the last kick of the half.
</P>
<P>
Ghana were locked inside their own territory for the early part
of the second-half as the Gote d'Ivoirans went on the rampage.
</P>
<P>
But the threatening attacks were largely not turned into goals,
until with less than 10 minutes to time, Donald Sie was left
unmarked from a counter-attack and slided home from outside the
box.
</P>
<P>
Ghana just managed to hold on until the final whistle. Their
efforts to pull a goal back were denied by Ivorian goalkeeper
Alain Gouamene.

LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Massamesso Tchangai scored the
sole goal for Togo to beat Cameroon 1-0, but the victory still
failed to make Togo to the quarter-finals of the African Nationas
Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
The goal came 18 minutes into the first half of the Group A
match in Ghana's northwest city Kumasi.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks of Togo needed to win this final group game by three
clear goals against the highly-fancied "Indomitable Lions" of
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the goal, the team had several more occasions in
the halp which they almost capitalize to incread their lead.
</P>
<P>
And after the break the Lions came back with a better
performance but at last could not find the net.
</P>
<P>
As the winner of the group, Cameroon will go to the quarter-
finals with Ghana, who lost its last match to Cote d'Ivoire 2-0.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Blossoming In East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The private sector has
blossomed into an increasingly powerful force for economic growth
in east China's Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
Private entrepreneurs in Jiangxi Province paid 2.83 billion
yuan in taxes last year, a rise of 21.5 percent over 1998 and
accounting for 18.1 percent of the total provincial fiscal
revenues for 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 70,000 workers laid off from state-owned
enterprises in Jiangxi were re-employed in private enterprises or
became self-employed last year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi's 10,654 privately owned companies with limited
liabilities have registered assets of 9.79 billion yuan in total,
and these companies account for 41.9 percent of all local private
firms.
</P>
<P>
Local private undertakings in the province exported 650 million
yuan worth of goods in 1999, six times the 1998 figure, and
invested 300 million yuan on 68 technology-innovation projects and
nearly 180 million yuan to develop new products.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province now has 45 privately owned hi-tech enterprises
involving 70 million yuan of total investment.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Zhejiang Province, the number of private
enterprises engaged such fields as machinery, chemicals, bio-
chemicals, and electrical facilities, has reached around 600.
</P>
<P>
Private entrepreneurs in Zhejiang are giving priority to
technology improvement and market share increase as new strategies
to further develop the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises in Zhejiang spent 4.95 billion yuan on
technology upgrading last year, 5.1 times the 1998 level, and 966
million yuan to develop new products, almost double the 1998
figure.

<HEADLINE> Largest Offshore Oilfield Found in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 1 (Xinhua)-- China has found its largest
offshore oilfield with reserves of 600 million tons in north China
's Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The profitable Penglai 19-3 is believed to be the second-
largest oilfield after the famous Daqing Oilfield which was
discovered in 1959 in northeast China, Chinese scientists
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield is in the ocean floor at a depth of between 900-1,
400 meters, covering an area of 50 square kilometers, revealed
Deng Yunhua, geologist in charge of the Bohai Oilfield near the
port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The joint exploration was done by the China National Offshore
Oil Corporation and the Phillips Oil Corporation of the United
States over the past six months; it is the biggest discovery for
the U.S. company in the past 3 decades.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened part of the Bohai oil exploration territory
to overseas firms in 1980, few major discoveries have been
reported due to a miscalculated theory that oil reserves were
available 3,000 meters deep undersea.
</P>
<P>
The new thinking from Chinese experts to search for oilfields
in the shallow sea area around 1,000 meters deep has produced good
results, including the 1998 discovery of Qinghuangdao 32-6
oilfield with reserves of 170 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Producing 160 million tons of oil annually, China is the fifth
largest oil producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a report issued by 60 research institutes
and ministries, China will face a shortage of 600 million tons of
oil by the year 2050 if the economy continues to develop at its
current pace.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil reserve is 94 billion tons, with most found
in land areas. But the output of many of the land oilfields has
been dropping. Since 1979, China has cooperated with more than 50
foreign companies in exploring offshore oil.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists and Phillips will continue their cooperation
to step up the exploitation in the new oilfield, which is expected
to boost the yearly oil output of all existing Bohai Sea oilfields
to more than ten million tons in the coming years, said geologist
Deng.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Help South China City Build Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will help
Fangchenggang in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
build an offshore bridge in the western part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Fangchenggang and Sembcorp Construction
Pte Ltd last week signed a bridge-building agreement, according
to local sources.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, an official with the regional development
planning commission also closed a deal with Enersave Hol Ding
Limited to form a comprehensive plan to better link three closely-
related spots in the city -- Jiangshan Peninsula, Jintan and
Dongxing.
</P>
<P>
The offshore bridge will have a total length of 10.65 km,
including a 1.6 km section crossing the sea and 9.05 km land
highway. It will start at the port area of Fangchenggang and end
at a highway juncture to Dongxing City after passing the western
offshore areas of Fangchenggang and Jiangshan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The four-lane bridge will cost about 230 million yuan, said
local sources.
</P>
<P>
Fangchenggang, situated on Beibu Gulf and bordering Vietnam, is
a major gateway to the sea for southwest China and serves as a
shortcut from China to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The city, some 200 km away from Nanning, the regional capital,
supervises Fangchenggang Port, Fangcheng District, Dongxing City
and Shangsi County. It has a population of 760,000 and is
connected to expressways and railways.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Atlas of Nanjing Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An atlas of the east China
city of Nanjing charted and printed by the Japanese during World
War II has been discovered in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"The latest map of Nanjing" as it is called, was printed in
October, 1938, and on it, several ponds are clearly marked
opposite the old supreme court of Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
This map will be a persuasive evidence in a lawsuit involving
Shiro Azuma, 88, a former Japanese soldier who published his war
diary describing how Japanese invaders killed Chinese civilians in
China during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Azuma recently lost a lawsuit in Tokyo when it was ruled that
what he had said was not true.
</P>
<P>
The newly revealed map is 68 centimeter longs and 49.5
centimeters wide with a scale of 1:20,000, and shows the date of
issue, the name and address of the distributor, the name of the
copyright holder and publisher, and the name, address, and
telephone number of the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
Song Xiangyang, a worker in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei
province, bought the map last December at a secondhand book vender.
</P>
<P>
The map was appraised as an original copy by Cheng E'bin,
former chief engineer of the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Surveying
and Mapping, and Bai Xiangang, senior engineer of the Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Invading Japanese troops massacred some 300,000 Chinese
civilians and unarmed soldiers in Nanjing on December 13, 1937.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese right-wing's gathering in Osaka, Japan, on January
23 to deny the reality of the Nanjing Massacre aroused protests
among both Chinese and Japanese.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 1 (Xinhua)-- A total of 16 pieces of Japanese
military equipment collected by a local citizen here was revealed
today to document the truth about Japan's invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
The collection offered by Lu Shikui, a worker in Tianjin,
includes some overcoats, gloves and military swords used by
Japanese military officers, a set of gas masks, several military
caps, and other battlefield artifacts.
</P>
<P>
These items were collected in northeast China, where the
Japanese Army had its headquarters in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Lu's collection has brought attention from a local committee
which will hold a special exhibition for him soon.
</P>
<P>
Lu also has some pictures and written materials revealing Japan
's invasion of China after 1931, when Japan first bombed China's
Southern Manchuria Railroad near Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, and from there radiated out to invade
all of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lu is now busy organizing his collection for the exhibition,
which he hopes will inform people about China's history during the
invasion.

<HEADLINE> Teams Fail to Agree on World Cup Group 8 Schedule </HEADLINE>

<P>
BUCHAREST, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Romania, Italy, Hungary,
Georgia and Lithuania failed after eight hours of negotiations on
Monday to reach an agreement on a schedule for their 2002 World
Cup Group 8 qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
"The representatives of the five nations to play in the
European World Cup's Group Eight ended their meeting without
positive results," Romanian football federation (FRF) general
secretary Adalbert Kassai said after the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kassai said he thought that the world governing body FIFA may
now have to decide the timetable.
</P>
<P>
Italian Soccer Federation general secretary Guglielmo Petrosino
blamed the deadlock on Hungary. "Hungary blocked the setting of a
convenient World Cup schedule for our group," Petrosino said.
</P>
<P>
Group members have until February 7 to agree their timetables
for the qualifiers. Representatives of the countries had to
reconvene in Italy later this week for further discussions, which
three of the national coaches might be unable to attend.
</P>
<P>
"Romania, Georgia and Lithuania are now taking part in a
friendly tournament in Cyprus, so their coaches, who had to come
to Bucharest for today's meeting, won't be able to travel to Rome
this week," Kassai said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, FIFA will probably have to draw our group matches
schedule," he added.

<HEADLINE> Portsmouth Players Face FA Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Five Portsmouth players,
including hat-trick scorer Steve Claridge, are facing an FA
investigation after betting on the outcome of Saturday's first
division match with Barnsley.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Monday, the Pompey players placed
a total of 250 pounds on their side beating Barnsley, at odds of 3-
1.
</P>
<P>
Claridge scored all three in the 3-0 victory, Pompey's first
league win since October.
</P>
<P>
The former Cambridge, Leicester and Birmingham striker admitted
there had been a wager afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"When we looked at the odds and we were 7-2 or 3-1 for a home
win, I thought 'that's an insult to us'," said Claridge.
</P>
<P>
"We looked at that, we've all had a good bet on it and we've
won a few bob."
</P>
<P>
But FA spokesman Steve Double confirmed that the governing body
would be looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
"We've made it abundantly clear in recent years that betting by
players, managers and coaches, is against our rules," said Double.
</P>
<P>
"Our rules are clear. People in football cannot bet on matches
except for the football pools.
</P>
<P>
"During the course of this week we'll be in touch with
Portsmouth about Steve's comments," said the spokesman.

LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer

Martin O'Neill for calling him a "footballing cretin".

"It seems to me that Martin O'Neill is losing his Mr. Clean

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Admits Players "Went Too Far" in Referee Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Alex Ferguson has berated his
Manchester United stars for hounding referee Andy D'Urso off the
pitch.
</P>
<P>
D'Urso claimed he feared for his safety after a posse of United
players, led by skipper Roy Keane, squared up to him after he
awarded Middlesbrough a controversial penalty at Old Trafford on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson defended his players at the time claiming they were
upset by D'Urso's decision, but he now admited they were in the
wrong after watching the incident on television.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson rarely criticises his players in public, but he
admited Keane and Co went too far and rebuked them at training on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However he still maintained that D'Urso was wrong to award the
spot-kick because Jaap Stam tackled Juninho fairly.
</P>
<P>
"I thought our players went too far, I must say that, and I've
had a word with them this morning," he told Piccadilly Radio.
</P>
<P>
"I've watched it on television and I can understand the ref's
reasons for giving the penalty because from behind it might have
looked that Jaap had taken his legs.
</P>
<P>
"But in fact he got the ball first and then followed through
and caught the boy's legs. But he certainly got the ball first."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, though, scoffed at D'Urso's claims that the United
players might have knocked him over if he had not stepped
backwards.
</P>
<P>
"Hardly, in front of 60,000 witnesses, but nonetheless I think
we overreacted," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Provides Cyprus with New Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece has supplied Cyprus with
self-propelled artillery units and additional TOR-M1 missile
systems, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Greece has delivered to Cyprus National
Guard 12 Slovakian-made Suzana 155mm self-propelled artillery
units, along with an undisclosed number of additional TOR-M1 short-
range anti-aircraft missile systems.
</P>
<P>
The first two TORs were displayed at the Independence Day parade
on October 1, last year, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Greece had given Cyprus a lightly-armed navy
patrol boat, the second in the island's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Military experts here have in the past dismissed the Slovak
artillery system as unreliable and problematic.
</P>
<P>
However, military sources in Greece stressed that after several
trials the glitches had been fixed, claiming that it was now one of
the most reliable artillery systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
Under intense international pressure and war threats from
Turkey, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides was forced to divert the
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles to
Greece's Crete island in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Cyprus government has been striving to find
alternatives as part of its air-defense umbrella, amid fears that
missiles which could hit the Turkish mainland some 80 kilometers
away would raise tension again.
</P>
<P>
Turkish fighter planes are less than four minutes flying time
from the Cyprus island.

southwestern part of the country to mark the 21st anniversary of
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian state-run television showed the military aircraft
and helicopters were busying at boarding troops to be dispatched to
the manoeuvre zones in southwestern border areas.
</P>

JERUSALEM -- The ongoing intensive Palestinian-Israeli talks

Negotiators of the two sides have met twice since Sunday, but no

Erekat told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Erekat asked Israel to take a positive attitude toward the talks
so as to meet the deadline of February 13 that the two sides set
for a framework agreement on the final-status issues, such as
borders, the Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlers and Jerusalem.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to the northern Israeli

escalating attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, but
the violence there should not hinder the Israeli-Syrian talks.

"I do not think that we should at this juncture relate it any

<HEADLINE> Senior Israeli Official on Final-status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua)-- The ongoing Israeli-Palestinian
intensive peace talks will last for some time and the two sides
will reach a framework agreement on final-status after the three-
stage negotiations, said a senior Israeli official Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, told Israel Radio that
the first stage of the final-status talks will last for about 10
days, thus, the two sides will have enough time to explain their
positions on various key issues such as the fate of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, borders, Jewish settlement and water.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will draft the framework agreement on final-status
during the second stage of talks, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The time of the third stage will be decided by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat during their future meetings, he added.
</P>
<P>
Such an interpretation of the final-status talks came after the
Palestinian side complained that no progress was made so far during
the current intensive talks, which started secretly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos,
expressed on Monday publicly his frustration at the snail-pace of
the talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"These negotiations are proceeding very, very slowly...The
implementation of whatever we have agreed upon goes through a
bottleneck of procrastination, unilateral delaying tactics and
minimalist implementation that threaten the whole process," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat also complained on
Tuesday that the talks produced no substantial progress so far.
</P>
<P>
He asked Israel to take a positive attitude towards the talks so
as to meet the February 13 deadline for the two sides to reach a
framework agreement on the final-status as stipulated by the Sharm
el Sheikh peace deal signed last September.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal asks the two sides to work out the framework
accord on final-status by February 13 and a final peace treaty by
September this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian side announced Tuesday that Arafat
and Barak will hold talks Thursday at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Palestinian side said, Arafat will ask
Barak to implement his pledges for the interim period such as
Israel's third phase withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to transfer another 6.1 percent of the West Bank
territories to the Palestinians during the third withdrawal, which
has been postponed since January due to differences over areas that
Israel has to hand over.

<HEADLINE> Owen Sidelined by Injury Until March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- England striker Michael Owen's
injury problems continued when he was ruled out of action until
the start of next month Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Owen, who visited a Harley Street doctor Tuesday, has not
trained for 10 days after damaging his hamstring against
Middlesbrough on January 22.
</P>
<P>
The injury is the latest in a series of setbacks for the
England striker, who may now find his Euro 2000 place under
pressure.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Anfield club said, "Liverpool's medical and
technical staff met on Tuesday afternoon to consider at length the
extensive reports received from a number of specialists who have
examined Michael Owen.
</P>
<P>
"Following that meeting, it has been decided that Michael will
follow a specially formulated program of activity designed to
address the underlying causes of his hamstring problems.
</P>
<P>
"The program will involve strengthening exercises for his lower
back, stabilization activities for his pelvis and work to improve
both the strength and endurance of his hamstrings.
</P>
<P>
"Michael will be working at Liverpool's Melwood training
complex during the period of this program and is expected to be
back playing again at the start of March, " said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has promised not to send the
young striker back into action until he is completely fit.
</P>
<P>
Houillier left him behind when the team went to Malta for a
training break last week and the club appears to be making
contingency plans for a spell without their leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
Houllier watched Dutchman Erik Meijer and Jon Newby score for
Liverpool reserves Monday, prompting speculation that the two
players could come into his plans for this weekend's clash.
</P>
<P>
Titi Camara returns from suspension, giving the Anfield boss
the choice of Meijer, Vladmir Smicer, Danny Murphy or Newby to
partner him.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool are understood to have given up trying to find a loan
signing from abroad.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Visit India, Bangladesh in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday that he will visit India and Bangladesh in March, but
has not decided whether his South Asian trip include Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Just as I believe we have to engage China that has a political
system very different from ours, we have to engage India that
makes decision that sometimes we don't agree with," Clinton told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going because it's the biggest democracy in the world. I
think we haven't been working with them enough," he added. "We
have an enormous common interest in shaping the future with them."
</P>
<P>
The White House confirmed on Tuesday that the trip will take
place during the week of March 20. India announced the trip
earlier on Tuesday, saying it hoped the visit would lead to closer
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The White House left open the possibility of also visiting
Pakistan, saying "no decision have been made about other stops."
</P>
<P>
It would be the first visit by a sitting U.S. president to
India since 1978, when former President Jimmy Carter went there,
and the first ever to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had been planning to visit India and Pakistan earlier
but reversed course after both countries set off nuclear
explosions in 1998. Planning for the trip resumed last year but
then was derailed when General Pervez Musharaf took over power in
October by ousting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Bill on Taiwan, Clinton to Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement earlier in the day, the White House said it "
strongly opposes" the measure because it "would seriously diminish
Taiwan's security and undermine the important U.S. objective of
stability in Asia."
</P>
<P>
"This bill would mandate a number of new security and military
arrangements with Taiwan that could create dangerous, false and
inaccurate expectations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Movement toward a more formal military relationship (with
Taiwan) also could have other serious unintended negative
consequences," it added.
</P>
<P>
If the bill were sent to President Clinton in its present form,
his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Several provisions in the bill, the statement added, "interfere
with the president's broad authority to control the disclosure of
information about foreign negotiations and other sensitive
national security and foreign relations information."
</P>
<P>
The bill also interferes with the president's "authority" and "
ability" to carry out his responsibilities for the conduct of the
nation's foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
The measure was sharply condemned by China. In Beijing, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Monday that China has
demanded that the U.S. Congress immediately stop their moves to
infringe on China's sovereignty by passing the bill.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the measure is also meant to interfere in China's
eventual reunification with Taiwan and that such attempts posed a
"serious threat" to the "relationship across the Taiwan Straits,
the peace and stability in Asia-Pacific region, and the Sino-U.S.
ties."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning said Monday,
"We strongly urge the U.S. government to take effective measures
to prevent this act from being adopted in the Congress and to
prevent it from becoming law."

BUENOS AIRES, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An ice-breaker of the
Argentina Navy on Tuesday saved a trapped cruiser with 186 people
on board in the Atlantic Ocean, said a communique from Argentina'

</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the cruiser "Clipper Adventurer,"
belonging to a U.S. tourist firm, was rescued and resumed its
journey on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser Monday remained motionless south of Matha Strait,
west of Antarctic Peninsula, about 1,400 kilometers south of
Ushuaia.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser was sailing between Belgrano and Liard islands,
separated by Matha Strait, when a sudden change in wind direction
pulled ice to the strait and trapped the ship, which is 100 meters
long and 16 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
Ice breaker "Admiral Irizar" left immediately for Matha Strait
to help following the assistance request.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser left Ushuaia port last Friday, with 115 American
and Canadian tourists and 71 crew members, most of whom are
Americans, Germans and Filipinos.

<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Women swimmer Ruan Yi claimed
the only gold medal for China on the first day of a World Cup
meeting, the eighth leg of 12 venues series in Sheffield, England,
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimmer made no mistake in winning the women's 100m
butterfly event at 59.06 seconds, beating Mandy Loots of South
Africa and Jennifer Button of Canada to the second and third
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Loots was clocked at 59.73 while Button, at 1:00.03.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen-year-old Yang Yu, another Chinese women swimmer, who
swam the fastest time in the morning's heatings, was beaten by
triple world short-course champion Martina Moravcova of Slovakia
in the 200m freestyle event.
</P>
<P>
U.S. based Moravcova was timed at one minute 55.61 seconds,
swimming past Yang Yu by 0.03 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Moravcova, who celebrated a golden double in the evening, also
won the 200m individual medley in two minutes 11.65 seconds.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's events, world champion Ian Thorpe overcame
what he described as a "juvenile" error when his goggles slipped
to win both his races.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Australian's goggles slipped down his face in
the opening 100 meters freestyle final but, sixth of the eight
finalists and more than half a second behind pace-setting
compatriot Darren Lange at the 50-meter mark, Thorpe recovered and
powered to victory in 49.38 seconds.
</P>
<P>
It was closer than it should have been, with Americans Jarod
Schroeder and Dan Phillips second and third in 49.66 and 49.68
respectively, and his time was nearly two seconds slower than he
swam in the Sydney World Cup meeting in January.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, who became the youngest men's world champion in history
when he won the 400 meters freestyle title at 15 two years ago,
had to work harder than anticipated in Tuesday's 400 to deny the
challenge of American Chad Carvin, world short-course silver
medalist in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe won the event in three minutes 40.94, overtaking pace-
setter Carvin after 200 meters and forging on to beat the American
by more than a second in a time five seconds slower than he swam
two weeks ago in Sydney, where he also broke his 200m freestyle
world short-course record.

<HEADLINE> 52 U.N. Member States Fall into Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The 54th General
Assembly session Tuesday said that 52 U.N. Member States have
fallen into arrears and will lose their vote at the General
Assembly this year, a U.N. spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
They are the countries that have accumulated arrears that
equal or exceeded their budget assessments for the previous two
years, and this will make the countries lose their vote at the
General Assembly under Article 19 of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The latest report on contributions to the U.N. budget
indicates that approximately 3.47 billion U.S. dollars is owed by
Member States, some 1.3 billion U.S. dollars for the regular
budget, around 2.1 billion U.S. dollars for the peace-keeping
budget, and about 31.8 billion U.S. dollars for the two
International Tribunals, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The final number of Member States that met their Charter
obligation by making their full payment to the U.N. regular budget
by January 31 stands at 42, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Except for seven Member States that received special
exemptions from the General Assembly, the countries on the list
will not be permitted to vote in the General Assembly until their
arrears fall below the two-year level," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In response to press questions, the spokesman said that the
number of Member States who had lost voting rights under Article
19 was higher than in recent years.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Food Agency Postpones Colombia Program for Fund Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (
WFP) said Tuesday that it has had to postpone a planned relief
program for internally displaced people in Colombia for the lack
of fund.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. food agency has not received any funding for the 9
million U.S. dollars for the two-year operation, which was
scheduled to start Tuesday, a U.N. spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that so far, WFP has received no funding at
all -- "zero dollars and zero cents."
</P>
<P>
WFP will renew its appeal to donors for financing to give food
assistance to 227,000 people who have fled their homes because of
the internal armed conflict. More than 1.5 million Colombians have
been internally displaced over the past 15 years, more than in any
other part of the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
As the food-aid arm of the United Nations system, WFP is the
largest multilateral food-aid organization in the world,
responsible for handling around 3 million metric tons of food aid.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1963, WFP's mandate is to help poor people in
developing countries by combating world hunger and poverty.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises to All-Time High in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending
rose 2 percent to an all-time high level in December, the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that spending surged to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 730.3 billion dollars, pushing the amount of money
spent on building single-family homes to a monthly record. That
followed a revised 2 percent increase in November and was much
stronger than many analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1999, construction spending rose 6 percent,
following an increase of 7.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The construction report showed that spending on all government
projects jumped 6.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 175.7 billion dollars in December, a record monthly high.
</P>
<P>
For all residential projects, spending rose 1.5 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 330.5 billion dollars, also a
monthly record level.
</P>
<P>
The value of all private construction projects picked up 0.7
percent to an annual rate of 554.5 billion dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, builders in some parts of the country have
experienced shortages of skilled workers and some building
materials which can delay or disrupt construction schedules, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
But housing and other construction activity has continued to
remain at healthy levels despite these problems and rising
mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Tuesday begins a two-day meeting that many
economists believe will end Wednesday with a decision to boost
interest rates in an effort to slow the red-hot economy, which
today sets a record 107 months of uninterrupted growth in history.

<P>
BRASILIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Greater part of the Brazil's
industry output increased in the last quater of 1999, Brazilian
National Confederation of Industry (CNI) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The industry surged 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999
compared with the third quarter and jumped 27.1 percent against
the same period of 1998, according to investigation realized by
the CNI.
</P>
<P>
The employment of the country also improved by the end of 1999,
said the CNI.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian economy has had a consistent recovery since the
last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
 Overall production, especially auto and paper industries made
big output.
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian economy had been sluggish before the debt default
in Russia in August of 1998. It pushed many developing countries
into recession. The downturn in Brazil was aggravated by last
January's currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
 But the economy has been slow to show signs of a sustained
recovery by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways to Fly Relatives of Air Crash Victims to Abidjan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways will fly
relatives of the passengers and crew in the January 30 air crash
to Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government of Cote d'Ivoire had promised to provide
assistance in visas and other travel documents, said Steve Clarke,
the airline's technical director, at a press conference on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Airbus 310, with 168 passengers and 11 crew
members on board, slammed into sea off Cote d'Ivoire shortly after
its takeoff from the Abidjan International Airport Sunday night.
So far only 10 survivors have been found and the hope for more
survivors becomes slim with time passing.
</P>
<P>
According to Clarke, 21Kenyan military divers would fly to Cote
d'Ivoire on the same day to help recover the wreckage of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
However, at present the airline's paramount concern is the
passengers and crew, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-nine bodies have been found. Among them were Nigerians,
Kenyans, Indians, Congolese, Americans and Ethiopians. The
condition of the other 80 people is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
The crash was the first accident of Kenya Airways since it was
established in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Urges Arms Progress in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson Tuesday called for a breathing space in the peace
process as it wavers on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Dublin after discussing the long-awaited de
Chastelain report on decommissioning with Irish Foreign Minister
Brian Cowen, delivered Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He said more progress on arms decommissioning was needed
following First Minister David Trimble's prediction that Northern
Ireland's political institutions would be suspended in the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
In reply to Trimble, Mandelson said, "Something only becomes
inevitable when there is no other option."
</P>
<P>
He said there were a number of positive elements in the report,
including maintenance of paramilitary ceasefires and the
commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
"All these are enormously important developments, which make
life worth living," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said there were further chances to achieve
decommissioning. "It's those that need to be properly examined and
thoroughly discussed with the relevant parties before we reach
final conclusions."
</P>
<P>
Mandelson told BBC that the report had not demonstrated "
sufficient progress on decommissioning."
</P>
<P>
But the Irish Republican Army said it posed no threat to the
peace process as it had met the decommissioning body on three
occasions and as recently as Monday night.
</P>
<P>
IRA sources told BBC its guns remained silent and it remained
committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the organization was persuaded to talk to
the body overseeing disarmament to "help move the situation out of
the political vacuum it had been stuck in for the previous 18
months. We did so in good faith and constructively."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams denied his party had defaulted on
its side of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process was in crisis although it could be
saved. But he warned, "It cannot work if one party is intent on
walking out."
</P>
<P>
Adams also said he still believed decommissioning could be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Trimble told a press conference that his party
could no longer sit in government with Sinn Fein in the absence of
arms decommissioning by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed Mandelson would initially consult with the
parties, announce the suspension of the political institutions and
that the British government would pass legislation to temporarily
impose direct rule within a few days.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Showers Leave 600 Homeless in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The persistent rains that fell
over the high plateau in the Chilean First Region left 600
homeless in the Huara and Pozo Almonte areas, the Emergency
Regional Office (OREMIL) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some roads show damage causing interruptions with some small
villages like Ollague, in the province of El Loa, according to the
OREMIL.
</P>
<P>
In the community of San Pedro de Atacama, water service was
stabilized and the Intentional Crossing of Jama has been found
qualified to all kinds of vehicles. The crossing of Sico is closed
due to the showers and snowfalls.
</P>
<P>
The communities with more damage asked the OREMIL for
mattresses, blankets, food and wooden sticks to assist the
homeless families.
</P>
<P>
According to Governor Fernando Nunez, the main problems were
due to the overflowing of the Camarones, Vitor, Colpitas and Ach
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Nunez added that most of the secondary roads are cut off and
in danger of total lack of being circulated.
</P>
<P>
"The worst of all is the flow of rivers continues increasing
and the rains do not stop with the consequent risk of flooding,"
said the governor.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Registers Low Traffic. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) --  Panama Canal registered a
decrease of 8.2 percent in cargo tons during the first trimester
of the fiscal year 2000,the Panama Canal Authorities said on
Tuesday (ACP).
</P>
<P>
The current fiscal year started on October 1,1999 and will end
on September 30 of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"During the above mentioned period the cargo tons that crossed
the interoceanic waterway reached 48 million tons, 4.3 millions
less than the previous year "
</P>
<P>
Such a decrease was due to the increase of the international
oil prices agreed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), which was reflected in the transportation cost
and charges in maritime freights.
</P>
<P>
The most affected products were the grains cargo, oil derived
products, iron manufactures, steel, coal, wood, and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
This loss was compensated up to certain level by an increase
in the flow of container ships, chemicals, frozen products and
automobiles
</P>
<P>
Container shipments continued to expand at an important rate
of 8.3 percent,for a total of 7.9 million tons in the first
trimester of the fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The route Asia-United States, the main commercial route for
container ships, showed an increase of 3.8 percent with 3.1
million tons shipped during the mentioned period.
</P>
<P>
The main increase in traffic container ships was noticed in
the north area, in other words the Asian route to the United
States, which reported an increase of 7.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pledges Economic Reform for World Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian leadership vowed
Tuesday to complete economic reform in a bid to woo the World Bank
for new tranches of loans.
</P>
<P>
Moscow will stick to the policy of economic reform even after a
new state head is elected in near future, Russian First Deputy
Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said at a Tuesday meeting with
visiting World Bank President James Wolfensohn here.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov said the financial crisis that broke out in Russia in
August 1998 "once again demonstrated the need for radical
restructuring," stressing that macroeconomic achievements without
structural reforms cannot ensure stable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank's efforts to support Russian reform "are
very serious and helpful," adding that the Russian leaders highly
value the World Bank's approach to the Russian government's
efforts to promote reform.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn assured the Russian leadership that the political
situation in Russia will have no effect on the Bank's decision to
extend funds to the country, Kasyanov told journalists after his
meeting with the bank chief.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side, according to Kasyanov, confirmed that
structural adjustment is a priority for the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
However, Kasyanov said that he thinks Russia will get no
structural adjustment loan from the World Bank in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
The loan conditions of the program will be corrected in
accordance with the new economic realities in Russia and the
Russian government's new program of economic reform after the
March presidential elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Russia can get a coal sector structural adjustment loan
and a social protection adjustment loan within the coming month,
Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin also held a meeting
with Wolfensohn at the Kremlin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Putin said that thanks to the World Bank's aid and its
president's efforts, the structural reforms in Russia "are
progressing properly."
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the Russian financial turmoil in 1998 lay
in the fact that the government did not pay attention enough to
structural reform of economy, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn arrived here Tuesday for a one-day visit to review
with Russian leaders the progress in implementing structural and
social policy reforms and to decide "how the Bank can best
continue its long-term relationship with Russia," according to an
official report of the World Bank press service.
</P>
<P>
The last official visit by the World Bank chief to Moscow was
made in mid-April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the World Bank's leading borrower. Since it was
admitted to the bank in 1992, the latter has approved over 11
billion U.S. dollars in loans to it. More than 6 billion dollars
have been transferred.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wahid Tells General Wiranto to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said in London Tuesday that he wanted his country's former
military chief General Wiranto to resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, in London as part of a two-week overseas tour, said he
wanted Wiranto to step down soon.
</P>
<P>
"I just today telephoned our minister of defense to go to
General Wiranto and ask him to resign now instead of when I come
back to Indonesia, because it will avoid further embarrassment,"
Wahid told an investment conference held in London.
</P>
<P>
If the general resigned now, "it would be good for him," Wahid
said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact I would like him to resign earlier in order to avoid
harassment (by opponents) means I respect him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said Monday he wanted Wiranto to step down by the time
the president returns home in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
But Wahid said Tuesday he had now changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
Wahid dismissed as "hogwash" talk of a coup in Indonesia
because of his demand for the resignation of General Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hatred or fear of a coup. This is all hogwash," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Jakarta said that Wiranto, incriminated in an
official Indonesian report into the fighting in East Timor, had
made it clear Tuesday that he would not step down as coordinating
minister for political and security affairs until Wahid clarified
his demand that he quit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Unable to Confirm Iraqi Resumption of Arms Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said Tuesday
that it could not confirm whether Iraq had renewed its program to
build weapons of mass destruction, but said buildings that housed
missile facilities had been rebuilt since U.S. and British raids
at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We have no firm evidence that they have rebuilt their weapons
of mass destruction capability. It clearly is a worry," Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters when asked about a New York
Times report that recent U.S. intelligence showed Iraq may have
rebuilt some of its battered military infrastructure damaged by U.
S. and British air strikes from 16 to 19 December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We do know that they have rebuilt buildings. We don't know
what goes on in those buildings," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said U.S. intelligence tools could easily tell "when
somebody rebuilds a building," but could not tell "what goes on
inside the building."
</P>
<P>
He said that was the cause "for worry" and the only way to find
out what was going on was to get U.N. inspectors back on the
ground in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors left Baghdad before 16 December, 1998
when they were warned that the United States and Britain would
launch air strikes against Iraq. After the U.S. and British
bombing, Iraq never allowed inspectors to return.
