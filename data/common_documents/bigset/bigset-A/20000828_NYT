COWBOYS ACQUIRE TIGHT END IN TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys feel they got lucky, in a
couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a trade with Atlanta on Sunday, the Cowboys acquired O.J.
Santiago, a 6-foot-7, 264-pound tight end with 44 NFL career
starts, including Super Bowl XXXIII barely 19 months ago. The
Falcons, in return, will receive Dallas' fourth-round pick in 2001
and seventh-round pick in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than seven tight ends had come and gone during a
three-week flurry of auditions with the Cowboys in an unsuccessful
attempt to replace No. 3 tight end Mike Lucky, whoseseason ended
with a knee injury July 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys finally have what they wanted all along: another
Mike Lucky ... and more.
</P>
<P>
   The Santiago trade _ actually initiated by the Falcons _ came
amid the NFL's final cutdown to 53 players, which the Cowboys
reached Sunday by waiving 18 players.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising cut was fourth-year veteran Tony Hutson, who
went to training camp as one of three players vying with Solomon
Page and Jorge Diaz for the starting job at right guard and ended
up not making the team. Coming off major knee surgery Oct. 12,
Hutson was held out of all but the last two preseason games for
what was described by team officials as ``precautionary'' measures.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones indicated that the Cowboys might not be done
with roster moves. With rookie Kareem Larrimore set to start at
left cornerback, the team is known to be interested in upgrading
that position, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys put in a waiver claim, they must wait until 3
p.m. Monday to learn if they are awarded the player. Based on 1999
record, similar to draft order, the Cowboys cannot be awarded a
player unless 18 teams pass on him.
</P>
<P>
   If a player clears waivers after 24 hours, he is fair game to be
signed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Giants cornerback Phillipi Sparks, who has been
unwilling to sign for the $440,000 veterans minimum, remains
available on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Jones called it ``quite a swing'' over the past 10 days at the
Cowboys' tight-end position, where David LaFleur has bounced back
from a groin strain to give the Cowboys optimism for him this
season ... and now the addition of Santiago, who can back up both
pass-catching tight end Jackie Harris and blocking tight end
LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. Santiago definitely can block,'' coach Dave Campo said.
``He's handled our defensive ends at times in the past. Greg Ellis
is a pretty good indicator as to whether a guy can block or not.
O.J. did some good things against Greg a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a nice little package there with LaFleur, Harris and
Santiago because we have a combination of everybody with those
three guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, 26, looks like a basketball player in shoulder pads.
Surprisingly, he's a better blocker than expected and maybe less of
a receiver because of past signs of inconsistent hands. He can
split the safeties on the deep ball, but can he catch it?
</P>
<P>
   That, along with injuries, was the problem in Atlanta where
Santiago caught only 15 passes for an 11.6-yard average and no
touchdowns last season after catching 27 passes for 15.9-yard
average and five touchdowns during the Falcons' Super Bowl run two
seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta signed Santiago for the lowest of three possible tenders
_ $472,000 _ for a restricted free agent. He will be an
unrestricted free agent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have had Sanitago's successor _ Reggie Kelly _ since
drafting him in the second round in 1999, using a pick from
Baltimore that cost the Falcons their first-round choice in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago underwent surgery this off-season to repair a torn
right pectoral muscle, which was the result of a weight-room
injury. He was to be examined by Cowboys team doctors Sunday night,
then given a playbook because he's being counted on to be ready for
Sunday's season opener against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very comfortable that he will be able to walk out there
and help us immediately,'' said Campo, adding that Santiago will
receive a crash course in a select number of packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize,'' Jones said, ``that a guy like O.J.
Santiago does more than just (serve as a backup); we can now expand
with him. The potential is there to open up the offense even beyond
what we thought we could do with LaFleur, Harris and Lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have now acquired four players in 2000 who have
started in the past two Super Bowls: Joe Bowden, Barron Wortham and
Harris (Tennessee), and Santiago (Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're probably not through (setting) this 53-man roster,''
said Jones, excusing himself to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   There was a waiver wire to read, possibly claims to be made ...
and most likely a cornerback to be found out there somewhere. nn

PALMER: `I STUNK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ USC sophomore quarterback Carson Palmer
didn't need anyone to tell him how he played in the Trojans' 29-5
victory over Penn State on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He offered his own analysis moments after he reached the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stunk up the whole game. I stunk,'' Palmer said. ``I felt
very rusty. I came out and played awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was playing his first game in nearly a year. He broke his
collarbone against Oregon and was forced to sit out the rest of the
season. That was apparent early against Penn State, when his second
pass of the game was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very rusty. I came out and played awful,'' Palmer said.
``After the first interception, I thought I would bounce back and
get into a rhythm, but I didn't throw one good ball the whole
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Palmer was 10 of 20 for 87 yards and one interception.
He was almost intercepted a couple of other times in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Although Palmer was clearly not at his best, USC was
concentrating on its running game. This after its special teams and
defense spotted the Trojans an early 14-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But that did little to calm Palmer's frustration over his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been over a year. I wish I knew what it was,'' he said.
``I can't play like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that Palmer felt he had one of his worst college
games in what he considered the biggest college victory of his
brief career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely (the biggest),'' Palmer said. ``It's a completely
different team. We have a new attitude and it gives us a lot of
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense and the offense had my back. I'm disappointed, but
all that's important is we got the win.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: POLITICAL TONGUE TWISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS book title in 11th graf)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporters covering George W. Bush's presidential campaign are
having a field day with his so-called Bushisms. It's
understandable. They're irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all hear the universal call to like your neighbor just
like you like to be liked yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was his message to struggling workers: ``I know
how hard it is to put food on your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra, move over. Let the governor of Texas hit some
malaprop-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Back in February, Bush said of John McCain, ``He can't take the
high horse and then claim the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   You want economic insight? ``We ought to make the pie higher,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   These comments should not be dismissed as mere gaffes. We owe it
to the governor to take him somewhat seriously. Consider the
following question, which he posed in New Hampshire: ``Will the
highways on the Internet become more few?''
</P>
<P>
   Whew!
</P>
<P>
   The danger if Bush keeps this up is that we will start to think
of him as some kind of champ in the fine art of malaprophesizing.
That would be a mistake. Consider, for starters, that the term
Bushism initially referred to that great malapropartist George
Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st president of the United States and
father of the current contender.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush once said, ``We're enjoying sluggish times, and
not enjoying them very much.'' He said, ``It's no exaggeration to
say the undecideds could go one way or another.'' He said, in a
reference to Dan Quayle: ``My running mate took the lead, was the
author of the Job Training Partnership Act. Now, because of a lot
of smoke and frenzying of bluefish out there, going after a drop of
blood in the water, nobody knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as you see, this ability of the younger Bush to get
entangled in the obscurer thickets of the language is not that
unusual. The plain truth is that politicians have always been
brilliant at finding new ways to insert their feet into mouths that
inevitably are running too much. Which is why you have books with
titles like, ``Political Babble: The 1,000 Dumbest Things Ever Said
by Politicians.'' And, ``The 267 Stupidest Things Democrats Ever
Said.'' (There's one for Republicans, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown, commenting on an earthquake when he was
governor of California, said: ``This is the worst disaster in
California since I was elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut nicely bungled an
appearance on behalf of a Democratic Senate candidate in South
Carolina by saying; ``We've got a strong candidate. I'm trying to
think of his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention Dan Quayle? He may be the champ. ``Republicans,''
he said, ``understand the importance of bondage between parent and
child.''
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president was a master at mangling the language.
He once said: ``I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward
more freedom and democracy. But that could change.''
</P>
<P>
   His most famous foul-up, now enshrined in Bartlett's Familiar
Quotations, was a reference to the motto of the United Negro
College Fund: ``A mind is a terrible thing to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Quayle: ``What a waste it is to lose one's mind, or not to
have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago was terrific at this
sort of thing. These were some of his best: ``I resent your
insinuendoes.'' ``The police are not here to create disorder.
They're here to preserve disorder.'' ``We shall reach greater and
greater platitudes of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was Ronald Reagan. Entire books have
been written about his flubs. I loved the time when, annoyed by
something Ed Asner had said, Reagan snapped, ``What does an actor
know about politics?''
</P>
<P>
   So Bush should take heart. He's not the only one out there
hacking away at the language. He might say on ``Meet the Press,''
``Laura and I really don't realize how bright our children is
sometimes until we get an objective analysis.'' Or, on the
``Today'' show: ``I don't have to accept their tenants. I was
trying to convince those college students to accept my tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not alone. As Daley happily pointed out, ``No man is
an Ireland.''

BUMPY RIDE ON VEHICLE SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   It has been a dismal month for those concerned about motor
vehicle safety, but it brightened just a bit last week when two of
the world's major automobile manufacturers took corrective action
to restore consumer confidence. First the Ford Motor Co. decided to
cut production of its popular Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles
so as to free their tires to help replace those being recalled for
safety reasons on existing vehicles. Some 6.5 million
Bridgestone/Firestone tires are being recalled after being linked
to hundreds of accidents and 46 deaths in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's No. 4 automaker, admitted that
it has systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of
thousands of defective automobiles since 1977. Middle-level
officials, anxious to avoid embarrassing recalls, covered up
complaints about fuel tanks, brakes and clutches, simply by
altering or hiding documents. Top management says it never knew
about it. The company expanded a recall of the faulty vehicles,
most of which were sold in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's decision to halt production will be costly. Ford will
suspend Explorer production at its big St. Louis plant, as well as
production of Ford Ranger pickup trucks at two other plants. These
are very profitable vehicles, and Ford estimates its pretax loss at
up to $140 million. The shutdowns will last until Sept. 11, giving
the supply of replacement tires time to begin catching up with
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The decision made good business and legal sense. Ford would have
been vulnerable to lawsuits had it continued to mount tires on new
Explorers at a time when drivers of old Explorers needed
replacements for the tires Firestone recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone has said that, despite the many claims
sent to it by warranty-holders, the company did not detect a
pattern of failure that required special attention. But when Ford
ran the same claims through its own computers, it discovered not
only an unusually high number of complaints but also the source of
most of the problem tires _ a factory in Decatur, Ill., operated
from 1994 to 1996 by replacement workers. Ford says that from now
on it will inspect warranty data on all the tires it installs on
its cars, instead of depending on the tire manufacturer to supply
that information.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's own performance remained under critical scrutiny. By
week's end, Ford was being rebuked by Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater for failing to notify regulators promptly last year
when it recalled the Firestone tires on some of its vehicles
overseas. Congress, which will hold hearings next month, may need
to mandate that manufacturers report all lawsuits, recalls and
serious customer complaints to the regulators.

McCULLOUGH MAKES NAME FOR HIMSELF IN KICKOFF CLASSIC 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In one afternoon USC went from Tailback
Who back to Tailback U.
</P>
<P>
   While USC coach Paul Hackett has insisted that three or maybe
even four tailbacks would play this season, sort of a
tailback-by-committee setup, one emerged Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Sultan McCullough locked up the position by gaining
128 yards in 29 carries in the Trojans' 29-5 victory over Penn
State in the Kickoff Classic. For his efforts, he was named the
game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready. I've been ready for months,'' McCullough said.
``This is what I wanted. Whatever I need, I'm going to get. I think
I can do it. I'll show them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough has always been confident, but this is the first time
he has demonstrated consistency in a game, partly because it's the
first time he hasn't been buried on the depth chart. McCullough not
only had a career high in rushing, he did it without the usual
long, breakaway runs that have been characteristic for a back who
is also one of college track's top sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it had to be a power game,'' McCullough said. ``I run
over people too if I have to. That's why we wear pads. I knew I
could do a lot against another team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just McCullough who believes he can be a power or
breakaway back anymore. After Sunday's game, his teammates were
more than happy to throw compliments his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hitting the hole hard and fast,'' offensive tackle Faasea
Mailo said. ``He's learned to use his speed as a sprinter to be a
devastating back.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, McCullough could give USC another legitimate
weapon for an offense that already includes quarterback Carson
Palmer and wide receiver Kareem Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions seemed determined to shut down Kelly,
double-teaming him about 75 percent of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they keep doubling me, Sultan will keep having the game
that he does,'' Kelly said. ``I didn't have a great game but Sultan
came through. I don't care about stats.''
</P>
<P>
   With Malaefou MacKenzie hurting his hamstring and Petros
Papadakis playing primarily in short-yardage situations, Hackett
seemed ready to crown McCullough as ``the back'' following the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we have three backs,'' Hackett said.
``We felt that one of them would separate themselves and Sultan
certainly took a big step today. And it was the way he ran. He had
tough runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great speed and is one of the fastest in the country,
but he's learning to be a tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough is just thankful he's finally getting the carries he
dreamed about when he signed with USC out of Muir High in Pasadena,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what I would I get today, I'm just glad I got
the ball,'' he said. &QL;

ON HORSE RACING: AN ORDINARY HORSE? NEVER!
</HEADLINE>
 By JOE DRAPE  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ This time of year, with the glory of
the Triple Crown faded and the stars of the spring series on the
sidelines, there is a tendency to size up the 3-year-olds and hang
the tag of ordinary around their necks. That's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon of the 131st Travers proved here Saturday,
there's no such thing as an ordinary horse _ especially for the
people most intimately involved with them. Ask Nick Zito, the
colorful and competitive New York trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Hoarse and heartbroken after his Albert the Great was run down
by Unshaded 20 yards from the wire, keeping him a neck away from
his first Travers victory, Zito composed himself and distilled the
magic of horse racing. He explained how he had won the Kentucky
Derby with Albert the Great's father, Go For Gin, and how Carl
Nafzger had won the Derby with Unbridled, who is Unshaded's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, racing is such a beautiful sport,'' Zito said with
an appreciative smile. ``Here he is 10 years later, winning the
Travers with his son. So it's a remarkable business we're in and
there's a lot of romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ask Jim and Terry Scatuorchio, the owners of More Than Ready,
the victor in the Grade I King's Bishop here, which preceded the
Travers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, the small, black colt was being
mentioned in the same breath as Affirmed and Easy Goer after
topping a perfect five-for-five start with a nearly 10-length
victory here at the Sanford Stakes. When a fever disrupted his
training, two tough losses followed in the fall and the colt was
sent to Kentucky for a complete physical. While veterinarians found
nothing wrong, More Than Ready was laid up and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But the Scatuorchios and the trainer Todd Pletcher believed he
was far from an ordinary horse and aimed him for the Triple Crown.
In January, he was a dead heat winner in his return race, the
Hutcheson Stakes in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ran valiantly the next five races against the best
3-year-olds in the nation. But each time, he never quite got to the
finish line first. In the Louisiana Derby, Mighty passed him in the
final jumps; in the Bluegrass Stakes, High Yield nosed him after a
breathtaking stretch duel; in the Kentucky Derby, he took the lead
in the stretch but couldn't hold on and finished fourth, six
lengths behind Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one days ago, More Than Ready was poised to win his first
Grade I race, a coveted designation worth millions when it comes
time to sell a colt for stallion duties. He was among the top
choices in the Haskell Invitational at New Jersey's Monmouth Park,
the track where Jim and Terry Scatuorchio had their first date.
</P>
<P>
   This time, disaster hit the day before the race when the colt's
regular rider, John Velazquez, broke his collarbone in a spill at
Saratoga. With jockey Richard Migliore on him for the first time,
More Than Ready got in traffic trouble and finished fourth, just 2{
lengths from the winner.
</P>
<P>
   So More Than Ready was taken off the Travers trail and entered
in the seven-furlong King's Bishop. It was a Grade I race at a
sprint distance he excelled at. Before the Haskell, Scatuorchio had
already signed a stallion deal for More Than Ready's post-racing
career.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would secure a great deal of bonus money. But for the
Scatuorchios, for Eddie Rosen, the pedigree consultant who helped
pick out More Than Ready, for the dozens of family members and
friends who had followed the colt across the country the past year,
winning the King's Bishop was also about seeing a hard-working
horse finally get the respect he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an experience of a lifetime,'' Scatuorchio said.
``He's brought a lot of joy into a lot of people's life and you
never know if you'll get an opportunity like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   So when More Than Ready went from last to first to capture the
race, the winner's circle was crowded, exuberant and tearful with
the colt's ardent followers. Even Pletcher, who is as reserved and
measured as Zito is emotional, couldn't help but be touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes this game isn't very sophisticated when you
think here's a horse who has proven himself in Grade I company over
and over again, but hasn't won,'' said Pletcher, who is leading the
trainer standing here. ``If ever there was a horse deserving of a
Grade I race, it's him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the year, votes will be counted among writers and
racing secretaries, and one 3-year-old will be named champion. It
probably will be the Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus. But don't tell
Nafzger, Zito, Pletcher or the Scatuorchios that their horses are
ordinary. They won't believe you.

NEWBURY HAS A KICK FOR USC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ USC kicker David Newbury was trying to
contain himself Sunday, even though he made all three field goals
in the Trojans' 29-5 victory over Penn State in the Kickoff
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I don't know if you all remember how I started off
last year,'' Newbury said. ``I'm always a fast starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury made two field goals against Hawaii, including a
48-yarder, before descending into a season-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I want to sit back and wait for something to happen
before getting too excited,'' Newbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, Newbury has noticed one change from a year ago.
After he missed an extra point against Penn State, he came back and
nailed all three of his field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I dwelled too much on a bad kick,'' he said.
``That's the difference. I have a lot more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury couldn't play it cool on the field, however, jumping up
and down each time he converted a kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't help it,'' Newbury said. ``I've been waiting for
this game since Nov. 26. I wanted to show my teammates I could do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   FAMILIAR FACE: Former USC strong safety Rashard Cook, who is
playing for the Philadelphia Eagles, was on the Trojans' sideline
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only live an hour away, I had to come,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook was a sophomore the last time the Trojans played Penn
State, in the 1996 Kickoff Classic. Penn State won that game 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different Penn State team,'' Cook said. ``And I
think we have a better team than we did back then.''
</P>
<P>
   INJURY REPORT: Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie suffered a hamstring
strain, but it is not considered serious. He was limited to three
carries and gained eight yards.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Trojans emerged from the game healthy.
</P>
<P>
   JUMP START: An otherwise flawless day had one slight hitch when
the truck carrying USC's equipment would not start after the game.
After a delay it was repaired and made it to Newark International
Airport in time to catch the team's chartered flight back to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   DEJA VU: Troy Polamalu's 43-yard interception for a touchdown
was the first Penn State has allowed for a score since USC
defensive back Quincy Harrison returned an interception 68 yards in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   BACK IN FORM: USC tailback Petros Papadakis scored a touchdown _
his first since Dec. 31, 1998 in the Sun Bowl _ on a 2-yard run.
Papadakis sat out last season after breaking his foot in training
camp. &QL;

LIBERTY LOOKS FOR SOLACE AS COOPER LEAVES THE STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM SPOUSTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The celebration echoed through the Compaq Center and
filtered hauntingly into the loser's locker room. As though being
beaten for the third time by the Houston Comets in the WNBA finals
wasn't enough, the Liberty couldn't shut out the sounds of its
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' 79-73 overtime victory Saturday was as traumatic as
it was dramatic for the Liberty. Despite the odds against winning
twice on Houston's court, the Liberty players said they truly
believed they could bring down this dynasty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We played them better than anybody else played them this
season,'' guard Becky Hammon said. ``We came in here with a lot of
heart and determination, and fell one basket short again. It's not
a very good feeling.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center Tari Phillips said, ``I thought if we were able to pull
this one out, we would have won the series.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Liberty became a footnote to a fourth title.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' four straight WNBA championships are the most
consecutive titles in professional sports since the Islanders won
four National Hockey League Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last such run in baseball was put together by the Yankees,
who won five titles from 1949 to 1953. In the NBA, the Boston
Celtics won eight straight titles, from 1959 to 1966. There has
never been a NFL team that won four straight championships,
although the Green Bay Packers won three straight, in the seasons
from 1965 to 1967. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the Liberty can make a valid argument that it
could have swept the two-of-three-game series from the Comets, who
are scheduled for a victory parade Tuesday in downtown Houston
thanks to Cynthia Cooper's two clutch baskets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 at Madison Square Garden, Cooper's 3-point play with
26 seconds left clinched the Comets' 59-52 victory. If her shot
with 21.5 seconds to play from beyond the NBA 3-point line had
missed and Game 2 had not gone into overtime, the Liberty most
likely would have won and tied the series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much like its regular season, which started 4-9, the Liberty
found success to be elusive and victories hard-earned in the
playoffs. The Liberty blew several chances to beat the Comets, but
it also staged impressive comebacks, particularly in Game 2, when
it rallied from 10 points down in the first half and from 9 points
down in the second half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had a lot of talented players, we just had to find
that chemistry,'' the Liberty's Vickie Johnson said. ``In the
second half of the season, we really put it together. Everybody
doubted us and never thought we would win the East. But we always
fought back.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the Liberty and the rest of the WNBA can look forward to a
league without Cooper, the four-time finals most valuable player
whose retirement casts a shadow on the Comets' quest for a fifth
straight championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the games she has won for them, they would
have to do a lot of adjusting and a lot of regrouping,'' Liberty
coach Rich Adubato said. ``Nobody has the ability to break the
defense down and finish the way she does. Swoopes breaks it down
and scores. Cooper breaks it down and creates opportunities for
everybody.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's Sue Wicks said, ``When she leaves, it will be a
different game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Sheryl Swoopes, the league's most valuable player and
defensive player of the year, admits to wondering about the
post-Cooper era. But she predicts several stars-in-waiting will
emerge to keep the Comets among the WNBA's elite next season.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be foolish to say we're not going to miss Cynthia,''
Swoopes said. ``She's been such a great player. We're going to miss
her, and the basketball world is going to miss her. At the same
time, I don't want to take anything away from this team and say
we're going to be nothing without her. Obviously, we're going to be
different offensively, but other players will have their chance to
shine. We'll be ready for that challenge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, who scored 31 points on Saturday, added: ``I'm never
going to think this is my team, this is the way we're going to do
it, etc. This is our team. That's why we've been so successful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Especially against the Liberty. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Vincent La Selva, the artistic director of the New
York Grand Opera Company, often answers the telephone himself in
the company's Carnegie Hall office. For several years, he's been
noting some of the questions posed about the company's summer
season of free opera in Central Park. Here are a few he especially
enjoyed from this year's batch:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you get a reserved seat in the unreserved section?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I be sure to get a seat if they are all taken?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I buy a subscription for the free opera?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When do you decide if it's going to rain or not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wrote the music for Verdi's `Don Carlos'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I be able to get out of the park when the opera is
over?''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:

</P>
<P>
   I was visiting my son in Sacramento, Calif., and joined him on a
trip to his bank. Most of the transactions with the customers
seemed to take some time. Finally it was my son's turn, and the
teller greeted him: ``Hi, Rick, how are the dogs? Last week, Suzie
told me one of them was sick. And by the way, how was that meat
loaf recipe I gave Suzie?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick stood there and chatted with her, oblivious to the line
that continued to form behind him.
</P>
<P>
   I stood there and thought: ``GIVE HIM THE MONEY. JUST GIVE HIM
THE MONEY!''

   Ted Hardin telephoned a neighborhood restaurant and ordered a
simple salad of just lettuce and tomatoes to accompany his
spaghetti. He paid for it and discovered when he sat down to eat
that the salad was brimming with olives, mushrooms, onions,
peppers, nuts and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Incensed, he dialed the restaurant and told them in no uncertain
terms to immediately send the plain lettuce and tomato salad he had
ordered. When it was delivered, he shoved the first salad in the
delivery man's hands and made a snide remark about incompetence. He
noted that the second delivery man was better dressed than the
first one and that the salad came in a different container.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later he realized that he had mistakenly dialed
another neighborhood restaurant, and as confused as they
undoubtedly must have been, they nevertheless sent the salad he
said he had ordered.

   Cell phone conversations are irritating at least every second
bus passenger, according to an unscientific survey of reactions in
letters and telephone calls. Florrie Chiat was on a 57th Street
crosstown bus when a cell phone rang and the owner, in a loud
voice, proceeded to share her ``business'' conversation with her
unhappy fellow riders. Finally a man, also in a loud voice,
suggested that everyone join him in singing, which they did.
</P>
<P>
   The phone user was oblivious, continuing to share her business
with the rest of the bus. Another passenger then piped up. He
suggested that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should
have two rates, one for true passengers and another for passengers
using the bus as an office.
</P>
<P>
   That one worked.

   The call ended.

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   After arriving on the Long Island Rail Road at Pennsylvania
Station, we hailed a taxi and en route mentioned that after the
theater we would be returning to Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The driver told us that he lived in an adjacent town on the
island and that he, too, would be going out there about midnight.
We rejected as too expensive his suggestion that we hire his taxi
for the return trip. He then replied that he hated to drive alone
and offered to meet us outside the theater and drive us home as his
guests.
</P>
<P>
   We agreed to meet him after the curtain fell, but never expected
that he would be there. To our surprise, he was. We were four
passengers, and I sat in front with him and discovered that he was
from Kiev in Ukraine, the same city from which my father had
emigrated almost 100 years ago. We spent a delightful hour singing
Russian and Jewish folk songs, and when we arrived at our
destination tipped him well: what our railroad fare would have
cost.
</P>
<P>
   I thought then that here was an ordinary New Yorker, a man who
defied the cold, abrasive, impersonal image. A man with the same
dreams and ambitions that my father had a century ago.

EDITORIAL: MILITARY MISRULE IN PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf overthrew Pakistan's
democracy, promising to eradicate corruption, revive the economy
and open the way for ``true democracy.'' He pledged to restrain
nuclear weapons development and pursue peaceful diplomacy with
India.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, he has made little progress with the economy
or corruption and has put off the return of democracy until at
least 2003. Pakistan still has not signed the nuclear test ban
treaty and tensions with India over Kashmir are as dangerous as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Now Musharraf has announced plans for a new political system
designed to buttress his own power by excluding the country's top
politicians. That would compound Pakistan's problems. A speedier
timetable for restoring democracy is urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's democratic governments have been flawed. But its
military dictatorships have blighted its economic and political
development and gravely damaged its international reputation.
Musharraf's administration has proved no different.
</P>
<P>
   Military rulers claim they can push through reforms because they
do not have to make deals with entrenched political interests. But
they are beholden to Pakistan's single most powerful interest
group, the military and its related intelligence services. Military
spending absorbs more than a quarter of Pakistan's yearly budget,
diverting resources needed for education and development.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton visited Pakistan in February, he made
clear America's unhappiness with military rule and with Musharraf's
refusal to cut ties with terrorist groups in Kashmir and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Don McKinnon, secretary-general of the
Commonwealth, delivered a similar message. The International
Monetary Fund is also unhappy with the slow pace of promised
economic reforms. Musharraf should acknowledge that he is worsening
Pakistan's problems and accelerate the return to democratic rule.

EDITORIAL: PROTECTING THE EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, scientists spotted a patch of open ocean
about a mile wide at the North Pole, where the ice is normally 6 to
9 feet deep. This remarkable discovery followed close on the heels
of a prediction from Norwegian scientists that the polar icecap
could disappear, at least in summer, in 50 years. To most
climatologists, the thinning of the sea ice is further proof of the
warming of the earth's atmosphere, a potentially disruptive trend
that hardly any mainstream scientists now dispute.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of thing that Al Gore loves to talk about, but
so far global warming has hardly entered the presidential campaign.
In fact, except for a three-day period when Gore talked about
energy policy, environmental questions generally have been hidden
behind big-ticket items like Social Security, taxes and national
defense. But few issues are as vexing and contentious as those that
touch on the relationship between people and nature _ issues like
clean air, the degradation of the oceans and marine life, the
preservation of open space and biodiversity, and, of course,
climate change.
</P>
<P>
   The nation faces two broad environmental imperatives. The first
is to continue the momentum of the last 30 years, a period when
Congress moved legislatively to clean up the damage inflicted by
the Industrial Revolution and to give environmental concerns equal
weight with economic development. The second is to help the rest of
the world grapple with problems that override national boundaries,
like global warming and the destruction of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, the green revolution took wing under Richard
Nixon, who presided over the creation of an astonishing body of
environmental law. It accelerated under Jimmy Carter, and burst
forward again under Bill Clinton, who is ending his term with a
series of intricate regulatory moves designed to outfox a hostile
Congress and add millions of acres of threatened wilderness to the
public domain before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   But at no time could this progress be taken for granted.
President Ronald Reagan's appointees did their best to thwart the
will of Congress through inertia and lax enforcement. In 1995, the
Gingrich Republicans came very close to rescinding some of the
country's basic environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude of the White House is decisive. Reagan's appointees
undermined existing law because he did not care. The Contract With
America gang failed because Clinton did care. So it goes,
throughout government. Whether the Army Corps of Engineers, which
for decades loved to build dams and straighten out free-flowing
rivers, serves or damages the environment depends on whom the
president appoints as its civilian chief and whether he keeps an
eye on it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when the bureaucracy finally gets around to using its
existing statutory authority to regulate industrial farmers who
foul the rivers with animal waste, it will be because some chief
executive has ordered it to.
</P>
<P>
   The global issues are of course less amenable to Washington's
influence, but these problems cannot begin to be solved without
presidential involvement. Put simply, the less-developed world,
including China, will not reduce emissions of the gases that
contribute to global warming unless the industrialized nations do.
The industrialized nations, meanwhile, cannot move forward without
the active participation of the United States, the world's biggest
producer of those gases.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has refused to force industry to clean up
emissions. Nor has it offered industry any incentives to do so.
Though Clinton helped negotiate the Kyoto agreement on global
warming in 1997, he chose not to spend further political capital on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has taken a more assertive approach than Gov.
George W. Bush on all of these questions. Gore helped devise the
administration's aggressive regulatory strategies under the clean
air and water laws and fortified Clinton's resolve to oppose
Republican efforts to weaken those laws. He can also be expected to
continue Clinton's efforts to guard and expand the public lands.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush has pursued a cooperative approach emphasizing
voluntary solutions to environmental problems, and has said that as
president he would turn over ``significant'' authority to local
governments. While he supports the federal Land and Water
Conservation Fund, he has criticized important administration
initiatives on wilderness protection and has promised to open the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming, of course, is Gore's signature environmental
issue, and he is likely to give it a kind of prominence that
Clinton did not. He has also unveiled an ambitious and fairly
detailed menu of subsidies and market incentives aimed at helping
industry achieve dramatic reductions in greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agrees that global warming is a problem, but so far he has
given no details of what he would do about it. The candidates'
positions on warming reflect the overall pattern of the campaign to
date on environmental matters. Bush has expressed general concern
for these issues, and on Friday singled out the preservation of
tropical forests as a priority in his diplomacy with Latin America.
But Gore has outlined more detailed remedies and conveyed a more
muscular attitude about enforcement.

disheveled clapboard shack last week to say the local government
would rebuild her house for no charge. President Clinton would be
visiting the House of Justice across the street, the mayor
explained, and he should not have to see such misery in Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is a saint brought to me from heaven,'' said a
smiling Sarmiento, a widow of a police officer who lives with a
disabled son on the charity of family members. Watching workers
struggle to complete the front facade in time for Clinton's visit
Wednesday, she added, ``I'd love to invite him inside for a bowl of
sancocho'' _ a stew of chicken, potatoes and plantains _ ``but he
would never visit a house like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since local officials learned a month ago that Clinton would be
coming to this splendid Spanish colonial port of soaring church
steeples and mounted cannons, they have rushed into a breathless
urban renewal campaign perhaps not seen since Sir Francis Drake
sacked the city in 1586. A thousand workers are widening sidewalks,
fixing cracked streets, whitewashing government buildings and
planting palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important event in Cartagena's history since
President Bush came here in 1990,'' Benedetti said. ``But this is
even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit here to a regional presidential anti-narcotics
conference _ with the usual bevy of reporters and camera crews _
helped bring a 34 percent increase in tourists the following year,
local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of tourists has decreased because of the
country's expanding war with Marxist guerrilla groups, to 535,103
tourists in Cartagena last year from 865,379 in 1994. So people
here are hoping this visit will cause another surge in tourism,
this city's most important industry.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetti is lobbying to urge Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea,
to ride through the old city in a horse-drawn carriage, Cartagena's
answer to Venice's gondolas, to show off its quaint narrow streets
shaded by rococo balconies draped by lush tropical flowers. She
also hopes to have a word with Clinton to press him to include an
exception for Cartagena to the State Department travel advisory
warning that Colombia is an exceptionally risky place for American
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   No detail has been left to chance to create the perfect pictures
and sound bites. About 150 homeless children have been removed from
the streets to ``recreational centers'' on the outskirts of the
city, and 1,500 kiosk owners have been told to haul their rickety
wares off the presidential route on Tuesday and Wednesday. One
thoroughfare along the beach _ which taxi drivers have taken to
renaming Avenida Clinton _ has been closed entirely for a complete
repaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a girl fixing up her house for her boyfriend's first
visit,'' noted El Tiempo, Bogota's leading newspaper, ``and asking
that her parents and brothers behave themselves to make the best
impression.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock grooming effort will cost the city $1
million _ a handsome sum for a city with a total annual budget of
$160 million _ to fix up the route Clinton will take in his
eight-hour visit. And that does not count the contributions being
made by the local telephone, electric and water companies to fix up
damaged pipes, street holes and faulty wiring, or the efforts of
store owners, who are washing down everything from their curtains
to welcome mats.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit has produced an almost giddy response from
Cartagena residents, who seem to never tire of telling visitors
that they live in an ``oasis'' far from the kidnappings and
massacres that characterize the rest of the country. Actually,
Cartagena is well below other Colombian cities in terms of crime
and violence, and there have not been any serious incidents here
since two bombings in 1989, one by the Medellin drug cartel and one
by a Marxist guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's visit will show the world that not all
Colombians are bad,'' said Dimas Ortiz Rondono, 58, a lottery
ticket seller who wears a row of rosary beads around his neck and
works beside the old slave market in the Plaza de los Coches, which
Clinton is scheduled to visit. ``And then the tourists will flock
back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Victor Prieto Castro, a 53-year-old reporter for the local
Victoria AM radio station, looked for foreign correspondents to
interview, he appeared excited about covering the biggest story to
come his way in some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't buy this kind of publicity,'' he said, ``We couldn't
be happier. This trip is going to give Colombia a whole new
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Cartagena residents are so certain a one-day visit by
Clinton will make a lasting difference for a country that has
suffered four decades of conflict or for a Caribbean tourist
destination that most cruise-ship companies would just as soon pass
on to keep their passengers calm. Some even express concerns that
the president could attract some terrorist attack, that would ruin
the city's reputation forever.
</P>
<P>
   Leonor Sanchez, a 40-year-old guide at the Palace of the
Inquisition, said she was happy Clinton was scheduled to visit the
Plaza de Bolivar outside the palace. But she said she was not sure
it was a good idea that Clinton visit the building's torture
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dark side of Colombia's history, when power was
terribly abused,'' said Sanchez, a jolly lady with an encyclopedic
knowledge of the old ways of stretching and mutilating bodies. ``He
could get the bad impression that we have always been a violent
country.''

   Streaking Elarton, Eusebio lead Astros past Expos
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Scott Elarton never expected to win 15 games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio hasn't been keeping tabs on his improbable hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   But both players remained on course Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio extended his hitting streak to a club-record-tying 23
consecutive games, and Elarton pitched his second career complete
game as the Astros cruised to a 7-3 victory over the Montreal Expos
at Olympic Stadium. The victory was the Astros' 10th in their last
13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio doubled twice and hit his seventh homer to match Art
Howe (1981) and Luis Gonzalez (1997) for the longest hitting streak
in club history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the Astros' record streak was 23 games,'' said
Eusebio. ``It hasn't really been on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elarton (15-4), who fought off control problems that
resulted in a career-high seven walks, became one of five 15-game
winners in the National League this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about 20 wins,'' said Elarton, who also
pitched a complete game against Montreal on Aug. 6. ``I would have
been happy with 10 wins this season. I didn't know what to expect
coming back from surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou went 3-for-4 with his 25th homer as the Astros
scored all the runs they would need during a four-run fourth
inning. Alou, who went 6-for-10 during the weekend series, raised
his batting average to .366.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio, who began his hitting streak July 9, tied the record
with a double down the right-field line off Expos starter Trey
Moore in the fourth inning. He added an RBI double in the fifth and
a solo homer in the eighth that put the Astros ahead 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on fire,'' Elarton said. ``He doesn't waste any time.
When he gets up to the plate, he swings the bat and gets it out of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored one run in the first inning, four in the
fourth and one in the fifth to take a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno and Julio Lugo singled to lead off the game, and
both advanced on a balk by Moore. Jeff Bagwell delivered a
run-scoring grounder for his 31st RBI in August, tying the team
record for RBIs in a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros failed to produce any more runs in the inning when
Richard Hidalgo's pop to short right field was caught by second
baseman Jose Vidro. Lugo was gunned down attempting to score from
third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised to see Lugo going on the play. I thought he
was faking,'' Expos catcher Brian Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell walked to lead off the fourth, and two batters later,
Alou launched a two-run homer down the left-field line. Eusebio
followed with his record-tying hit, and Cedeno added a two-run
single with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   With a six-run cushion, Elarton had room for error. He walked
six batters through six innings, including two to load the bases in
the fifth. The 6-7 righthander escaped trouble by coaxing Vidro
into an inning-ending fly out to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to take me out after the sixth inning, but I said
I wanted to go out there,'' Elarton said. ``I felt I could get
things straightened out. I wasn't being aggressive the way I
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider broke up Elarton's shutout bid with a two-run double
in the sixth inning. The Expos never put together another serious
threat as Elarton grew stronger late in the game. Following a walk
to Andy Tracy in the sixth, Elarton needed only 23 pitches to
retire the next eight batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a quality of a great pitcher to go through some rough
waters and find a way to smoother sailing on the other side,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``A lot of guys, once they get
into the late innings and have a rough inning or two, that's it.
They can't regroup. Elarton did.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton allowed six hits while striking out six. His two
complete games trail only Chris Holt, who has three, for the team
lead.

CANSECO SOUNDING UPBEAT ABOUT FUTURE WITH RANGERS

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys announced their ``final'' cuts Sunday to meet
the deadline to reduce the number to 53, but this is far from the
team's roster for first game of the season. The Cowboys are looking
for help at cornerback and safety. Look for them to make room by
reducing their numbers at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACKS (2)
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman and Randall Cunningham. You didn't think Clint
Stoerner would make the roster, did you? Aikman and Cunningham are
probably the most accomplished 1-2 combo in the league. If both go
down, the season is over anyway. Besides, the Cowboys would have
signed a veteran off the street start before turning the team over
to Stoerner. Look for receiver Joey Galloway to play quarterback in
an emergency situation. RUNNING BACK (3)
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, Chris Warren and Michael Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Warren have combined for more yards than any 1-2 combo
in the league. Both are still capable of carrying the load. Wiley
got the nod as the No. 3 back largely because the Cowboys paid him
a $100,000 bonus as a fifth-round pick. He might make his biggest
impact as a returner. FULLBACK (1)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thomas
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys don't mind having just one fullback because they
will use a lot of two tight end sets. Besides the H-back position
has largely the same responsibility as the fullback, meaning tight
ends Jackie Harris and O.J. Santiago, will be able to supplant
Thomas at times. WIDE RECEIVER (6)
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway, Raghib Ismail, James McKnight, Jason Tucker, Wane
McGarity and Chris Brazzell.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Cowboys had only one receiver they could count
on. Now they have six. Speedsters Galloway and Ismail might make up
the most dangerous starting combo in team history. McKnight, Tucker
and McGarity have potential. TIGHT END (3)
</P>
<P>
   David LaFleur, Jackie Harris and O.J. Santiago
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, the Cowboys have gone crazy looking for
a serviceable tight end to replace the injured Mike Lucky. Sunday's
trade for the veteran Santiago gave them someone better than Lucky.
He has the size to block like LaFleur and the speed to make plays
down the field like Harris. This threesome is solid. Harris,
however, remains the biggest addition. He could be Aikman's most
trusted receiver. GUARD (5)
</P>
<P>
   Larry Allen, Solomon Page, Jorge Diaz, Kelvin Garmon and Al
Jackson
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like about this group? The starters could be as
good as any in the league. Diaz is a backup with starters'
experience. Garmon, the camp surprise, is the favorite to start
next year when Page moves to tackle. The Cowboys liked Jackson so
much that they gave him $20,000 to sign as rookie free-agent before
camp. TACKLE (2)
</P>
<P>
   Erik Williams and Flozell Adams
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a four-time Pro Bowl pick. And Adams could achieve
standout status this year. The Cowboys would move either Allen or
Page to guard if Williams or Adams go down. Allen started at tackle
two years ago, and Page is a natural tackle. CENTER (3)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stepnoski, Ben Fricke and Dale Hellestrae
</P>
<P>
   Stepnoski is no longer considered the best center in the game.
But he is as steady as they come. Fricke can also backup at guard
and is the backup deep snapper. The one-dimensional Hellestrae, the
league's best deep snapper, is the real ``Survivor'' winner.
DEFENSIVE END (4)
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ellis, Ebenezer Ekuban, Peppi Zellner and Dimitrius
Underwood
</P>
<P>
   ``Who''' was never in question. The only surprise here is that
``he'' of the troubled past (Underwood) is being counted on in the
rotation. Ellis must pick up where he left off when he was injured
last year. Ekuban is being counted on to have a breakout year as
well. If not, the Cowboys are in trouble. DEFENSIVE TACKLE (5)
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hennings, Alonzo Spellman, Leon Lett, Brandon Noble and
Michael Myers
</P>
<P>
   This group is solid. However, that will not be good enough. The
Cowboys need Hennings, Spellman and Lett to be dominant if they are
going to become legitimate contenders. Spellman has looked the part
in the practice. But he must do it consistently in games. Ditto for
the still cat-quick Lett. LINEBACKER (7)
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Coakley, Dat Nguyen, Darren Hambrick, Joe Bowden, Barron
Wortham, Orantes Grant and Chris Bordano.
</P>
<P>
   Write this group down in pencil because Bordano is not likely to
stay. The Cowboys don't need seven linebackers. They really don't
need three middle linebackers. Bowden and Wortham give the Cowboys
their best set of backups in of more than a decade. Contrary to the
hype, Coakley is the star, not Nguyen. Not yet. SAFETY (4)
</P>
<P>
   Darren Woodson, George Teague, Izell Reese and Chris Akins.
Woodson and Teague make up the most capable starting position on
defense. Reese has made a successful return from neck surgery.
Akins, a special-teams maven, is the updated version of Kenny Gant
and Bill Bates. CORNERBACK (6)
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McNeil, Kareem Larrimore, Charlie Williams, Duane
Hawthorne, Dwayne Goodrich and Mario Edwards
</P>
<P>
   McNeil is the only sure thing here. The Cowboys are looking for
a cornerback to supplant the rookie Larrimore, whether it's the
result of the trade, a waiver-wire pick up or Williams returning to
help. The latter is not likely to happen in time for the season
opener. SPECIALISTS (2)
</P>
<P>
   Tim Seder (kicker) and Micah Knorr (punter)
</P>
<P>
   Kickers coach Steve Hoffman has seemingly done it again. Seder
and Knorr appear to be the second coming of Richie Cunningham and
Toby Gowin _ or is that Chris Boniol and John Jett? Besides if
Seder doesn't make it, veteran kickers Eddie Murray and Doug
Pelfrey are a phone call away. PRACTICE SQUAD CANDIDATES
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Clint Stoerner, defensive end Bryant Shaw, defensive
end Aaron Fields, receiver Damon Hodge and running back Troy
Hambrick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys plan to field a full practice squad. These are the
top candidates. Fields and Hambrick are the mostly likely targets
to get picked up by other teams. A cornerback, maybe Sunday cut
Stephen Fisher, could sneak on to the practice squad if a spot
becomes available. nn

KARL HOPES FOR CHANCE TO STICK IN ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Scott Karl, whom the Angels acquired from the
Colorado Rockies last week, will become the 13th pitcher to start a
game for the Angels this season when he takes the mound Tuesday
against the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Karl averaged 11 wins and 33 starts for four consecutive seasons
with the Brewers from 1996-99 but struggled this season after being
traded to the Rockies, going 2-3 with a 7.68 ERA. He began the
season in the starting rotation but was demoted to the bullpen
before being traded to the Angels for a player to be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``My consistency and the numbers I put up in Milwaukee were a
result of me being out there every fifth day,'' Karl said. ``Over
the course of a season, everybody will have a slump and a hot
streak. It's what you do in the middle that dictates the kind of
season you have.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Milwaukee, I started every five days. In Colorado, I never
got that opportunity. I don't know if they were impatient or just
wanted to go in a different direction. But the routine I was used
to was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He might not get that routine with the Angels, either, as their
rotation has been a revolving door, shuttling pitchers between the
mound and the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (manager Mike) Scioscia's call,'' Karl said. ``I've
done my best when they run me out there every five days. I hope for
that opportunity here.''
</P>
<P>
   PERCIVAL READY: Troy Percival returned from his stay on the
disabled list Saturday night and gave up a two-run homer to Travis
Fryman. But Scioscia said Percival is ``ready to get back on the
horse'' and resume his role as the club's closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Troy Percival is our closer,'' Scioscia said. ``He
didn't lose the position because of an injury. The way our bullpen
lines up, we're much better with Percy in the closer's spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa assumed the role in Percival's absence,
saving four of five opportunities. But he will return to his role
as a set-up man.
</P>
<P>
   Percival has been working on a new pitch, a cut fastball, and he
threw it a few times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's looking for is to have some kind of breaking pitch
he can get into the zone when his curveball is not working for
him,'' Scioscia said. ``It can be an effective pitch for him. It's
another weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE REHAB: Pitcher Tim Belcher made a rehab start for Single-A
Lake Elsinore on Sunday night. Scioscia said Belcher will need one
or two more rehab starts before he'll be considered for the
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Jarrod Washburn (stress fracture in shoulder) and Seth
Etherton (tendinitis in shoulder) continue to rehab their injuries.
Washburn is closer to returning than Etherton but is still a week
to two weeks away from beginning a rehab assignment. &QL;

   Hits keep coming as Helton chases .400
</P>
<P>
   By RICHARD JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Todd Helton's preparation has begun more than five
hours before game time. After catching a cab to Three Rivers
Stadium, he has changed into baseball cleats, gym shorts and a
T-shirt to join a half-dozen other Colorado Rockies for an early
round of batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before stepping into the batting cage, he is casually
chatting with two reporters, but the small talk abruptly stops and
the smile disappears when his workday begins. Over the next few
hours, he will take this early round of batting practice, follow it
with the standard pre-game hitting, and finally have a last-minute
one-on-one session beneath the stands with Rockies hitting
instructor Clint Hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a videotape study session and perhaps a
glance at the notebook he keeps on dozens of opposing pitchers.
Once prone to ``beating myself up after every bad at-bat,'' Helton
seems as unflappable as any player in the big leagues, thanks in
part to these long workdays that force him to think only of the
next task or the next at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   His work is paying off. Long touted as one of the game's next
great hitters, Helton, 27, has fulfilled all his potential and then
some in his third full major-league season. He's among the National
League leaders in a host of offensive categories, from RBIs and
hits to doubles and runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a Nintendo machine,'' said Rockies shortstop Neifi
Perez, himself a budding star. ``It's just ping, ping, ping.
Single, double, homer. He's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that batting average, which is at .394 after
Helton went 2-for-4 in a 9-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on
Sunday afternoon. No major leaguer has carried such a lofty average
this late in a season since George Brett made a run at .400 two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   That magical barrier hasn't been cracked since Ted Williams hit
.406 in 1941. Helton has consistently downplayed talk of .400,
saying it's not even a goal and he doesn't feel comfortable talking
about it. But on this day, he's relaxed and chatty and confident
enough to discuss the possibility of reaching a milestone that
ranks alongside Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak as one of
baseball's most sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's realistic,'' he said. ``There's 30-something
games left, and I have to hit a little over .400 in that stretch. I
think I've done that before. It's realistic when you look at it
that way. I don't like talking about it. When you talk about it,
it's harder to separate yourself from it. You don't want it to
become the focus of the game and why I'm going out there and
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a sweet lefthanded swing that reminds some of former
Yankees great Don Mattingly, Helton has spewed hits all over the
place this summer, reaching base in 114 of the 126 games he has
started. He's hitting .413 since the All-Star break, and 10 days
ago he briefly got his average above .400.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? He's hitting .545 with the bases loaded, .432 with
runners on base and .387 after the seventh inning. Best of all,
according to those who know him best, he has done it the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works his tail off,'' Rockies manager Buddy Bell said.
``This is a very hard game, and he's making it look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In these first swings in the batting cage, Helton seems focused
on nothing except the pitcher. He stands upright in the box and
wiggles the barrel of the bat directly over his head as he awaits
the pitch. Then, as it's delivered, he raises his front foot for an
instant, cocks the bat behind his left ear, and explodes toward the
ball in one silky motion of power and grace.
</P>
<P>
   Helton has complained he doesn't have one of those classically
beautiful lefty swings, that his stroke never will be as
picturesque as that of Brett or Rafael Palmeiro. Typically, he's
being too critical of himself, because on this day, his swing is as
graceful and easy to watch as any in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many people have walked the walk he's walking right
now,'' Hurdle said. ``I told him to enjoy it. It's all that hard
work that has gotten him to this point. He shouldn't let it lock
him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton was hitting .370 on Aug. 4, but he began to make a
serious run at .400 by going 19-for-29 on a road trip to Montreal
and New York and getting his average as high as .400 during one
game. He has not finished a game above .400, but he has stayed in
the .390s despite having back-to-back hitless games last week for
the first time since June 22-23.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Brett went over .400 on Aug. 17 and was above it as
late as Sept. 4. He slipped to .399 on Sept. 5 and finished at 390.
(Tony Gwynn finished at .394 in 1994, but a strike ended the season
Aug. 12.)
</P>
<P>
   Hurdle, who played with Brett in Kansas City and remains a close
friend, has told Helton some of what Brett went through that summer
of '80. He has spoken of the attention and how Brett handled the
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``George would never let an opposing pitcher see if he was
struggling,'' Hurdle said. ``He'd go back in the tunnel, and we
could hear him letting off steam. We'd go back and check to see if
he'd hurt himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd is different. He's under control all the time. I've
wondered how he lets the steam off. They're similar in that both of
them have the ability to drive the ball from line to line. Whatever
is asked of them to do to help the team win is first and foremost.
They have the ability to have the focus and concentration to just
hit the ball hard somewhere and to not get caught up in any of the
periphery, any of the external environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are extremely disciplined at the plate. Brett, who played
in just 117 games in 1980, struck out only 22 times in 449 at-bats
that season. Helton has struck out 43 times in 465 at-bats this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never saw George swing at as many balls outside the strike
zone as Todd will,'' Hurdle said. ``Todd will expand the strike
zone at times. At times, he's more of a slasher. George had
tremendous control of the strike zone. If George took a pitch,
there was a pretty good chance it wasn't a strike. Todd has great
recognition of the strike zone, but he knows what he can get out
after. George didn't venture much outside the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton arrived in the big leagues to stay when first baseman
Andres Galarraga left the Rockies to sign with the Atlanta Braves
after the 1997 season. Wearing jersey No. 17 because of his
admiration for Cubs veteran Mark Grace, Helton immediately reminded
some of Grace with a lefthanded stroke that sprayed line drives
from foul line to foul line.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .315 in his first full season and finished second to Cubs
righthander Kerry Wood in the 1998 National League Rookie of the
Year voting. He got even better in his second season, hitting 320.
Last winter, he went back to Knoxville, Tenn., with three goals: to
start the season hotter, to hit lefties better and to hit better on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. A career .240 hitter in April, he burst from
the gates this season, batting. 367 during the opening month. He's
also hitting .336 against lefties, a 69-point improvement on his
career average against them. And on the road, he's hitting .362,
which is 100 points better than his career average away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a goal-oriented person,'' he said. ``That's
what's fun about the whole thing. You set goals, and you strive for
them. If you don't have goals, what makes you better?''
</P>
<P>
   His workaholic personality comes through in virtually every
interview as he looks the reporter in the eye, politely answers
each question and even attempts a joke or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind the attention,'' he said, ``but I'm not seeking
it out. Someone told me it was the result of doing well. That's a
good way to look at it. But I'm still not going to be doing any
stand-up routines.''
</P>
<P>
   He married a former University of Tennessee classmate two
winters ago, taking her to a baseball fantasy camp before their
honeymoon began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have someone to share your life with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also close to Hurdle, who was Colorado's minor-league
hitting instructor when Helton began his career. These days, the
two discuss virtually every at-bat. They're also friends off the
field, exchanging advice on a number of subjects, including their
personal reading lists (both recently finished Hannibal and are
making their way through a sampling of James Lee Burke thrillers).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built a trust in one another over a lot of years,''
Hurdle said. ``I can suggest he try something that maybe someone
who doesn't have the history with him can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton grew up in the heart of Volunteer country, in Knoxville,
Tenn., with an older brother and younger sister. His father Jerry
played briefly in the Minnesota Twins organization but left
baseball when his first son was born.
</P>
<P>
   From his earliest days, Helton recalls the miniature batting
cage in his basement. He was a two-sport star (baseball and
football) at Knox Central High, where his perfectionist nature was
already detectable.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him what kind of grades he got, and he will focus on the
lone B _ the only class in which he didn't receive an A during high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honors English class,'' he said. ``I was supposed to
read a bunch of books over the summer but was playing baseball and
didn't have time to read them. I tried to alibi through all those
books.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Helton had two choices: sign a baseball
contract with the San Diego Padres or accept a football scholarship
from Tennessee. Thanks to some parental persuasion, he accepted the
football scholarship, but after four days of two-a-days, he was
rethinking the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my family and decided to stay with football,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His heart apparently was never in it. He did start four games
for the Vols between the Heath Shuler and Peyton Manning eras. But
even as he played football, it was his passion for baseball that
bubbled to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``College football wasn't something that excited me,'' he said.
``Don't get me wrong. I tried my best. It wasn't like I didn't
care. But I always felt I was behind. I hadn't been to spring
practice or anything like that. I was hitting in a cage while
others were lifting weights and getting stronger. It's easier to
work at something you like.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he remembered from those days, he said: ``I do
remember certain plays, but you could fit them all on one VCR
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes his offseason home in Knoxville, and there's still a
bit of Tennessee orange running through his blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I can sing Rocky Top,'' he said. ``No, I'm not going
to.''
</P>
<P>
   He got a second chance at baseball when the Rockies made him the
eighth pick of the 1995 draft. He began his career at Class A
Asheville, N.C., and climbed steadily up the organization's ladder.
His batting average climbed each season, from .254 at Asheville in
1995 to .352 at Class AAA Colorado Springs in 1997. He made an
impression in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Helton take a round of batting practice one
spring, former Rockies manager Don Baylor issued the following
order: ``Don't anyone mess with this kid's swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested Helton's hitting .400 wouldn't be a
legitimate achievement because he plays half his games in the
hitter-friendly confines of Coors Field. It's true Helton is
hitting .425 at home and .362 on the road, but that argument
overlooks the fact most hitters develop a comfort zone in their
home parks. It also overlooks the fact Williams hit .428 at Fenway
Park and .380 on the road in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree it's difficult for guys who play in Denver to hit on
the road,'' Helton said. ``Denver is such a good place to hit, and
when you go on the road, it's such a contrast. What you have to do
is take the same feeling when you step into the box. You have to
take the same feeling you have in Colorado on the road with you.
It's hard to do, but it's something you have to program to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Helton needs his home-field advantage late in the season,
he's going to have it. The Rockies play 18 of their last 27 games
at home, including nine of their last 12.
</P>
<P>
   Helton knows the next few weeks of his life will be hectic if he
keeps his batting average near .400. He has spoken to Hurdle enough
to know the microscope under which Brett lived in 1980. He also
watched the 1998 Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa circus from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would mean more to him than he lets on,'' teammate
Jeff Cirillo said. ``I mean, he has a chance to do something people
will remember forever. I think he'll do it, too. What will bother
him is if it begins to be a distraction for the team.''

   Eusebio travels slow road to club-record hitting streak
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Tony Eusebio is taking the scenic route into the
Astros' record book.
</P>
<P>
   In a journey that has spanned almost two months, Eusebio tied
the club record by hitting safely in his 23rd consecutive game
during the Astros' 7-3 victory over the Montreal Expos on Sunday at
Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio delivered his record-tying hit with a double down the
right-field line off Expos starter Trey Moore in the fourth inning.
He joined Art Howe (1981) and Luis Gonzalez (1997) for the longest
hitting streak in club history.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio, a 33-year-old catcher who has been relegated to backup
duties for most of this season, added an RBI double in the fifth
and a solo home run in the eighth to cap a 3-for-4 afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's doing is amazing,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``You don't hear of any supposed `backup catchers' _
guys who don't play a lot _ having 23-game hitting streaks.''
</P>
<P>
   While sharing playing time with rookie Mitch Meluskey, Eusebio
has put together a streak _ the longest active one in the majors _
spanning 50 days and 44 Astros games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to have this long of a streak, especially
since I don't play every day,'' said Eusebio, who had a 24-game
hitting streak while with Class AAA Tucson in 1993. ``My job the
last three or four years has been as a backup, but when they need
me in an emergency, I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio's 23-game hitting streak is the fifth-longest by a
catcher since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio began the streak July 9 _ in the final game before the
All-Star break _ with a single in the fourth inning off Kansas
City's Jeff Suppan. Since then, Eusebio has raised his laverage
from .203 to .285. During the streak, he is batting .405
(34-for-84).
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself I have an opportunity to get my batting average
up,'' said Eusebio, who went 7-for-12 in the three-game series with
the Expos. ``Every time I've gone to play I haven't thought about
the streak just getting a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   So how hard is it to not go hitless in 50 days? Consider that
when Pete Rose set the modern National League record of 44
consecutive games with a hit in 1978, he did it in 47 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he'll probably finish the season with a 24-game
hitting streak since he doesn't play every day,'' Bagwell joked.
``That makes it even more impressive. I can't express to people how
hard it is to maintain a string when you don't see live pitching
every day. I can't go more than one day without facing a pitcher.
Otherwise, I'm all screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Eusebio had two doubles and a home run in his final
three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Sandy Koufax could get him out right now,''
pitcher Jose Lima said.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, STARS, MAVERICKS ARE ONLY RELIEF IN SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a perfect local August, it would rain twice a week with an
average temp of 75. The sports media would just be returning from
two weeks of Dallas Cowboys training camp in Waikiki. The Texas
Rangers' bullpen would not be returning from a certain isolated
beach property in the Pacific, having been voted ``on'' the island
_ forever. A federal law would ban NFL exhibition games. Lone Star
Park would be offering full refunds on losing wagers.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, of course, has instead given us an August from the
deepest depths of jock-kingdom hell. And worst of all, in a month
of sporting worsts around here, the ongoing boredom has been the
hardest. It makes us crazy. It made one of us open the door naked
when the cops were knocking. It makes some of us talk in tongues,
mumbling to ourselves such gibberish as:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurry, hockey. Hurry, hoops.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be long now, friends. So hang on. August is expiring,
and the Dallas Stars are coming back, then the Dallas Mavericks are
coming back. Rain can't be far behind, and while in this delusional
state, why not wish for a snowstorm before Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when the NHL was a foreign concept, you would
have been given a Hatcher high-stick to the head for thinking
outloud that a hockey season would someday be our salvation from
the August blast furnace. Just 10 months ago, the Mavericks ranked
behind the Pro Bass Tour as a sporting endeavor most likely to wet
your bait.
</P>
<P>
   But in eager anticipation, while also knowing instant relief is
needed from the Rangers and from those five Cowboys exhibition
games, the following is a brief capsule of what's coming on ice and
wood.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, with their established championship pedigree, report
to training camp in Vail, Colo., on Sept. 8. On Oct. 4, camp opens
for the Mavericks, who have wandered our streets, unloved and
ignored for more than a decade. Now, however, there has been a
sudden reversal in public perception. Who says it's impossible to
out-Jerry Jerry? Someday soon will Jerry be trying to out-Cuban
Cuban?
</P>
<P>
   In the category of boredom this summer, the Stars' off-season
activity ranked right up there with the Rangers and the Cowboys. If
you wanted some fun, then you tried to keep up with Mark Cuban, who
has his ownership speedometer stuck on 90 mph. But check his tires
_ are they Firestone?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of meddling, does Cuban dream up all these trade
proposals on his own, like a Fantasy League geek? Where did this
latest thing come from? Who the heck thought the troublesome
Christian Laettner was a fit with the Mavericks? Is it the same guy
who also pursued Shawn Kemp (unsuccessfully, thank goodness)
earlier this summer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer from Cuban:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie, Del, Sidney, Keith Grant, etc., all get involved in
the discussions about a player.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Don Nelson, Del Harris, Sidney Moncrief and Grant,
who is the assistant GM to Big Nellie. Cuban is telling us these
are basketball decisions, not Cuban decisions. Does that make
anybody feel better?
</P>
<P>
   But without question, it's the Cuban enthusiasm, and the Cuban
money, fueling a renewed interest level in the Mavericks, combined
with the team's strong finish and strong work ethic that was on
display last season.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite is Stars GM Bob Gainey, the steady,
dependable, spotlight-shy mastermind of hockey success at Valley
Ranch. But for those of us who thought it was a bummer summer for
Gainey, along comes Stars coach Ken Hitchcock to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was presented the list of local and leaguewide knocks
on the Stars doing nothing to improve in this off-season. Such as:
</P>
<P>
   Lack of overall speed not being addressed. ``Wrong,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We will add speed, but it's green speed. Young players like
Jon Sim, Roman Lyashenko, (Richard) Jackman and others will be
expected to provide this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of scoring firepower. ``Better health solves this,'' said
Hitchcock, meaning Jere Lehtinen, Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie
Langenbrunner opening the season at full speed. Plus, Brett Hull's
regular-season slump appeared to be cured in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of leadership, with the heart and soul of Guy Carbonneau
retired. ``This is a challenge,'' Hitchcock said. ``You don't just
automatically replace what Guy gave us. We do have the people who
can provide the necessary leadership, and now there is no excuse
for them not to step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a lack of toughness. How in the heck was a Scott
Thornton allowed to walk in free agency? And then Dave Manson, too?
``Well,'' said Hitchcock, who paused on this issue, ``this is why
coaches have to stay the hell out of the money end of the business.
We want to re-sign everybody. As far as toughness, we have some
people who will have to prove themselves in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the plus and minus factors, the welcome sign is out for
the Stars and Mavericks. Hurry, hockey. Hurry, hoops. We need you.
And soon. nn

<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, N.J. _ Putt after putt had refused to fall,
afternoon had given way to early evening, and it was apparent that
only a miracle could save James Driscoll in Sunday's final match of
the 100th US Amateur Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeless?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of, yeah,'' said Driscoll. ``But I never really thought
I'd blown it because the match was never over, so . . .''
</P>
<P>
   So why not a miracle? It came in the form of a three-hole
stretch over fabled Baltusrol Golf Club's upper course, a series of
shots that helped erase Jeff Quinney's 3-up lead and propel
Driscoll into overtime in this oldest of US golf championships.
Driscoll, 22, the pride of Brookline, Mass., and Charles River CC
in Newton, won the 34th hole with a conceded birdie, the 35th with
a knee-knocking 8-foot birdie putt, and the 36th with a 4-foot putt
for par after a Houdini escape from the pine trees down the right
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   The stirring finish forced extra holes, but after matching pars
at the first and second, Driscoll and Quinney were defeated by
weather. With lightning in the area, play was halted with Driscoll
and Quinney standing on the 193-yard, par-3 third tee, the 39th
hole of the match. They will return at 9 Monday morning to continue
the sudden death, a reality that met with mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish we could have finished,'' said Driscoll, who lost
the first hole of the 36-hole match and never would get it all
squared until 35 holes later. ``Not because I might have had some
momentum, but just to get it over with tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinney, dejected after his day-long lead had vanished, greeted
the stoppage with open arms. ``I'm trying to keep my head high,''
he said. ``I'm still in there, but I'm tired. It's a fresh day.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll conceded he, too, was exhausted because it was long day
of putting woes, crucial shots, and situations that you rarely see.
Regardless of how Monday's restart turns out, whether it lasts one
hole or a dozen or even more, it will have a hard time matching the
drama and bizarre turn of events that dominated 38 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we wouldn't be calling it drama if not for Driscoll's
comeback, which started at the par-4 16th, the 34th of the day. And
as it is with most comebacks, this came courtesy of a leader's
tentative swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game left me,'' said Quinney, who was 2 up after the
morning portion but quickly doubled that lead when Driscoll started
the afternoon bogey-bogey. ``I just didn't feel comfortable. I just
didn't finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinney was dormie, 3 up with three to play, when he fell apart
and pumped life into Driscoll's fading hopes.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the fairway on the 16th, was short of the green in
two, and chipped long after watching Driscoll knock his approach
within 20 feet. When Quinney fluffed his fourth shot and pitched
long with his fifth, he conceded Driscoll's putt and tried to
regroup at the 566-yard, par-5 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Quinney did, too, slamming a drive left-center and a perfect
layup to get within 100 yards of the pin. Driscoll spoiled a great
drive by pushing his layup right into a bunker 60 yards short of
the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest shot in golf,'' said Driscoll, who knew he
couldn't treat it like a typical bunker shot. ``Way too long to
blast it. There's really no other way to play it except kind of try
to punch-hook it.''
</P>
<P>
   He pulled it off perfectly, knocking it within 8 feet of the
pin. Quinney was 15 feet away with his third shot, then missed his
birdie putt. The pressure was all on Driscoll, who had been
frustrated hole after hole with a putting stroke that left him
baffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the get-go, I missed a short one on the first
hole,'' he said, ``and my putting is very much determined on how I
putt in the beginning of a round.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been but two birdies in the morning and one in the
afternoon _ not counting the conceded one on the 34th hole _ and as
he stared down this 8-footer at the 35th hole he didn't flinch. ``I
didn't have any more or less confidence than I always do over a
putt.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw the left-to-right, downhill break, ``a cup-and-a-half
outside the hole,'' and he knew he had to make it. He probably had
put himself in a similar make-believe situation thousands of times
in all those years since he first started whacking balls around
Charles River CC. But this time, well, it was for real.
</P>
<P>
   It was also dead in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did exactly what I thought it was going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Needing to win the 36th hole to extend the match, Driscoll tried
to compose himself, but he did too good a job. He threw a relaxed
swing on the ball and pushed it into the pine trees and was jolted
to find his ball resting against a pine cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure the ball was touching. I wasn't going to risk
a two-shot penalty at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   He had three options _ hit it backward where the opening was
wide; directly sideways where the opening was a little less wide;
or go forward, where the gap was narrow. ``Hey,'' he said to
himself, ``I might as well go as far up as I can,'' and he threw a
punch shot on first the pine cone, then the ball. The pine cone
splattered; the ball ran underneath branches, between small pine
bushes, and came to rest 144 yards from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Quinney, who had driven poorly and was 135 yards out after his
second shot, watched helplessly as Driscoll lifted a pitching wedge
to 4 feet. He had led the festivities since about 9:35 in the
morning, but now, with darkness falling, he was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 15-footer for birdie to end it, but missed.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure back to Driscoll, who wasted little time settling over
the 4-footer. ``It caught the right edge and snuck in,'' said
Driscoll, whose enthusiastic gallery roared. His parents, sister,
five brothers, dozens of cousins, and countless friends from
Charles River CC rushed the green, but Driscoll looked at none of
them. He cast his eyes skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it went in,'' he said. ``I was just thanking
God at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   He had dodged plenty of obstacles, none more incredible than the
par-5 eighth hole in the afternoon. Already 3 down at that point,
Driscoll had driven well left beneath a tree and for some reason he
chose to gamble. He pulled out a 3-wood and convinced himself that
he had enough room to swing hard.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The club got caught in a tree branch, and while he knew
he would look silly, Driscoll knew something else _ he could have
been called for a penalty had he stopped his swing. So he followed
through _ and whiffed. That's right, he missed.
</P>
<P>
   But he regrouped with a punched iron that put him in position to
reach the green with his fourth shot. When he missed his par
attempt, he had only one hope _ a three-putt bogey by Quinney, who
obliged, running his 20-foot downhill birdie try a good 15 feet
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone 4 up,'' said Quinney, shaking his head in
disbelief. ``I hit a terrible putt.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a feeling Driscoll could relate to _ at least for the
first 33 holes.

CLINTON URGES NIGERIA TO ACT ON AIDS AND ITS PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for rewriting thruout, story is now 2 takes) 
By MARC LACEY  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  ABUJA, Nigeria _ President Clinton urged Nigerians Sunday to
eliminate the taboos associated with AIDS in Africa, and to
confront what he called the ``tyranny'' of the disease with the
same resolve they showed in enduring decades of dictatorship.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Is it harder to talk about these things than to watch a child
die of AIDS who could have lived if the rest of us had done our
part?'' the president asked at a women's conference here. ``Is it
harder to talk about than to comfort a child whose mother has died?
We have to break the silence about how this disease spreads and how
to prevent it. And we need to fight AIDS, not people with AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks presented a bold challenge, not only to
Nigerians but to all in Africa, where health experts have lamented
the fact that the stigma surrounding the disease and inadequate
public education about its dangers have contributed to the spread
of AIDS. An estimated 23 million Africans carry HIV, the virus that
causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But while the president offered U.S. support for Nigerian
efforts to confront AIDS, he offered no new assistance. Africans
reacted coolly to the United States' offer last month of $1 billion
in annual loans to finance the purchase of anti-AIDS drugs in
sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that the approach would merely add
to the already heavy debt burden of African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the day addressing some of the most pressing
problems in Africa: AIDS, poverty, joblessness and soaring national
debt. He ventured from the Nigerian capital to a rural village to
get a glimpse of how a vast majority of Nigerians live and, winding
up a two-day visit to Africa's newest democracy, he encouraged
Nigerian businessmen to work to expand the economy beyond its heavy
reliance on oil.
</P>
<P>
   Under a morning rain, the village chief, Muhammadu Baba, led
Clinton through the muddy walkways traversing the village of
Ushafa, where tin-roof huts house several thousand residents, as
well as houses of worship, a pharmacy and health clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The president, accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, received a
rousing welcome as schoolchildren bearing tiny American flags sang
greetings and native dancers spun around him in the center square.
Clinton, to the delight of onlookers, slipped into a traditional
Nigerian robe and held aloft a handmade hoe, both official gifts of
the village.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a hotel conference room in Abuja, Clinton told
business executives that Nigeria would be added to the list of
developing countries that receive duty-free status for their
exports, and he vowed to increase ties between Nigeria and the
United States, its largest export market. The elimination of
tariffs could increase demand for Nigerian exports including cocoa,
cotton, hand-made traditional textiles, minerals and forest
products.
</P>
<P>
   But it was at a midday appearance before a crowded women's
conference that Clinton addressed the health plight that if left
unchecked, he said, would stymie the country even if political and
economic reforms took root.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside a man infected with the virus that has become
the continent's leading killer, Clinton applauded Nigeria's efforts
to control the spread of AIDS. But he offered a blunt reminder to
Africans that the disease is preventable _ if people would only
speak frankly about how it is spread, and take common-sense action.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is 100 percent preventable _ if we are willing to deal
with it openly and honestly,'' he said. ``In every country, in any
culture, it is difficult, painful, at the very least, embarrassing
to talk about the issues involved with AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   The president announced no new funds for Nigeria's AIDS fight
but he detailed the $20 million the United States will spend this
year to control the spread of AIDS, malaria and polio in Nigeria.
He reported that AIDS education would be included as part of the
military training that United States troops are giving to Nigerian
peacekeepers headed to nearby Sierra Leone, which has been ravaged
by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience of young people, religious leaders and
women at the conference in Abuja that Nigerians, despite the
introduction of civilian rule last year, would never be free until
they bring infectious diseases under control. An estimated 5.4
percent of Nigeria's 114 million people are infected with the AIDS
virus, according to the White House, giving it one of the highest
infection rates on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed at the courage of the people of Nigeria in
struggling against the oppression that you endured for too long
until you got your democracy,'' Clinton said. ``I urge you now to
show that same kind of courage to beat the tyranny of this disease
so you can keep your democracy alive for all the children of
Nigeria and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, frustrated by the lack of action by some African
governments, have praised President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria
for making the fight against AIDS a priority. But Obasanjo stressed
Sunday that Nigeria would need help from the rest of the world to
win its struggle against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a disease you can say if you eradicate it in
Nigeria, it is eradicated for good,'' Obasanjo said. ``Those from
Nigeria who go outside and have sexual relations with those who
have HIV-AIDS or have blood transfusions with them will bring it
back. We don't see it as a Nigerian disease. We see it as a world
disease that is ravaging Africa most.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Clinton's two-day visit here, Obasanjo has repeatedly
raised the issue of debt relief, encouraging the wealthy nations of
the world to forgive the large sums amassed by previous African
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, elected 15 months ago as part of Nigeria's tenuous
transition to democracy, did not directly address the U.S. AIDS
plan Sunday. But in toasting Clinton at a state dinner on Saturday
night, he made a plea for financial relief from the United States
and other wealthy nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we cannot achieve our desire for economic
development if we continue to bleed from the gushing wounds of an
ever-penetrating debt-repayment lance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in addressing business leaders Sunday, said past
leaders of Nigeria _ a country that has suffered under corrupt
dictators for most of its modern history _ had squandered its
riches and must be careful to focus any debt relief on improving
the lives of its people.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Ushafa, Clinton saw how far Nigeria must still
progress. The village lacks telephone service and running water and
received electricity only several months ago. Clinton entered a
small medical clinic that had been stocked with supplies by the
State Department just the day before.
</P>
<P>
   One worker told the president that the clinic had treated 234
cases of malaria this year. There are no HIV cases, villagers said,
although nearby villages have cases and urban areas are heavily
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. assistance to Nigeria includes $2 million in the
current budget to produce insecticide-treated bed nets to keep
malaria-infected mosquitoes at bay, as well as $9 million to battle
polio and $10 million to assist the anti-AIDS fight. The White
House has requested a $100 million increase, to $342 million, in
international AIDS funds in the 2001 fiscal year budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just Nigeria's fight, or Africa's fight,'' Clinton
said. ``It is America's fight and the world's fight too.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks heartened John Ibekwe, who heads an
organization in Nigeria for people living with AIDS. ``With you as
an advocate on our side, governments in Africa will do more than
they are doing,'' Ibekwe said in introducing the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who restricted his travel in Nigeria partly for
security reasons, leaves for Tanzania early Monday for an update
from former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa on the Burundi
peace talks. He began his day at a Baptist church in Abuja, where
he heard the Rev. Israel Akanji preach on the parable of the Good
Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbers have come; bandits have come,'' Akanji said of his
country's struggles against its own leaders. ``We have been left
wounded, bleeding and dying. Is there a Good Samaritan passing
by?''

AFTER CARRIAGE RIDE, A SCARY TIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 3rd graf to remove description of horse.)  
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four tourists were slightly hurt Sunday when a
horse-drawn carriage tipped onto its side in Central Park, tossing
the tourists, a vacationing British family, onto the asphalt, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 11:15 a.m. just inside the park near
its entrance at Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The carriage driver, Naim Aydin, said he had just completed a
circuit of the park with the family aboard and had stopped at a
trough to water the horse. As he led the animal through a left
turn, the old green carriage tilted past its balance point and
suddenly slammed onto its side, dumping out Colin Howe, 55, his
wife, Pauline, 54, and Charlotte and Michael, their two children,
who are 13 and 10. The police did not know where the Howes lived in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just fell over,'' Aydin said. ``I am unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the accident created an alarming scene _ the Howes were
strapped to immobilizing back boards and then taken away in
ambulances _ the authorities said the accident was not serious. The
Howes were treated at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center and
released. A hospital administrator said they had minor cuts in
bruises and planned to resume their vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Aydin nor the horse, which he said was brought to the
city from upstate two days before, were injured. The horse
apparently did not tip with the carriage.
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent damage to the carriage was a dent on the left
fender. The horse was led by hand back to its stable on West 52nd
Street and 12th Avenue, leaving Aydin and a friend to grunt and
sweat as they pushed the carriage 13 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Two men familiar with the carriage said it was a model, made 50
to 100 years ago in Canada, that is known to be easily tipped.
Aydin said he did not own the carriage and declined to give the
owner's name.

USC EARNED VICTORY OVER PENN STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's cardinal-and-gold edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   If you read any of the preseason college football magazines,
then you know Penn State had been downgraded from Nittany Lion to
Pretty Kitty. Joe Paterno may have to wait until 2001 to get the
seven wins he needs to tie Bear Bryant's NCAA Division I win
record.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been so long since USC's defense actually got after an
opponent that no restrictions will be placed on their 29-3 win
Sunday at the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   USC's defense held Penn State to six rushing yards, and that's a
pretty sweet number even if you concede that Lion quarterback
Rashard Casey played like he was handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   It shines when compared to last season, when USC's defense was
stomped by Arizona (307 yards), Stanford (160) and Arizona State
(213), and allowed 21 or more points in 8 of 12 games. Going back
to mid-1996, USC's defense had allowed 21 points or more in 26 of
42 games, and gone 9-17 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   With Sultan McCullough, Kareem Kelly and Carson Palmer, one has
to believe the Trojans can average 30 points a game, even in spite
of Sunday's modest offensive effort. If Zeke Moreno and ex-Long
Beach City College linebacker Markus Steele can just contain
opponents, then USC has every right to believe it can return to the
Top 10 and Rose Bowl. ...
</P>
<P>
   Penn State returned only two starters on defense, but
McCullough's 137-yard effort still stands out as progress for the
running game. USC netted just 31 yards a year ago against Oregon
and minus 20 yards against Arizona, and neither team had a great
defense. ...
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about these ``extra'' games in college football
is the glare of the spotlight. Florida State gets bored beating BYU
and people say the Seminoles are down from last season. USC will
undoubtedly jump into the top ten now and leave most everyone
expecting a rout of Colorado in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's a quality program, and I'm guessing Gary Barnett, who
lost to USC in the '96 Rose Bowl when he was at Northwestern, will
be looking to even that score. ...
</P>
<P>
   One can talk all day about the intangibles of the Yankees and
Braves and the pitching depth of the A's and Mariners. But who
makes and misses the playoffs more than likely will come down to
the kind of schedule the contenders have in September.
</P>
<P>
   American League, team by team:
</P>
<P>
   Yankees: They have more road games left than the other AL
contenders except the Angels, but they also have the second-best
road record in the league. The Yankees, four up on Boston in the
East, have just three games left with the Red Sox (Sept. 8-10), and
Toronto could be DOA when they meet for two series inside of a long
week. The Yankees finish with the Tigers, Rays and Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox: The best time to take the Sox temperature is next
week, after this week's games against the A's and Angels.
Thereafter, they have just a three-game series with Cleveland and a
series against Boston the last week. Even with fractured pitching,
they're eight games up on Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners and A's: They almost have identical schedules. Both
have a series coming up with Boston, followed by a run of games
against sub-.500 teams and a AL West round-robin the last 10 days.
The A's play four in Seattle, but they're home to Chicago this week
while the pitching-wracked Mariners are at the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Angels: Mike Scioscia's team is just 2{ games out of the wild
card spot, but they have only 12 home games left and a 27-34 road
record. However, after a three-game series at Chicago this weekend,
the next six series are against sub-.500 teams before ending the
season with the A's and Mariners. Considering the way the Angels
have rebounded from some heartbreaking losses, it would be
shortsighted to say they're done.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox, Blue Jays and Indians: The Blue Jays are done, with six
of their next seven series against the Yankees, White Sox and A.L.
West leaders. Cleveland's rally has been impressive, but they'll
have to do more than split a sequence that includes the White Sox,
Yankees and Red Sox twice in mid-September. Boston needs to step up
during a brief homestand against Seattle and Oakland, what with the
Yankees and Indians still to come. ...
</P>
<P>
   National League, team-by-team:
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals: After next weekend's series at home versus the Mets,
the Cards don't face a team with a winning record the rest of the
season. Who needs Mark McGwire with a slate like this?
</P>
<P>
   Braves and Mets: Their race to decide the N.L. East champ will
likely encompass the wild card as well. The schedule favors the
Mets, what with Atlanta having two series left with Arizona, both
coming before two series with the Mets the last two weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   N.L. West: The Giants next six series are against sub-.500
teams, while Arizona has two series against Atlanta and two more
with the Dodgers. The Giants could have the division padlocked by
the time they play seven games against the Snakes the last 11 days
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hope to stay within sight of the Giants until they
launch a 13-game homestand. But the Giants would still need to give
back a lot of games, and the Dodgers would have to figure a way to
overcome a 32-30 home record. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen a major-league hitter take more good pitches
than Dodgers center fielder Tom Goodwin. Sometimes you can be too
patient. ...
</P>
<P>
   Don't say Davey Johnson can't play little ball. The winning run
Sunday in the Cubs game came on a walk, sacrifice, ground ball to
advance the runner to third, and wild pitch. Just like the days of
Maury Wills and Jim Gilliam. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that Ismael Valdes took a huge step in
rehabilitating his reputation in the club house by plunking Mark
Grace on the arm Sunday. It earned him an ejection, but it was the
kind of statement his reputation needed. ...
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball did Tommy Lasorda's U.S. Olympic baseball
team no favors. Several teams refused to allow their top prospects
on the team. Third baseman Joe Crede (White Sox), first baseman
Carlos Pena (Rangers) and pitcher Randy Keisler (Yankees) were
among the top minor leaguers the Olympic team couldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Trojan Barry Zito (A's), Aubrey Huff (Tampa Bay) and Craig
House (Rockies) were also on the list before they were called them
up to the majors. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'd get excited about the upcoming Fernando Vargas-Felix
Trinidad 154-pound title bout if I didn't already know that Don
King, Trinidad's promoter, will find some way to screw things up. &QL;

PATRIOTS CUT TWO MORE THAN REQUIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Monday's Patriots roster is different from
Sunday's, and Tuesday's is sure to be different from Monday's as
new coach Bill Belichick attempts to build his team, one that is
still thin at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick Sunday reduced his roster to 51 players, two fewer
than necessary, clearly believing help will be available from
elsewhere. And help is particularly needed at running back and
tight end, where Belichick has only two players each, and at
linebacker, now down to a rather thin five.
</P>
<P>
   The two extra roster spots mean Belichick will closely peruse
the list of players cut by Sunday's 4 p.m. deadline. The Patriots
certainly will have at least two, if not more, players cut by other
teams in Foxborough by midweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what the waiver wire brings,'' said the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an exact science,'' Belichick added of his first
cutdown with New England. ``I'm sure there'll be some mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But few fans could argue with Belichick's surgery, even if the
final cut included one ``name,'' veteran running back Raymont
Harris, and one of former coach Pete Carroll's 1999 starters,
safety Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Not much was expected of the journeyman Harris when he was
signed by New England, and Carter's play ranged from mediocre to
poor last season even though Carroll kept him in the defensive
backfield for virually the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not so much about him but the progress of the other
players,'' Belichick said of Harris, who was released outright. And
the waiving of Carter, who languished on the third team for much of
training camp, came as no surprise. ``We had only so many spots,''
said Belichick, noting that the players he kept in Carter's place
made contributions on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Three local players were waived: wide receiver and fan favorite
Sean Morey of Marshfield and Brown, tight end Chris Eitzmann of
Harvard, and linebacker Marc Megna of Fall River. It is quite
possible that all three could be named to the practice squad;
players who clear waivers by 4 p.m. Monday can be brought back.
</P>
<P>
   One key decision by Belichick was to keep all four of his
quarterbacks, Drew Bledsoe, John Friesz, Michael Bishop, and rookie
Tom Brady, who threw the ball well enough in exhibition games to
suggest he may have a future in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, said Belichick, ``showed us enough where we could keep
him on the roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping all four QBs means that the Patriots have 26 offensive
players (4 QBs, 2 TEs, 2 RBs, 3 fullbacks, 6 wide receivers, and 9
offensive linemen) to 22 on the defensive side. Also on the roster
are kicker Adam Vinatieri, punter Lee Johnson, and Lonnie Paxton,
he of the laser beam long snaps. But those numbers could change
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick also placed rookie offensive lineman Adrian Klemm, a
second-round draft choice, on the physically unable to perform
list. This means Klemm (knee) cannot return for at least six weeks.
The coach, though, said he expects Klemm to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, veteran offensive lineman Lance Scott (knee) was placed on
the injured reserve list, meaning that he cannot return this
season. He was the third offensive lineman to be placed on an
injured list in four days, as veteran Todd Rucci (knee) recently
was placed on the non-football injury list. Rucci cannot return for
at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Others among the 12 players waived were rookie nose tackle
Maurice Anderson of Virginia; rookie offensive lineman Rob Gatrell
of Fresno State; rookie running back Patrick Pass of Georgia;
rookie defensive lineman Jeff Marriott of Missouri, and rookie
linebacker Maugaula Tuitele of Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   Also waived were nose tackle Garrett Johnson, linebacker Olrick
Johnson, and cornerback Kelly Malveaux, all of whom have NFL
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he and his staff were of common mind on most of
the cuts, with fierce debates on only a few players. A determining
factor, beyond the usual factors of special teams play and
versatility, was whether it was believed players were improving.
</P>
<P>
   If the coaches felt two players were equal, said Belichick, a
deciding factor ``was whether one player was gaining ground or
another was leveling off. You try to project where the (improving)
player will be a month from now or a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players who clearly fit that bill are young wide receivers
Dane Looker and Shockmain Davis, each of whom made the team. The
Patriots obtained Looker in a trade with the Rams three weeks ago,
a condition of which was that the Patriots would give St. Louis a
sixth-round draft choice if he made the team. And Looker was
impressive in making the squad, catching 19 passes in three
exhibition games, four for touchdowns. Davis, also a rookie, was
nearly as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   As most NFL coaches do, Belichick said cutdown day was
difficult. ``It's been a tough couple of days,'' he said. ``It's a
tough day no matter how long you've been in the league. You never
get used to it.''

NELSON CAPTURES FLEETBOSTON CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ For more than a dozen holes Sunday, the final
round of the FleetBoston Classic at Nashawtuc Country Club was an
all-out hit-me-with-your-best-shot war.
</P>
<P>
   Three shots separated 11 golfers, and a playoff seemed
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But then Larry Nelson took charge with back-to-back birdies on
holes 14 and 15 to open up some breathing room between himself and
the pack, and suddenly the battle was for second place.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson could cruise after that, aware the tournament was his to
win or lose. He added another birdie at 17 and pocketed $195,000
after a 13-under-par 66_203 and a tough four-shot margin of victory
over Jim Thorpe, who finished 67_207.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood's Allen Doyle (67), Chi Chi Rodriguez (67), and Bruce
Fleisher (68) all finished at 208, and at 209 were two-time
champion Hale Irwin (69) and Leonard Thompson (70).
</P>
<P>
   The win was a milestone for Nelson, 52, who has helped design
more than a dozen golf courses worldwide. It was his third win of
the year and eighth since joining the Senior PGA Tour in 1997. The
$195,000 pushed his 2000 earnings to $1,773,355, third behind
Fleisher and Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after shooting 70 and falling a stroke behind leader
Kermit Zarley, Nelson felt someone was due for a big round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be somebody, it had to be,'' said
Nelson. ``I just didn't know it was going to be me. That would be
the only way you could get out of the pack. Either that or we'd be
having an 11-way playoff. It looked like it was going to be that
way for a while. I really didn't feel comfortable out there until
the 10th.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when he slammed a 3-wood 249 yards to within 35 feet of
the pin and two-putted for birdie. That pushed him to 10 under, and
he never surrendered after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``From then on I felt it was mine to win or lose,'' said Nelson,
who used a different putter each round in an effort to help him
cure that ailing part of his game. ``I felt my game was getting
better every day,'' he said, ``and I was just hoping my putting
would kick in, which it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has played the last two Senior PGA stops, but before that
withdrew from the Bell Atlantic and Lightpath Long Island Classics
with an inflamed vertebra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks ago today, I couldn't tie my shoes,'' he said. ``I
stopped lifting weights, stopped running, everything the doctor
said. Now I'm stretching and doing situps and the back feels OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the also-rans gave it a go during the final round.
Thorpe pulled within a stroke of the leader on the ninth with a
3-footer that put him 8 under. He nursed that until the 18th, when
a 2-footer for birdie fell and broke the logjam with Rodriguez,
Doyle, and Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I might have a chance to win if I shot 7 or 8
under,'' said Thorpe, whose best finish this season was a
fifth-place tie at the Lightpath Classic. ``I really didn't give
myself an opportunity to do that on the back nine. I didn't think
I'd be where I am, though, especially after starting 70-70.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Rodriguez, who turned back the hands of time with
a stirring back-nine 31 that featured five birdies, including three
straight at 14, 15, and 16. The birdie on 10 ignited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 60 feet from the back edge, like a football field,''
said Rodriguez, who recorded his best finish since 1996. ``I felt
the adrenaline pumping. I haven't been nervous in six years and
that is very bad for you because then you don't care. (Sunday) I
was like a roach in a chicken nest.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, Fleisher, and Irwin made runs at the top spot, but once
Nelson made those back-to-back birdies, they couldn't get over the
hump.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the media area, Nelson had a few parting words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing here. I love the crowds; they're bigger here
than just about anywhere in the country. And they are very nice. I
especially love this course, I just can't pronounce its name.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing it correctly wasn't necessary. Playing it was, and
Nelson played it very well.

ROYALS OUTLAST RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ROYALS-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ How hot was it?
</P>
<P>
   Check under the collars of Tim Wakefield, Jimy Williams, and
Scott Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   On a stifling, 95-degree day when Wakefield's knuckleball
betrayed him again and the Red Sox needed all the help they could
muster, they fell victim in part to an obscure umpire, Pat Spieler,
who fueled a killer Kansas City rally by appearing to make one of
the most abominable calls since the birth of the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   No one needed laser surgery to see that Wakefield's
second-inning throw to the catcher Hatteberg appeared to force out
Dave McCarty at the plate with enough time left for Hatteberg to
down a lemonade. Spieler's call allowed another run to score when
the next batter, Jermaine Dye, launched a sacrifice fly that
otherwise would have ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sox never recovered, as the Royals ran up leads of 9-1
and 11-3 before Boston staged a trademark late charge, which this
time fell short. The fallout was an 11-7 loss, a split in the
four-game series, and a lot of anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a brutal call,'' Hatteberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't good at all,'' Wakefield said. ``He cost me two
runs, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Spieler insisted to Williams that Hatteberg took his foot off
the plate before the throw arrived. But the manager said the ump
may have been influenced by a freak of astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been a full sun out there,'' he said. ``He was
out by 30 feet. That's not good, not at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams protested vehemently and said later, ``Why he didn't
throw me out, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their complaining, no one in the Sox clubhouse went so
far as to blame the loss on Spieler, not when poor pitching and a
fielding miscue or two were crucial to the setback.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Sox remain a half-game ahead of Cleveland
in the American League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to use it as an excuse,'' Wakefield said of
Spieler's call. ``I didn't pitch very well today, and I haven't
pitched very well in the last three starts.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave up seven earned runs on eight hits and three walks in
five innings. That was an improvement on his last outing, when he
yielded eight runs on nine hits and two walks in 4 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Wakefield's effort Sunday also was better than his
performance two weeks ago in Texas, when he was knocked out in the
fourth inning after walking the bases loaded and giving up a grand
slam to Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wakefield (6-9) is winless in his last eight starts
since he won his fourth game in a row July 16. His ERA in the eight
starts mushroomed to 7.58, and his dismal stretch is sure to
provide grist for Monday morning managers who want him out of the
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield said he cannot pinpoint his problem. ``If I had the
answers,'' he said, ``we might have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he has no plans to remove Wakefield from his spot.
And Wakefield considers the notion ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make the decisions around here,'' he said. ``I made
something like 10 quality starts. Now I've had three bad ones, and
you're asking me if I'm out of the rotation. Don't ask me that.
That's stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how hot it got afterward. On the field, Hatteberg said,
it was the hottest game he ever has caught, and he played some
minor league ball in Florida and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   It got hotter as the Royals built their lead, thanks to the
second-inning fiasco and two-run homers by Dye in the third inning
and McCarty in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the fifth, the Sox were down, 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredibly hot, tiring game,'' Hatteberg said, ``and
when you get down, it makes it that much more difficult to come
back. You have to mount an attack to put together some big innings,
and when you don't it drags on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox made it 9-3 in the sixth, after Brian Daubach led off
with his second double of the day and Nomar Garciaparra singled,
sending Daubach to third. After Hatteberg walked, Lou Merloni
brought home Daubach with a sacrifice fly and Trot Nixon singled in
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Royals scored two more runs off Bryce Florie in
the bottom of the inning, Williams appeared to call it a day.
</P>
<P>
   He yanked Daubach, who was 7 for 14 (.500) in the series with
two homers, four doubles, and four RBIs. Taken out, too, was
Garciaparra, who is leading the league with a .373 average. So was
Troy O'Leary, who was 4 for 12 (.333) in the series with three
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's replacement, Bernard Gilkey, stroked the first of five
hits in a four-run, eighth-inning rally that closed the KC lead to
11-7.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's replacement, Rico Brogna, grounded into a force play
to end the rally. The Sox tried to complete the comeback in the
ninth, when Garciaparra's replacement, Manny Alexander, walked to
lead off. But Gilkey struck out and Hatteberg grounded into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you put some new blood in the game and it sparks
you,'' Williams said. ``And it did.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you wish you had not taken out your starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you say, `Damn, why did I do that?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With little time for second-guessing, the Sox departed for Tampa
for a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like this are going to happen,'' Hatteberg said. ``We've
just got to put it behind us.''

NIXON'S SLUMP PROVING HARD TO STOMACH 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There are dozens of broken bats, shattered
helmets, and even a battered coffee machine or two in Trot Nixon's
past that could testify to how he has dealt with slumps in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's killing me not to snap here or there,'' Nixon said Sunday
morning. ``We had a punching bag in Pawtucket that I just wore out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful for the fact that we're in the thick of things.
If we weren't, I would be going insane right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months into his second major league season, Nixon looked as
if he would become as much of a fixture in right field as the Pesky
Pole. He was hitting .321 by the end of May, was on a pace to drive
in and score more than 100 runs, and had seven home runs in his
first 44 games.
</P>
<P>
   His game-winning, ninth-inning home run in Yankee Stadium off
Roger Clemens on the last weekend in May sent Nixon's popularity
soaring. Remember when the notion that the Sox had a shot at Sammy
Sosa first surfaced, there were plenty of people who didn't want to
do the deal if it meant giving up the homegrown Trot?
</P>
<P>
   But then came June, the hits became scarcer, and in Toronto,
Nixon blew out his right hamstring running out a ground ball in
SkyDome. He wound up missing a month, and hasn't been the same as
he was before he got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The .300 hitter of May has hit just .237 (36 for 152) since
then. He has just one home run in his last 48 games, and his two
RBIs in Sunday's 11-7 loss to the Royals gave him just 15 in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain why I haven't been able to lock in on
things,'' he said Sunday. ``I feel like I've been seeing the ball,
but I'm just not reacting to it like I normally should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife (Kathryn), `This is an absolute battle ever
since I've been back from my injury. I feel like I've swung the bat
at times, closer to where I was before I got hurt. I wasn't
swinging that good then, but I felt like I had a little bit of whip
in my bat, and I felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Nixon said, he probably should have taken a little
more time before coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have played a few more rehab games. I had
that choice. I probably should have gone to Pawtucket for a week or
so, to get some at-bats down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss a lot of time, you lose a lot of your timing. It's
tough. You want to come back and help the ball club as much as
possible, and then you're not doing anything at the plate, you just
feel like crap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I care about is winning ballgames. You want
your personal goals, too, but you have to set that stuff aside and
get Ws. But it's frustrating when your team wins and you didn't do
anything. You say, `Geez, what did I do? It was nine on eight
today.' Sometimes, I have to tell myself not to think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had just two hits in 15 at-bats this weekend in Kansas
City. With a runner on third in the second inning Sunday and one
out, he lined to short. Wendell Kim could have sprinted back and
forth across the diamond a half-dozen times in the time Nixon made
his way back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   He lined to deep center in the fourth, singled a run home on
another line drive in the sixth, and his sacrifice fly in the
eighth made it 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   It's baffling to Nixon why he hasn't been able to get more
trajectory on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of frustrating that I haven't been able to put up
the power numbers I'd like,'' he said. ``I should have at least 15
home runs by now. I can hit 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I'm not getting the trajectory. If I knew, I
could probably get the ball in the air more. I don't think it's
mechanics. I think it's more or less where you hit the ball. It's
not like taking a pistol 10 feet from the target, pointing it, and
if the pistol is accurate and you aim and set it, you'll be all
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hit the baseball, you want to hit underneath it, but
you can't hit it wherever you want. Johnny Damon is a perfect
example, what he did with his home run Saturday night. He just took
the bat, drove it through the zone down, and got that the backspin
on the ball. It just took off on a line. I figured the ball was
going to have some topspin, but he got underneath it and got that
backspin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain situations, I just missed balls. I either hit 'em
too high or off the end of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when he got off to a brutal start as a rookie,
Nixon spent long hours working with manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to him last year because of the fact I was absolutely
lost,'' he said. ``I don't feel like I'm really lost now. The more
I take batting practice, the more I'll get in that groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Nixon (8) and Troy O'Leary (10) have hit as many
home runs in 709 at-bats as Royals left fielder Mark Quinn, a
rookie, has hit in 404 at-bats. Jermaine Dye, the Royals right
fielder who drove in three runs Sunday with a two-run homer and
sacrifice fly, has 99 RBIs, one more than O'Leary and Nixon
combined.
</P>
<P>
   And Damon, the splendid Royals center fielder who wore out Red
Sox pitching (21 for 42, .500) and is leading the major leagues in
hitting since the All-Star break, is the same age as Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ticks me off to the point that there's no return,'' Nixon
said. ``But if I sit here ticked off every time I did that, I'd
find myself out of baseball or down in the minor leagues. I don't
want to do that, but there are so many great players out there, if
you don't put up some good numbers you're not going to be around
very long.''
</P>
<P>
   What sustains him, he said, is the knowledge that he can salvage
his season with a big September.
</P>

WILLIAMS GOES ON SPIEL ABOUT UMP SPIELER 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-UMPIRE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ His name is Pat Spieler, he is a substitute
umpire in his first season in the major leagues, and after this
weekend, he won't need any introductions to Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably recognize him in the mall,'' said Williams,
who had more face time arguing with Spieler than he would have
liked, no more so than in the second inning when Spieler, who was
working behind the plate, ruled Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg did not
have his foot on the plate when Tim Wakefield threw home on a
bases-loaded ground ball by Jeff Reboulet in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a forceout that would have been the second out of the
inning with the score still 1-0, Royals, Kansas City had another
run and would soon make it three when Hector Ortiz scored on a
sacrifice fly by Johnny Damon, which otherwise would have been the
third out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   David McCarty, who scored on the comebacker to Wakefield, would
have been out by 30 feet if Spieler hadn't ruled Hatteberg was off
the plate. No one _ not Williams, not Hatteberg, not Wakefield _
could recall a similar ruling by a plate umpire on a routine
comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been a full sun today,'' said Williams, who has
been known to cite a full moon as the explanation for other bizarre
occurrences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe he called that play,'' Williams said. ``Why
I didn't get tossed by him, I don't know. Why I didn't get tossed
by the first-base umpire, I don't know, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg said he didn't see a replay, unlike Channel 25
announcer Sean McDonough, who told the folks back home they'd just
witnessed ``an awful'' call, the worst he'd seen this season. But
there was no question, Hatteberg said, that the runner should have
been out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out and straddled the base and my foot was on the front
of the plate, just where I wanted it,'' Hatteberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who argued vigorously with Spieler after Wakefield
stormed from the mound in protest, in the fifth debated first-base
umpire Tim Timmons, who ruled that Jermaine Dye had beaten Lou
Merloni's attempt to double him off after catching a foul popup by
Mark Quinn behind the third-base bag. Mike Sweeney, who was on
third, scored on the play when first baseman Brian Daubach threw
wildly to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got as much sun as those players today,'' Williams said.
``That's not good. I don't like that. I don't like to be out there.
And I didn't use sunscreen, either. That's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Spieler had an eventful weekend. Friday night, while umpiring at
second base, he called out Jose Offerman at first when he was
doubled off the bag on a fly ball to Dye in right field. Saturday,
he ruled that Royals first baseman Sweeney slid into the bag ahead
of Manny Alexander on Alexander's bid for an infield hit. Williams
argued those calls, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't good, he wasn't good at all,'' was Wakefield's
summation of Spieler's work behind the plate, which may have been
the first time the umpire has been behind the plate for a
knuckleballer this season, no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cost me two runs in the second inning, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   His ball-strike work was also bad, according to both Wakefield
and Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who contended that Spieler also was late in making his
call, muted his criticism by saying that the Sox couldn't blame
this loss on a call made in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what happens,'' he said, ``is your focus goes to the
umpire instead of what you're trying to do in the game. Do you ever
get it back?''

<P>
   ``DROWNING RUTH''
</P>
<P>
   By Cristina Schwarz
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   This first novel is soap opera at its best, a story with such
melodrama waiting around every bend that it would seem silly if
Schwarz were not so adept at leading us on through the mire. It is
1919, and Amanda Starkey, a Milwaukee nurse who cares for men sent
home from the Great War, is teetering on the edge of a nervous
breakdown. When the hospital asks her to leave, she goes home to
live on her family's farm overlooking Nagawaukee Lake with her
younger sister, Mattie, and Mattie's 3-year-old daughter, Ruth. A
year later, Mattie is found mysteriously drowned (yes, Mattie,
despite the book's title), her body frozen in the lake ice. What
happened? Schwarz moves masterfully back and forth in time,
switching from third-person narration to the voices of Ruth and
Amanda and introducing characters who are startlingly blind to
their roles in events that cost Mattie her life and threaten
Amanda's sanity. It's a darkly entertaining story of guilt and
grief, told with suspense and meticulous control.

   ``TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by James M. McPherson
</P>
<P>
   (DK, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, historian James M. Banner Jr. writes, was
``insecure, volatile, impulsive, irritable, suspicious,
self-pitying, self-righteous and filled with often combustible
rage.'' John F. Kennedy once said to a group of Nobel Prize winners
that they were ``the most extraordinary collection of human talent
ever gathered at the White House, with the possible exception of
when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.'' And was it a critic or an
admirer who asked about Andrew Jackson, ``If (he) wants to go to
heaven, who's to stop him?'' Most of us don't need to know
everything about the 42 men who have been presidents of the United
States, but it's nice to grasp the basics. This handsome book
offers an informative essay about each president, written by a
member of the Society of American Historians (editor McPherson
deals with Abraham Lincoln). Also, here are voting statistics for
each election and the texts of each president's inaugural address.
It's a primer well worth its price.

   ``ISN'T THAT A GUN IN YOUR POCKET?''
</P>
<P>
   By Rachel Abramowitz
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $26.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started directing, people said to me the first day,
`Where shall we put the camera?''' Elaine May remembers. ``And I
didn't know what the camera looked like. I thought it was one of
the lights.'' Luckily, she figured it out. This book, which began
as a story about women in the movie business for
(beginitalic)Premiere (enditalic)magazine, is really a rambling
collection of miniprofiles of powerful women in Hollywood,
including Barbra Streisand, Jodie Foster, writer-director Nora
Ephron, director Penny Marshall, studio executive Sherry Lansing
and agent Sue Mengers. Abramowitz actually spends less time on the
subject of women and power than she does telling stories about the
making of such films as (beginitalic)The Accused(enditalic),
(beginitalic)Yentl(enditalic), (beginitalic)Thelma
&AMP;(enditalic)(beginitalic)Louise(enditalic), (beginitalic)Fatal
Attraction (enditalic)and (beginitalic)When Harry Met
Sally(enditalic). In the end, it's more fun that way. After all,
she says, the true measure of success in Hollywood is the ease with
which it's taken for granted.

   ``THE CIVIL WAR: A NEW VIEW IN CLOSE-UP 3-D''
</P>
<P>
   By Marc E. Frey
</P>
<P>
   (Running Press, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   This ``book'' is terrific if you are 8 years old, but Civil War
enthusiasts with more years under their belts will probably find it
wanting. On the first page, a simple tent pops up, much like the
one Lincoln and McClellan met in at Antietam (there are men in this
one, too, but they aren't Lincoln or McClellan and you need a
flashlight to see them). On the next page is something that bears
considerable resemblance to a pit toilet but is really a
stubby-barreled, muzzle-loading cannon (that's the problem with
pop-up books - everything looks like something else, and you don't
get to choose what it is). The third page offers a simple pop-up of
the ironclad warship Monitor; on the fourth are the trenches of the
Petersburg campaign; on the fifth is the city of Columbia, S.C.,
with little flames coming out of it; and finally, a lumpy
topographical map of Gettysburg. That's what you get for the price
of admission - scoff or enjoy, as you will.

DEFENSE MAKING ITS MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A year ago Adam Eyre, Rustin ``Rusty''
Pierce, and Mauricio Wright were far from the Revolution radar
screen. Eyre and Pierce were playing for collegiate teams in
California and North Carolina, respectively, and Wright was the
captain of the San Jose Clash.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are the Revolution's starting defenders and likely the
key to the team's Major League Soccer playoff prospects as it
prepares to meet D.C. United at Foxboro Stadium Wednesday and in
Washington Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Fernando Clavijo has completely revamped the Revolution
defense, benching Olympic team captain Brian Dunseth and discarding
three former national team players, Mike Burns and Dan Calichman of
the United States and Ivan McKinley of South Africa. The result has
been consecutive 2-1 victories over Tampa Bay and Columbus, teams
that regularly have troubled the Revolution with dynamic forwards
such as Mamadou Diallo, Jeff Cunningham, and Dante Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who arrived from San Jose in a trade for Burns and
Calichman May 30, has allowed the Revolution to switch to the 3-5-2
alignment that Clavijo had planned to install in the preseason. And
Eyre and Pierce have emerged as effective marking backs.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a candidate for MLS most valuable player last season,
had a difficult start to his Revolution career. His reputation
suffered after he clashed with San Jose coach Lothar Osiander, then
struggled to adjust to his new team. The most linguistically
versatile interviewee among the Revolution starters even declined
comment after a particularly devastating loss in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been everything I thought he would be, as a leader and
as an individual,'' Clavijo said. ``He has been screaming his head
off at the younger players, and they have responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he came here, people were saying he was lazy in
practices and doesn't want to do this or that. But here he is
staying late after practice, and he has been great. It makes you
wonder how these problems arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright had interpreted the libero position very literally in San
Jose, distinguishing himself more for his adventurous offensive
forays than for discouraging the opposition. Once joining the
Revolution, he soon was convinced to be more selective in going
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the freedom to go forward,'' Clavijo said. ``He is an
attacking defender. But he needs to pick the times to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright three times abandoned the central defense against the
Crew Saturday night. Each time, a scoring opportunity resulted.
Wright was involved in a scramble with Todd Yeagley that resulted
in Imad Baba's 35th-minute penalty kick to tie it in the 35th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to stay at home, it's no problem for me,'' Wright
said. ``I play for the Revolution, and you have to do what the
coach wants. I have to take care of the other defenders because we
are playing with three, especially against a team like Columbus,
which has some of the fastest players in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is getting better. We lost against Columbus earlier
in the season, but now we are playing better (on) defense. If we
only give up one or two goals, that gives a lot of confidence to
the rest of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   A more enterprising Wright might produce more offense, but that
might compromise the team's effectiveness. The Revolution have
surrendered more than one goal in regulation time only twice, and
no more than two goals in a game, since a telling 4-1 loss at
Columbus. Wright has increased the volume since then.

FUN AT HEART OF RODRIGUEZ' GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-RODRIGUEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Chi Chi Rodriguez's surgically repaired heart
was filled with joy Sunday as he was poignantly reminded that he
still has the heart of a champion.
</P>
<P>
   His final-round 5-under-par 67 earned him a share of third place
in the FleetBoston Classic at Nashawtuc CC, his best finish in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's 31 on the back nine, in fact, had him smilingly
comparing himself with Tiger Woods. ``Just call me Lion
Rodriguez,'' beamed Chi Chi, who playfully took a spectator's seat
at the 18th green before getting up and narrowly missing a 15-foot
birdie putt from the fringe. ``And tigers don't mess with lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who was champion here at the former Digital Seniors
Classic from 1986-88, hasn't won a PGA Senior Tour title in six
years. His earnings, and his scores, have steadily declined. And
two years ago, 10 days before his 63d birthday, he had surgery
following a mild heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, however, his three-round total of 8-under 208, tying him
with Allen Doyle and Bruce Fleisher, netted him his biggest payoff
in years _ $78,000. Coupled with his check for $17,853 for his
third-place finish in the Georgia-Pacific Super Seniors portion of
the tournament, it was nearly a $100,000 weekend, more money than
he has earned on tour all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back. My heart is strong again. I have new arteries and
I'm getting more oxygen in than I have in years and I'm stronger
than I have been in six years,'' said Rodriguez, who hadn't been in
the top 25 in a tournament this year.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Sunday's nostalgic _ and at times spectacular _
round, which marked his best finish since 1996 when he was
runner-up to Gil Morgan at the Ralphs Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's 33 on the front Saturday hinted at things to come,
but putting woes on the back left him at 3 under, five strokes
behind second-day leader Kermit Zarley. And when he stayed at 3
under through the front nine Sunday, it appeared Rodriguez wouldn't
be sharing space on the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Rodriguez _ a big fan of the Red Sox, Pedro Martinez
in particular, and Boston scrod _ turned back the clock in dramatic
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied the 10th (60 feet), 11th, 14th, 15th, and 16th holes,
while exciting the record crowd of 42,000-plus with his trademark
swordsman routine as each birdie putt fell.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder of days past, and a tribute to friends who
recently had passed on. Rodriguez said he has dedicated his 2000
tour season to the former chairman of Toyota of America, Yuki Togo,
who died a month ago and ``was like a brother to me. I'm trying to
win one for him and for my (late) manager, Eddie Elias.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who has been stuck firmly at 22 PGA Senior Tour
first-place finishes, was at his humorous best after Sunday's
round, his lowest at a tour event this year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a tricky downhill chip that he parlayed into a
save for par at 17, Rodriguez said, ``If I was Chester, I would
have had a flat lie because I could have taken my wooden leg off,''
a reference to a character from the 1960s western TV series
``Gunsmoke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gallery was really rooting for me. They always have, but
it's pretty tough to be rooting for bogeys and double bogeys like
I've been making,'' added Rodriguez, who felt he ``blew'' the
tournament Saturday when he ``must have taken 20 putts.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's been a long, long time since Rodriguez, who turns 65
Oct. 23, has been able to look back on a round and lament what a
stroke or two could have meant _ and that significance was not lost
on him.
</P>
<P>
   And it's why, as he walked to the 18th green after a great sand
shot that gave him a chance at 9 under, it was time to bond one
last time with a gallery that kept calling his name.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez dipped under the rope and gestured to a man to step
aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to move and he didn't know what for,'' said
Rodriguez. ``Then I took his chair. You could tell that chair was
not electric.''
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere created by a golfer who suddenly had found
the fountain of middle age certainly was.

   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ For years, they had a schedule softer than
pudding. It wasn't so much whom they played, but whom they didn't
play. The Hokies' opponents each week were teams from the
Mid-American Conference and other lightly regarded leagues,
sometimes even Division 1-AA teams. Teams no one would notice even
if someone were looking.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under the steady guidance of Frank Beamer, Virginia Tech's
schedule got better, and so did the program: from a 2-8-1 record in
1992 to 64-20 ever since. The Hokies have become one of the Big
East elite, better than Miami, better than Syracuse, better than
anyone else in a league that as a whole has fought for respect
beyond the boost Miami brought with it from its glory days of the
mid '80s to early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Tech climbed almost to the summit, charging through
the regular season unbeaten to earn a spot in the national
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The critics still disrespected them, claiming that a perennial
power such as Nebraska or Tennessee was more deserving of being
matched against Florida State in the Sugar Bowl for the national
title.
</P>
<P>
   But something was different this time. Tech no longer needed to
make excuses to anyone, because the Hokies had a quarterback who
could make them, on any given Saturday, the equal of anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vick has made Virginia Tech a legitimate national
contender. In fact, in last January's national championship game,
Vick brought Tech within reach of Florida State. Vick has made the
Hokies a force.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, Vick was scheduled to begin what some believe
will be his final season at Virginia Tech, despite the fact that,
in terms of eligibility, he is just a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. That is a matter to be decided down the road. For
now, the focus for Tech was on beginning a new season in the
relatively bright spotlight of a nationally televised game against
Georgia Tech in the Black Coaches Association Classic. However, a
lightning storm forced postponement of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vick is what makes Tech special. Under normal circumstances, a
team would take a big hit by losing the heart of a defensive unit
that led the country in scoring defense and was third in total
defense. Losing marquee players such as defensive ends Corey Moore
and John Engelberger would hurt any team.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hokies do feel the losses. Even in reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the perception of Virginia Tech going into the season.
Miami once again is on top of the Hokies in the national rankings,
despite the fact that the Hurricanes have lost to them the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the 'Canes don't have a Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   No one does, which is why you can't count out Virginia Tech.
Just as you can't get much of an argument when you start talking
about Heisman Trophy favorites and Vick's name at the top of your
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is something else, isn't he?'' said Beamer, managing to
smile and shrug at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not easy being so special. The glare of the spotlight
has toughened Vick and, to some extent, wearied him.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas a year ago no one had heard of him, everyone wants a
piece of Vick now. The questions are endless, the demands on his
time neverending. He is no longer just a kid. ``I stopped being a
regular student when I became the starting quarterback,'' he said.
``I stopped being a regular person when we got to the Sugar Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be casual at Virginia Tech, not just for Vick but for
those who follow him. You wanted to talk to Michael Vick, you
simply tracked him down on campus. Now everything is organized. His
time is partitioned. Windows of opportunity are rarer and rarer as
the Virginia Tech people try and build some fenses around their
star player.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time status has rubbed off on the Hokies as a whole. No,
they don't get the automatic respect that a Florida State or a
Nebraska does, year after year. But they are making progress. Take
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's game, for example. The Hokies wanted to play in a
preseason game, but no one wanted to play them. They searched and
searched and heard ``No, thank you'' from teams in the Pacific 10,
Big Ten, and Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Georgia Tech, coached by Beamer's friend George
O'Leary, said, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets are in a year of transition. No one expects
them to be much of a factor in their own league, much less
nationally, in this first season without talented quarterback Joe
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary wanted an early indication of the character of his team,
so he opted for the money and the exposure, knowing full well his
team might take a beating.
</P>
<P>
   For Virginia Tech, the stakes are different. No longer is it the
little program that could. The Hokies are on a new level, and
people are watching closely to see if they fail. That comes with
the territory of being close to the top.
</P>
<P>
   The word around Blacksburg is that Tech will not be as good as
it was last season, but better than many people are predicting.
</P>
<P>
   As for those Miami fans out there, Tech is making it clear that
it is not ready to concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as Michael Vick is around.

   TREES (FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ.)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has seized upon a Flagstaff-area
fire-danger reduction program as a possible national model for the
country's fire-ravaged forests. But even some locals involved in
the plan say it's not the sweeping success the administration would
like to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The forest-thinning plan is being touted to Congress and the
public as way to make forests more fire resistant - in effect, to
undo 100 years of uninformed forest management, decisions that have
left the nation's forests snarled with underbrush and thick with
diseased trees.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan has critics - even among those instrumental in
designing and implementing it.

more kinds of cows and corn than nationalities. But Iowa, which
hemorrhaged families during the 1980s farm crisis and has an
unemployment rate of only 2 percent, is proposing something no
other state has done: an all-out immigrant recruitment drive to
encourage foreigners to call Iowa home. The plan is to make Iowa an
``immigration enterprise zone,'' and the ideas range from seeking
an exemption to immigration quotas to urging companies to recruit
abroad. By Pam Belluck.

   BLACKS-DNA (Boston) _ This fall, some 300 African-American
children here are to be sent home with swabs meant to gather DNA
samples from the cheeks or gums of their family members, part of a
local molecular biologist's nascent project that he means to extend
to North Carolina and other spots with long-stable African-American
populations. Last spring, a Howard University geneticist announced
he would soon offer DNA analysis to African-Americans. And the
African Burial Ground Project in New York has been assembling a
data-base of DNA from long-buried African-Americans and living
Africans. The efforts may be disparate but this much seems clear:
black Americans hunger to trace their African ancestry is combining
with powerful new DNA technology, and the foundations are being

Robert Torricelli's 1996 campaign staff may have been complicit in
Chang's illegal political donations _ something the senator
strongly denies. Lawyers familiar with the case say Chang has given
prosecutors information suggesting that Torricelli's aides
accounted improperly for some of his contributions, and at least
two dozen FBI agents have been added to the inquiry in recent
weeks. Chang himself is something of an enigma. As a businessman,
many of his former employees say, Chang generated all sorts of
ambitious schemes but almost no apparent profit. So where did his

 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Bring It On (enditalic)poses the musical question:
Who put the ``duh'' in dumb?
</P>
<P>
   Well, now we know.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when you take two dozen cheerleading
routines and patch them together with rejected dialogue from
(beginitalic)Beverly Hills 90210(enditalic). You get
(beginitalic)Clueless(enditalic) without the charm or trace of a
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's not much room for story between cheerleading
tryouts, cheerleading practice, cheerleading contests and
cheerleading summits, which include winning lines such as, ``This
is not a democracy. It's a cheerocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   This movie isn't even cute, mostly because of its parade of
unlikable characters: snippy, foul-mouthed rich girls who seem to
live in their cheerleading uniforms. They're so unpleasant, we
really don't care if they win the big competition.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is clearly aimed at teenage girls; the studio trucked
in a busload of them for the screening in Phoenix. If only they had
drowned out more of the inane dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the cheerleading theme may bring teens into the
theater, but they might as well watch the real thing on ESPN2.
Except for the predictably corny finale, the pep squad sequences
are pretty unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   This film is also filled with lewd references and sexual
innuendo that seem out of place in an otherwise lightweight story.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Bring It On (enditalic)stars Kirsten Dunst as
Torrance, captain of a champion cheerleading squad at a ritzy San
Diego high school. In a crisis of pom-pom proportions, Torrance has
to find a new routine for the nationals after learning her team's
material was stolen from an inner-city squad, the East Compton
Clovers.
</P>
<P>
   The film plays up the race angle, but the Clovers get the short
shrift as caricatures that walk on set, deliver put-downs and then
disappear. Even so, Gabrielle Union stands out as the Clovers'
strong-willed captain.
</P>
<P>
   As Torrance struggles to find a new routine, she meets some
characters lifted from other movies, including Cliff (Jesse
Bradford), a guitar-playing, retro outsider, and his sister, Missy
(Eliza Dushku), a sophisticated tough girl who rolls her eyes a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Torrance is also equipped with the standard-issue cheating
boyfriend, irritating little brother and nearly invisible but
well-meaning parents.
</P>
<P>
   Dunst gives a totally flat performance, almost as if she's
insulted to be making a cheerleading movie. She has none of the
sparkle that Alicia Silverstone brought to
(beginitalic)Clueless(enditalic). And this film could have used a
little sparkle. Or something.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a fairly well-done opening sequence, the funniest
scenes roll during the credits, when the actors and actresses
freelance to (beginitalic)Mickey,(enditalic) the Toni Basil tune
from the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   As they dance around, you can tell they're relieved that the
movie is over.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the audience.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Drug abuse. Sex scandals. Vicious backbiting. Missing millions.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the life of a TV preacher can be pretty rough.
</P>
<P>
   So says (beginitalic)The (enditalic)(beginitalic)Eyes of Tammy
Faye(enditalic), a compelling documentary about life behind the
pulpit that examines the rise and fall of PTL, one of the most
successful television ministries in history.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato combine old footage,
interviews and an innovative style to produce a stunning portrait
of the so-called ``electric church.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye, of course, used to be Tammy Faye Bakker. She was
married to televangelist Jim Bakker, who built PTL from nothing,
only to see it destroyed by the Jessica Hahn sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Tammy Faye Bakker Messner has been little more than
a (beginitalic)Saturday Night Live (enditalic)joke. Because of her
garish makeup - the movie includes a hilarious tour of her makeup
bag - and squeaky speaking voice, the mainstream media made her out
to be a clownish loon, little more than an amusing sideshow to
Jim's fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   In a sympathetic portrait, the film shows the other side of
Tammy Faye, who comes off surprisingly candid and quite sane. If
we're to believe the producers, Tammy Faye is a victim, a
well-meaning Christian entertainer done in by her husband's hubris
and the ambition of fellow TV preacher Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by RuPaul, the film notes that Tammy Faye was one of
the first religious figures to openly embrace those who were
rejected by other churches: gays, AIDS victims and drug addicts.
She also survived bouts with drug addiction and cancer, along with
the foundering of her marriage and career.
</P>
<P>
   The film also points out that Tammy Faye was a tireless
entertainer, sometimes doing TV shows for hours at a time with no
script. It's also clear that she has a good singing voice, which
she used to produce dozens of albums.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the movie offers a fascinating look into the early
days of televangelism, which is rooted in the work of old-time
traveling preachers, such as Oral Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   It includes priceless footage from Jim and Tammy's early days,
when they created hand puppets to entertain children on one of the
first Christian TV shows. Their partner was none other than Pat
Robertson, who later became well-known as the host of
(beginitalic)The 700 Club(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   After several false starts, Jim and Tammy struck gold with the
Charlotte, N.C.-based PTL (Praise the Lord) network, which produced
Las Vegas-style shows and eventually was on 24 hours a day. At the
height of their success, the pair built Heritage USA, the world's
first Christian theme park, which, at one time, was third in
attendance behind Disneyland and Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all came tumbling down after it was revealed that
Jim had had a tryst with Hahn, a young church employee. According
to Tammy Faye, Falwell used that news to leverage the Bakkers out
of PTL. Falwell, for his part, said he assumed control of PTL at
Jim Bakker's request.
</P>
<P>
   The film also takes some shots at (beginitalic)The Charlotte
Observer(enditalic), which won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of
the PTL scandal. In one of the film's most poignant moments, Tammy
Faye confronts the reporter who wrote the stories.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he asks for her autograph.

<P>
   The guys in (beginitalic)The Crew (enditalic)still have it.
</P>
<P>
   They just can't remember where they put it.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the fun of this raucous comedy about four old
mobsters who move to Miami Beach and dream up one last caper to
save their retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   The film features a star-studded cast, including Richard
Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Jennifer Tilly. Unlike its
kissing cousin, (beginitalic)Space Cowboys(enditalic), about four
senior citizens who join NASA, (beginitalic)The Crew
(enditalic)offers crisp dialogue and a clever script that keeps the
story moving.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their star power, none of the actors walks through this
picture. They're all working so hard they achieve a chemistry that
makes you believe they've been friends for years.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss does a fabulous job narrating the story, and Reynolds
is wonderfully understated as the violent ``Bats,'' who loses his
job at Burger King in hilarious fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Hedaya turns in his finest performance to date as thick-headed
``Brick,'' whose job at a mortuary ultimately comes in handy. The
gang is rounded out by ``Mouth'' (Seymour Cassel), who talks only
at the most inopportune times.
</P>
<P>
   After a snappy opening that introduces us to the gang in their
youth, we fast-forward to the present, where they're living in a
retirement home being circled by yuppie vultures who crave their
ocean views.
</P>
<P>
   As the noose tightens, the boys dream up a plan: They spirit a
body from the mortuary and leave him in the lobby, making it look
like a gang hit. The plan backfires when it turns out that the
``victim'' was the father of a local drug dealer (Miguel Sandoval).
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval gives a great comedic performance as the overserious
dealer, Raul Ventana, who mistakenly thinks he's being victimized
by competing drug lords. Sandoval gets laughs just about every time
he's onscreen. Lainie Kazan does a nice turn as a woman who is
kidnapped by the boys, as does Tilly, playing a stripper without
the requisite heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Crew (enditalic)includes several sidesplitting
sequences that are as original as they are funny. At one point, the
gang employs a mouse to start a fire, with the camera following the
little guy through all the nooks and crannies. That scene had the
audience roaring throughout.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a really inventive sequence involving Ventana and
some unfortunate members of his gang, who are dangling upside down
by ropes. Somehow, Sandoval is able to keep a straight face, which
makes it even funnier.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this, there's also a sweet back story involving
Dreyfuss' character trying to locate his long-lost daughter, who
disappeared when he was serving a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   The plot line gives the story just enough weight to make it
touching.
</P>
<P>
   The only mystery here is why Touchstone chose to open one of the
year's funniest films in late August. No matter, though.
(beginitalic)The Crew (enditalic)should have legs well into the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the guys still have it.

ANGELS SET HR RECORD IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Chuck Finley's name is all over the Angels'
record book, but Sunday he added his name in a way he'd rather not
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Now pitching for the Cleveland Indians, Finley yielded Tim
Salmon's 30th homer of the season in the Angels' 10-9 victory in
front of 31,504 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The homer made the Angels the first team in American League
history to have four players with 30-plus homers in a season. It's
happened six times in the National League _ the Dodgers (1977,
'97), Rockies (1995, '97, '99) and Braves (1998) having achieved
the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon joined Troy Glaus (37), Mo Vaughn (31) and Garret
Anderson (31) to set the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the other three guys got there, I was hearing about
it,'' Salmon said. ``But with a month left in the season, I was
bound to run into one. When I first heard about it, it seemed a
little surprising no other American League team had done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon has been the hottest Angels hitter of late. His past four
homers have come against Pedro Martinez, Roger Clemens, Mike
Stanton and now Finley. In three games against Finley this season,
Salmon is 5 for 8 with three homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no secret,'' Salmon said. ``He's one of those guys you
have to sit back and react to what he throws. I just reacted. You
can't sit back 3-1 and think he's going to throw you a heater. He
might drop in that forkball. Sometimes, against guys like him you
have your best at-bats because you just react instead of guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the postgame talk in the Angels clubhouse focused on the
home runs, but Angels manager Mike Scioscia was quick to emphasize
the Angels' ability to manufacture runs. And they needed every last
one Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels knocked Finley out of the game in a five-run sixth to
take a 10-4 lead. But the Indians rallied against the Angels'
bullpen with five runs _ including a grand slam by Roberto Alomar _
in the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine (3-4) had relieved shaky starter Kent Mercker (3 2/3
innings, 4 runs, 8 hits) and held the Indians in check until tiring
in the seventh. After the Indians knocked around Mike Holtz and
Mark Petkovsek, Shigetoshi Hasegawa entered to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa will go back to a set-up role now that Troy Percival is
healthy again, but he went out with a bang, retiring all six
batters he faced to earn his eighth save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got some big plays from their defense, throwing
out three runners at the plate. Anderson made the biggest throw,
nailing Manny Ramirez trying to score from second on a two-out
single to center by David Segui in the seventh, keeping the Angels'
lead at 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   Long before all the late-inning fireworks by both offenses, the
focus was on the return of Finley, who was making his first start
at Edison Field since he left the Angels to sign a three-year, $27
million contract with the Indians this past winter. It turned out
to be his worst performance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up eight runs and 11 hits, including home runs to Glaus
and Salmon. Finley went 1-0 with a 2.13 ERA in starts against the
Angels in Cleveland, but was gone after 5 1/3 innings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored only five runs in two games against Finley in
Cleveland, but finally broke through against him in the third
inning Sunday. &QL;

<P>
   When it wasn't me he'd come to visit, I'd hurry to meet Dr.
Owens at the front gate, hoping he'd let me carry his black satchel
into the house.
</P>
<P>
   We lived in one of the small, duplex homes built by the Jones &AMP;
Laughlin company for the immigrants who worked in the steel mill.
Dr. Owens visited patients throughout the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was stately and grand as a sorcerer, his leather doctor's bag
like the gripsack of Merlin. Inside it, the bottles and vials
jiggled and bumped into one another as he walked, making music like
muffled bells.
</P>
<P>
   In my memory, it's almost always me Dr. Owens comes to treat.
</P>
<P>
   These were the days before I had my tonsils out, when my throat
would be so inflamed and my fever so high I sometimes saw the face
of Lucifer coming straight at me from across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to call Dr. Owens,'' my mother would say, growing
calm simply by voicing the old man's name. He was the doctor who'd
delivered my brother and me. He'd helped my mother and father care
for their ailing parents. Something in his demeanor, as much as the
potions in his black bag, brought comfort to the families on our
block.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't describe what his face looked like anymore, but I
remember he had large warm hands, and he wore stiff white shirts
that carried the scent of a man who'd just been to the barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   I've thought a lot about Dr. Owens since reading the series of
stories by (beginitalic)The Arizona Republic's (enditalic)David
Parrish and Jodie Snyder. For a week, their articles have detailed
the failings of many local physicians and the discipline, or lack
of it, they received from the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   If Dr. Owens were around today, practicing the kind of hands-on,
deeply personal medicine I remember so well, I have no doubt he
would stand out {hellip} as one of the most potentially dangerous
physicians in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each visit to our house, Dr. Owens would linger in
the kitchen. He'd chat with my mother about food and make small
talk with my dad about baseball or football. Then he'd have a shot
of whiskey. His ``medicine,'' he called it. In the winter, he'd
sometimes pour the liquor into a cup of coffee. In summer, there
may have been a glass of ice water.
</P>
<P>
   I don't suspect we were always the last stop on Dr. Owens'
rounds. I'm not sure he followed the same social routine at every
house.
</P>
<P>
   I do know he was a soft old man willing to work a tough old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who would have filed a complaint against him with the
local medical board, or caused him to cease making home visits,
would have had reason to fear for his own health from the people of
Third Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   I've talked about this with friends, who laugh and say standards
were lower in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were lower. The cost of medical malpractice
insurance was lower. The threat of lawsuits was lower.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of humanity, standards were very high.
</P>
<P>
   We expect more of doctors, now, I've been told. But just the
opposite is true. We expect them to be scientifically faultless, to
be procedurally flawless, to be perfect as robots. All of which
adds up to something less than human.

MARINERS PLAYING AS IF THEY CAN'T STAND HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE Consider your 50 cents for this newspaper especially
well spent this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Contained herein is the solution for the Mariners' woes, which
after the slow-drip 2-1 defeat to the White Sox Sunday officially
have worn out the term ``slump'' and are being fitted for
``debacle'' on the way toward ``collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it advocates what is anathema in sports, the solution is
not one offered by anyone in the clubhouse. But in the absence of
any other plausible theory on how a good team can go so bad so
suddenly for so long, we offer this suggestion in the spirit of
adding to the chaos:
</P>
<P>
   Just lose, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The division lead, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Mariners pulled ahead in the American League West
by seven games, they have acted as if they were the bewildered
first possessors of the Old Testament. They are staggering around
under its responsibility, playing as if a bobble or bungle will
plunge civilization back to the dark days when rocks were the
favored item of worship.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a team that plays well from ahead. The franchise has
virtually no history in the activity.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dogs that were allegedly let out earlier this month
was an overdog. Despite the fancy new doghouse, these guys are
underdogs. They know about seven-game leads what New Guinea
tribesmen know about microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The lead has been enormously troublesome. They desperately need
to get behind, only the Oakland A's won't cooperate. The Mariners,
losers of 12 of their last 14, have been free-falling for a couple
of weeks, only to look over and see the A's, losers of 14 of 21,
burning up on re-entry themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If this continues, the Anaheim Angels will win the division, and
no one interested in the preservation of the American way of life
wants to see that.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Mariners to fall behind, they could finally relax. The
milk would be on floor, and the time for laments would end and the
mopping could begin.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as they stay ahead, the sort of agonized flailing
visible this weekend seems destined to continue.
</P>
<P>
   While pitching deservedly has been the biggest source of the
collective hand-wringing, the three games against the team with the
AL's best record showed marked improvement on the mound. Also
better was the previously wretched defense.
</P>
<P>
   What has not improved is hitting, especially clutch hitting.
Lost in the body count during double-digit opponent run totals is
the fact that four of the 12 defeats were by a single run,
including Sunday, when the Mariners were stymied by someone named
Sean Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   A late replacement for Sox ace James Baldwin, the obscure middle
reliever had won seven games over parts of four major league
seasons before the Mariners hitters reincarnated him as the second
coming of Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   This guy should have been a piata for the Mariners, and instead
Lowe and relievers Lorenzo Barcelo and Keith Foulke shut them down
on four crummy hits.
</P>
<P>
   The same futility was obvious Friday, when the Mariners lost 4-1
despite loading the bases in the ninth inning for the heart of the
order. All three outs in the inning were K's, including the first
out by Edgar Martinez that had what may have been his career-worst
cut on a third strike.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a phrase from the pro golf tour, Martinez's swing
resembled an octopus falling out of a tree. He was trying so hard
he practically torqued himself out of his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's happened to me a few times too,'' admitted Alex
Rodriguez, who joined Martinez as the final two outs Sunday _ both
whiffs. Each player has the capacity for a one-swing game
resolution, but they are so desperate to make something happen that
they are hacking like adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hit the ball over the stadium,'' Rodriguez said.
``When things don't go well, you think you have to hit the home
run. You're trying to give the team a lift. But it's a combination
of everybody trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mariners, the lack of clutch hitting isn't
a recent phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday added a modest three to the only offensive category in
which the Mariners lead the major leagues {ndash4/5 runners left on
base. Over the weekend, they became the first team to strand 1,000
runners this season. It will be several more games before another
team crosses that frontier of futility.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they were playing well, the Mariners weren't very good
in the clutch-hit department. After GM Pat Gillick failed to come
up with a big bat before the trading deadline, many fans were
seduced by the early August success into believing that more
offense wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that while the pitching and fielding had been good
and are showing signs of recovery, hitting this season has always
been mediocre and gained little with the trading-deadline addition
of Al Martin (.259 with two homers and seven RBIs in 20 Mariners
games).
</P>
<P>
   Now, even the good hitters, drunk on desperation, have become
choppers.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Lou Piniella: Anybody pressing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressing? No, I don't think that's the problem,'' the Mariners
manager said. ``Outside of our young third baseman (Carlos
Guillen), we have a veteran ballclub out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After 12 losses in 14 games, it's apparent that even the vets
are getting squirrelly. They know that a slump is no longer the
proper word. Pressing is exactly what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only way to stop the pressing is by stopping the
leading. The Yankees, in town for three games starting Monday
night, are, as defending champions, uniquely qualified to help get
the Mariners back where they can handle things.

MARINERS CAN'T FIND RALLY CAPS; CHICAGO WINS WITH TWO SWINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Zero. It's the biggest number.
</P>
<P>
   Zero. It's the number of times the Mariners have won a game when
trailing after the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday it happened again. For the 49th time. Down 2-1 in the
ninth inning to Chicago, the Mariners went nowhere and lost 2-1 to
the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame it all on one inning, mind you. The Mariners
went nowhere for much of the day in losing for the 12th time in 14
games. The White Sox threw their closer at the Mariners in the
ninth, and Keith Foulke was up to the challenge, getting Raul
Ibanez to pop up and Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez to strike
out.
</P>
<P>
   No team wins much in the ninth. The White Sox, for example, lead
the American League in wins with 77 and have won just four times
when trailing after eight. But at least the White Sox have done the
deed. The Mariners haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little surprising to hear that,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Gerald Perry said that, and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely haven't had many big hits late (in the game)
this year,'' Perry said. ``I can't put my finger on why that is.
We've got good clutch hitters. I wish I could say.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have gotten this one would have been nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 49 were simply unwinnable, like the 19-3 loss the
Sox handed the Mariners on Aug. 9. No team can be expected to come
back from 16 runs down with only three outs left.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was winnable. Difficult, but winnable. But Foulke
threw strikes, and the Mariners never got the ball out of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to win many of these games in the ninth,''
manager Lou Piniella said. ``The other team has its best pitcher in
there. You never want to face the White Sox trailing in the ninth
inning. Or the Yankees (who come into town Monday night). Good
teams put games like those away.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can the Mariners do? Simple. They have to score more
runs early. And they could start by getting more than four hits in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the second time in three days the Mariners finished
the day with just four hits. That's a disturbing trend, given that
the starting pitching seems to have turned a corner. The Mariners
starters threw 21 full innings in the three games this weekend
against Chicago, and the White Sox scored in just three of those.
</P>
<P>
   But with the offense still in shackles, the Mariners remain
enslaved to the thought of getting help from the rest of baseball.
The M's still have a 2{-game lead over Oakland in the AL West
despite winning just twice in the last two weeks. That says more
about the slumping A's than it does about the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Yankees, who took two of three from the A's this
weekend, arrive for a three-game Safeco Field set. They've got one
of the best closers in the game in Mariano Rivera. Seattle has to
find a way to neutralize him. Jumping out early would be good.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble is, Monday night's starter is Roger Clemens,
and The Rocket is a handful for anybody. If you're not already in a
slump, he can put you there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys we've faced lately have been pitching like they were
Clemens,'' Rodriguez said, breaking into a grin. ``It's always a
challenge to face him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's starter Sunday, Sean Lowe, isn't Clemens. You wouldn't
have known that from watching the Mariners, however. Seattle got
one run in the fifth inning when Mike Cameron singled, stole second
and scored on Mark McLemore's single.
</P>
<P>
   That tied the game at 1-all. Instead of that being a starting
place, however, it was the end. Seattle didn't get another
baserunner. And that meant that Freddy Garcia's first eight-inning
start of the year would go for naught.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko homered off Garcia in the second inning and Ray
Durham went deep in the eighth. Two pitches. Two runs. Too much for
the Mariners to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``What some people don't realize is that we're not a
powerhouse,'' Piniella said. ``We're a respectable club that when
all goes right and we play well, we'll win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, not much is going right _ a botched call by third
base umpire Tony Randazzo might have cost the Mariners a run and a
possible big inning in the third. And the Mariners aren't playing
great. The last three games have seen the M's play better than in
the first 11 games of the slump. But the A-game _ the one that
produced a seven-game lead in the West just two weeks ago, is still
on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a funk right now,'' Cameron said. ``I don't think
we're going to fall, though. If we come through this, we'll come
out in shining armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have doubted us now that we're in this little
slide. But no one in this clubhouse doubts us. (The division title)
is laid out for us. We've just got to find the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Score early. Score often. Those are good keys.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; HEADLONG &LR; , by Michael Frayn. (Picador USA, $14.) The author
uses his skills as a playwright to create a fast-moving internal
novel about a philosopher named Martin who stumbles onto what he
suspects to be an unknown Bruegel masterpiece in the home of a
country gentleman. With dollar signs in his eyes, Martin plays
scholarly detective to uncover the painting's provenance, hiding
his scheme from his wife and gambling his career and marriage. In
this ``rueful and amusing'' tale, which was chosen by the editors
of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, ``the big
action is Martin turning a page _ movingly, comically,
delightfully,'' Randy Cohen wrote here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN: A Life of Diego Rivera &LR; , by
Patrick Marnham. (University of California, $18.95.) The great
Mexican muralist is portrayed as an amoral chameleon who managed to
befriend capitalists like the Rockefellers while attacking them in
his Marxist-flavored art. Last year our reviewer, Michael
Kimmelman, called this an ``urbane and entertaining biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LEPER'S COMPANIONS &LR; , by Julia Blackburn. (Vintage
International, $12.) In this novel, a bereaved Englishwoman
retreats internally from the modern day into her same village in
the year 1410, where she takes up with a band of pilgrims headed
for the Holy Land. In 1999 in these pages, Bruce Bawer praised the
book's ``hypnotic vision of the world's horror and beauty, banality
and sacredness _ and of the frailty and splendor of the human
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 'TIS: A Memoir &LR; , by Frank McCourt. (Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $14.) The author picks up his life story where ``Angela's
Ashes'' left off, describing his journey from Ireland to New York
at the age of 19 and his fitful development as son, lover, husband,
writer and teacher. His ``narrative gift'' and ``spirited
intelligence'' inform this ``exploration of the elusive American
dream,'' Maureen Howard wrote here in 1999. `` 'Tis a success
story.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE GREAT SHAME: And the Triumph of the Irish in the
English-Speaking World &LR; , by Thomas Keneally (Anchor, $18), the
author of ``Schindler's List'' tells the story of the Irish
diaspora in the 19th century, especially the thousands of men and
women sent in chains to penal colonies in Australia, among them a
core of political prisoners who continued to fight for an
independent Ireland. The result is ``an epic tale of courage and
ingenuity,'' Jay P. Dolan said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DONA INES VS. OBLIVION &LR; , by Ana Teresa Torres. (Grove, $13.)
Speaking to a variety of people, both living and dead, this novel's
narrator tells how her cloistered life as matriarch of a wealthy
Caracas family slipped into chaos and tragedy. ``Dona Ines' cranky,
engaging, importuning, resentful, obsessed and relentless voice
guides us through a family history that is also mired in Venezuelan
history,'' John Vernon wrote here in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEMINGWAY: The Final Years &LR; , by Michael Reynolds. (Norton,
$15.95.) In the final volume of his five-part life of Ernest
Hemingway, the author, who died last month at the age of 63,
describes the writer's experiences during World War II, his rocky
relationship with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh, and his dependency
on alcohol and prescription drugs. Last year in these pages, James
Wood called this an ``excellent and exhaustive biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WAY PEOPLE RUN: Stories &LR; , by Christopher Tilghman. (Picador
USA, $12.) Many of the lonely, middle-aged protagonists in these
tales continue to feel the afterburn of sibling spites and other
family hurts, yet are unable to match the intensity of their
childhood experiences. ``Tilghman has a deft, Cheeveresque way of
lending risky undertones to the rituals of suburban life,'' Rand
Richards Cooper wrote in the Book Review last year. ``These are
long stories'' that ``read almost like miniature novels.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CELEBRATION, U.S.A.: Living in Disney's Brave New Town &LR; , by
Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins. (Owl/Holt, $15.) A
correspondent for The New York Times and his wife (also a
journalist) describe the mixed blessings of living with their two
youngest children in Disney's micromanaged Norman Rockwell
fantasyland in central Florida. Their account ``reflects a
scrupulously maintained reportorial balance,'' David L. Kirp wrote
here in 1999. ``Its tales of family life ring true because they are
drawn directly from the authors' own experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ELUSIVE EMBRACE: Desire and the Riddle of Identity &LR; , by
Daniel Mendelsohn. (Vintage, $12.) A classical scholar explores his
family's complex history and the landscape of gay and heterosexual
desire. ``This charming apercu-filled memoir is ... a personal myth
about undoing family myths,'' Jonathan Lear wrote here in 1999.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush pitching tax cuts to indifferent electorate
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taxes. How we love 'em!
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not exactly love them, but the inability of
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to animate the
electorate with his plans for whopping tax cuts suggests we're not
all that angry about them, either, despite years of hysterical
tutoring by talk-radio alarmists, anarchy-lite libertarians,
supply-siders and, of course, Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It has become an article of GOP faith that taxes are too high
and, cut, would still be too high. With the Cold War won and
anti-communist dramatics thus moot, the party increasingly has
leaned on its animus toward taxation for a defining issue.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Republican candidates is that beyond the circle
of party faithful, proposals for broad tax cuts play to an
electorate vacillating between indifference and antagonism to the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Polls typically rank taxation as somewhere in the second tier of
voter concerns, and usually toward the bottom of that second tier.
Twice in recent years the congressional GOP leadership has pushed
broad tax cuts only to find the grassroots so unmoved the pitches
flopped even with Congress's Republican majorities.
</P>
<P>
   To create issues for the election, those majorities did pull
themselves together this year to repeal the estate tax -- newly
renamed, for political purposes, the death tax _ and to fix,
supposedly, the so-called marriage penalty. President Clinton
casually swatted both aside with veto messages that pointed out the
estate tax repeal was mainly a giveaway to the rich and the
marriage-penalty fix showered unwarranted benefits on couples who
actually benefit from the current code.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush is promising to push both again as president and, on
top of that, proposes a general tax cut of $1.6 trillion over 10
years. (Actually a $1.9 trillion cut, figuring in the additional
interest the government would have to pay.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this plays off projected federal budget surpluses that
are about half speculative at best and dependent upon a level of
budget discipline that has escaped both parties even in bad times.
(Democratic candidate Al Gore is proposing $500 billion in cuts and
tax favors that are targeted to middle income earners, which may
make them more socially responsible but still nearly half as bad
economically.)
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Bush pitches his cuts as a way to excite economic growth
-- which is exactly what we don't need more of right now. That
would push economic expansion beyond the productivity increases
that hold inflation in check. The all but sure result would be a
Federal Reserve slapping inflation down with high interest rates
that would wipe out much of the pocketbook gain.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will be time to discuss big cut taxes after we pay down
the national debt, nail down Social Security and Medicare and
perhaps even shake off the Reaganist government-is-bad-for-you
trance that has left us without, for just one instance, enough
safety inspectors to keep killer tires off the market.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lieberman overplays the religion hand
 &HT;    For release Aug. 30, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I admit to some manner of exhilaration at Al Gore's landmark
decision to have Joe Lieberman as his running mate. Nevertheless, I
have worried about Lieberman since his Bible-quoting first
appearance alongside Gore in Nashville earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Already, I am playing with words. If a Christian candidate was
quoting from the Bible during a political appearance, I would call
it Bible thumping; more of a pejorative expression. Why give
Lieberman a break because he's from the same religion as am I?
Lieberman is a Bible thumper. There, I've said it!
</P>
<P>
   We're not exactly brothers, more like cousins. He's Orthodox,
I'm Reform. The Orthodox types like to say that us Reforms are more
assimilated into American society than are they. That's code for
meaning that they believe we don't put as much stock in our faith
as do they, and that we've acquiesced to a Christian-dominated
society.
</P>
<P>
   I quarrel with that. Our differences are in style, not in
belief.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress. Lieberman, a man whose devoutness to faith I
respect and admire, has brought religion firmly into the
presidential campaign. It is rare that a political candidate for
high office has not expressed his faith in the Almighty, but he's
done it as a personal gesture. Lieberman is making a crusade of it.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the vice presidential candidate told a congregation
at a Detroit church that religion needs to return more to public
life. You can take that several ways, but I fear that Lieberman is
sending a message for religion to intermix with politics and
government. If he's not sending that message, then his delivery is
being misinterpreted by many, including Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following Lieberman's Nashville quotations from the
Book of Chronicles, I spoke with several (Jewish) friends who were
stunned by Lieberman's speech. We agreed that if such a delivery
had come from the mouth of a Christian candidate, we would be
alarmed; we would be using terms like the Christian Right _ also
pejorative, if you're not a member of the Christian Right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was a one-time thing, some of us rationalized. Maybe
Joe got caught up in the excitement of the moment in being the
first Jew on a national ticket. His advisers will calm him down, we
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But he was at it again in Detroit last weekend. ``I stand before
you today as a witness to the goodness of God,'' he told his
audience amid his calls to rededicate the United States ``to God
and to God's purposes.'' (As a Jew, expressions such as this always
have bothered me, as God's role in the Holocaust continues to
puzzle and haunt me.)
</P>
<P>
   I know where Joe's coming from. He's looking to put America back
on a higher moral ground (and getting all those votes from others
who want America on a higher moral ground.) And that's all right.
We can use it.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a fine line in this separation of church and
state issue with which we have to deal. Like most Americans, I'm
not certain where that line is drawn but I worry that Lieberman, by
his constant reference to Biblical citations and blessings to God,
is straddling that line quite precariously.
</P>
<P>
   I do, however, find a difference in what Lieberman is doing and
what the Christian Right represents. Lieberman is calling for a
return to faith and moral high ground, no matter your religion _
and even tolerates those who have no religion. The Christian Right
would like to impose its religious beliefs on all of us.
</P>
<P>
   This is a difference with a distinction, but it is unsettling
nevertheless. There can be a campaign of regaining that undefinable
moral ground without testing the precarious waters of separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is an extremely personal circumstance. It is not
campaign material. In 1960, in answer to inane concerns that he
would be a tool of Rome, John Kennedy did his best to separate his
Roman Catholicism from his political career.
</P>
<P>
   While presidential (and vice presidential) candidates always
have adhered to their religious beliefs, have shown up in church on
Sundays and have been advocates of morality (well, at least they
said they were), they have not worn religion on their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, Joe Lieberman does. It troubles me.

WEB CREATING AN ERA OF IDENTITY THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes tips text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It couldn't possibly be happening again,'' Jerry Coleman
remembers thinking in October 1998, when his credit card was
rejected over a $38 dinner of lamb kabobs. ``Not to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is an assistant district attorney in San Francisco. He
has prosecuted dozens of identity-theft cases, and he teaches a
course on fraud and forgery at nearby San Jose State University. He
even travels around the country training police officers and fellow
prosecutors about identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman's track record is not so good when it comes to
protecting his own identity.
</P>
<P>
   After that 1998 dinner, he discovered someone had gone on a
weeklong, $25,000 spree with his card _ more than the credit limit
theoretically allowed. Worse, it was the third time in 18 months
that someone had assumed Coleman's identity to rack up thousands of
dollars in bogus charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you travel as much as I do, you're at high risk and
there's not always much you can do to prevent it,'' he said this
week. ``That's why identity theft has become, quietly perhaps, the
most common white-collar crime in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so quietly, perhaps. Identity theft, in fact, is fast
becoming a bogeyman lurking in the shadows of mainstream America.
And while identity thieves are still often low-tech con artists,
the rise in cases, say experts, has roughly paralleled the
proliferation of the Internet.

<P>
   Low-tech or high-tech, identity theft occurs when a criminal
uses another person's Social Security number, date of birth, or
other identifying information to apply for credit. The victim,
whose name the resulting debt is in, is left to deal with the
fallout _ usually after the thief disappears.
</P>
<P>
   A phone poll done by New Hampshire-based Image Data LLC last
September found that 21 percent of American adults said they or a
member of their family have been a victim of identity theft. Of
those, 96 percent said the resulting problems were ``serious'' or
``very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have beseiged authorities with complaints in recent
years about phony credit-card and cell-phone accounts, misused
Social Security numbers, and all kinds of fraudulent loans taken
out in their names. State and federal legislators have responded
with new laws and stiffer penalties, and a trio of government
summit meetings on identity theft are scheduled for this fall in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft isn't a violent crime in the traditional sense,
but it's a highly invasive crime,'' said Bruce Townsend, director
of the financial crimes division of the Secret Service. ``Victims
show the same kind of (psychological) signs as those who have been
through violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months since the Federal Trade Commission created a
toll-free hotline specifically to deal with such cases, it has
received more than 23,000 calls. The rate at which the calls come
in has almost doubled since the beginning of summer, to 1,000 a
week _ 60 percent filing complaints, 40 percent seeking
information.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, cases still result from old-fashioned
chicanery, such as intercepting mail, digging through the trash,
stealing a wallet, or conning someone into giving personal
information over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an Internet crime and never was,'' said US
Inspector General James Huse, the man responsible for policing
illegal use of Social Security numbers. ``But technology has
created new ways of storing and selling personal information . . .
(and) it's likely to create more and more headaches in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mari Frank still doesn't know how whether her imposter used
technology to hijack her name four years ago, or whether she went
the old-fashioned route. A lawyer in Laguna Niguel, Calif., Frank
was alerted that she had a problem when a bank called asking about
an unpaid $11,000 bill on a credit-card account she hadn't opened.
</P>
<P>
   When police raided her namesake's apartment, they found a
variety of bills in Frank's name, checks, and a driver's license
with her name but the imposter's face and address, and even a stack
of Frank's business cards. All told, the woman had accumulated
almost $50,000 in spurious debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still amazed that she had driven four hours to steal
business cards from my office,'' said Frank, who has written a book
on her experience and who now represents other identity theft
victims in court. ``I can't explain how violated I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank has plenty of company. Among the notable victims of
identity theft in recent years are FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky, US
Senator Dianne Feinstein, and dozens of high-ranking military
officers who were up for promotions at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the names aren't as well known, but some of the cases
are just as startling.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute sent letters to 12,000
patients earlier this month, alerting them that a part-time
employee may have stolen their records and used them for no good.
And last month, a 29-year-old Natick, Mass. woman pretended she was
going into labor to escape from police custody after being arrested
on more than 50 outstanding warrants for identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, police dubbed Woburn, Mass. resident Kerrin Alfonso
``the queen of identity fraud'' after she allegedly assumed the
identities of co-workers, friends, a former roommate, and her
beautician in a $300,000 spending orgy. Among her purchases were a
matching set of $50,000 Lexuses and a $35,000 Toyota Avalon, a down
payment on a house, and a vacation to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases are smaller, typically involving thieves who take on
the identity of someone else, quickly charge a few thousand
dollars, and then drop the ruse and disappear before the victim
catches on.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much money is involved, it can be devastating
for the victim,'' said Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly.
``They'll be fighting an uphill battle to clear their name for
years, maybe forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said his office gets half a dozen complaints a week from
identity theft victims, up from one or two when he took office in
January of last year. Staffers have even created a brochure for
victims, telling them about their rights and what they should do to
clean up their credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity fraud is becoming a major issue for us,'' Reilly
said. ``I've been talking with other attorneys general and others
in law enforcement, and everybody is being forced to devote more
resources to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical victim takes two years to clean up his or her credit
history, according to a survey by the US Public Interest Research
Group. The average amount of sham charges: $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once things are straightened out, victims aren't held
accountable for such illegitimate bills.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, many lose their ability to borrow, as
the bad credit caused by identity thieves keeps reappearing under
their names like a trick candle that won't blow out. Occasionally,
thieves accumulate an arrest record in someone else's name, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even Coleman, the San Francisco prosecutor, had a hard time
getting the illicit charges removed from his credit history. Like
all identity theft victims, the burden of proof fell on him to show
that he hadn't made the purchases in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same department stores that overwhelm me with evidence if
they've been robbed couldn't be bothered to look up receipts and
other information I needed to clear my name,'' Coleman said. ``They
just don't care, which makes it a lot harder to clean up your
credit report after something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, when Congress made identity theft a federal crime
and 22 states (including Massachusetts) followed suit, victims
often felt snubbed by the police, too. Investigators and credit
bureaus typically viewed lenders as the victims and didn't want to
spend time or money chasing down nonviolent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 law, though, also required the FTC to establish the
consumer hotline and create a central database of identity theft
statistics. That has helped law enforcement agencies coordinate
multiple investigations and has made it easier for victims to make
their cases to local police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigators may not have the resources to chase down one
person's $7,000 complaint, but what if they go into our database
and find 20 similar complaints?'' asked Betsy Broder, who heads the
FTC effort. ``Suddenly, it's a much bigger case and it's more
likely they'll find the resources to track it down.''

IT'S DOWNRIGHT COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not only is vacation over for a lot of us in this melancholy
last week of August, but winter has begun, at least in the stores,
and that makes the whole thing worse.
</P>
<P>
   Boots, sweaters, coats, furry slippers, red gift boxes, and the
absolute psychic crusher _ Christmas ornaments _ are proliferating
in retail land, as though the winds were already howling and the
bathing suits were packed away in the bottom drawer, as though the
holiday shop clock were running, and the populace cared.
</P>
<P>
   The populace does not care. OK, some of the populace cares, but
they are the compulsives, tucking gifts away in the back of the
closet so they can say ``I got it all done early.'' They will say
that right through autumn and deep into December when the rest of
us are fried at the mall. They will say it so often that we will
want to tuck them away in the back of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   The average human being in a post-vacation slump cannot deal
with efficiency or get excited about a gaggle of snowmen on a
string.
</P>
<P>
   The snowman ornaments arrived in the stores in July, along with
the dancing bears, clowns, and gingerbread houses. They glittered
from displays covered in red paper at Hallmark outlets, heralded on
mall marquees shouting: ``The 2000 Ornament Debut!'' Some stores
opened at midnight to let in the crowds, as though Harry Potter
books or Rolling Stones tickets were inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for collectors,'' says Linda Odell, spokesman for
Hallmark headquarters in Kansas City, explaining that the company
releases 200 new ornaments in the summer and another 100 in
October. Yes, before Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   There are 31 million ornament collectors in the United States
and they can't get enough, even though the average human being in a
post-vacation slump might figure there would have to be a limit to
the number of things that can hang from an evergreen branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think multiple trees,'' says Odell. ``Five and six trees in a
house, each with a different theme.''
</P>
<P>
   The image is too much for someone sitting at a desk watching the
tan line fade. One tree is too much, even if it twinkles from the
corner of a gift shop or is supposed to blend with the quilts and
knitted socks at county fairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockland Lobster Festival held in Maine at the beginning of
August had a twinkling tree and Santa faces in the crafts tent.
They did not blend with the midway noise, the fried dough smell,
and the humid ocean air. It was a bad case of When Worlds Collide,
sending a shiver down a tourist's spine as the season of lists
encroached on the season of bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   That encroachment has been happening since Memorial Day in
catalogs, where holiday candles, pumpkins, back-to-school items,
and fleece are advertised along with beach towels and straw hats.
</P>
<P>
   But a person can toss out a catalog. Reality is something else,
especially when it's unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should all go live in France for a while. Summer is
summer there, and August is the piece de resistance of the season.
A retail executive returning from that country was amazed at the
merchandising mindset along the Seine: ``The stores are full of
summer stuff!''
</P>
<P>
   What a concept _ buying and selling in the present.
</P>
<P>
   In America we can get so far ahead of ourselves that we forget
where we are. ``Somewhere all of Christmas has happened already,''
said the retailer. ``It's on board ships. It's in warehouses. It's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some of us are spending too much time multitasking in
cyberspace. A person goes out there, talks to six people at once
while taking a conference call with three more, and simultaneously
checks the portfolio. What city are we in again? And what day is
it?
</P>
<P>
   Things happen very fast in the business cycle _ so fast that
someone can think December has come and gone and it's the end of
next August.
</P>
<P>
   The average human being in a post-vacation slump sinks to the
bottom of the well contemplating that one, because it means two
vacations are over.

WHEN THE DATING SERVICE SENDS YOU SOME DUDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Single women are always lamenting the poor quality of men out
there in the dating pool, but Suzanne thought she had found a way
to weed out the losers.
</P>
<P>
   The New Bedford, Mass. resident, who asked not to be identified,
paid the Successful Singles dating service in Wellesley $1,895 for
six referrals. The company plays matchmaker using a computer that
analyzes customer answers to a lengthy questionnaire on a wide
range of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary objective is to refer people who are mentally and
emotionally compatible,'' the Successful Singles contract states.
``Minimums and maximums in age, height, weight, etc. are used as
secondary guides, not absolutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In her description of the perfect date, Suzanne told me she
would be interested in someone with similar interests, including
animals (she has two cats), dining out, the theater, and movies.
But she had specific physical requirements as well. She preferred a
man between ages 31 and 40 who was physically fit, tall (between 5
feet 9 and 6 feet 2), with dark eyes, dark hair, and no facial
hair. Because she drives a lot for work, she also was interested in
someone who lives within 40 miles of her.
</P>
<P>
   Her first referral from Successful Singles didn't match several
of her physical preferences and told her he had once had a drinking
problem. She claims he told her that he had also done time in jail.
That didn't suit her taste, so she moved on to the next name.
</P>
<P>
   Her second suitor was 5 feet 4 inches tall, sported a mustache,
and was allergic to cats. Suzanne said bachelor number two also
made a number of inappropriate sexual comments. ``I said I like
animals, not that I wanted to go out with one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After that experience, Suzanne began pressing Successful Singles
for her money back, even though the three-day right of recision had
already passed.
</P>
<P>
   As she discussed her situation with company officials, another
name arrived in the mail, so she decided to give Successful Singles
another try. Bachelor number three had a beard and a mustache and
lived more than 40 miles away, but otherwise she said he was
satisfactory. There just wasn't any personal chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Suzanne said she had had enough. When I pointed
out to her that matchmaking is hardly a science, she acknowledged
it's a crapshoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take your chances no matter what,'' she said. ``But when
you tell them what you want and they don't pay any attention,
that's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne said the referrals she received didn't meet the
dictionary definition of successful (``having wealth, fame, or
rank''). She was particularly irked at Successful Singles for
sending along someone who had done time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were barely making it,'' she said. ``I can meet a
mess in a bar. I didn't need to pay all this money to do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   When Successful Singles refused to refund her money, Suzanne
contacted her credit-card company to dispute her payment. The
credit-card company, noting she signed a contract with only a
three-day right of recision, sided with Successful Singles.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne then filed a complaint with the attorney general's
office that was referred to its consumer assistance council in
Hyannis. The attorney general's office has received four complaints
about Successful Singles this year, and a total of 19 since the
beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer assistance council failed to negotiate a resolution
of Suzanne's complaint. Ronald Cater, the president of Successful
Singles, responded to the complaint by saying Suzanne had been
promised six referrals and had received eight. ``The contract has
been more than fulfilled, therefore there is no refund due,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Cater defended his company's
compatability profiling approach and said Suzanne knew what she was
in for when she signed the contract. He said the company relies on
its customers to be truthful in their answers to survey questions.
</P>
<P>
   Cater said he checked out Suzanne's claim that her first
referral had done jail time and said it was a minor offense, not a
felony conviction, close to a decade ago. Bachelor number one told
me he had been arrested for operating under the influence of
alcohol in 1992 and has been sober ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had a good time on his date with Suzanne and
thought she was a lot of fun. He said his experience with
Successful Singles was generally positive, although he didn't renew
his membership after receiving his initial referrals. He said it
was too expensive, even though he said he purchased a cheaper
membership than Suzanne's.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Suzanne had paid $1,895 for her referrals, he said:
``Holy crap! I'd be after them too if I paid that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachelor number two did not return my phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Cater, after initially downplaying the concerns Suzanne raised,
said he would be happy to extend her membership for another six
months and do the initial screening himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a customer that's unhappy. We want to try to make her
happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Suzanne said she wants nothing more to do with Successful
Singles. She said careful screening was what she paid the service
for in the first place; she said she didn't want to take a chance
on what they would send her next. She said she contacted me to
alert other consumers to the pitfalls involved with dating
services.
</P>
<P>
   The warning is worth passing on. Dating services work for some
people and not for others, but for obvious reasons few come with
money-back guarantees. Read the fine print carefully and make sure
you're comfortable with how the service works before signing
anything.

   --RCN prices rise in New York. Jamie Houde, who lives in
Manhattan and uses RCN for cable TV and high-speed Internet
service, says the company increased his cable TV rate 23 percent
just two months after he signed up. He says his cable bill rose
from $26 a month to $32 a month due to what the company said was a
``significant increase in operating and programming costs.'' An RCN
spokeswoman said the increase was confined to New York and there
are no plans for similar hikes in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   --Prius follow-up. Our report on the problems one consumer had
in tracking down the new hybrid car from Toyota prompted varied
responses from readers. Andrew Garvin of Newton, Mass. said he put
down a $500 deposit for a new Prius in mid-June with Wellesley
Toyota and it's been ``nothing but misinformation, delays, and
confusion since then.'' By contrast, Paul Milner of Sharon, Mass.
said he pulled into Boch Toyota in Norwood last weekend for a
quick, pleasant test drive. Kevin Ford of Somerville, Mass. says
the Prius is too pricey for his economy-car budget and offered this
suggestion: Why doesn't the state rebate all sales and excise taxes
on hybrid cars for the first five years of ownership to encourage
their purchase and their environmental benefits?

WELL-FEATHERED NEST AUGURS WELL FOR FUTURE RETIREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We hope to retire in two to five years, after our children
finish college. We have a home with a $630,000 market value and a
$100,000 mortgage, plus a fully paid country home we will probably
use as our retirement residence. We'd like to have a gross income
of $100,000 to $125,000 in retirement. Are we too conservative or
not conservative enough? Is there a better place to put the money
market holdings? It seems we should be able to obtain our income
while preserving a good part of our assets. To do this, is it
better to draw down the taxable or tax-deferred accounts first?
</P>
<P>
   I.D., Cambridge, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your nest is well-feathered. To achieve a $125,000 income in
retirement, you would need to withdraw at a level representing only
3.67 percent from your total savings. Moreover, you would have an
income stream of $105,632 if you simply withdrew the yield from
your various fixed-income accounts and the dividends from your
common stock, plus the Social Security and pension _ and that is
not factoring in any growth between now and the time you retire. (I
estimated 5 percent returns from the fixed-income holdings, since
most are money market funds; the total might be a bit higher.)
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing is that you have enough savings that you can
afford to take a very conservative investment stance. I would
suggest only two changes, one of which you should be able to make
at once, the other over many years.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the big question as to whether to continue
holding that huge money market position, now representing more than
38 percent of the portfolio. It seems foolish to me, in view of the
fact that you can currently purchase five-year jumbo CDs with rates
as high as 7.81 percent, entering last week. If you invested all of
your money market funds at this rate (although I would not
recommend that CD investments at any one institution exceed the
level of FDIC insurance) it would represent a difference of $19,341
in annual income, presuming you are averaging 5 percent on the
money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   (In normal times, I would suggest a good GNMA fund for such a
position in the portfolio, but it seems the current fixed-income
market favors CDs. The Vanguard GNMA fund has a current yield of
6.85 percent, and a 7.67 percent 10-year total return. With the
prospect of interest-rate hikes ahead and a yield trailing that of
long-term CDs, this isn't the time to go with the GNMA, or any bond
fund, for that matter. It could well be that in five years when
your CDs mature, the relative yields will have returned to more
normal levels, and it would be advantageous to switch tactics.)
</P>
<P>
   The second change I would suggest is to divert whatever
dividends you get from your assorted stock funds to the purchase of
common stock in taxable accounts. This is because you indicate you
are concerned with maintaining a substantial estate for your
children. When it comes to taxes that come due to your heirs, it
doesn't matter what you are holding in your tax-deferred accounts _
they will have to pay. But in the taxable accounts, if they inherit
common stock they will enjoy the benefits of the so-called step-up
rule, which allows them to treat the value of the holding at the
date of the death of the owner as their base cost, and ignore your
base cost. That can make an enormous difference.
</P>
<P>
   You should probably hire either a financial planner or a tax
specialist; your holdings are large. Many tax strategies could make
enormous differences. (For example, my instinct would be to draw
the yields from both taxable and deferred accounts as spelled out
above, so as to reduce the accumulation in the accounts from which
you will be forced to make withdrawals after age 70 1/2. But a tax
expert might suggest a better alternative.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Note to D.B., Palm Harbor, Fla.: Without going into the details
of your situation, I suggest you follow the reasoning about CDs as
detailed in the previous exchange, taking the returns from
five-year jumbos that should easily outpace either the Guaranteed
Investment Contract, a bond fund, or laddered holdings of
individual bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently left my employer. While I intend to remain active,
it will largely be through nonincome-producing endeavors. I have
sufficient assets to meet my needs of $6,000 a month without
working. What are the best penson options for me?
</P>
<P>
   G.M., North Andover, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems pretty clear that you should wait until age 55
before drawing anything. If you take the lump sum available today,
of $101,181, you would have to earn 14.98 percent average annual
returns to get the $179,980 that would be available if you stayed
in the plan until 55. There would be comparable (and in some cases
much greater) gains if you choose one of the four annuity options.
For example, by waiting four years, the value of your lifetime
annuity payment would go from $596 to $1,386 a month; if you go
with the option at the lowest level, which guarantees the payments
through both your life and your spouse's, the payments would rise
to $1,237 a month, from $551.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what happens if you wait until age 65: If you chose the
lump sum at 65, it would bring you $218,585. That calculates out to
5.51 percent average annual returns over the next 14 years _ quite
far from that calculation of nearly 15 percent over the first four
years. Worse, the growth in the lump-sum account for the years from
age 55 to age 65 comes out to a 1.95 percent average annual return
_ almost certainly not even keeping pace with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   (To me, the numbers make little sense; one hypothesis I have
developed is that while you are 51 your 52nd birthday is probably
drawing nigh. I also considered the chance of a typo here and
there, but rejected it because the value of the other options are
similarly unappetizing if you wait until age 65 to draw on the
plan. The only conclusion I can draw is that the plan is designed
to provide a strong incentive to retire and/or receive benefits at
age 55 and not before, and an equally strong incentive not to wait
until age 65 to retire or take benefits.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've established that 55 is the best age to take
benefits, the question arises as to what is the best of the annuity
or lump-sum options. If you took the $1,386 a month lifetime
annuity rather than the $179,980 lump sum, you would need an
investment that would earn 9.25 percent to provide the income
stream without invading principal. (You could argue that the
required earnings level would be lower, because the principal
should be entirely drawn down by the time you die to make a precise
calculation. But given that your age at death is at this point
incalculable, and that you should expect many years of living after
age 55, the differential would likely be very small.)
</P>
<P>
   The basic advantage of a lump sum over an annuity is that the
sum will be available to you, your spouse, or your heirs,
regardless of when you and/or your spouse die. Obviously, the
writer of the annuity is the big winner if one or both of you die
early; if one or both of you live well beyond the average life
expectancy, you win and the writer either loses or makes less money
on the proposition than it anticipated. It's nice to bet on your
own longevity, and that of your spouse, as well. It seems to me
that the variance between the lifetime annuity for yourself _
$1,386 monthly at age 55 _ and the $1,237 that would be payable to
either you or your wife, whoever lived longer, is sufficiently
small to make the 100 percent joint and survivor option the most
attractive annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets us to the bottom line. You mention that you have
savings sufficient to support yourself now, without working. The
question then is whether you have sufficient savings to continue to
do so after age 55, after factoring in the inflation that is likely
to pester you for the balance of your financial life. For a start,
reflect on the fact that it will cost $1.15 by the time you reach
age 55 to buy what $1 does today, and $1.62 a decade later,
provided inflation averages 3.5 percent during those periods.
</P>
<P>
   So my answer is this: If you have sufficient savings to provide
your required income stream for the balance of your reasonable life
expectancy, you can view this as a long-term investment. If you
invest the lump sum in stocks for about 20 years, you should expect
returns in the 10 percent annual range _ it would not only be a bit
higher than what you'd need to replace the income stream from the
annuity, but the money would belong to you or your estate. On the
other hand, if you suspect that at some point this money will
become important in your day-to-day living, it seems to me that the
returns offered from the annuity are generous, relative to most of
these instruments I have analyzed, and I would take the 100 percent
joint and survivor option at age 55.

<P>
   But many, including Massachusetts attorney general Reilly, don't
think Congress has gone far enough. They would like to see even
stiffer penalties for identity thieves, as well as rules to deal
with online information brokers, which compile and sell personal
information on individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to happen on a national level,'' Reilly said. ``These
cases often cross state and even national borders, so
jurisdictional issues make it pretty hard for states to deal with
on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and the others may soon get their way. Several bills have
been proposed in Congress that would deal with specific aspects of
identity theft, and Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore has
proposed a law that would make it illegal to sell Social Security
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That became an issue last fall when 21-year-old Liam Yoens shot
former classmate Amy Boyer outside her Nashua office. Yoens was
able to track down Boyer using her Social Security number, which he
bought from a Web site for $45.
</P>
<P>
   ``As information about us is collected and aggregated and sold
on the Internet, where does it end?'' asked Huse, the Inspector
General. ``That's a question that still hasn't been answered.''
</P>
<P>
   How Congress answers it will go a long way toward determining
how easy it is for crooks to use the Internet for the next
generation of identity theft. The trick, experts say, is to limit
illegitimate uses of information without making it too hard for
legitimate businesses online.
</P>
<P>
   While such issues are being debated, the best thing for people
to do is take steps to protect themselves in the offline world (see
box).
</P>
<P>
   ``These people will tear your credit to shreds and then, when it
doesn't do them any good, move on,'' said Robert Bethel, spokesman
for the US Postal Inspection Service, which has seen its identity
theft arrests quadruple in the past three years. ``In cities like
Boston, especially, take the extra step to protect yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM IDENTITY THEFT:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --DON'T carry your Social Security card or birth certificate in
your wallet. Keep them in a secure place, such as a safe deposit
box.
</P>
<P>
   --GIVE out your Social Security number only when absolutely
necessary. The numbers were created to keep track of your taxable
earnings, not as a universal identifier. Request a different number
for your driver's license. Never give the number (or other
identifying information, such as date of birth or mother's maiden
name) to unsolicited telephone callers or over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   --CHECK your wallet for any cards, such as health insurance
cards, that include your Social Security number. Contact the
service provider and ask to use a different number.
</P>
<P>
   --CARRY only those credit cards you use regularly, and cancel
all unused cards.
</P>
<P>
   --PHOTOCOPY everything you carry in your wallet and keep copies
in a safe place, such as a safe deposit box. Also include a list of
bank and investment accounts in your name. Update the file
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   --LOOK closely at all credit card and bank statements each month
for any unusual activity or unauthorized charges. Also be on the
lookout for any bills that don't arrive on schedule, which could be
a sign an identity thief has changed the address on your account.
</P>
<P>
   --SHRED or destroy all pre-approved credit-card solicitations.
To reduce the number of solicitations you receive, call
888-567-8688 and ask to be removed from the marketing lists of the
major credit bureaus. The request is valid for only two years and
it won't stop every solicitation, but it will dramatically reduce
the volume of unwanted offers.
</P>
<P>
   --DESTROY or shred all documents containing personal information
rather than trashing them whole. Put the ones you keep in a safe
place.
</P>
<P>
   --ORDER and review copies of your credit report from each
national credit reporting agency at least once a year.
Massachusetts residents are entitled to a free copy from each
agency anually. Contact information: Equifax, 800-685-1111;
Experian, 800-682-7654; Trans Union, 800-916-8800.
</P>
<P>
   --DON'T use your birthday or other easily guessed information as
a password or personal identification number, or PIN. Make sure the
PINs you use can't be seen by anyone while you're using an ATM or
public phone.
</P>
<P>
   --CALL the local post office or postal inspector if you suspect
your mail is being stolen or tampered with. Drop off bill payments
only at a post office or in secure boxes on the street. Stealing
them in transit is a goldmine for thieves.
</P>
<P>
   --PICK UP new checks at the bank, if possible, rather than
having them mailed to your home.
</P>
<P>
   --BE CAREFUL about sending personal information over the
Internet. Send PINs, credit card numbers, or other important
information only over encrypted systems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT ALREADY BE A VICTIM:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --FILE a report with local police and keep a copy for your
records.
</P>
<P>
   --KEEP a record of all efforts you make to correct your credit
history, including the measure you took, to whom you spoke or
wrote, and the date and time of your call or letter. Send all
letters certified mail and keep copies.
</P>
<P>
   --DON'T pay any bill or charge that resulted from identity
theft.
</P>
<P>
   --CALL your bank and creditors immediately. Close your checking
account and request new bank account numbers and ATM cards. Cancel
all credit cards and request that new accounts be opened with new
account numbers. Follow up in writing and ask that the accounts be
closed ``at the customer's request.''
</P>
<P>
   --CONTACT the credit reporting agencies right away and request a
``security alert'' be placed on your accounts. Again, follow up
with a written letter. Contact information for the agencies'
fraud-investigation units: Equifax, 800-270-3435; Experian,
888-397-3742; Trans Union, 800-680-7289. At the same time, request
and carefully review copies of your credit reports, looking for
other bogus accounts or loans.
</P>
<P>
   --INFORM the post office in writing that you are a victim of
identity theft and that change-of-address request forms submitted
on your behalf should not be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   --REQUEST a new driver's license with an alternate number from
the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Also, ask that your old number be
flagged so the police will know if anybody attempts to pass it off
as valid.
</P>
<P>
   --CALL the Social Security Administration's fraud hotline at
800-269-0271 and advise it of your situation. As a last resort, ask
about getting a new number issued, while flagging your old one for
fraudulent use.
</P>
<P>
   --CONTACT the Federal Trade Commission's identity theft hotline
at 877-438-4338. Counselors there can give you advice about
cleaning up your credit history.

   Can you stand one more reality show? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopkins 24/7,'' a limited series debuting tonight at 10 on
ABC, is an honest-to-goodness _ and ABC would probably prefer we
whisper this word _ documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The producers spent three months in Baltimore's Johns Hopkins
hospital, recording all the life, death and occasional humor that
went on there with hand-held digital cameras. Then they cut it down
to six hours _ airing tonight, tomorrow and the next four
Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``ER'' territory, bouncing from the tragic (a girl with
uterine cancer) to the bizarre (a sick sea turtle), but generally
without the soap opera. You have to feel for the patients here _
and maybe more so because of the camera's presence.
</P>

STRANGER'S BEQUESTS INCLUDE GONZALEZES, AMIRAULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Okla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Katherine Abernathy of Shawnee, Okla., never met the
Amiraults of Massachusetts or the Gonzalezes of Miami. But as she
prepared to take her own life, Abernathy scribbled a four-page will
disinheriting her own relatives and leaving her $500,000 estate to
two families she apparently viewed as victims of government power.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy, 57, shot herself in the chest five weeks ago, just
hours after her mother died of natural causes in the large Shawnee
home they shared.
</P>
<P>
   Before she picked up the family's .22 Magnum, Abernathy picked
up a pen. Unmarried and childless, she rewrote her will to leave
her property to the Amiraults, who were accused of molesting
children at their Malden day-care center in the mid-1980s, and the
Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez, whose refusal to turn over the
Cuban boy to federal authorities prompted a government raid in
April to seize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give away freedom for power is hollow and tragic,''
Abernathy wrote, referring to the stories of both families. ``May
God, such as He is, bless and care for America _ what's left of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy's relatives, who say she has been mentally
incapacitated for years, are challenging the will. A judge was to
review the case at a hearing Monday in Shawnee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a painful, sad, and difficult situation,'' cousin
Robert Abernathy, the main petitioner, told the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The Amiraults' attorney, James L. Sultan, has retained an
Oklahoma lawyer to represent the family's interests at that
hearing. Sultan said a will that is in the handwriting of the
deceased and is signed and dated is valid under Oklahoma law. That
would not be true in most other states, including Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interpretation of this document, which may or may not be
accurate, is that she felt that both the Miami family and the
Amiraults had been victimized by abuses of government power, and
that she felt some kinship to them because of what they had
suffered at hands of official power,'' Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as a heartfelt political expression from
somebody who was obviously in tremendous pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leaving her valuable property to the two
families, Abernathy left her notes and photographs to Dorothy
Rabinowitz, a Wall Street Journal columnist who publicized the
Amiraults' story. In her will, Abernathy described the case as a
``scam.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy left her dog, Mai Ling, to Oklahoma University
president and former Oklahoma Senator David Boren.
</P>
<P>
   The Amiraults' trial, during which children testified about
talking robots, public torture of animals, and sex abuse, led to a
national debate. Cheryl Amirault LeFave and her mother, Violet
Amirault, were convicted in 1987 and received 20-year prison
sentences, but were freed on appeal in 1995. Violet Amirault died
in 1997. LeFave's brother Gerald Amirault is still in prison but
will appear next month before the state's Advisory Board of
Pardons.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her Dorchester home, Cheryl LeFave declined to
comment on Abernathy's bequest. But Sultan said the family, which
would probably use the money to help pay the college tuitions of
Gerald's two daughters, is ``incredibly touched and honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Diaz, an attorney representing Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, told the Miami Herald that the family would not
comment on the Abernathy's will. But he said members are checking
the hundreds of letters they have received to see whether Abernathy
had sent one.
</P>
<P>
   According to an obituary in the Shawnee News-Star, Abernathy
graduated from Shawnee High School and Oklahoma University, where
she was named ``Outstanding Woman Student'' as a senior. She lived
for years in Houston, where she was in the Junior League and the
Daughters of the American Revolution and was active in civic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   She moved back to Shawnee two years ago to care for her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very artistic person, involved in fine arts and
several museums down there,'' Max Shumacke, pastor of the United
Presbyterian Church of Shawnee, told the Miami Herald. ``She was an
excellent calligrapher and a home decorator. But I don't know if
you'd call that a business. She was just very good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the American labor force, a century of hard
work has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day 1900, the typical American worker was a man
accustomed to toiling 10 hours a day, six days a week on a farm or
in a factory. Injury and illness were constant threats. Frequent
baths, fun vacations and full lunch buckets were virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many people would want to go back to those good
old days,'' said Carl Van Horn, a labor expert at Rutgers
University. ``Working conditions are so much better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers of 1900 may have been tired, hot and dirty, but they
were also optimistic. New technologies such as electric lights,
telephones and automobiles were appearing, stirring hopes that work
would be easier and life more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, those dreams have become our reality. On Labor
Day 2000, American workers are healthier, safer and better paid
than at any time in history. One of the few things they have in
common with their counterparts 100 years ago is a sense of
confidence that technology will continue to improve working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Coming changes could scarcely be more sweeping than those of the
past century.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics show that overwhelmingly, Americans in
1900 worked with their backs and often endured brutal working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most common job for men was farm laborer. For women, it was
domestic servant. Even children _ one-sixth of them under 16 were
working _ held strenuous jobs, commonly working in coal mines and
textile mills.
</P>
<P>
   Without machinery such as tractors, washing machines and power
tools, jobs were physically demanding and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workplace was quite unsafe,'' said Roy Rosenzweig, a
history professor at George Mason University. In the late 1800s,
about 35,000 workers were killed each year in industrial accidents,
Rosenzweig said. Many employers found ``it was cheaper to let
people die than to improve safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs involving railroads or coal mines were especially lethal.
On May 1, 1900, in Scofield, Utah, more than 200 miners were killed
when coal dust ignited and created a huge fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a much larger work force, only about 6,000 people
die each year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of all employees now work in stores and
offices, enjoying the benefits of central heat and air
conditioning. Even factory workers generally have indoor plumbing,
plenty of light and climate control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, vacations were virtually unknown except in a few
white-collar professions. Leisure for common workers came only on
Sundays, Christmas, July 4 and perhaps Labor Day, a legal holiday
in most states at that time. Retirement was rare, even for the
relatively few people who lived to age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Today, full-time employees typically work five days a week, get
paid vacations and look forward to more than a decade of retirement
beyond age 65. Benefits unimaginable in 1900 are routine for many
workers in 2000: medical insurance, life insurance, subsidized
retirement savings, stock options, and subsidies for child care,
education and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation also has improved. Although the average work week
in 1900 was 59 hours, family incomes averaged just $375 a year. A
typical worker had to toil about two hours to purchase a dozen
eggs, compared to five minutes' work at today's average hourly wage
of $13.71.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of getting enough good food was reflected in
people's physical stature. At the turn of the century, the average
height of Army recruits was just under 5 feet 7 inches. Today it's
5 feet 10 inches, and researchers say the change can be credited to
improved nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work and low pay also helped shorten life spans. The
average American died at about age 49, compared with today's
average of more than 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the improvement in workers' lives?
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn of Rutgers said part of the credit goes to changes in
public policies. Child labor laws, Social Security, occupational
safety regulations, wage-and-hour laws and employer-backed pensions
and insurance vastly improved the lot of workers. Union efforts to
win a 40-hour work week and paid vacations helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   But technological change was the key to higher living and
working standards. In 1900, more than four out of five workers
performed manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the development of heavy equipment, such as earth movers,
backhoes and cranes, increased productivity and reduced the number
of workers needed for physical labor, according to Steve Hipple, an
economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big shift in labor in the past century has been away from
mining, manufacturing and construction,'' Hipple said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 percent of workers are now employed in manufacturing,
and agricultural workers make up just 2.5 percent of today's labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has contributed to another big change, Hipple said:
``the mass influx of women into the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, only about 18 percent of the labor force was female.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the century, ``factory work pulled young
women off the farm,'' said Paula Rayman, a labor economist at
Harvard University. But after they married, women generally
returned to the home to raise children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of female workers remained relatively low until the
1960s, when inflation and rising housing costs spurred more females
to seek work in the office buildings, restaurants, hotels and malls
rising up around them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the advent of computers accelerated the shift of
work's burdens from legs and backs to fingertips and brains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with most jobs located in offices and stores, about 62
million women are among the 133.5 million Americans working, or 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   And now another wave of innovation is generating
turn-of-the-century optimism. With new technologies boosting
productivity, consumer confidence is at historic highs and labor
experts say working conditions may soon be getting even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to need more education'' to keep pace with
the changes, Van Horn said. But for those who get the right
training, the workplace soon could have all the comforts of home.
In fact, it will be home for the millions of workers who will be
using advanced telecommunications devices as their tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When wireless connections start to work (well), that will
change our ideas about whether people have to work in certain
buildings,'' such as offices or factories, he said. ``Houses will
be redesigned so that our work space will be in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new century, a major shift for women may be toward
self-employment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue we are hearing about now from young women
is: Can you work and still have a life?'' she said. To give
themselves more scheduling flexibility, many women will be looking
for ways to work from home or to run their own businesses, she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Rutgers labor expert Van Horn says it won't be only women
looking for more scheduling freedom. New technologies will soon be
freeing 21st century workers from hectic commutes, giving rise to
more leisure time, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   While it's difficult to forecast the future of work, only thing
that seems certain is that ``you're going to have much more
flexibility about where you can work,'' he said.

 &HT;    DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGY BRINGS CHANGE TO FRUIT GROWERS

   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Jim Miller's Redlands orchard used to
sit among dozens of farms in the shadow of the Colorado National
Monument, a national park. Now, suburban homes line the road.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches have been grown in the Grand Valley for more than 100
years. The last century has changed not only how the crop is
harvested, but the product itself. Smaller trees, different
pesticides and changing labor pools have transformed how farmers
grow their peaches.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference starts with the actual trees, said Harold
Larson, a fruit pathologist with the Colorado State University's
Orchard Mesa Research Station. Trees are smaller, closer together
and so laden with fruit many need to be propped up with supports
once the harvest nears.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter trees mean easier harvests, Larson said. Pickers can
now work almost entirely from the ground, using shorter ladders
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals used to keep the trees pest-free and healthy have
shifted as well.
</P>
<P>
   Growers used to spray the trees with pesticides such as sulfur,
arsenic and nicotine, Larson said. Technology has replaced those
chemicals with less toxic pesticides that only need to be used once
or twice a summer. And some pests can be lured into traps with
chemicals that mimic those bugs produce in the mating season.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban sprawl creates a separate problem for farmers like
Miller. The pesticides can drift in the air, Miller said, wafting
into neighboring homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the homes may be closer to the orchards, the sense of
community that once characterized the harvest has all but vanished,
said Harry Talbott, whose Orchard Mesa farm is one of the largest
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1950s, when the whole town would come out for the
harvest, both Talbott and Miller said they can rarely find local
workers to pick and prune in the orchards. Local students would
rather work in the packing shed or even at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, I hired 24 high school students to pick cherries.
They couldn't pick a ton a day,'' Miller said. The next summer,
migrant workers from Mexico picked more than three times the amount
of the high school students. This year, Miller said, he paid
pickers by the hour rather than the pound, marking a subtle change
in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches themselves have changed in response to consumers, who
now tend to eat a few peaches a week rather than canning dozens at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest has spread to nearly the entire summer, giving
customers about three months of fresh peaches. Growers have shifted
from the traditional Elberta, an even-colored peach that separates
easily from its pit for canning, to tastier varieties that have a
more reddish tint and clings to the pit.

 &HT;    NCR'S FOUNDER WAS A PIONEER IN CARING FOR WORKERS
 &HT;    With LABOR. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By LYNN HULSEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A hundred years ago, an eccentric and visionary
industrialist was setting a pattern for business and labor
practices now in common use.
</P>
<P>
   He was John H. Patterson, a co-founder of National Cash Register
Co. Patterson was famous for impulsive actions, often firing
executives who displeased him. But he also had a paternalistic
interest in workers' welfare.
</P>
<P>
   For many men and women, getting hired on at ``the Cash'' was the
ticket to a lifetime job at the world's largest producer of
mechanical cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson understood, long before his contemporaries, that a
happy, comfortable worker is a more productive one. He offered
higher wages and a cleaner, safer work environment than the typical
1900-era factory.
</P>
<P>
   Company cafeterias sold hot meals for less than it cost to
provide the food. The well-lit factories had first aid stations,
locker rooms and a ventilation system. Employees were even
permitted two baths a week on company time in company bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The hours were long. Employees typically put in 59 hours per
six-day week in 1902. Weekly wages for a messenger totaled $5 per
week, while a carpenter could expect to take home the handsome sum
of $14.85. By 1917, company records show that Patterson offered
time-and-a-half wages for work exceeding 48 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton businessmen criticized Patterson for paying workers more
than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, paid vacations were still many years away, but
Patterson would load employees onto trains and take them on an
expenses-paid, out-of-state excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Total employment was 2,269, mostly men engaged in the
manufacture of cash registers at the Dayton headquarters. NCR also
operated far-flung international sales offices that used
Patterson's pioneering sales techniques, including quotas,
territories and regular communication with salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   According to local historian Claudia Watson, Patterson ``would
always say he was selling a system, not a cash register. He would
understand the term 'business solution'.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company once known for innovation failed to adapt
quickly to the world of microelectronics. It suffered a wrenching
period of downsizing, restructuring, a 1991 takeover by AT&AMP;T and,
at its worst, near collapse in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1996, the company was again restructured. Its name
was changed back to NCR, and it began shedding unprofitable
businesses and rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is a high-technology, publicly traded company involved
in the collection, warehousing and analysis of data for retail,
financial and communications industries.

 &HT;    CHICKEN WASN'T ALWAYS AN EVERYDAY MEAL
 &HT;    With LABOR. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By JOHNNY JOHNSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ It was in 1928 that Herbert Hoover's
presidential campaign coined the slogan ``a chicken in every pot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 20th century, a chicken dinner was a
delicacy for most Americans. But over the years, improvements in
breeding and technology have created a poultry farming industry and
made chicken one of the main protein sources for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't really a market for poultry meat'' in
Hoover's day, said David Alders, a local poultry producer for
Pilgrim's Pride. The main purpose of chickens back then was to
produce eggs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone did want to make a meal out of a spare chicken, the
bird would have to be caught, killed, plucked, dressed, cut up and
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of consumers could buy a whole chicken at
the market, but they still had to dress, cut and cook it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, people could buy only the cuts they desired. Better yet,
restaurants specializing in cooked chicken by the piece appeared,
and then became ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   America has gone from producing 34 million chickens in 1934 to 7
billion in 1994, and per-capita consumption has risen from less
than one pound to more than 81 pounds over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   These changes were made possible by radical improvements in the
poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest changes has been in the birds themselves.
Chickens have been engineered to yield more meat, especially white
meat, in a shorter time, Alders said. Most people don't even think
of today's chickens as once having been a specific breed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has transformed the poultry farm almost as
completely, slashing labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I operate a seven-house broiler farm, with no permanent help,
other than my 13-year-old son, and still have time to do many other
things,'' he said. ``That would have been unheard of several years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders raises about 140,000 chickens a year. In the early days,
feed and water had to be put out manually, which was very
time-consuming, he said. Even after the invention of automated
</P>
<P>
   chain troughs, which could deliver feed throughout a house, feed
had to be manually distributed for baby chicks, which could not yet
reach the troughs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many new houses are allowing growers to automatically
distribute feed on paper during the ``brooding stage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other advancements include automated water and climate control
systems, Alders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have computers that run fans, heaters and foggers,'' he
said. ``I never have to turn anything on manually.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders said automated ``chicken catchers'' that herd grown
chickens from the houses onto trucks for market are already being
advertised in many poultry magazines. Those could eventually cut
labor costs by 60 to 70 percent, he said.

 &HT;    RAILROADS HAVE SHRUNK, BUT JOBS LARGELY THE SAME
 &HT;    With LABOR. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)

 &HT;    By JANITA POE

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When retired Southern Railroad machinist Bill Purdie
began his career in 1936, old-timers could remember the Civil War,
and the railroad was still the main mode of long-distance travel.
</P>
<P>
   His starting salary? Twenty-two and half cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie spent the next several decades doing pretty much the same
thing: making and repairing steam engine parts.
</P>
<P>
   The steam engine required a lot of welding and drilling holes
and making bolts, parts and castings, said Purdie, now an
85-year-old retiree. ``It was hard work and heavy repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did a century ago, laborers still build, repair and
maintain the railroad engines, equipment and lines, and conductors
still oversee business on the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Railroading, in general, is fundamentally about the same job
as years ago,'' said conductor Jack Hunt, 46.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Crescent, an Amtrak train that links New Orleans and
New York, conductor Hunt recently sat down in the lounge car and
penciled in numbers on his ``turnover sheet'' and ``delay report,''
just as historians say early conductors did in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The only new technology Hunt regularly uses on the job is his
cell phone, which replaced his radio last year as his tool for
contacting the engineers at approaching stations. While radios had
limited frequencies, he said, cell phones almost guarantee
immediate contact.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change in railroad work can be found in the
type of labor required to build a train or a railroad line, said
Lesa(cq) Campbell, a historian with the Southeastern Railway Museum
in Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Around the turn of the century, railroad tracks were built with
the brawn of outdoor laborers. But today, most of the line work now
involves repair and maintenance. Instead of 30 work gang members
driving spikes, one by one, a crew of about six skilled workers
operates hydraulic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The job of engine shop and roundhouse workers also has became
less labor-intensive in the second half of the century. After the
diesel engine replaced steam in the 1950s, their work evolved into
what now is primarily parts assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers needed to operate the railroads has
declined sharply from earlier years. Currently, about 24,000
employees work for Amtrak, according to spokesman Steven
Taubenkibel. Another 200,000 work for the four major freight
railroad companies _ CSX and Norfolk Southern in the East, and
Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union-Pacific in the West.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campbell, 1.8 million people worked for the
railroads in 1917, one of the peak years for the industry.

 &HT;    BABY BOOMERS RE-INVENTING NOTION OF RETIREMENT
 &HT;    With LABOR. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Retirement, which barely existed at the
dawn of the 20th century, could evolve quickly in the 21st under
the influence of the Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War veterans were probably the first group to get
pensions, but retirement still wasn't even a dream for small-town
shopkeepers and farmers as the 20th century approached. Few had to
worry long: average life expectancy was 49 in 1900, and only about
one in 25 Americans was 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for old-age security had become standard fare for labor
organizers and social reformers by the end of World War I, but they
were little heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the Crash of 1929 made retirement an unwelcome
reality for millions. The Great Depression spurred more than a
dozen states to enact old-age plans among other relief measures,
but most were restricted to the truly poor, and few paid enough to
live on.

<P>
   President Franklin Roosevelt proposed ``cradle to grave''
economic security, and Congress passed the Social Security Act
overwhelmingly in 1935. It took nearly two years to set up the
system before Ernest Ackerman, a streetcar motorman from Cleveland,
became the first person to apply for benefits. He got a lump-sum
payment: 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, older people are a force in American society like never
before. Already, one in eight Americans is 65 or older, and by 2030
it will be one in five.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to decades of strong overall economic growth and the
flowering of public and private pensions, the 65-to-74 age group
has the country's highest median net worth, $190,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to medical progress, older people can actively enjoy
their wealth. More than 72 percent of retirement-age Americans say
they are in good or excellent health, and a 65-year-old can expect
to live another 17.7 years.
</P>
<P>
   So barring an economic shock, the Baby Boomers who changed
America in the '60s are poised to change it again as they enter
their own 60s, a milestone just over five years away for the
generation's leading edge.
</P>
<P>
   One survey found that eight in 10 intend to keep working in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading-edge Baby Boomers are likely to work at least 20
hours a week,'' says Charles F. Longino Jr., professor of
gerontology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. ``They'll
be returning for second careers. They'll be going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be much more mainstream to get up and go,'' said
R. Alan Fox, editor and publisher of Where to Retire magazine. ``It
will be like going away to college.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the early 19th century, Abraham Lincoln and
his youthful peers attended so-called ``blab'' schools, where they
repeated their lessons aloud, over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   When Deborah Husak left public school more than 150 years later,
recitation and memorizing still were in vogue. But when Husak began
teaching in 1968, education was undergoing a fundamental change.
Students were being encouraged to think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher is really more of a facilitator now,'' said Husak,
who teaches fourth grade at Mills Elementary School in South
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Blackboards and chalk have given way to computers and overhead
projectors, and personal counseling, even ethics instruction, have
joined readin', writin', and 'rithmetic. The profession of an
estimated 3 million people nationwide has never been more
challenging _ even if the pay remains relatively low and respect is
a now-and-then thing.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the frightening new circumstance of being potential
targets of kids with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that guns can be at your school makes the whole
environment very unstable,'' said Leyla Cohlmia, a chemistry
teacher at Austin High School.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teachers must compete with television, radio, movies,
wireless communication, computers and the Internet _ especially the
Internet. These technology choices offer children a wealth of
sophisticated information that they expect to encounter in school.
They get angry and bored when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to be that much more prepared,'' Cohlmia said. ``We
never thought of talking to someone in England on the Internet
about their weather. We went to the encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have to be ready, as well, to act as emotional,
financial and even ethical counselors to the young survivors of the
disintegration of the two-parent family. At the same time, they're
teaching a new generation of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers work,'' Husak said. ``Sometimes there's no one at
home. Sometimes kids speak the language, and sometimes they
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another problem that teachers must solve, said Jackson Pace,
who teaches physics and computer networking at LBJ High School, is
that while contemporary education encourages children to think for
themselves, employers increasingly complain that new graduates
can't do it. Pace believes the problem is caused by students'
overriding need to master multiple-choice tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids scope out the teachers, and the way they test, and forget
the content,'' Pace said. ``They don't know biology, but they're
making A's in biology. The multiple-guess test has got to go, if
you're trying to figure out if they can think.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the American labor force, a century of hard
work has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day 1900, the typical American worker was a man
accustomed to toiling 10 hours a day, six days a week on a farm or
in a factory. Injury and illness were constant threats. Frequent
baths, fun vacations and full lunch buckets were virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many people would want to go back to those good
old days,'' said Carl Van Horn, a labor expert at Rutgers
University. ``Working conditions are so much better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers of 1900 may have been tired, hot and dirty, but they
were also optimistic. New technologies such as electric lights,
telephones and automobiles were appearing, stirring hopes that work
would be easier and life more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, those dreams have become our reality. On Labor
Day 2000, American workers are healthier, safer and better paid
than at any time in history. One of the few things they have in
common with their counterparts 100 years ago is a sense of
confidence that technology will continue to improve working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Coming changes could scarcely be more sweeping than those of the
past century.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics show that overwhelmingly, Americans in
1900 worked with their backs and often endured brutal working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most common job for men was farm laborer. For women, it was
domestic servant. Even children _ one-sixth of them under 16 were
working _ held strenuous jobs, commonly working in coal mines and
textile mills.
</P>
<P>
   Without machinery such as tractors, washing machines and power
tools, jobs were physically demanding and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workplace was quite unsafe,'' said Roy Rosenzweig, a
history professor at George Mason University. In the late 1800s,
about 35,000 workers were killed each year in industrial accidents,
Rosenzweig said. Many employers found ``it was cheaper to let
people die than to improve safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs involving railroads or coal mines were especially lethal.
On May 1, 1900, in Scofield, Utah, more than 200 miners were killed
when coal dust ignited and created a huge fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a much larger work force, only about 6,000 people
die each year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of all employees now work in stores and
offices, enjoying the benefits of central heat and air
conditioning. Even factory workers generally have indoor plumbing,
plenty of light and climate control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, vacations were virtually unknown except in a few
white-collar professions. Leisure for common workers came only on
Sundays, Christmas, July 4 and perhaps Labor Day, a legal holiday
in most states at that time. Retirement was rare, even for the
relatively few people who lived to age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Today, full-time employees typically work five days a week, get
paid vacations and look forward to more than a decade of retirement
beyond age 65. Benefits unimaginable in 1900 are routine for many
workers in 2000: medical insurance, life insurance, subsidized
retirement savings, stock options, and subsidies for child care,
education and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation also has improved. Although the average work week
in 1900 was 59 hours, family incomes averaged just $375 a year. A
typical worker had to toil about two hours to purchase a dozen
eggs, compared to five minutes' work at today's average hourly wage
of $13.71.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of getting enough good food was reflected in
people's physical stature. At the turn of the century, the average
height of Army recruits was just under 5 feet 7 inches. Today it's
5 feet 10 inches, and researchers say the change can be credited to
improved nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work and low pay also helped shorten life spans. The
average American died at about age 49, compared with today's
average of more than 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the improvement in workers' lives?
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn of Rutgers said part of the credit goes to changes in
public policies. Child labor laws, Social Security, occupational
safety regulations, wage-and-hour laws and employer-backed pensions
and insurance vastly improved the lot of workers. Union efforts to
win a 40-hour work week and paid vacations helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   But technological change was the key to higher living and
working standards. In 1900, more than four out of five workers
performed manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the development of heavy equipment, such as earth movers,
backhoes and cranes, increased productivity and reduced the number
of workers needed for physical labor, according to Steve Hipple, an
economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big shift in labor in the past century has been away from
mining, manufacturing and construction,'' Hipple said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 percent of workers are now employed in manufacturing,
and agricultural workers make up just 2.5 percent of today's labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has contributed to another big change, Hipple said:
``the mass influx of women into the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, only about 18 percent of the labor force was female.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the century, ``factory work pulled young
women off the farm,'' said Paula Rayman, a labor economist at
Harvard University. But after they married, women generally
returned to the home to raise children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of female workers remained relatively low until the
1960s, when inflation and rising housing costs spurred more females
to seek work in the office buildings, restaurants, hotels and malls
rising up around them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the advent of computers accelerated the shift of
work's burdens from legs and backs to fingertips and brains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with most jobs located in offices and stores, about 62
million women are among the 133.5 million Americans working, or 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   And now another wave of innovation is generating
turn-of-the-century optimism. With new technologies boosting
productivity, consumer confidence is at historic highs and labor
experts say working conditions may soon be getting even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to need more education'' to keep pace with
the changes, Van Horn said. But for those who get the right
training, the workplace soon could have all the comforts of home.
In fact, it will be home for the millions of workers who will be
using advanced telecommunications devices as their tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When wireless connections start to work (well), that will
change our ideas about whether people have to work in certain
buildings,'' such as offices or factories, he said. ``Houses will
be redesigned so that our work space will be in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new century, a major shift for women may be toward
self-employment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue we are hearing about now from young women
is: Can you work and still have a life?'' she said. To give
themselves more scheduling flexibility, many women will be looking
for ways to work from home or to run their own businesses, she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Rutgers labor expert Van Horn says it won't be only women
looking for more scheduling freedom. New technologies will soon be
freeing 21st century workers from hectic commutes, giving rise to
more leisure time, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   While it's difficult to forecast the future of work, only thing
that seems certain is that ``you're going to have much more
flexibility about where you can work,'' he said.

   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Jim Miller's Redlands orchard used to
sit among dozens of farms in the shadow of the Colorado National
Monument, a national park. Now, suburban homes line the road.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches have been grown in the Grand Valley for more than 100
years. The last century has changed not only how the crop is
harvested, but the product itself. Smaller trees, different
pesticides and changing labor pools have transformed how farmers
grow their peaches.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference starts with the actual trees, said Harold
Larson, a fruit pathologist with the Colorado State University's
Orchard Mesa Research Station. Trees are smaller, closer together
and so laden with fruit many need to be propped up with supports
once the harvest nears.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter trees mean easier harvests, Larson said. Pickers can
now work almost entirely from the ground, using shorter ladders
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals used to keep the trees pest-free and healthy have
shifted as well.
</P>
<P>
   Growers used to spray the trees with pesticides such as sulfur,
arsenic and nicotine, Larson said. Technology has replaced those
chemicals with less toxic pesticides that only need to be used once
or twice a summer. And some pests can be lured into traps with
chemicals that mimic those bugs produce in the mating season.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban sprawl creates a separate problem for farmers like
Miller. The pesticides can drift in the air, Miller said, wafting
into neighboring homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the homes may be closer to the orchards, the sense of
community that once characterized the harvest has all but vanished,
said Harry Talbott, whose Orchard Mesa farm is one of the largest
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1950s, when the whole town would come out for the
harvest, both Talbott and Miller said they can rarely find local
workers to pick and prune in the orchards. Local students would
rather work in the packing shed or even at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, I hired 24 high school students to pick cherries.
They couldn't pick a ton a day,'' Miller said. The next summer,
migrant workers from Mexico picked more than three times the amount
of the high school students. This year, Miller said, he paid
pickers by the hour rather than the pound, marking a subtle change
in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches themselves have changed in response to consumers, who
now tend to eat a few peaches a week rather than canning dozens at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest has spread to nearly the entire summer, giving
customers about three months of fresh peaches. Growers have shifted
from the traditional Elberta, an even-colored peach that separates
easily from its pit for canning, to tastier varieties that have a
more reddish tint and clings to the pit.

 &HT;    NCR'S FOUNDER WAS A PIONEER IN CARING FOR WORKERS
 &HT;    With LABOR. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)

 &HT;    By LYNN HULSEY

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A hundred years ago, an eccentric and visionary
industrialist was setting a pattern for business and labor
practices now in common use.
</P>
<P>
   He was John H. Patterson, a co-founder of National Cash Register
Co. Patterson was famous for impulsive actions, often firing
executives who displeased him. But he also had a paternalistic
interest in workers' welfare.
</P>
<P>
   For many men and women, getting hired on at ``the Cash'' was the
ticket to a lifetime job at the world's largest producer of
mechanical cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson understood, long before his contemporaries, that a
happy, comfortable worker is a more productive one. He offered
higher wages and a cleaner, safer work environment than the typical
1900-era factory.
</P>
<P>
   Company cafeterias sold hot meals for less than it cost to
provide the food. The well-lit factories had first aid stations,
locker rooms and a ventilation system. Employees were even
permitted two baths a week on company time in company bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The hours were long. Employees typically put in 59 hours per
six-day week in 1902. Weekly wages for a messenger totaled $5 per
week, while a carpenter could expect to take home the handsome sum
of $14.85. By 1917, company records show that Patterson offered
time-and-a-half wages for work exceeding 48 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton businessmen criticized Patterson for paying workers more
than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, paid vacations were still many years away, but
Patterson would load employees onto trains and take them on an
expenses-paid, out-of-state excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Total employment was 2,269, mostly men engaged in the
manufacture of cash registers at the Dayton headquarters. NCR also
operated far-flung international sales offices that used
Patterson's pioneering sales techniques, including quotas,
territories and regular communication with salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   According to local historian Claudia Watson, Patterson ``would
always say he was selling a system, not a cash register. He would
understand the term 'business solution'.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company once known for innovation failed to adapt
quickly to the world of microelectronics. It suffered a wrenching
period of downsizing, restructuring, a 1991 takeover by AT&AMP;T and,
at its worst, near collapse in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1996, the company was again restructured. Its name
was changed back to NCR, and it began shedding unprofitable
businesses and rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is a high-technology, publicly traded company involved
in the collection, warehousing and analysis of data for retail,
financial and communications industries.

 &HT;    CHICKEN WASN'T ALWAYS AN EVERYDAY MEAL
 &HT;    With LABOR. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.

<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ It was in 1928 that Herbert Hoover's
presidential campaign coined the slogan ``a chicken in every pot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 20th century, a chicken dinner was a
delicacy for most Americans. But over the years, improvements in
breeding and technology have created a poultry farming industry and
made chicken one of the main protein sources for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't really a market for poultry meat'' in
Hoover's day, said David Alders, a local poultry producer for
Pilgrim's Pride. The main purpose of chickens back then was to
produce eggs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone did want to make a meal out of a spare chicken, the
bird would have to be caught, killed, plucked, dressed, cut up and
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of consumers could buy a whole chicken at
the market, but they still had to dress, cut and cook it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, people could buy only the cuts they desired. Better yet,
restaurants specializing in cooked chicken by the piece appeared,
and then became ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   America has gone from producing 34 million chickens in 1934 to 7
billion in 1994, and per-capita consumption has risen from less
than one pound to more than 81 pounds over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   These changes were made possible by radical improvements in the
poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest changes has been in the birds themselves.
Chickens have been engineered to yield more meat, especially white
meat, in a shorter time, Alders said. Most people don't even think
of today's chickens as once having been a specific breed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has transformed the poultry farm almost as
completely, slashing labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I operate a seven-house broiler farm, with no permanent help,
other than my 13-year-old son, and still have time to do many other
things,'' he said. ``That would have been unheard of several years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders raises about 140,000 chickens a year. In the early days,
feed and water had to be put out manually, which was very
time-consuming, he said. Even after the invention of automated
</P>
<P>
   chain troughs, which could deliver feed throughout a house, feed
had to be manually distributed for baby chicks, which could not yet
reach the troughs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many new houses are allowing growers to automatically
distribute feed on paper during the ``brooding stage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other advancements include automated water and climate control
systems, Alders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have computers that run fans, heaters and foggers,'' he
said. ``I never have to turn anything on manually.''
</P>
<P>
   Alders said automated ``chicken catchers'' that herd grown
chickens from the houses onto trucks for market are already being
advertised in many poultry magazines. Those could eventually cut
labor costs by 60 to 70 percent, he said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When retired Southern Railroad machinist Bill Purdie
began his career in 1936, old-timers could remember the Civil War,
and the railroad was still the main mode of long-distance travel.
</P>
<P>
   His starting salary? Twenty-two and half cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie spent the next several decades doing pretty much the same
thing: making and repairing steam engine parts.
</P>
<P>
   The steam engine required a lot of welding and drilling holes
and making bolts, parts and castings, said Purdie, now an
85-year-old retiree. ``It was hard work and heavy repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did a century ago, laborers still build, repair and
maintain the railroad engines, equipment and lines, and conductors
still oversee business on the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Railroading, in general, is fundamentally about the same job
as years ago,'' said conductor Jack Hunt, 46.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Crescent, an Amtrak train that links New Orleans and
New York, conductor Hunt recently sat down in the lounge car and
penciled in numbers on his ``turnover sheet'' and ``delay report,''
just as historians say early conductors did in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The only new technology Hunt regularly uses on the job is his
cell phone, which replaced his radio last year as his tool for
contacting the engineers at approaching stations. While radios had
limited frequencies, he said, cell phones almost guarantee
immediate contact.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change in railroad work can be found in the
type of labor required to build a train or a railroad line, said
Lesa(cq) Campbell, a historian with the Southeastern Railway Museum
in Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Around the turn of the century, railroad tracks were built with
the brawn of outdoor laborers. But today, most of the line work now
involves repair and maintenance. Instead of 30 work gang members
driving spikes, one by one, a crew of about six skilled workers
operates hydraulic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The job of engine shop and roundhouse workers also has became
less labor-intensive in the second half of the century. After the
diesel engine replaced steam in the 1950s, their work evolved into
what now is primarily parts assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers needed to operate the railroads has
declined sharply from earlier years. Currently, about 24,000
employees work for Amtrak, according to spokesman Steven
Taubenkibel. Another 200,000 work for the four major freight
railroad companies _ CSX and Norfolk Southern in the East, and
Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union-Pacific in the West.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campbell, 1.8 million people worked for the
railroads in 1917, one of the peak years for the industry.

 &HT;    BABY BOOMERS RE-INVENTING NOTION OF RETIREMENT
 &HT;    With LABOR. Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By DOUGLAS KALAJIAN

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Retirement, which barely existed at the
dawn of the 20th century, could evolve quickly in the 21st under
the influence of the Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War veterans were probably the first group to get
pensions, but retirement still wasn't even a dream for small-town
shopkeepers and farmers as the 20th century approached. Few had to
worry long: average life expectancy was 49 in 1900, and only about
one in 25 Americans was 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for old-age security had become standard fare for labor
organizers and social reformers by the end of World War I, but they
were little heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the Crash of 1929 made retirement an unwelcome
reality for millions. The Great Depression spurred more than a
dozen states to enact old-age plans among other relief measures,
but most were restricted to the truly poor, and few paid enough to
live on.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin Roosevelt proposed ``cradle to grave''
economic security, and Congress passed the Social Security Act
overwhelmingly in 1935. It took nearly two years to set up the
system before Ernest Ackerman, a streetcar motorman from Cleveland,
became the first person to apply for benefits. He got a lump-sum
payment: 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, older people are a force in American society like never
before. Already, one in eight Americans is 65 or older, and by 2030
it will be one in five.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to decades of strong overall economic growth and the
flowering of public and private pensions, the 65-to-74 age group
has the country's highest median net worth, $190,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to medical progress, older people can actively enjoy
their wealth. More than 72 percent of retirement-age Americans say
they are in good or excellent health, and a 65-year-old can expect
to live another 17.7 years.
</P>
<P>
   So barring an economic shock, the Baby Boomers who changed
America in the '60s are poised to change it again as they enter
their own 60s, a milestone just over five years away for the
generation's leading edge.
</P>
<P>
   One survey found that eight in 10 intend to keep working in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading-edge Baby Boomers are likely to work at least 20
hours a week,'' says Charles F. Longino Jr., professor of
gerontology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. ``They'll
be returning for second careers. They'll be going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be much more mainstream to get up and go,'' said
R. Alan Fox, editor and publisher of Where to Retire magazine. ``It
will be like going away to college.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the early 19th century, Abraham Lincoln and
his youthful peers attended so-called ``blab'' schools, where they
repeated their lessons aloud, over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   When Deborah Husak left public school more than 150 years later,
recitation and memorizing still were in vogue. But when Husak began
teaching in 1968, education was undergoing a fundamental change.
Students were being encouraged to think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher is really more of a facilitator now,'' said Husak,
who teaches fourth grade at Mills Elementary School in South
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Blackboards and chalk have given way to computers and overhead
projectors, and personal counseling, even ethics instruction, have
joined readin', writin', and 'rithmetic. The profession of an
estimated 3 million people nationwide has never been more
challenging _ even if the pay remains relatively low and respect is
a now-and-then thing.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the frightening new circumstance of being potential
targets of kids with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that guns can be at your school makes the whole
environment very unstable,'' said Leyla Cohlmia, a chemistry
teacher at Austin High School.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teachers must compete with television, radio, movies,
wireless communication, computers and the Internet _ especially the
Internet. These technology choices offer children a wealth of
sophisticated information that they expect to encounter in school.
They get angry and bored when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to be that much more prepared,'' Cohlmia said. ``We
never thought of talking to someone in England on the Internet
about their weather. We went to the encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have to be ready, as well, to act as emotional,
financial and even ethical counselors to the young survivors of the
disintegration of the two-parent family. At the same time, they're
teaching a new generation of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers work,'' Husak said. ``Sometimes there's no one at
home. Sometimes kids speak the language, and sometimes they
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another problem that teachers must solve, said Jackson Pace,
who teaches physics and computer networking at LBJ High School, is
that while contemporary education encourages children to think for
themselves, employers increasingly complain that new graduates
can't do it. Pace believes the problem is caused by students'
overriding need to master multiple-choice tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids scope out the teachers, and the way they test, and forget
the content,'' Pace said. ``They don't know biology, but they're
making A's in biology. The multiple-guess test has got to go, if
you're trying to figure out if they can think.''

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the great paradoxes of our aging service
economy is that actual service, with a human face and a helping
hand, has disappeared from most American companies. The service
that most of us encounter these days is virtual, supplied by voice
mail, e-mail, satellite pagers and, of course, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are noticing the difference. According to the American
Customer Satisfaction Index, compiled by the University of
Michigan, customer-service satisfaction has dropped since 1994 in
nearly every sector of the economy, with much of the blame going to
the increased use of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Call any business today _ your insurer, an airline, a credit
card issuer, a computer manufacturer, the phone company, your local
bank _ and whether you are trying to make a purchase, reserve a
seat, check your balance or, heaven forbid, obtain technical help _
odds are that you will be directed to the company's Web site to
fend for yourself. In other words, service has become self-service.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine walking into a fine restaurant and being told: ``Foie
gras is over here, truffles are over here, and sorry but our bread
is on back order, but you can check the status of your bread order
online, and don't forget your express service tag when confirming
your entree.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are fortunate enough to get a human being on the phone,
it is certain that you will be asked to verify your account number
and nature of your call, even though you have spent the past 10
minutes doing just that through the automated voice menu. And,
should you require further assistance, the person you are speaking
with is often powerless to do anything but transfer you to a
supervisor who will either shunt you back into the automated system
or suggest you visit the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations think they have the situation covered by assuring
customers that ``this call may be recorded to ensure quality.'' But
what does call monitoring really say about service? To the
employee, it says: ``We don't trust you to do your job
professionally. We will be watching and listening. Should you
deviate from your approved script or linger too long with a caller,
you will be disciplined.'' To the customer, the subtle message is,
``If you dare to complain, we will have evidence to show that our
personnel acted in compliance with our corporate courtesy policies
while you lost your cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, who besides the legal department would ever take comfort
in the fact that a given business records its service calls?
</P>
<P>
   What customer would be likely to think: ``It took 20 rings, six
menu options and three service reps to find out that my account
still hasn't been credited for the returned items, but at least
they taped my call.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that companies don't deserve the latest
in call-routing networks or that they shouldn't have the best
customer management software on their Web sites. But too many
businesses are using these technologies as proxies for real service
because it so much easier to invest in systems, which can be
programmed and paid for once, than in people, who need to be
trained and retrained, not to mention incentivized, energized,
refreshed and promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that much of what is passed off as customer
management is in fact anti-customer and anti-employee, and
companies are beginning to pay a price for their steadfast reliance
on such tools. Employees in jobs requiring direct human contact
perform less well when the basic dynamic of a customer relationship
has been taken away from them. Ultimately, they flee from boredom
or a sense of hitting a dead end, or else their jobs are outsourced
to third-party providers, whose allegiance is to the contract with
the client and not the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Volume, speed, economy, ``scalability'' _ these are the
watchwords of modern customer relations management. Emphasis on
attributes like these is born of business models and strategic
plans fixated on increasing ``eyeballs'' and transactions while
decreasing costs, rather than building loyalty among customers and
employees and reducing mistakes in delivery of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that so many dot-com companies are struggling?
I bet you that all of them have very ``robust'' service models,
with powerful tracking and data-mining software for customer
profiling. Yet I wonder how many of these businesses have made the
same commitment to their hiring and orientation practices, or have
taken the time to create a hard measure of their own service
glitches, or have entrusted their employees to use their own
judgment when correcting problems rather than relying on the heavy
team approach that characterizes the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that these enterprises are offering innovative
products and services. Their common failing is they haven't learned
to treat their customers the way they themselves would like to be
treated.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Should we conclude from the final verdict of
``Survivor'' that life is a game? Games are metaphors, in that they
reframe familiar human events, make them formal, set them apart
with beginnings and endings. Games attach some motivation to human
activities, along with a certain amount of stage setting: the
elegant pieces of a chess set, tennis whites. In the Western
tradition, we take it for granted that the purpose of a game is to
win.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of ``Survivor'' designed their game to require the
players to eject other members of their own group and to betray
their allies. They surrounded the game with an elaborate and corny
setting and a set of rules and rituals that seemed to be inspired
by memories of some ill-understood Introduction to Anthropology
course. The trappings of a popular image of the primitive were used
not only for cosmetic purposes, but also to legitimize behavior
that many people would find unacceptable in other contexts.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the course of evolution, human beings really had
practiced Hobbes' ``war of all against all,'' our species would not
have survived. Nor would we have survived if our families, tribes
and communities had been based solely on calculated advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Human groups that depended on Stone Age technologies also
depended on mutual caring. More than any other species, Homo
sapiens must learn cooperation. Even some sociobiologists who argue
a direct application of the ``survival of the fittest'' acknowledge
that fitness refers to reproductive success, which includes, for
human beings, caring for the weak.
</P>
<P>
   One of the distinctive characteristics of our species is the
ability to think and communicate about conditions that are not real
or not verifiable. We can lie. We can make believe. We can
postulate hypothetical subatomic particles and remote planets,
opening doorways of scientific exploration. We can believe in gods.
We can play. But it pays to know what we are doing.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Survivor,'' the prize went to Rich, the player who was
apparently clearest from the beginning that this was a game of
strategy and alliances. The prize did not go to players who stood
firmly on personal honor (Rudy) or emphasized relationships
(Susan).
</P>
<P>
   Several players spoke of what they had learned in the experience
_ a kind of reward beyond money. Rich won by concentrating from the
start on the game itself _ where Kelly, for example, waffled. But
if Rich were to play the game of life only as he played the game of
``Survivor,'' he would be likely to lose in a more fundamental way
_ losing the joy that comes with relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Games draw their metaphors from many sources: big business,
power politics, exploration. Game theory tends to focus on the
metaphor of competition. As in economic analysis, the theory gets
easier if one assumes that human beings have very simple
motivations, like always seeking to maximize profit. There is an
old joke in which an economist is asked what he would do if he were
marooned on a desert island with a case of canned tuna, and he
answers, ``assume a can opener.'' The million-dollar prize is the
equivalent of the can opener _ something introduced from outside
the situation that reduces complex human motivations to a single
goal.
</P>
<P>
   If the outcome of ``Survivor'' convinces people that there is
something fundamentally, primally human about competition that
legitimizes betrayal, it moves us one step further into being a
society whose values are defined by the economists. But if it
reminds us of the artificiality of such a society, it can help us
avoid the kind of stage setting that forces such behavior. We might
move on from the ``Survivor'' motto _ ``Outwit, Outplay, Outlast''
_ to ``Outgrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The final episode included a test in which the three finalists
competed to see who could stand longest on the ends of logs while
keeping a hand on a fantasy ``idol.'' This is no more than another
piece of kitsch cooked up by the producers, but it makes a
suggestive metaphor: Our simplifying assumption about human
behavior is the assumption that profit is our god. The danger is
that believing it might make it so.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ George W. Bush claims Al Gore is campaigning on
the issue of class warfare, and of course he is right. What Bush
doesn't mention is that he's running on class warfare, too _ but
the classes are different. For Gore, it's rich vs. ``working
families,'' and he's against the rich. For Bush, the war is between
the meritocracy and everyone else, and he's against the
meritocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate is on the right side to win, depending on which
war is really being fought _ or, more accurately, on which war most
the voters would rather win.
</P>
<P>
   If it is an economic class war, Gore has a chance of victory.
There is a widespread perception of the growing disparity in
wealth, and no one disputes that the tax cut Bush proposes would
greatly benefit the very rich. But a more immediate question is how
to keep the good times rolling, and Bush would claim that the
credit for them lies elsewhere than with the Clinton-Gore
administration, and that he is the true champion of working
families.
</P>
<P>
   The economic battle for the presidency could go either way. And
that brings us to the other battle, the one that Bush expects to
win: the war against the meritocracy.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war over what kind of people should be in charge, and
it has been raging for decades. To some extent it's a values war.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the GI Bill, college has depended increasingly
more on measurable scholastic ability than on the status of wealth
or birth. The good schools, and afterward the good jobs, public and
private, have been going to those with the highest grades and SAT
scores. The trend accelerated in the 1960s, as federal scholarships
and loans and needs-based financial aid further widened the college
applicant pool. It is widely assumed that Bush could not get into
Yale today but that Gore would have a shot at being admitted to
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the matter with merit? Absolutely nothing _ assuming
that merit can be measured. But what if it can't? Do good college
grades tell us who is better at life in its wider scope, and not
just college courses? Do they tell us who would be a better
president?
</P>
<P>
   The meritocracy thinks that they do. This isn't just conceit.
People are naturally grateful to the source of their success. To a
businessman, it's the free market. To Prince Charles, it's the
monarchy. To millions of Americans holding better jobs than their
parents ever dreamed of, it's the school work or the SAT. Only
that's not what they think. They all think it's merit.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the meritocracy is that it believes it's
certifiably better at everything. It has demonstrated a proficiency
at reasoning skills, and therefore thinks every problem can be
solved entirely with that proficiency. If this were indeed correct,
then Herbert Hoover would have been a better president than
Franklin Roosevelt, and Jimmy Carter would have ranked higher than
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the meritocracy is that it doesn't really
believe in majority rule, because if we already know who the
smartest people are, why should we bother to solicit the opinion of
anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   This has caused, not consciously but very, very pervasively, a
restructuring of our institutions to avoid the will of the
electorate. The classic example is Hillary Clinton's plan to
overhaul health care, devised away from the public debate, in rooms
full of policy experts. Increasingly, too, major decisions are made
by judges and administrators virtually immune from electoral
reproach, let alone removal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hoping that the backlash against this elitist approach
is focused on Gore. To be seen primarily as a wonk is fatal to a
candidate today. Clinton flew under the voter radar because he was
a Southern governor who had the good old boy thing down perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bush is really the Midland, Texas, scamp whose drawl
can make Lyndon Johnson sound like Dean Acheson. He's the
descendant of gentry, the Democrats continually point out, while
Gore is in fact the son of parents who worked their way out of
poverty in the South.
</P>
<P>
   So why does this war favor Bush? Because the voters are so
alienated by the effect of the meritocracy on the very concept of
consent of the governed that our elections have been transformed.
Campaigns are framed to be less about issues than about the
candidate's background and outlook. If a presidential candidate is
seen as primarily a member of the meritocracy, the voters seem to
push the other lever, even if it means tax cuts for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Values play into this war. A candidate whose principal faith is
in pure reason, rather than experience, frightens most voters. As
an alternative, they look for someone guided by values: tradition,
constancy, patience, resolve, tolerance, dispassion, compassion,
courage, good humor, humility, faith.
</P>
<P>
   Faith is a good example. If you believe in God and religious
tenets, you possess values other than total reliance on the power
of intellect. That's why this campaign has been marked on both
sides by more protestations of faith than were ever provoked by
Torquemada.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is very vulnerable in any contest decided by resentment of
the meritocracy. In two interviews in The New Yorker, his
statements are almost impossible to read _ tortured self-analytical
psychobabble and social science prose. These are potentially more
damaging than Bush's gaffes _ since a lack of expertise probably
plays better than excessive expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would do well to reproduce millions of copies of the Gore
interviews and drop them from planes over every swing state. The
economic class war being played out in this election could go
either way; the new elite class war, only one.

   CARLISLE, Pa. _ As the class of 2004 arrives on campus this
month, more students than ever are coming without the blessing of
the SAT. Five years ago, the faculty here at Dickinson, one of
America's oldest liberal arts colleges, took the pioneering step of
eliminating the SAT requirement for admission. Last spring, Mount
Holyoke did the same, joining a minor trend. About 285 accredited
colleges have now eliminated the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson believed that no longer requiring the SAT would
improve the quality of the student body, and it has. Our
applications are up by 35 percent since the requirement was
dropped, and the proportion of entering freshmen who graduated in
the top 10 percent of their high school classes has risen to 50
percent from 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Our move signaled to students and counselors alike that
Dickinson considered the entire student in the admission process.
</P>
<P>
   SAT scores are not entirely out of the picture, since 91 percent
of our applicants still choose to submit them. But after 26 years
of evaluating applications at four competitive colleges, I know
that the SAT is but one factor in selection, and not requiring it
emphasizes that. At Dickinson, we consider strength of curriculum,
grades, competitiveness of the high school, writing ability,
leadership, depth and breadth of activities, and recommendations
from teachers and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   College admission is becoming more competitive today in large
part because of the desire for a ``name brand,'' which is thought
to secure one's future, and the search for a good ``price,'' which
has the public flagships booming while many private colleges bid
against one another with scholarships and discounts. The hype about
the SAT feeds this competitive frenzy. Students compete for the
best score and take courses solely intended to increase their
scores.
</P>
<P>
   We should be encouraging students to focus on the excitement of
learning, rather than on a score, and to think about the substance
of what a college offers. If making the SAT optional in a selective
admissions process helps us get there, it is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   At Dickinson, students who withheld SAT scores before they were
accepted usually send them to us afterward, and by the time the
freshmen begin school, we have scores from 98 percent of them. And
we have uncovered a striking statistic: Since eliminating the SAT
requirement, we have gained 60 SAT points, on average, in our
entering freshman class.

   CHICAGO _ In a lifetime as a judge, lawyer and lawmaker, I can
safely say I've encountered few judges guilty of outright
dishonesty. Even when I started practicing law in Chicago in the
bad old days, the number of crooked judges was small. But that is
not what people believed then or believe now.
</P>
<P>
   That is why so much is built into our judicial system _ from the
black robe and ``all rise'' custom to lifetime tenure for federal
judges _ to help foster the notion of judicial integrity. It all
becomes meaningless, however, when private interests are allowed to
wine and dine judges at fancy resorts under the pretext of
``educating'' them.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1998, according to a report from the Community
Rights Counsel, a nonprofit public-interest law firm, more than 230
federal judges took one or more trips each to resort locations for
legal seminars paid for by corporations and foundations that have
an interest in federal litigation on environmental topics.
</P>
<P>
   In the seminars devoted to so-called environmental education,
judges listened to speakers whose overwhelming message was that
regulation should be limited _ that the free market should be
relied upon to protect the environment, for example, or that the
``takings'' clause of the Constitution should be interpreted to
prohibit rules against development in environmentally sensitive
places.
</P>
<P>
   Judges who attended the seminars wrote 10 of the most important
rulings of the 1990s curbing federal environmental protections,
including one that struck down habitat protection provisions of the
Endangered Species Act and another that invalidated regulations on
soot and smog. In six of these cases, according to the report, the
judge attended one of the seminars while the case was pending
before the court. And, the report reveals, many judges failed to
disclose required information about these seminars on their
financial disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   If an actual party to a case took the judge to a resort, all
expenses paid, shortly before the case was heard, the judge and the
host would be perceived to be acting improperly even if all they
discussed was their grandchildren. The conduct is no less
reprehensible when an interest group substitutes for the party to
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it may be a coincidence that none of the seminars
financed by private interests take place in Chicago in January or
in Atlanta in July. It may be a coincidence that the judges who
attend usually come down on the same side of important policy
questions as those who financed the meetings. It may even be a
coincidence that environmentalists are seldom invited to speak. But
surely any citizen who reads about judges attending fancy meetings
under questionable sponsorship will have well-founded doubts about
their objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   I know one federal judge who has been on a dozen trips sponsored
by the three most prominent special interest seminar groups. I
remember at least two occasions where judges on judicial panels
where I also served took positions that they had heard advocated at
seminars sponsored by groups with particular interest in the
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judiciary has a judicial center that provides
educational seminars for judges on a wide range of legal topics.
Since it uses taxpayer funds and answers to Congress, the program
locales are not exotic, but the presentations are balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the governing body
for all federal judges, has punted on the propriety of privately
funded seminars, advising that judges assess their appropriateness
``case by case.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of requiring judges to stick to federally sponsored
seminars, the government could, at least, require that whenever a
judge attends any professional seminar, the government must pay his
or her way. Then citizens might begin to ask questions about what
they were paying for _ and whether it was really likely to promote
judicial fairness.

CHENEY SLIPS ON OIL CRITICIZING NATIONAL MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has written about public lands issues
for over a decade and is respected for his insight into these
issues. His e-mail address is levendos(at)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney
threw down the gauntlet, challenging the national monuments created
by President Clinton. It was a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney knows as much about national monuments as his
presidential running mate, George W. Bush, knows about foreign
policy. Cheney has spent too many years in board rooms in the
company of oil executives in Texas to speak knowledgeably about
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the assertion that if Bush and he were elected, Bush
might make the decision to rescind the national monument status of
the monuments Clinton has created.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush were president, he could not rescind a national
monument status. No president can. Only Congress has that
authority.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of the Interior's top legal counsel,
Solicitor John Leshy, ``The attorney general of the United States
issued an opinion in 1938 that said the president could not undo a
national monument, could not undo it in the sense of completely
repealing it. And no president has ever done that. Presidents have
made boundary adjustments, both enlarging and diminishing the size.
That's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the reasoning was pretty simple; it just said the
Antiquities Act authorizes the president to proclaim monuments but
not to unproclaim them. Only Congress, according to that view, can
`unproclaim' or outright repeal a national monument altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   And Congress doesn't unproclaim national monuments very often.
Practically, it's politically impossible to do so. The American
people want wilderness preserved and protected.
</P>
<P>
   In general, national monument status prohibits any new mineral
exploration, drilling for gas and oil, or mining. Under the new
policy of landscape monuments, the areas are left pristine and
protected from development, as the people want them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furor among some members of the Utah congressional
delegation and other Western congressmen when Clinton created the
Escalante-Staircase National Monument in 1996, there has not been a
successful move in Congress to abolish that monument.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the record: Approximately 64 million acres have been set
aside as 110 national monuments since the Antiquities Act was
passed in 1906. Congress has only abolished six national monuments
_ comprising about 5,000 acres in total. One of the abolished
monuments was later redesignated as a monument under a different
name.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was mistaken in another criticism of the process of
creating national monuments during the Clinton administration. He
asserted that these proclamations are announced ``willy-nilly all
over the West'' without considering the desires of the people who
will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Cheney bashed the administration's monument
designations, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, in an Aug.
23 interview, repeated what he had said many times before, ``We
have a `no-surprise' policy when it comes to recommending national
monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   A no-surprise policy makes good political sense. Babbitt has
traveled from Western state to Western state repeatedly in order to
gauge residents' interest in having a particular locale set aside
as a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   The records show that Babbitt has met with congressional
delegations, with governors and state legislators, with mayors and
local stakeholders and any others who might have some say in the
matter. There have been public hearings in each state where a new
monument was nominated and then created. Discussions about possible
national monument status has been front-page news in the states
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has even suggested to congressional delegations that
they take the lead in creating greater protection for unique public
landscapes in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Claims that national monument status has been forced down a
state's throat have no factual basis. It would be political suicide
to take such a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, 80 percent of the population supports the
designation of Aqua Fria National Monument outside of Phoenix. In
other Western states, polls indicate the support for their new
monuments hovers at 75 percent. Nationally, the American people
have shown unwavering support for the new monuments.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, Babbitt sent the president a recommendation that
proposes the creation of the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in
northern Arizona. The Vermilion Cliffs proposal covers 293,000
acres of federal land and includes the Paria Plateau. It would
continue to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Babbitt recommended that Clinton expand the current
Craters of the Moon National Monument in central Idaho. The
original 54,440-acre monument was created by President Calvin
Coolidge in 1924. Babbitt proposes that it be expanded by 661,000
acres in order to include craters, cones, lava flows, caves and
fissures along a rift that is 65 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the end of it. Babbitt will make other
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   About other monument proposals, Babbitt said, ``We have a list
of areas that have been publicly discussed, where I have been out
on the ground and engaged all of the stakeholders: Steens Mountain
(Oregon), the Carrizo Plain in California, the Santa Rosa Mountains
in California, the Missouri Breaks (Montana), the Black Ridge area
in Colorado, the San Rafael in Utah. These areas are in the
congressional phase right now. At this point, these are all areas
of possible future recommendations, but they are areas where we
have emphasized our desire to see legislation coming out of the
Congress. With each of these places, we have stuff going in varying
degrees in the Congress.''
</P>

where he stands on environmental issues _ on the side of oil.

 &HT;    Prepare to go back in time with the next hot game

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Capcom, known for its 'Street Fighter' and
'Resident Evil' series for Nintendo and PlayStation, is set to blow
the roof off of computer animation with its new Onimusha: Warlords
adventure game for PlayStation2. Its technical achievements in
animation were recently awarded Best of Show at the SIGGRAPH 2000
computer graphics conference for the game's opening movie and
optical motion system, which capture six samurais battling
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Warlords is being touted as one of the most technically advanced
video games conceived for the PlayStation2. The game is an epic
saga of 16th-century Japan, when warlords launched attacks against
one another and fought battles in the name of power. Players are
samurai warriors who must fight their way into a castle to save a
princess. A 200-piece orchestra performs the original musical
score. The technology creates finely detailed character graphics
that show life-like emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The release date is set for this winter.

 &HT;    Something's fishy with the new Dreamcast virtual pet, Seaman.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at the video game industry's mounting ability to
permeate daily living in the digital age, Sega offers a virtual pet
quite unlike any other. While Seaman ($50; www.dreamcast. com; for
the Dreamcast) does require the Dreamcast console hardware to
function, the resemblance to traditional video games pretty much
ends there. Seaman, a half-man, half-fish creature of enigmatic
lineage, is born and raised right there on one's television screen
in computer-generated glory. Bundled with a microphone and
state-of-the-art voice recognition software, users can actually
hold real-time conversations with the creature and have those
conversations committed to an extensive memory system. Each day one
is expected to visit the fish-man in his ``tank,'' adjust the
oxygen, heat and light levels, keep a regular feeding schedule and
provide genuine foster care for the freaky fish-o-sapien.
Throughout the experience, users will discover that his
occasionally insolent disposition and irreverent responses to
questions are a true reflection of his feelings and how he's been
treated. Frightfully, this talking, learning virtual pet will
recall subjects broached or incidents experienced from days gone by
and bring them up again in conversation. It's one of the most
unnerving examples of artificial intelligence yet offered at a mass
consumer level. With the soothing baritone of Leonard Nimoy
providing narration and tutorial, Seaman's complex level of
interactivity will boggle your mind as you un-boggle the mystery
behind his origins.
</P>
<P>
   While the video game industry and the movie industries both
compete for your entertainment dollar, a new trend in convergence
is emerging: Video games based on movies and movies based on video
games are beginning to launch simultaneously. Such is the case with
X-Men Mutant Academy ($40; www.activision.com; for the
PlayStation), which is a game simpatico with the recent summer
blockbuster, which in turn is based on an immensely popular comic
and cartoon franchise. Unfortunately, the game is merely another
means to brand name us with X-Men; it has little to do with the
film. In fact, it only vaguely resembles a modern video game in the
first place. Mutant Academy is a well-drawn, well-animated 2-D
fighting game _ and that's it. There's no adventure akin to a movie
plot, just the various super-anti-heroes duking it out in a
face-to-face, side-scrolling romp. Even on the aging PlayStation
console, most fighting games are known to contain so much more than
flat-action eye-candy, such as three dimensions. Nevertheless,
X-Men Mutant Academy is a very good 2-D fighting game complete with
trademark super-moves and painful powers of mutant punishment. But
it's the weakest member in the grand amalgamation scheme of
console, cartoon, comic and cinematic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about this PlayStation version of Worms Armaggeddon:
($30; www.hasbro-interactive.com; for the PlayStation) Sony
initially nixed the idea of a 2-D,
cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than-Looney Tunes action/strategy game
starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate simply for the fact that the
idea of a 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/funnier than Looney Tunes
action/strategy game starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate didn't
seem like a viable PlayStation game a few years back when Sony was
marketing a hardcore gamer's machine. Now, of course, Sony will
license everything just to saturate the market, which is usually a
bad thing in the watered-down library sense of things, but a very
good thing in this specific case as Worms Armageddon is a
surprisingly great 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than-Looney
Tunes action/strategy game starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate.
Excellent even.

   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   The real-time strategy genre is hitting maturity with fully
fleshed 3-D worlds (think Homeworld, Shogun: Total War and the
upcoming Dark Reign 2), and none captures this territory better
than Ground Control, a future-war adrenaline pumper from Sierra
($35; www .sierrastudios.com/games/groundcontrol; for Windows).
Beautiful to behold and a blast to play, this fast-paced game skips
the tedium of resource gathering, so prevalent in the genre, and
goes straight for the gut, dropping the player (after an excellent
tutorial) into the fight for Krig-7B, a distant planet bursting
with an innovative array of infantry, artillery and aircraft. A
compelling sci-fi plot unfolds, lending context as the fights
become increasingly brutal and spectacular. Camera control and unit
placement can get awkward, but the multiplayer aspect is
innovative, and the terrain and units are stunningly detailed as
the game scales from point-blank range to the 2,000-foot level in
an instant. In short, Ground Control delivers the full wallop with
attention paid to every last detail.

 &HT;    Fridge magnets of the future
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If the hybrid word ``RubberSteel'' sounds like
something out of Star Trek, then the future is now. The MagZone has
a variety of ShowOffs Photo Print Sheets ($4 to $6 depending on
package; www .magzone.com) for all your ``Craft-eze'' needs.
Malleable rubber stock laced with magnetized steel and peel-away
adhesive allows for the sticking and posting of just about anything
you wish to affix to your fridge, file cabinet or fire door _ the
most obviously implied of which would be photographs or artwork.
RubberSteel is also easily cut to fit with scissors or a blade.
Similarly available are standard-size Magnetic Photo Frames (two
for $3.60), which are without adhesive but come with a pre-cut hole
to both enshrine and hold a picture against any flat metal surface.

 &HT;    A case of virtual indestructibility
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Because translucent colors are all the rage _ as
if working at the computer is supposed to be pretty _ Case Logic
offers translucent, fruity-colored CD-ROM cases ($6;
www.caselogic.com). A fairly durable plastic casing houses typical
soft cloth pouches with clear plastic faces for your ROM organizing
needs. Through elaborate testing methods, I found that the unit and
the snap on its hinging lock remain intact and functional even
after the case is ``accidentally'' dropped on the floor repeatedly.
However, they tend to crack when hurled full-force against a cement
wall. Still, pretty impressive. And since all four fruity colors
are so pleasant to behold, odds are they'll subdue any full-force,
item-chucking, temper-tantrum impulses.

 &HT;    Walking through ritzy stores great, but Web helps thrifty
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many shoppers have a love/hate relationship with
upscale department stores.
</P>
<P>
   We love what they sell but can't always afford it. And even if
we can, the salespeople can often make us feel like we should all
get back on our turnip trucks and drive back to Podunk or whatever
Godforsaken backwater it is assumed we have crawled out of.
</P>
<P>
   I vividly remember trying to buy a bottle of trendy perfume in a
certain high-end department store. Getting the attention of the
sales staff was tougher than getting past the velvet ropes at
Studio 54 in its heyday. Across the sales floor a friend of mine
was trying to purchase a silk tie for his new job. After a while,
he meandered over to me, without a purchase, muttering, ``I really
don't care. I'm just going to that tie store near the food court.
These people make me feel like a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you've got the time and you've got some mad money, skip
the snotty salespeople and try department store shopping online.
Trade magazine The Industry Standard argues in its current issue
that half the fun of luxury department store shopping is the
elegance of the surroundings, the glorious feeling of actually
touching a pair of Gucci loafers or a Prada tote bag or trying on
that fabulously chic Armani suit. The Standard points out that the
luxury stores' online counterparts don't have half the inventory
their brick-and-mortar stores have and that shoppers don't want to
spend hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars ordering a dress
online that might not be the right color or that might not fit.
</P>
<P>
   To this concept, we say ``phooey.'' We also say visit the new
Neiman Marcus Web site (www
</P>
<P>
   .neimanmarcus.com). What we have here is a flashier version of
Neiman's numerous hard copy ``look books'' mailed to its credit
card customers that display the store's hot picks for any given
season. There's a ``shop by trend'' section that lets users sigh
over cashmere sweaters from Marc Jacobs or Donna Karan separates
the store dubs ``Wall Street Chic.''
</P>
<P>
   But by far the best thing about the Neiman site is the Manolo
Blahnik shoe salon. Launched with the help of Atlanta-based firm
RichFx, this area of the store is a virtual video game for designer
shoe fans _ and you know who you are. Even if you have no idea what
Manolo Blahnik shoes are, go ahead and download the RichFx player
and take a look at the shopping experience Neiman's has the
potential to offer shoppers visiting the rest of its online store.
The software program that runs within the Web site looks like the
computer game ``Myst,'' only you're examining shoes instead of
spaceships. There are original drawings from the designer and even
his motto: ``My shoes are not fashion,'' he says. ``They are
objects ... gestures that happen to be fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh my.
</P>
<P>
   For a certain element of the population this is more fun than
the Godiva chocolate site.
</P>
<P>
   But if Neiman's isn't your style, walk across the virtual street
to Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Again, selection is slim compared to the brick-and-mortar store.
The ladies who lunch and then presumably spend the rest of the day
shopping have vetoed this site. However, for ordinary working girls
eating salads at their desks, the Saks site is a delightful
diversion. From designer evening gowns from Badgley Mischka, to
workplace-appropriate clothes from the store's very stylish
in-house line, or accessories from the usual designer suspects
Jimmy Choo, Kate Spade, Calvin Klein and HugoBoss, they're here.
And yes, the teensy and trendy Fendi baguettes are here.
</P>
<P>
   While the official jury is still out on high-end department
store Web sites, they do have numerous advantages for time-crunched
and cash-crunched shoppers who every now and then do like to sample
the finer things in life.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, every site lists prices. Sometimes when one is
looking at accessories or jewelry in department stores, the tags
are discreetly turned over to hide the three- or four-figure price.
</P>
<P>
   On even the most ancient of computer monitors, the colors and
the design of the products show up beautifully. And, if it's
something you really, really want, you can either order it on the
spot or perhaps call your local store and see if it has the same
item and can hold it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores like Neiman and Saks undeniably rely on
well-heeled customers wandering through their stores like Lauren
Bacall in ``How to Marry a Millionaire'' pointing at item after
item and commanding, ``I'll take that and that ... and that and
that and that!''
</P>
<P>
   However, for the ordinary shopper who places buying a Chanel
handbag in the same class as putting a down payment on a car, sites
like these give you the information you need to be a better
consumer of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   You know the prices, you know the designers and when you need a
special dress for a gala event or just want to splurge on a sharp
new tie to wear to work, you can check out the goods right here.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want, snap up that tie for the job interview _ a
couple of clicks, no waiting.

 &HT;    Graphics a big hook in `Ecco'
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been well over a year since I first saw screen
shots of a promising Dreamcast game titled ``Ecco the Dolphin.'' It
was one of the best-looking games I had ever seen, and now it's
finally here and I couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game loads, prepare to witness some of the best
graphics on the system to date. For the first half-hour I totally
ignored the game play and just explored the vast undersea world in
awe.
</P>
<P>
   The game artists' research spanned several months, and it shows.
From the smooth contour of a dolphin to the subtle cloud of sand
from a shifting stingray, every element is captured realistically.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful imagery is complemented with a soothing ambient
soundtrack. Some hard-core gamers may be a little skeptical, but
it's actually a refreshing break from the gritty, techno-throbbing
action games.
</P>
<P>
   The sensory experience is nearly perfect, but how does it play?
</P>
<P>
   Again, I was impressed. Ecco, the dolphin, has many abilities,
and although they may take a few minutes to get used to, you'll be
chasing fish and gliding gracefully along the ocean floor in no
time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ecco's most important abilities is his sonar projection.
The skill allows Ecco to speak to other creatures, wrangle fish and
map out his environment.
</P>
<P>
   The only factor that comes close to polluting this pristine game
is the vagueness of the tasks for each stage.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are info-crystals and sea creatures that guide
Ecco, you'll often be uncertain as to what to do or where to go. I
usually don't refer to hint guides, but I found that I didn't have
much choice if I wanted to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a few unclear missions, ``Ecco the Dolphin'' is a dream.
This is yet another great title that makes me happy I have a
Dreamcast.

 &HT;    Long-distance calls via Web come free, if not so easily
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine being so excited about something that you
called yourself to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   I made my mouse tracks across the on-screen dialpad, clicking
along the digits of my phone number. I heard the distant sound of
ringing through my computer's speakers, followed by my recorded
voice. I was alone in my home, and I told my voice mail, ``It
works, it really works.''
</P>
<P>
   My first Internet telephone call was to my own answering
machine. I was amazed and excited when it worked. I suppose that's
why I even left myself a message.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance phone service was my major vice and a steady
expense ever since I had the money to pay for it. Internet
telephone offers a chance to save money.
</P>
<P>
   I was a reluctant convert to Internet telephone calls. My
neighbor Susan asked me what I knew about the technology, and I was
ashamed to say I had no first-hand experience. I gave her some
articles about it, and she picked a provider.
</P>
<P>
   She invited me to her house to help walk her through the first
call. The process did not go smoothly, but that short exposure made
me curious.
</P>
<P>
   I could understand Susan's motivation to find free or cheap
phone calls. Her daughter met a foreign student who returned to
Germany. Their phone exchanges could get expensive, and Susan
wanted to find a way to reduce the costs.
</P>
<P>
   After fiddling with Susan's setup for a while, I came home and
got to work on my own computer. I downloaded PC-to-Phone software
from Deltathree's Web site (www.deltathree.com).
</P>
<P>
   It took work, but I managed to set it up. Once I was ready to
make a call, I dug out the microphone that came packaged with our
computer.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial call to myself, I was eager to test the
technology on real conversation. Call No. 2 was to my friend Marci.
She was friendly, as always. Then she said, ``I'm sorry, but who is
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Next I called my parents. My mother asked if I was in the car,
and she struggled through a short phone call with me before asking
me to call on a ``real'' phone later.
</P>
<P>
   The microphone is not great for this purpose. My call recipients
also had the distraction of hearing their own voices loud and clear
from my computer speakers while they talked. To optimize your
chances for quality sound, you need a headset that plugs into your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics stores carry them, and some of the Internet phone
providers sell them from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the exciting news is, even with the bad microphone, the
calls worked. And the price was right; the call was free. Plus,
this technology allowed me to make phone calls while I was online.
</P>
<P>
   I only have one telephone line at home, which I use for my
computer and telephone. When I surf the Web, the phone line is tied
up and calls are sent to my BellSouth voice mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Using PC-to-Phone, I can use the Internet and make phone calls
through my computer at the same time. I can also check my voice
mail messages by dialing in to the voice mail center. It simply
requires opening another browser window.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Deltathree, there are several companies offering
free calls from personal computers to traditional phones.
Dialpad.com (www.dialpad.com) and PhoneFree.com (www.phonefree.com)
offer free, unlimited calls within the United States. Other
companies like Net2Phone (www.net2phone.com) and MediaRing.com
(www.mediaring.com) offer discounted calls within the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The technology still has imperfections. There are echoes and
voice delays. Some calls are reminiscent of cheap mobile phones or
international calls of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those cases where you get something for nothing
and sacrifice a little quality.
</P>
<P>
   One way to improve quality is to buy a headset.
</P>
<P>
   Net2Phone makes a headset that plugs into the back of a
computer. It sells at many local retailers for about $45. Or you
may find headphones that you can order via one of the Internet
phone providers. Deltathree and Dialpad.com offer a selection on
their sites ranging in price from $10 to $75.
</P>
<P>
   To make the calls, you need a computer, an Internet connection,
a sound card, a microphone and speakers.

 &HT;    Bundles of fun
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   For kids not content with mere ogling and cooing over their
latest bubblegum card acquisition or setting up a fantasy
competition via linked game machines, Bandai's Gundam Wing toys
offer hands-on, tangible toys for imaginary-world play. Better
still, Bandai bundles two activities into one package as the toys
are also available as Gundam Wing plastic model kits ($5 to $25;
www.bandai.com). When the glue-less snap-together figurines are
finished _ complete with weapons, decals and accessories _ they
become effective and interactive posturing models with some 40
points of articulation. A slightly sophisticated motor-skills
challenge and a long-term toy craze all in one. Pretty neat.
</P>
<P>
   THE GENTLE LULL OF A JACKHAMMER?
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing mechanical wind-up mobiles have over lazy-age
motorized, doll-dangling, eye-catching baby distracters: They're
not motorized! That is to say, while Fisher Price's Sparkling
Symphony Mobile with Remote Control ($25; www.fisher-price.com) is
indeed ultra modern, colorful and pleasing to behold visually, the
diminutive powerhouse rotating its dangling moon and stars is
notably audible. To compensate, the symphony of nursery rhyme
electronica is fixed at a fairly loud volume, which is all well and
good if you're grooming a future rock star or jackhammer operator,
but it's not at all peaceful late in the night when a soft,
soothing lullaby is all that's required. A wonderful daytime
distraction, to be sure, but clicking on the remote from up to 20
feet away and setting the moaning wheels and enthusiastic digital
orchestra in motion somewhat defeats the purpose of stealth tactics
in the nursery.

 &HT;    Worry not about a bot
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I've started paying more attention to applications that place
bots on my computer. You should make readers aware that many
programs place bots on their system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Mares, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: So, what's a bot and what does it do? Bot is short for
robot. It's a software tool that sifts through computer data. It
has been programmed to search and recover information.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Developers send bots on missions with specific
instructions. Web search engines dispatch bots to snag relevant URL
information from other servers. Shopping bots are big. They scan
the Web for prices for online products. Bots can be newshounds,
too, retrieving the latest in news, finance, sports and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: They help maintain intricate Web sites. They monitor site
links to make sure they're still alive when Web pages are removed
or relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There is some concern about how they are used. They're
constantly retrieving info and have been called ``spiders'' or
``Web worms.'' This can give the impression that they multiply.
That's not really the case. They use standard Web protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Bots can place demands on a network. There are newer
protocols being designed every day to standardize and limit those
demands. Developers are asked to strike a balance when designing
and deploying a bot.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: So, bots can be good, bots can be bad? In general, bots
are babes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Readers:
</P>
<P>
   Here's a fun Web site to bookmark. Cruise to www.surprise.com.
Thank you, Dave Garr, for sending it in.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's a gift site that doesn't try to sell you anything.
It's big on pointing you to ideas for fun gifts anywhere on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Click on ``Who's it for'' to pick a present for
grandparents, the baby sitter or your child's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The ``What Occasion?'' options cover retirement,
housewarmings, graduations, birthdays. Another ``must click'' is
``What are they like?''
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Do they love to throw parties? Perhaps a maid service or
a bubble machine. A gadgeteer? No problem. There are PDAs, a
folding shovel and a wristwatch camera. The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Buying for someone with a wacky sense of humor? There's
custom toilet paper or a glow-in-the-dark basketball. For pet pals,
there's a puppy pager.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Ideas are submitted by folks who surf the site.
Surprise.com will pay $100 for ideas that are among the 1,000 most
popular ideas for a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Get downright organized about your gift-giving. Set up an
account. Schedule e-mail reminders for anniversaries, weddings,
etc., and keep track of gift ideas you've saved while browsing.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd write for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Reader input adds some clarity to discussion about digital
photos
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The recent column on digital photography provoked some
response, both from the unanointed, like me, and the experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am also an old photographer ready to go digital. But right
now, the more I read, the more confused I become. A number of my
friends have chosen the Sony Mavica line, which uses a floppy disc.
This is appealing to me because it seems so easy. Now Sony is
adding Memory Stick storage. Do you have any suggestions, based on
your own research? Thanks for any info you might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Using 3.5 floppies for image storage provides enormous freedom _
you don't have to carry a laptop or some other expensive storage
device if you intend to make a lot of pictures on a trip. As far as
I can see, the only sure disadvantage is that the Mavica is a lot
larger than most digital cameras. There is also the question of
whether it takes longer to record the image on a floppy than on a
Memory Stick, but I haven't found the answer to that.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Will Christopher passes along some excellent information
for all of us seeking to get into digital images:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I just this year made that plunge, perhaps my experience
might be of interest to you. Check out this Web site:
www.imaging-resource.com. It will give you all the information you
need and quite a bit more on any digital camera on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher extols the virtues of the Agfa Ephoto 1680, which
provides 1.9 megapixels, 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom. He
paid $429 for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site he mentions appears to be just what all of us
beginners need.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Eisele has a related question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately a year ago a piece of software came out which
allows an individual to take data from a VCR or video camera and
make still photos through their computer. Any ideas? It was
advertised on several radio shows about a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This requires hardware, not just software. The pioneer in this
field is the Snappy Video Snapshot, a little box to be connected
between your VCR/camera and your computer. A similar and perhaps
more sophisticated function is now being included in some video
display cards.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Langan, a reader in Colorado, wonders about the
durability of prints made on an inkjet printer. While the maker of
the Pictorico line of paper I reviewed recently states that its
Photo Gallery High-Gloss White paper is archival, I suspect the
greatest durability lies in the images themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless over the next 50 years or so there will be advances in
storage formats, and JPG and GIF files will become obsolete. But it
is hard to imagine that there won't be provisions for migrating
images from those formats to new ones.

 &HT;    Accessory-deprived? Writeable CD drive a handy tool
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am often a great disappointment to those who meet
me.
</P>
<P>
   Most people assume that _ here at Technology Ranch in exotic
Smyrna, Ga., _ I have all the latest in computer equipment. They
envision banks of blinking lights, PCs with processors so fast that
special cooling units are needed to prevent meltdown, and shelves
stocked with every new accessory that comes along.
</P>
<P>
   But today I am sitting in a bedroom that serves as my home
office, bare feet propped on a desk where my father once sat
presiding over a failing boat-manufacturing company. I am typing
away on a 350-megahertz computer that any self-respecting
13-year-old would sneer at.
</P>
<P>
   I love gadgets and computers. It's just that I am promiscuous
with my love and my money and have flings with fly rods, golf clubs
and cameras as well as computers. My modest income gets spread too
thin to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   So when the public relations woman called to ask me to test the
new MP3 audio gadget that her company was promoting, she explained
that I would need to use my writeable CD drive as part of the test.
I had to tell her I hadn't gotten around to buying one. You could
hear the disdain of my high-tech poverty in her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, being highly trained in the art of human relations and in
advanced table manners, she said she would lend the drive to me so
I could test her product. When the drive arrived, it sat _ unopened
_ for a week while I went about my more usual tasks of cleaning up
after the cat and trying to find my lost wallet.
</P>
<P>
   I still haven't tested her product. But I did install the CD
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a few days of messing with it, I am already looking
closely at my No. 2 fly rod, thinking I may pawn that sucker and
buy my own writeable CD drive. I am finding uses for the drive that
didn't strike me until I used it.
</P>
<P>
   It passed the Husted Test for Practicality. It has multiple
uses, and all of them have actually solved one problem or another
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I've used it to make audio CDs of some of my favorite vinyl
albums. Now I can drive along in my car accompanied by Peggy Lee.
Those who have heard me sing _ even trendy people who listen to
more popular music _ appreciate hearing her instead of me.
</P>
<P>
   My hard disk was clogged with electronic photographs. There's
the (I swear this is true and can provide witnesses if necessary)
photo my electrical engineer uncle sent of his new license tag,
countless family photographs I scanned in, photos of various
friends, and pictures that I no longer remember taking but hesitate
to throw away. I've copied most of them to a CD and tucked them
away so _ years from now when this hard disk meets up with the law
of entropy _ I'll have them.
</P>
<P>
   Then I did something that surprised even me. For years I have
been urging readers to make a backup copy of the personal data on
their hard disks. But _ since I did not have a tape drive, or even
a Zip drive _ the notion of inserting countless dozens of floppy
disks to save my tax data, e-mails and writing documents was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   I felt guilty about not doing it, but a guy can get used to
guilt. Now I have a true backup copy of my data. (I didn't bother
making copies of programs since it's almost always necessary to
install them from scratch in a new installation.)
</P>
<P>
   What I'm saying is: Go out and get a writeable CD drive if you
don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   I know many of you are nervous about tasks that involve opening
up the innards of your PC. But it's truly easy _ a 30-minute job at
most. I won't take you through the steps since it's far smarter to
follow the step-by-step instructions that come with the drive. But
I can tell you that installation simply involves sliding the drive
into your computer and fastening it with two screws.
</P>
<P>
   Then you plug in two cables. Once you load in the software that
comes with the CD drive, you're set. Those of you who still get the
quivers about things like this needn't be ashamed if you decide to
take your machine in to a computer shop for the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Since this CD drive must soon go back to the manufacturer, I'll
be postponing the purchase of a new sand wedge for my golf bag and
buying a writeable CD drive of my own.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, I may even get around to testing the MP3
gadget that started this whole thing.

 &HT;    `X-Men' geared toward fans of comic book version
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``X-Men's'' popularity seems to be peaking again with
a recent movie starring America's favorite mutant fighters, along
with a new video game titled ``X-Men: Mutant Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Activision product is a gem for PlayStation owners. The
console system is rapidly losing attention from the industry's top
developers because of the approaching arrival of the PlayStation 2
on Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' was the most successful comic book property of all
time. The game pays respect to the history of the mutant heroes,
while providing challenging fighting duels at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   There are many modes to the game, including Training, Survival
and Arcade. Choosing the first option, you and your selected
character go to visit Professor X, who patiently teaches you to
throw simple punches and kicks as well as elaborate combination
moves.
</P>
<P>
   In Survival mode, you battle until your energy meter goes out.
After defeating all of your opponents in the Cerbro mode, you are
treated to an animated history three minutes or longer about your
chosen mutant.
</P>
<P>
   Like the good and evil that exist in the world of ``X-Men,''
there are good and bad things to say about the video game.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the simple moves are a lot flashier than
comparable fighting games. They also do an excellent job of falling
in with the character's personality. There are special features,
such as 24-hit combination by Toad that can do fierce damage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite today's state-of-the-art technology, Activision opted to
remain two-dimensional with the fighting. In other words, you can
only duck and jump to avoid hits, not step aside to the right and
left as you can with 3-D titles. ``X-Men'' does have a tad of 3-D,
which is only used in the completion of special moves. As the
finishing blow is being launched, the camera angle will move around
to the back of your mutant for an up-close look.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are only average, but the fighting action runs
smoothly. What really stands out is when a character does a simple
special move and the game goes to slow motion for about two or
three seconds as the final hits are made.
</P>
<P>
   The music at the beginning of the game _ from the movie _ is
excellent, as are the introductory themes for each character. But
when the fighting begins, the music becomes annoying. It is without
purpose and fails to follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   You'll love this game if you love ``X-Men.'' When the game is
loading, screen shots of the old comic books appear on the screen.
It brings back wonderful memories of the evolution of the world's
superheroes.

 &HT;    Aussie animals
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've heard of kicking kangaroos and the furry koala.
They're two of Australia's most recognizable animal friends. But
did you know that about 95 percent of the mammals Down Under and 88
percent of the reptiles can't be found anywhere else in the world?
</P>
<P>
   Take a peek at Australia's unusual wildlife, from the furry and
fuzzy to the dangerous and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   KANGAROO: Kangaroos are marsupials _ that means they are
mammals, but the female has a pouch to carry and feed her young. A
baby kangaroo is called a joey. Australia is home to many
marsupials. The kangaroo (above) is the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Different types of 'roos are found on the continent, from the
small tree kangaroos to the large red kangaroos. They eat grass and
are active mainly at night.
</P>
<P>
   Kangaroos have large, strong tails. They stand on their tails
when they fight other 'roos _ that allows them to kick with their
big feet, as well as punch.
</P>
<P>
   KOALA: These cuddly-looking marsupials (top) live high in the
eucalyptus trees in the Australian states of Victoria, New South
Wales, South Australia and Queensland. They eat the trees' leaves,
which contain a lot of water. In fact, they eat so much eucalyptus,
about 2.5 pounds a day, you will rarely find a koala on the ground
looking for a watering hole. ``Koala'' is an aboriginal, or native
Australian, word that means ``no drink.''
</P>
<P>
   PLATYPUS: The platypus is yet another marsupial, but it's one of
two such animals that actually lay eggs. The other is the echidna,
which is also found only in Australia. Their eggs have soft shells,
unlike a bird's. When the babies hatch, they feed in their mother's
pouch.
</P>
<P>
   Platypi are strange-looking animals that make their homes in
burrows in the banks of rivers. Many people look at the platypus'
bill and four webbed feet and assume it is related to a duck. But
they aren't related.
</P>
<P>
   A platypus bill is about 2 inches long, flat, and covered with
shiny black skin. Platypi use their bills to find food. They eat
crayfish and worms and drink stream water.
</P>
<P>
   DINGO: Dingoes (left) are wild Australian dogs that are found
all over the continent, except on the island of Tasmania. They have
been there for at least 7,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dingoes live at the edge of forests and in the bush and
grasslands. They eat lizards and rabbits. If they team up, they can
catch large kangaroos. If dingoes kill more food than they can eat,
they bury the leftovers for later.
</P>
<P>
   SALTWATER CROCODILE: The saltwater croc (right) is the largest
reptile in the world, with some growing as long as 17 feet. They
live mainly in coastal areas of northern Australia and southeast
Asia, though they sometimes venture into rivers and swamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salties'' generally eat fish, turtles, crabs, birds and small
mammals. But larger crocodiles have been known to eat other crocs,
water buffalo and even humans. They catch their food by lying in or
around the water and then ambushing their prey. Salties use the
crocodile ``death roll'' to rip animals into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   INLAND TAIPAN SNAKE: Don't confuse the inland taipan snake with
the less poisonous coastal taipan. While both make the Top 10 list
of Australia's most poisonous snakes, the inland taipan is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The snakes can be found in old rat burrows, soil cracks, sink
holes or rock crevices in the dry plains and grasslands of central
Australia. They eat rats, frogs and small to medium mammals. The
taipan can strike its victims in a single bite or several quick
bites. The snake's future meal doesn't have time to fight back
before the venom takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   ATRAX SPIDER: The atrax is Australia's most poisonous spider.
Some people say it is the most poisonous spider in the world to
about an inch long. They can be ferocious if they are provoked. The
atrax can be found in the wet, coastal areas of New South Wales _
and it is often referred to as the Sydney Funnel Web Spider.
</P>
<P>
   MULGA SNAKE: Also known as the King Brown snake, this reptile
(below) is No. 2 on Australia's list of most deadly snakes. While
its venom is not as poisonous as other snakes, the mulga releases
much, much more venom in a single bite, paralyzing its prey. That's
what makes it so dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Mulgas feed on lizards, frogs, rodents, birds and other snakes.

 &HT;    Something's fishy with the new Dreamcast virtual pet, Seaman.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at the video game industry's mounting ability to
permeate daily living in the digital age, Sega offers a virtual pet
quite unlike any other. While Seaman ($50; www.dreamcast. com; for
the Dreamcast) does require the Dreamcast console hardware to
function, the resemblance to traditional video games pretty much
ends there. Seaman, a half-man, half-fish creature of enigmatic
lineage, is born and raised right there on one's television screen
in computer-generated glory. Bundled with a microphone and
state-of-the-art voice recognition software, users can actualloggle
your mind as you un-boggle the mystery behind his origins.
</P>
<P>
   While the video game industry and the movie industries both
compete for your entertainment dollar, a new trend in convergence
is emerging: Video games based on movies and movies based on video
games are beginning to launch simultaneously. Such is the case with
X-Men Mutant Academy ($40; www.activision.com; for the
PlayStation), which is a game simpatico with the recent summer
blockbuster, which in turn is based on an immensely popular comic
and cartoon franchise. Unfortunately, the game is merely another
means to brand name us with X-Men; it has little to do with the
film. In fact, it only vaguely resembles a modern video game in the
first place. Mutant Academy is a well-drawn, well-animated 2-D
fighting game _ and that's it. There's no adventure akin to a movie
plot, just the various super-anti-heroes duking it out in a
face-to-face, side-scrolling romp. Even on the aging PlayStation
console, most fighting games are known to contain so much more than
flat-action eye-candy, such as three dimensions. Nevertheless,
X-Men Mutant Academy is a very good 2-D fighting game complete with
trademark super-moves and painful powers of mutant punishment. But
it's the weakest member in the grand amalgamation scheme of
console, cartoon, comic and cinematic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about this PlayStation version of Worms Armaggeddon:
($30; www.hasbro-interactive.com; for the PlayStation) Sony
initially nixed the idea of a 2-D,
cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than-Looney Tunes action/strategy game
starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate simply for the fact that the
idea of a 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/funnier than Looney Tunes
action/strategy game starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate didn't
seem like a viable PlayStation game a few years back when Sony was
marketing a hardcore gamer's machine. Now, of course, Sony will
license everything just to saturate the market, which is usually a
bad thing in the watered-down library sense of things, but a very
good thing in this specific case as Worms Armageddon is a
surprisingly great 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than-Looney
Tunes action/strategy game starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate.
Excellent even.
</P>

<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   The real-time strategy genre is hitting maturity with fully
fleshed 3-D worlds (think Homeworld, Shogun: Total War and the
upcoming Dark Reign 2), and none captures this territory better
than Ground Control, a future-war adrenaline pumper from Sierra
($35; www .sierrastudios.com/games/groundcontrol; for Windows).
Beautiful to behold and a blast to play, this fast-paced game skips
the tedium of resource gathering, so prevalent in the genre, and
goes straight for the gut, dropping the player (after an excellent
tutorial) into the fight for Krig-7B, a distant planet bursting
with an innovative array of infantry, artillery and aircraft. A
compelling sci-fi plot unfolds, lending context as the fights
become increasingly brutal and spectacular. Camera control and unit
placement can get awkward, but the multiplayer aspect is
innovative, and the terrain and units are stunningly detailed as
the game scales from point-blank range to the 2,000-foot level in
an instant. In short, Ground Control delivers the full wallop with
attention paid to every last detail.

 &HT;    A case of virtual indestructibility
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Because translucent colors are all the rage _ as
if working at the computer is supposed to be pretty _ Case Logic
offers translucent, fruity-colored CD-ROM cases ($6;
www.caselogic.com). A fairly durable plastic casing houses typical
soft cloth pouches with clear plastic faces for your ROM organizing
needs. Through elaborate testing methods, I found that the unit and
the snap on its hinging lock remain intact and functional even
after the case is ``accidentally'' dropped on the floor repeatedly.
However, they tend to crack when hurled full-force against a cement
wall. Still, pretty impressive. And since all four fruity colors
are so pleasant to behold, odds are they'll subdue any full-force,
item-chucking, temper-tantrum impulses.

 &HT;    Prepare to go back in time with the next hot game
 &HT;    By D.A. Serra
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Capcom, known for its 'Street Fighter' and
'Resident Evil' series for Nintendo and PlayStation, is set to blow
the roof off of computer animation with its new Onimusha: Warlords
adventure game for PlayStation2. Its technical achievements in
animation were recently awarded Best of Show at the SIGGRAPH 2000
computer graphics conference for the game's opening movie and
optical motion system, which capture six samurais battling
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Warlords is being touted as one of the most technically advanced
video games conceived for the PlayStation2. The game is an epic
saga of 16th-century Japan, when warlords launched attacks against
one another and fought battles in the name of power. Players are
samurai warriors who must fight their way into a castle to save a
princess. A 200-piece orchestra performs the original musical
score. The technology creates finely detailed character graphics
that show life-like emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The release date is set for this winter.

 &HT;    11-year-old to play Harry
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fans of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books can now put
a real face on the boy wizard. Eleven-year-old British actor Daniel
Radcliffe has been cast as Harry for the movie ``Harry Potter and
The Sorcerer's Stone.'' Radcliffe has previously played the Charles
Dickens character David Copperfield in a British Broadcasting Corp.
TV program.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's friends Hermione and Ron will be played by newcomers
Emma Watson, 10, and Rupert Grint, 11. Both have performed in
school plays in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICANS HELD IN CHINA
</P>
<P>
   Three Americans are among 131 people who were arrested in China
last week. They are Christian missionaries from California who were
attending a revival meeting banned by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The missionaries were working with the China Fangcheng Church,
which does not have the government's approval to hold meetings.
Christianity is allowed in the Communist nation, but the government
says the Fangcheng Church is a cult. The government has recently
fined and arrested members of unapproved religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is working to find the Americans and bring
them home.
</P>
<P>
   FORD REPLACING BAD TIRES
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. said last week that it will temporarily stop
making trucks, so that it can use 70,000 new truck tires to replace
faulty tires on trucks and SUVs already on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The bad tires, made by Firestone, were standard on Ford
Explorers, Ford Rangers and Mecury Mountaineers. Firestone recalled
about 6.5 million of the tires after determining they could come
apart. The tires may have caused 62 deaths and more than 100
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The tire company was flying in replacements from factories in
Japan over the weekend to help meet demand in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based
organization, says the recall isn't broad enough to catch all the
faulty Firestone tires. It says 12 million more tires should be
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   GERMS MAY HELP BABIES
</P>
<P>
   Babies who are in day care may get more colds now, but they
might avoid getting asthma or allergies in the long run. The
reason? Day care babies are exposed to more germs, which could
actually help their immune systems develop, researchers now say.
</P>
<P>
   Infants under 6 months old in day care seem to have less chance
of developing asthma or allergies than their counterparts who
aren't in day care.
</P>
<P>
   Having an older sibling can help, too. The more older brothers
and sisters in the house, the lower the chances that a younger
child would develop allergies or asthma, researchers said.

 &HT;    Fridge magnets of the future
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If the hybrid word ``RubberSteel'' sounds like
something out of Star Trek, then the future is now. The MagZone has
a variety of ShowOffs Photo Print Sheets ($4 to $6 depending on
package; www .magzone.com) for all your ``Craft-eze'' needs.
Malleable rubber stock laced with magnetized steel and peel-away
adhesive allows for the sticking and posting of just about anything
you wish to affix to your fridge, file cabinet or fire door _ the
most obviously implied of which would be photographs or artwork.
RubberSteel is also easily cut to fit with scissors or a blade.
Similarly available are standard-size Magnetic Photo Frames (two
for $3.60), which are without adhesive but come with a pre-cut hole
to both enshrine and hold a picture against any flat metal surface.

 &HT;    Bundles of fun
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   For kids not content with mere ogling and cooing over their
latest bubblegum card acquisition or setting up a fantasy
competition via linked game machines, Bandai's Gundam Wing toys
offer hands-on, tangible toys for imaginary-world play. Better
still, Bandai bundles two activities into one package as the toys
are also available as Gundam Wing plastic model kits ($5 to $25;
www.bandai.com). When the glue-less snap-together figurines are
finished _ complete with weapons, decals and accessories _ they
become effective and interactive posturing models with some 40
points of articulation. A slightly sophisticated motor-skills
challenge and a long-term toy craze all in one. Pretty neat.
</P>
<P>
   THE GENTLE LULL OF A JACKHAMMER?
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing mechanical wind-up mobiles have over lazy-age
motorized, doll-dangling, eye-catching baby distracters: They're
not motorized! That is to say, while Fisher Price's Sparkling
Symphony Mobile with Remote Control ($25; www.fisher-price.com) is
indeed ultra modern, colorful and pleasing to behold visually, the
diminutive powerhouse rotating its dangling moon and stars is
notably audible. To compensate, the symphony of nursery rhyme
electronica is fixed at a fairly loud volume, which is all well and
good if you're grooming a future rock star or jackhammer operator,
but it's not at all peaceful late in the night when a soft,
soothing lullaby is all that's required. A wonderful daytime
distraction, to be sure, but clicking on the remote from up to 20
feet away and setting the moaning wheels and enthusiastic digital
orchestra in motion somewhat defeats the purpose of stealth tactics
in the nursery.

 &HT;    Accessory-deprived? Writeable CD drive a handy tool
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am often a great disappointment to those who meet
me.
</P>
<P>
   Most people assume that _ here at Technology Ranch in exotic
Smyrna, Ga., _ I have all the latest in computer equipment. They
envision banks of blinking lights, PCs with processors so fast that
special cooling units are needed to prevent meltdown, and shelves
stocked with every new accessory that comes along.
</P>
<P>
   But today I am sitting in a bedroom that serves as my home
office, bare feet propped on a desk where my father once sat
presiding over a failing boat-manufacturing company. I am typing
away on a 350-megahertz computer that any self-respecting
13-year-old would sneer at.
</P>
<P>
   I love gadgets and computers. It's just that I am promiscuous
with my love and my money and have flings with fly rods, golf clubs
and cameras as well as computers. My modest income gets spread too
thin to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   So when the public relations woman called to ask me to test the
new MP3 audio gadget that her company was promoting, she explained
that I would need to use my writeable CD drive as part of the test.
I had to tell her I hadn't gotten around to buying one. You could
hear the disdain of my high-tech poverty in her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, being highly trained in the art of human relations and in
advanced table manners, she said she would lend the drive to me so
I could test her product. When the drive arrived, it sat _ unopened
_ for a week while I went about my more usual tasks of cleaning up
after the cat and trying to find my lost wallet.
</P>
<P>
   I still haven't tested her product. But I did install the CD
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a few days of messing with it, I am already looking
closely at my No. 2 fly rod, thinking I may pawn that sucker and
buy my own writeable CD drive. I am finding uses for the drive that
didn't strike me until I used it.
</P>
<P>
   It passed the Husted Test for Practicality. It has multiple
uses, and all of them have actually solved one problem or another
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I've used it to make audio CDs of some of my favorite vinyl
albums. Now I can drive along in my car accompanied by Peggy Lee.
Those who have heard me sing _ even trendy people who listen to
more popular music _ appreciate hearing her instead of me.
</P>
<P>
   My hard disk was clogged with electronic photographs. There's
the (I swear this is true and can provide witnesses if necessary)
photo my electrical engineer uncle sent of his new license tag,
countless family photographs I scanned in, photos of various
friends, and pictures that I no longer remember taking but hesitate
to throw away. I've copied most of them to a CD and tucked them
away so _ years from now when this hard disk meets up with the law
of entropy _ I'll have them.
</P>
<P>
   Then I did something that surprised even me. For years I have
been urging readers to make a backup copy of the personal data on
their hard disks. But _ since I did not have a tape drive, or even
a Zip drive _ the notion of inserting countless dozens of floppy
disks to save my tax data, e-mails and writing documents was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   I felt guilty about not doing it, but a guy can get used to
guilt. Now I have a true backup copy of my data. (I didn't bother
making copies of programs since it's almost always necessary to
install them from scratch in a new installation.)
</P>
<P>
   What I'm saying is: Go out and get a writeable CD drive if you
don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   I know many of you are nervous about tasks that involve opening
up the innards of your PC. But it's truly easy _ a 30-minute job at
most. I won't take you through the steps since it's far smarter to
follow the step-by-step instructions that come with the drive. But
I can tell you that installation simply involves sliding the drive
into your computer and fastening it with two screws.
</P>
<P>
   Then you plug in two cables. Once you load in the software that
comes with the CD drive, you're set. Those of you who still get the
quivers about things like this needn't be ashamed if you decide to
take your machine in to a computer shop for the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Since this CD drive must soon go back to the manufacturer, I'll
be postponing the purchase of a new sand wedge for my golf bag and
buying a writeable CD drive of my own.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, I may even get around to testing the MP3
gadget that started this whole thing.

 &HT;    UPN stations may become part of a new Fox network
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ United Paramount Network passed away on New
Year's Day, 2001, at the age of 5, following a lengthy illness.
Despite slightly improved ratings in recent years, it hemorrhaged
more than half a billion dollars during its brief lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-network is survived by a couple of popular African
American sitcoms, a raucous pro wrestling show and a cult-favorite
sci-fi series in its seventh and final season.
</P>
<P>
   UPN was the child of Viacom and Chris-Craft, created to make
sure Viacom's Paramount-produced shows would be seen if the other
networks decided to buy only programs produced in-house. When
Viacom bought CBS, UPN's raison d'etre disappeared. Now that News
Corp. is buying Chris-Craft and UPN is losing those big-city
stations, that core UPN audience is lost as well.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral will take place at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles.
Trekkers and wrestlers will serve as pall bearers. In lieu of
flowers, viewers are asked to send contributions to the Keep
Voyager Alive Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   UPN, seen in Austin on KVC Channel 13, is battling what many
industry experts believe is a fatal illness now that News Corp. has
bought Chris-Craft Industries, which owns eight UPN stations in
vital major markets such as New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, News Corp. owner Rupert Murdoch politely
requests that those stations drop their UPN affiliations when their
contracts expire in January, that would leave the fledgling network
without coverage where network coverage is vital. Death is likely
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Do we care? Well, some of us do.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent boys whose hearts go pitty-pat at the mention of
World Wrestling Federation's ``Smackdown!'' certainly care. Big
time. The streets may be crawling with angry teen-agers if their
regular Thursday night testosterone outlet disappears. Other
networks have toyed with the notion of adding wrestling to prime
time, but for sheer outrageousness and camp, it would be hard to
beat''Smackdown!''
</P>
<P>
   A large number of African American viewers will mourn the loss
of ``The Parkers'' and ``Moesha,'' the No. 1 and No. 4 shows,
respectively, among black households. And next month, ABC's
prematurely canceled sitcom ``The Hughleys'' moves to UPN, which
means that group of loyal fans _ and D.L. Hughley himself _ will be
left in the lurch, too.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when network TV has been lambasted for lack of divers-
</P>
<P>
   ity, NAACP spokesman John White expressed concern recently over
the possible demise of UPN because the network ``has one of the
best records in terms of minority hiring and representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, legions of near-obsessive fans of ``Star Trek:
Voyager'' are sure to begin hyperventilating by Thanksgiving if the
sci-fi series doesn't find a new home in January.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not among the fans of pro wrestling, sitcoms and
``Voyager,'' you probably couldn't care less about UPN's fate. And
for good reason. Only by an enormous stretch of the definition is
UPN a network at all. For one thing, it only has 10 hours of
programming a week: 7 to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday. That's it.
This fall it will have only six hours of series, including a new
martial arts drama (``Freedom''), a high-tech crime drama (``Level
9'') and one new sitcom (``Girlfriends''). Trust me when I tell you
few people will mourn any of those shows.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ABC, CBS and NBC have 22 hours of prime-time
programming, plus news, sports and daytime blocks seven days a
week. Fox has 15 hours in prime, lots of kid shows in daytime and a
large chunk of sports programming. Even the WB, the other fledgling
web that's been vying with UPN for true network status, has 13
hours on six nights, along with after-school and Saturday morning
kiddie fare.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of major markets and the bleeding of $100 million to
$150 million a year due to pitifully low ratings add up to doom for
UPN, but that doesn't mean its most popular programs (which aren't
very popular by Big Three standards) won't find a home. Since
Viacom owns both CBS and UPN, a logical home for ``Moesha'' and
``Voyager'' might be CBS, which is always in the market for the
younger viewers those shows attract.
</P>
<P>
   The really bad news in this corporate turnover is that Fox is
threatening to create another network, Fox 2, that would be
anchored by the newly acquired Chris-Craft stations, including two
biggies in New York and Los Angeles. (If Fox doesn't launch a new
network, the former UPN/Chris-Craft stations probably would become
independents. Viacom/CBS owns UPN shows, so Fox probably couldn't
keep those on the stations if it wanted to.) The Fox 2 scenario is
particularly scary because Fox (which also has Fox Family, Fox
News, FX and Fox Sports on cable) is having trouble programming the
one broadcast network it already owns.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's upcoming fall schedule, with little more than a month
before the October premieres, still has three ``To Be Announced''
blocks in prime time _ a half-hour to start the night on Wednesdays
and the entire Thursday lineup _ and a new sitcom starring John
Goodman that still doesn't have a title or complete cast. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   More Fox, less UPN . . . hmmm. Is anybody better off with this
deal, besides Rupert Murdoch? From the couch potato perspective,
it's somewhere between a wash and a negative.

 &HT;    Walking through ritzy stores great, but Web helps thrifty
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many shoppers have a love/hate relationship with
upscale department stores.
</P>
<P>
   We love what they sell but can't always afford it. And even if
we can, the salespeople can often make us feel like we should all
get back on our turnip trucks and drive back to Podunk or whatever
Godforsaken backwater it is assumed we have crawled out of.
</P>
<P>
   I vividly remember trying to buy a bottle of trendy perfume in a
certain high-end department store. Getting the attention of the
sales staff was tougher than getting past the velvet ropes at
Studio 54 in its heyday. Across the sales floor a friend of mine
was trying to purchase a silk tie for his new job. After a while,
he meandered over to me, without a purchase, muttering, ``I really
don't care. I'm just going to that tie store near the food court.
These people make me feel like a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you've got the time and you've got some mad money, skip
the snotty salespeople and try department store shopping online.
Trade magazine The Industry Standard argues in its current issue
that half the fun of luxury department store shopping is the
elegance of the surroundings, the glorious feeling of actually
touching a pair of Gucci loafers or a Prada tote bag or trying on
that fabulously chic Armani suit. The Standard points out that the
luxury stores' online counterparts don't have half the inventory
their brick-and-mortar stores have and that shoppers don't want to
spend hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars ordering a dress
online that might not be the right color or that might not fit.
</P>
<P>
   To this concept, we say ``phooey.'' We also say visit the new
Neiman Marcus Web site (www
</P>
<P>
   .neimanmarcus.com). What we have here is a flashier version of
Neiman's numerous hard copy ``look books'' mailed to its credit
card customers that display the store's hot picks for any given
season. There's a ``shop by trend'' section that lets users sigh
over cashmere sweaters from Marc Jacobs or Donna Karan separates
the store dubs ``Wall Street Chic.''
</P>
<P>
   But by far the best thing about the Neiman site is the Manolo
Blahnik shoe salon. Launched with the help of Atlanta-based firm
RichFx, this area of the store is a virtual video game for designer
shoe fans _ and you know who you are. Even if you have no idea what
Manolo Blahnik shoes are, go ahead and download the RichFx player
and take a look at the shopping experience Neiman's has the
potential to offer shoppers visiting the rest of its online store.
The software program that runs within the Web site looks like the
computer game ``Myst,'' only you're examining shoes instead of
spaceships. There are original drawings from the designer and even
his motto: ``My shoes are not fashion,'' he says. ``They are
objects ... gestures that happen to be fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh my.
</P>
<P>
   For a certain element of the population this is more fun than
the Godiva chocolate site.
</P>
<P>
   But if Neiman's isn't your style, walk across the virtual street
to Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Again, selection is slim compared to the brick-and-mortar store.
The ladies who lunch and then presumably spend the rest of the day
shopping have vetoed this site. However, for ordinary working girls
eating salads at their desks, the Saks site is a delightful
diversion. From designer evening gowns from Badgley Mischka, to
workplace-appropriate clothes from the store's very stylish
in-house line, or accessories from the usual designer suspects
Jimmy Choo, Kate Spade, Calvin Klein and HugoBoss, they're here.
And yes, the teensy and trendy Fendi baguettes are here.
</P>
<P>
   While the official jury is still out on high-end department
store Web sites, they do have numerous advantages for time-crunched
and cash-crunched shoppers who every now and then do like to sample
the finer things in life.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, every site lists prices. Sometimes when one is
looking at accessories or jewelry in department stores, the tags
are discreetly turned over to hide the three- or four-figure price.
</P>
<P>
   On even the most ancient of computer monitors, the colors and
the design of the products show up beautifully. And, if it's
something you really, really want, you can either order it on the
spot or perhaps call your local store and see if it has the same
item and can hold it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores like Neiman and Saks undeniably rely on
well-heeled customers wandering through their stores like Lauren
Bacall in ``How to Marry a Millionaire'' pointing at item after
item and commanding, ``I'll take that and that ... and that and
that and that!''
</P>
<P>
   However, for the ordinary shopper who places buying a Chanel
handbag in the same class as putting a down payment on a car, sites
like these give you the information you need to be a better
consumer of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   You know the prices, you know the designers and when you need a
special dress for a gala event or just want to splurge on a sharp
new tie to wear to work, you can check out the goods right here.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want, snap up that tie for the job interview _ a
couple of clicks, no waiting.

 &HT;    Game Boy Advance, Gamecube from Nintendo due next year
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nintendo fans have something to cheer about. The
company revealed its new video gaming systems Thursday at the
Spaceworld trade show in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Game Boy Advance, successor to the Game Boy Color portable
gaming device, will feature a 32-bit processor, 50 percent larger

</P>
<P>
   Gamecube games will come in 1.5-gigabyte optical disk format,
and accessories will include a 56k modem and a wireless controller.
</P>
<P>
   The system is set to launch in North America in October 2001.

 &HT;    Graphics a big hook in `Ecco'
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been well over a year since I first saw screen
shots of a promising Dreamcast game titled ``Ecco the Dolphin.'' It
was one of the best-looking games I had ever seen, and now it's
finally here and I couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game loads, prepare to witness some of the best
graphics on the system to date. For the first half-hour I totally
ignored the game play and just explored the vast undersea world in
awe.
</P>
<P>
   The game artists' research spanned several months, and it shows.
From the smooth contour of a dolphin to the subtle cloud of sand
from a shifting stingray, every element is captured realistically.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful imagery is complemented with a soothing ambient
soundtrack. Some hard-core gamers may be a little skeptical, but
it's actually a refreshing break from the gritty, techno-throbbing
action games.
</P>
<P>
   The sensory experience is nearly perfect, but how does it play?
</P>
<P>
   Again, I was impressed. Ecco, the dolphin, has many abilities,
and although they may take a few minutes to get used to, you'll be
chasing fish and gliding gracefully along the ocean floor in no
time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ecco's most important abilities is his sonar projection.
The skill allows Ecco to speak to other creatures, wrangle fish and
map out his environment.
</P>
<P>
   The only factor that comes close to polluting this pristine game
is the vagueness of the tasks for each stage.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are info-crystals and sea creatures that guide
Ecco, you'll often be uncertain as to what to do or where to go. I
usually don't refer to hint guides, but I found that I didn't have
much choice if I wanted to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a few unclear missions, ``Ecco the Dolphin'' is a dream.
This is yet another great title that makes me happy I have a
Dreamcast.

 &HT;    Long-distance calls via Web come free, if not so easily
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine being so excited about something that you
called yourself to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   I made my mouse tracks across the on-screen dialpad, clicking
along the digits of my phone number. I heard the distant sound of
ringing through my computer's speakers, followed by my recorded
voice. I was alone in my home, and I told my voice mail, ``It
works, it really works.''
</P>
<P>
   My first Internet telephone call was to my own answering
machine. I was amazed and excited when it worked. I suppose that's
why I even left myself a message.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance phone service was my major vice and a steady
expense ever since I had the money to pay for it. Internet
telephone offers a chance to save money.
</P>
<P>
   I was a reluctant convert to Internet telephone calls. My
neighbor Susan asked me what I knew about the technology, and I was
ashamed to say I had no first-hand experience. I gave her some
articles about it, and she picked a provider.
</P>
<P>
   She invited me to her house to help walk her through the first
call. The process did not go smoothly, but that short exposure made
me curious.
</P>
<P>
   I could understand Susan's motivation to find free or cheap
phone calls. Her daughter met a foreign student who returned to
Germany. Their phone exchanges could get expensive, and Susan
wanted to find a way to reduce the costs.
</P>
<P>
   After fiddling with Susan's setup for a while, I came home and
got to work on my own computer. I downloaded PC-to-Phone software
from Deltathree's Web site (www.deltathree.com).
</P>
<P>
   It took work, but I managed to set it up. Once I was ready to
make a call, I dug out the microphone that came packaged with our
computer.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial call to myself, I was eager to test the
technology on real conversation. Call No. 2 was to my friend Marci.
She was friendly, as always. Then she said, ``I'm sorry, but who is
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Next I called my parents. My mother asked if I was in the car,
and she struggled through a short phone call with me before asking
me to call on a ``real'' phone later.
</P>
<P>
   The microphone is not great for this purpose. My call recipients
also had the distraction of hearing their own voices loud and clear
from my computer speakers while they talked. To optimize your
chances for quality sound, you need a headset that plugs into your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics stores carry them, and some of the Internet phone
providers sell them from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the exciting news is, even with the bad microphone, the
calls worked. And the price was right; the call was free. Plus,
this technology allowed me to make phone calls while I was online.
</P>
<P>
   I only have one telephone line at home, which I use for my
computer and telephone. When I surf the Web, the phone line is tied
up and calls are sent to my BellSouth voice mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Using PC-to-Phone, I can use the Internet and make phone calls
through my computer at the same time. I can also check my voice
mail messages by dialing in to the voice mail center. It simply
requires opening another browser window.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Deltathree, there are several companies offering
free calls from personal computers to traditional phones.
Dialpad.com (www.dialpad.com) and PhoneFree.com (www.phonefree.com)
offer free, unlimited calls within the United States. Other
companies like Net2Phone (www.net2phone.com) and MediaRing.com
(www.mediaring.com) offer discounted calls within the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The technology still has imperfections. There are echoes and
voice delays. Some calls are reminiscent of cheap mobile phones or
international calls of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those cases where you get something for nothing
and sacrifice a little quality.
</P>
<P>
   One way to improve quality is to buy a headset.
</P>
<P>
   Net2Phone makes a headset that plugs into the back of a
computer. It sells at many local retailers for about $45. Or you
may find headphones that you can order via one of the Internet
phone providers. Deltathree and Dialpad.com offer a selection on
their sites ranging in price from $10 to $75.
</P>
<P>
   To make the calls, you need a computer, an Internet connection,
a sound card, a microphone and speakers.

 &HT;    Worry not about a bot
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I've started paying more attention to applications that place
bots on my computer. You should make readers aware that many
programs place bots on their system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Mares, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: So, what's a bot and what does it do? Bot is short for
robot. It's a software tool that sifts through computer data. It
has been programmed to search and recover information.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Developers send bots on missions with specific
instructions. Web search engines dispatch bots to snag relevant URL
information from other servers. Shopping bots are big. They scan
the Web for prices for online products. Bots can be newshounds,
too, retrieving the latest in news, finance, sports and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: They help maintain intricate Web sites. They monitor site
links to make sure they're still alive when Web pages are removed
or relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There is some concern about how they are used. They're
constantly retrieving info and have been called ``spiders'' or
``Web worms.'' This can give the impression that they multiply.
That's not really the case. They use standard Web protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Bots can place demands on a network. There are newer
protocols being designed every day to standardize and limit those
demands. Developers are asked to strike a balance when designing
and deploying a bot.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: So, bots can be good, bots can be bad? In general, bots
are babes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Readers:
</P>
<P>
   Here's a fun Web site to bookmark. Cruise to www.surprise.com.
Thank you, Dave Garr, for sending it in.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's a gift site that doesn't try to sell you anything.
It's big on pointing you to ideas for fun gifts anywhere on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Click on ``Who's it for'' to pick a present for
grandparents, the baby sitter or your child's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The ``What Occasion?'' options cover retirement,
housewarmings, graduations, birthdays. Another ``must click'' is
``What are they like?''
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Do they love to throw parties? Perhaps a maid service or
a bubble machine. A gadgeteer? No problem. There are PDAs, a
folding shovel and a wristwatch camera. The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Buying for someone with a wacky sense of humor? There's
custom toilet paper or a glow-in-the-dark basketball. For pet pals,
there's a puppy pager.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Ideas are submitted by folks who surf the site.
Surprise.com will pay $100 for ideas that are among the 1,000 most
popular ideas for a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Get downright organized about your gift-giving. Set up an
account. Schedule e-mail reminders for anniversaries, weddings,
etc., and keep track of gift ideas you've saved while browsing.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Reader input adds some clarity to discussion about digital
photos
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The recent column on digital photography provoked some
response, both from the unanointed, like me, and the experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am also an old photographer ready to go digital. But right
now, the more I read, the more confused I become. A number of my
friends have chosen the Sony Mavica line, which uses a floppy disc.
This is appealing to me because it seems so easy. Now Sony is
adding Memory Stick storage. Do you have any suggestions, based on
your own research? Thanks for any info you might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Using 3.5 floppies for image storage provides enormous freedom _
you don't have to carry a laptop or some other expensive storage
device if you intend to make a lot of pictures on a trip. As far as
I can see, the only sure disadvantage is that the Mavica is a lot
larger than most digital cameras. There is also the question of
whether it takes longer to record the image on a floppy than on a
Memory Stick, but I haven't found the answer to that.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Will Christopher passes along some excellent information
for all of us seeking to get into digital images:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I just this year made that plunge, perhaps my experience
might be of interest to you. Check out this Web site:
www.imaging-resource.com. It will give you all the information you
need and quite a bit more on any digital camera on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher extols the virtues of the Agfa Ephoto 1680, which
provides 1.9 megapixels, 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom. He
paid $429 for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site he mentions appears to be just what all of us
beginners need.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Eisele has a related question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately a year ago a piece of software came out which
allows an individual to take data from a VCR or video camera and
make still photos through their computer. Any ideas? It was
advertised on several radio shows about a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This requires hardware, not just software. The pioneer in this
field is the Snappy Video Snapshot, a little box to be connected
between your VCR/camera and your computer. A similar and perhaps
more sophisticated function is now being included in some video
display cards.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Langan, a reader in Colorado, wonders about the
durability of prints made on an inkjet printer. While the maker of
the Pictorico line of paper I reviewed recently states that its
Photo Gallery High-Gloss White paper is archival, I suspect the
greatest durability lies in the images themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless over the next 50 years or so there will be advances in
storage formats, and JPG and GIF files will become obsolete. But it
is hard to imagine that there won't be provisions for migrating
images from those formats to new ones.

 &HT;    `X-Men' geared toward fans of comic book version
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``X-Men's'' popularity seems to be peaking again with
a recent movie starring America's favorite mutant fighters, along
with a new video game titled ``X-Men: Mutant Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Activision product is a gem for PlayStation owners. The
console system is rapidly losing attention from the industry's top
developers because of the approaching arrival of the PlayStation 2
on Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' was the most successful comic book property of all
time. The game pays respect to the history of the mutant heroes,
while providing challenging fighting duels at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   There are many modes to the game, including Training, Survival
and Arcade. Choosing the first option, you and your selected
character go to visit Professor X, who patiently teaches you to
throw simple punches and kicks as well as elaborate combination
moves.
</P>
<P>
   In Survival mode, you battle until your energy meter goes out.
After defeating all of your opponents in the Cerbro mode, you are
treated to an animated history three minutes or longer about your
chosen mutant.
</P>
<P>
   Like the good and evil that exist in the world of ``X-Men,''
there are good and bad things to say about the video game.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the simple moves are a lot flashier than
comparable fighting games. They also do an excellent job of falling
in with the character's personality. There are special features,
such as 24-hit combination by Toad that can do fierce damage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite today's state-of-the-art technology, Activision opted to
remain two-dimensional with the fighting. In other words, you can
only duck and jump to avoid hits, not step aside to the right and
left as you can with 3-D titles. ``X-Men'' does have a tad of 3-D,
which is only used in the completion of special moves. As the
finishing blow is being launched, the camera angle will move around
to the back of your mutant for an up-close look.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are only average, but the fighting action runs
smoothly. What really stands out is when a character does a simple
special move and the game goes to slow motion for about two or
three seconds as the final hits are made.
</P>
<P>
   The music at the beginning of the game _ from the movie _ is
excellent, as are the introductory themes for each character. But
when the fighting begins, the music becomes annoying. It is without
purpose and fails to follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   You'll love this game if you love ``X-Men.'' When the game is
loading, screen shots of the old comic books appear on the screen.
It brings back wonderful memories of the evolution of the world's
superheroes.

 &HT;    Absent again from big event TV
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Big deal television events put a nonviewer
in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   About 51 million people saw the last episode of ``Survivor.'' Or
will admit to it. Enough to stimulate serious media overkill and
dominate conversation in cafeterias, bars, offices, gyms and
student unions everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with these conversations do you say, ``No, I have no
knowledge of this 'Survivor' thing of which you speak'' and sound
like a snob? A spoilsport affecting the air of an ethical
vegetarian at a weenie roast?
</P>
<P>
   Or do you disguise your ignorance by airily mouthing any
secondhand conventional wisdom you've overheard. ``How did that
creepy Richard guy win? Don't that just burn your breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   A simple ``No, that's my bowling night'' would be too easy to
verify. It would be hipper to say: ``No, it aired during my
triathlon training.'' But it's hard to sound convincing between
handfuls of potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   The real story? My garbage disposal jammed. My bike chain was
loose. I had a flat tire and relatives arrived from out of town.
The bus was late.
</P>
<P>
   I need to develop excuses because I watch virtually no
television. This is not a moral thing. It is not Some Kind of
Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows it's not an overabundance of good taste - you would
be amazed at the percentage of my wardrobe that depicts palm trees
or identifiable fish species.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the truth is too boring to relate. I'm a sleep-deprived
single parent living in a part of the country with near-perfect
weather. This combination leaves little couch time. At least little
couch time when I'm awake.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just not into TV and went years without owning one.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this year, I've already fumbled with explanations. I've
never seen ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'' and missed the
game-show high weirdness of ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that _ to quote a show I
saw three times during the decade of the 1990s _ it's just hard to
explain without folks suspecting you belong to a cult.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do I dread being shunned for knowing nothing about the
show, there could be professional ramifications. I fear having my
columnist's license yanked for being the only columnist to fail to
write about the parallels between the presidential election and
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   I am told the final survivor, Richard Hatch, is a consultant.
The biography issued by the network says he ``conducts seminars on
numerous topics including conflict management, team building,
practical negotiation and public speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   He is building a career as a professional survivor right now.
Within eight months, his books, videos, talk show appearances, his
management philosophy will be so overfamiliar even I will catch his
act.
</P>
<P>
   I shudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' features a crude form of pure democracy in which
all the contestants vote each other off the show.
</P>
<P>
   This might catch on. Next, they'll do business layoffs like
that. I'd be worried if I were working anywhere where Hatch's
consults.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to be ready for next time.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity was out. The VCR jammed. The computer was down.
The cable went funny. I lost the remote control so deep in the
couch it will take a reupholsterer to dig it out.
</P>
<P>
   Full-fledged excuse systems are much better than a single
all-purpose excuse. And far better than telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   I think I heard that at a corporate consultant's seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever I come up with will need to be convincing or my
co-workers will vote me out. I'll be on shaky ground for at least
another week.
</P>
<P>
   Unless I can accuse someone else of being a TV snob.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Paul Thompson has a pig farm

some swanky houses. Now they want the pig farmer to go because the

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: We received a letter from Capital Recovery
Inc. in Utah stating that we were due a refund of $774.53 on a
paid-off mortgage held in a trust fund by the government. This
company offered to collect this refund for us for a 25 percent fee.
We are wondering if this is a legitimate deal or a scam. If it is
legit, how would we go about collecting this money ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ellen Macaulay
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a scam, but you can retrieve this money yourself. If you
believe the tracer's fee is worth the trouble, at least attempt to
negotiate the fee to a lower percentage before agreeing to payment.
Reputable tracers ask a percentage, and remember, payment is made
after you receive the money, not before. Some mortgage holders are
due a refund from the federal government for old FHA mortgages paid
off before Nov. 5, 1990. Contact The Federal Housing Administration
Support Service Center at (800) 697-6967 or visit
www.hud.gov/fha/comp/refunds/fhafact.html to investigate such
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While snorkeling in a nearby river, I found a brass token. On
one side, it has an engraving of a hen and a rooster kissing with
the words ``THE CHICKEN RANCH LA GRANGE, TEX'' inscribed around the
edge. On the back, ``GOOD FOR ALL NIGHT'' is inscribed in the
center and flanked on both sides by two hearts. I've heard about
the Chicken Ranch, but is this brass coin authentic or just a joke?
Who would be able to tell me?
</P>
<P>
   _ Edward F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Could be genuine. A woman well-versed in the history of the
Chicken Ranch, Kathy Carter, director of the Fayette Heritage
Museum and Archives, says there is no way to tell. (Newcomers, the
Chicken Ranch was an infamous brothel located in La Grange. Its
closing was loosely chronicled in the musical and movie ``Best
Little Whorehouse in Texas.'') Tokens like this were common in
houses of ill repute _ but so were counterfeit and commemorative
ones. Drop by the Fayette County museum in La Grange and let Carter
take a look. She is always interested in potentially historical
items. How did the brothel come to be called the Chicken Ranch?
During the Great Depression the reigning madam, Miss Jessie, was
forced to go on the ``poultry standard,'' charging one chicken per
``service.'' Soon chickens roamed the ramshackle place, and the
poultry operation became a profit maker. No one went hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My friend and I have a disagreement as to whether Dr Pepper
has any prune juice in it. She says yes; I say no. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are. Dr Pepper's secret formula, says spokesman Mike
Martin, contains 23 fruit flavors. Prune (plum) is not among them.
Never has been. Dr Pepper's (the period after the r was dropped in
the 1950s) 1999 sales topped 500 million cases in the United
States. That is 12 billion 12 oz. can or 44 cans per person per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Miller used to sell a clear beer a couple of years ago. Is
there any way I can get my hands on some?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ralph Henley
</P>
<P>
   A: More than a couple of years ago _ it was a 1993 test market
product for Miller Brewing in Austin, Richmond and Minneapolis/St.
Paul. Not every product turns out to be Miller Lite. No more
exists. If it did, you would not want to drink it because the shelf
life of beer is about four months.This beer was sold in clear
bottles and regular cans and looked like 7Up with a head. The beer
taste was there, but no golden color, no amber bottle.
</P>
<P>
   UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   Equal time, folks. An estimated 150,000 balloons and 1,000
pounds of confetti (biodegradable all) rained on the Democratic
delegates after Vice President Al Gore's acceptance speech. Proving
the race is tight in more ways than one _ that is the same number
of balloons the Republicans dropped in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail
jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968. Due to the number of
inquiries, Jane cannot respond to every request.

 &HT;    Zoning laws lack protection for those who came first
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Paul Thompson has a pig farm three miles west
of Stuart, Fla. where he, his wife, and the pigs have lived happily
since 1957 _ until recently. In the mid-1990s a developer bought
the neighboring land and built a golf course and some swanky
houses. Now they want the pig farmer to go because the newcomers
are objecting to the smell, and to the country music Farmer
Thompson plays most days to keep his porkers happy.
</P>
<P>
   You tell me _ who was there first?
</P>
<P>
   In Toledo, a bunch of folks built houses practically on top of
the approach lights to the city's airport and then formed an
alliance to complain of the noise. My question to them was: Who was
there first? Their answer: The airport, but we didn't know they
were going to fly so many airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Lots of cities build airports for show. The upshot is the
Port Authority is buying these folks all new, ultra-thick windows
and central air-conditioning to muffle the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make sense?
</P>
<P>
   An attorney in New London, Conn. doesn't think so. After reading
my snappish column in his hometown newspaper, the New London Day,
he wrote of a similar case in New Hampshire _ with a twist. It
involves an egg farm established by a young couple back in 1961.
Here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
   ``Their farm was located in an agricultural zone and they moved
to New Hampshire specifically to locate an egg farm on that site,
as permitted under the local zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``They invested several years of very hard work and several
hundred thousand dollars of expense to provide equipment, real
estate and buildings for the operation of their egg farm. To their
surprise a retiree arrived and built his `dream home' in the
agricultural zone, with full knowledge of the chicken farm next
door.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomer then began complaining about the ``malodorous''
breezes wafting from the chicken farm when the wind was right (or,
in this case, wrong), and pretty soon the egg farmers, though
complying with all regulations and disposing of chicken manure and
waste in the prescribed manner, were out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' the attorney writes, ``the Superior Court of New
Hampshire granted an injunction and imposed a fine of $10,000 a day
for every day that the chicken farm continued in operation. An
appeal to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire
</P>
<P>
   followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``...the farmer offered to purchase the property of the
neighbor, a so-called `balancing of the equities'. The farmer
argued that even though the neighbor was a Johnny-Come-Lately, if
there was anything wrong then the most damages that could ever be
sustained could not exceed...what the retiree paid or the fair
market value of the retiree's property.
</P>
<P>
   The choices were, according to this attorney, ``(1) receive the
highest value of his property in damages and become a
Johnny-Come-Lately elsewhere; or (2) forget about his case and
continue to live in the neighborhood where he had chosen to live,
with the smells found in an agricultural zone. The Supreme Court of
New Hampshire declared itself a `clean-air-jurisdiction' and, in a
unanimous opinion, decreed that the chicken farm had to go; and it
did _ straight into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always amazed at the Johnny-Come-Latelys who, under the
banner of environmentalism, announce that they are in favor of
farms. They are in favor of keeping farms and they are in favor of
conservation zones and land preserves, but not if the deer eat the
flowers, or the chickens smell, and certainly not if the pigs
produce strong odors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to all, those who wish to have residential home
sites should seek land in residential zones, not move in next to
airports, pig farms, chicken farms, and nibbling deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as we're talking about ``fair,'' why is it our
courts bust their backsides to protect the rights of murderers,
thieves, and other ``misunderstood'' segments of the population
while honest folks just keep on paying, and paying...and paying. It
seems to me what we're missing in this country of government ``by
the people and for the people,'' is a little equal ``and justice
for all.''

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Big deal television events
put a nonviewer in an awkward position. About 51 million people saw
the last episode of ``Survivor.'' Or will admit to it. Enough to
stimulate serious media overkill and dominate conversation in
cafeterias, bars, offices, gyms and student unions everywhere. When
faced with these conversations do you say, ``No, I have no
knowledge of this 'Survivor' thing of which you speak'' and sound
like a snob? A spoilsport affecting the air of an ethical
vegetarian at a weenie roast? (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal)

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: We received a letter from Capital Recovery
Inc. in Utah stating that we were due a refund of $774.53 on a
paid-off mortgage held in a trust fund by the government. This
company offered to collect this refund for us for a 25 percent fee.
We are wondering if this is a legitimate deal or a scam. If it is
legit, how would we go about collecting this money ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ellen Macaulay
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a scam, but you can retrieve this money yourself. If you
believe the tracer's fee is worth the trouble, at least attempt to
negotiate the fee to a lower percentage before agreeing to payment.
Reputable tracers ask a percentage, and remember, payment is made
after you receive the money, not before. Some mortgage holders are
due a refund from the federal government for old FHA mortgages paid
off before Nov. 5, 1990. Contact The Federal Housing Administration
Support Service Center at (800) 697-6967 or visit
www.hud.gov/fha/comp/refunds/fhafact.html to investigate such
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While snorkeling in a nearby river, I found a brass token. On
one side, it has an engraving of a hen and a rooster kissing with
the words ``THE CHICKEN RANCH LA GRANGE, TEX'' inscribed around the
edge. On the back, ``GOOD FOR ALL NIGHT'' is inscribed in the
center and flanked on both sides by two hearts. I've heard about
the Chicken Ranch, but is this brass coin authentic or just a joke?
Who would be able to tell me?
</P>
<P>
   _ Edward F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Could be genuine. A woman well-versed in the history of the
Chicken Ranch, Kathy Carter, director of the Fayette Heritage
Museum and Archives, says there is no way to tell. (Newcomers, the
Chicken Ranch was an infamous brothel located in La Grange. Its
closing was loosely chronicled in the musical and movie ``Best
Little Whorehouse in Texas.'') Tokens like this were common in
houses of ill repute _ but so were counterfeit and commemorative
ones. Drop by the Fayette County museum in La Grange and let Carter
take a look. She is always interested in potentially historical
items. How did the brothel come to be called the Chicken Ranch?
During the Great Depression the reigning madam, Miss Jessie, was
forced to go on the ``poultry standard,'' charging one chicken per
``service.'' Soon chickens roamed the ramshackle place, and the
poultry operation became a profit maker. No one went hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My friend and I have a disagreement as to whether Dr Pepper
has any prune juice in it. She says yes; I say no. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are. Dr Pepper's secret formula, says spokesman Mike
Martin, contains 23 fruit flavors. Prune (plum) is not among them.
Never has been. Dr Pepper's (the period after the r was dropped in
the 1950s) 1999 sales topped 500 million cases in the United
States. That is 12 billion 12 oz. can or 44 cans per person per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Miller used to sell a clear beer a couple of years ago. Is
there any way I can get my hands on some?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ralph Henley
</P>
<P>
   A: More than a couple of years ago _ it was a 1993 test market
product for Miller Brewing in Austin, Richmond and Minneapolis/St.
Paul. Not every product turns out to be Miller Lite. No more
exists. If it did, you would not want to drink it because the shelf
life of beer is about four months.This beer was sold in clear
bottles and regular cans and looked like 7Up with a head. The beer
taste was there, but no golden color, no amber bottle.
</P>
<P>
   UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   Equal time, folks. An estimated 150,000 balloons and 1,000
pounds of confetti (biodegradable all) rained on the Democratic
delegates after Vice President Al Gore's acceptance speech. Proving
the race is tight in more ways than one _ that is the same number
of balloons the Republicans dropped in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>

 Study Questions the Health Value of Catnaps  
 (Lead)  
 By RICHARD A. MARINI  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;  &QL;  &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Siesta. Power nap. Forty winks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the brief interval of rest is called, catching some Zs
in the afternoon is a tradition in many Latin American and
Mediterranean countries. And some companies in the United States
are promoting the midday snooze as a way to improve employee health
and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Now wake up and smell the coffee. A study by Hannia Campos, a
researcher in the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of
Public Health, says nodding off for 20 to 30 minutes during the day
could be bad for your health.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, published in the International Journal
of Epidemiology, found that those who napped every afternoon had a
higher-than-average risk of suffering a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Campos said she was not surprised by these findings, despite
what she conceded is a common perception that naps are
heart-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only published study I found on specific health benefits
of napping looked at a small group of agricultural workers who were
obviously very active and probably in fairly good health,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campos' study compared about 500 Costa Ricans who had survived a
heart attack with an almost equal number of healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   When surveyed, those in the heart-attack group were 50 percent
more likely to have enjoyed a daily siesta than those from the
other group.
</P>
<P>
   These findings appear to be backed up by research showing that
heart attacks are more likely to occur in the morning. This is
thought to be due to a complex chemical reaction that occurs in the
body shortly after waking and increases heart rate and blood
pressure. Such changes may trigger a heart attack in those who are
already at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Campos said an afternoon nap may trigger the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Not all specialists agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to note that this study found only an
association between napping and heart attack, not a
cause-and-effect relationship,'' said Nora Walker, a
board-certified sleep physician in private practice in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who've had heart attacks often suffer sleep disorders,
meaning they have trouble getting to sleep and often wake up during
the night. This makes them tired during the day so they'll tend to
nap more. So it shouldn't be surprising that they're more likely to
have a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Health experts recommend that people get the majority of sleep
at one time, preferably up to eight hours per day for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' said Pat Britz of the National Sleep Foundations, ``if
you need it, a short, 20- to 30-minute nap will leave you rested,
refreshed and alert. This can be particularly important, especially
if you'll be driving or operating heavy equipment.''

&HT;     `BRETHREN' LIVES UP TO ITS BEST-SELLER STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following three audio books have one thing in common: Each
as a hardcover book has been near the top of the best-seller lists
this summer. That said, they enjoy little common ground. One comes
recommended without reservation, one with reservation and one you
are urged to steer clear of. In that order, they are:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Brethren,'' by John Grisham. Read by Michael Beck.
Abridged, approximately 6 hours. Bantam Doubleday Dell Audio
Publishing. $27.95.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham, the uber-successful author of countless legal
thrillers, is in top form with his latest _ though it is more a
political thriller than a courtroom drama. The brethren for whom
the book is titled are three aging former judges who have been
caught in various misdeeds, making them cellmates at a
minimum-security federal prison in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   With too much time on their hands, they have fine-tuned a mail
scam that includes extortion. This gives the three geezers a steady
stream of cash flowing into an offshore bank account. When their
scam happens to ensnare a CIA-influenced candidate for president,
the brethren find themselves challenged beyond their wildest
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The plotting is superb, the developments never completely
predictable. Grisham manages to portray the three judges with some
complexity, both smarmy and likable. Beck, who has performed six
previous Grisham best-sellers, deftly gives each character a voice.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Not A Day Goes By,'' by E. Lynn Harris. Read by Rocky
Carroll. Unabridged, approximately 6 hours. Bantam Doubleday Dell
Audio Publishing. $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has carved out a special niche amid the fast-growing
field of black writers fixated on romance and conspicuous
consumption. His books feature bisexual and/or gay characters
acting just as superficially as their straight colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' latest brings back John ``Basil'' Henderson, a former
pro football star turned sports agent who, as Henderson describes
it, ``likes to switch lanes.'' The book opens on the morning of
Henderson's wedding day to Yancy Braxton, an up-and-coming, overly
ambitious Broadway star.
</P>
<P>
   We learn in the prologue that the wedding isn't going to happen,
and for the better part of six hours get to hear the juicy,
ridiculous three-month roller-coaster ride that preceded the
scheduled wedding day. Carroll, a regular on the television series
``Chicago Hope,'' cannot be faulted for his reading. It's what
Carroll's reading that can be knocked and enjoyed simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Omerta,'' by Mario Puzo. Read by Joe Mantegna. Abridged,
approximately 5 hours. Random House AudioBooks. $25.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, we find that the adage ``dead men tell no tales'' is not
quite true. If only it were. ``Omerta,'' published almost a full
year after Puzo passed away, is a dreadful book, as lifeless as its
creator. Puzo demonstrated three decades ago with ``The Godfather''
that he could create terrific scenes and memorable characters, but
the energy that went into that seminal novel cannot be found in
``Omerta,'' billed as the final chapter in the author's Mafia
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   This reads more like a parody of Puzo's best work, the plot
clumsy, the men and women in the story one-dimensional caricatures.
Mantegna is a fine reader, but even he cannot breathe life into a
corpse.

   Anyone who has spent a lot of time in classrooms knows you often
miss a lot by taking handwritten notes.
</P>
<P>
   Jotting down what the lecturer just finished saying means you
miss a lot. Lugging around a clunky tape recorder is a drag, and
you always have to keep an eye on when the tape is going to run
out.
</P>
<P>
   Aaah, but what about a three-hour recorder that weighs just two
ounces? Or a nine-hour recorder that weighs about the same?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best on the market are from Olympus and Voice Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympus Digital VN-180 ($119.95) also stores up to 300
messages and reminders, can have 20 different alarms set, puts
voice memos into 100-message folders, and you can edit content.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice Bank 9-Hour ($149.95) can record nine hours straight.
It also has four 99-message folders.

unable to afford the bucks it takes to install a security system?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, fake it.
</P>
<P>
   For $19.95 you can buy a fake surveillance camera from Gadget
Universe that looks so much like the real thing your average stupid

about the device to all of his/her friends and word gets around.

   DRAWING ON YOUR SKILLS

   Here's a great item for the budding school-age artist or just a
student who likes to illustrate a term paper or school project: The
Pablo-Internet Edition drawing tablet.
</P>
<P>
   It's from KB Gear Interactive and does a lot more than the
standard white computer drawing tablets you may have seen. This
8-by-6-inch device ($99) connects to a personal computer either by
USB or serial port connection.
</P>
<P>
   Using the pressure-sensitive pen, you can draw original art,
animate, photo edit, and so on, using the comprehensive software

&HT;     POLITICIANS SHOULD STOP EXPLOITING CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If the political exploitation of children were a
crime, most of our political leaders would be doing hard time.
</P>
<P>
   Put 'em away, I say. Three ``do it for the childrens'' and
you're out.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican and Democratic conventions, children were
trotted out to sing, deliver slogans and represent the supposedly
compassionate policies of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   A group of children at the Democratic convention even had to
take the stage to recite lines like ``When I grow up, will innocent
kids still be wrongfully touched? Will students go home from school
in a bulletproof bus?''
</P>
<P>
   Wrongfully touched? What kid ever would say that? What kind of
twisted adult would make a kid say it?
</P>
<P>
   Those children were wrongfully dragged out on stage without
informed consent for the propaganda purposes of politicians. Some
day their friends will find old C-SPAN videotape of the event and
they'll never live it down.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of child exploitation happens so often nowadays we
don't even think it's wrong. We don't even realize we're being
played for saps.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Al Gore pointed out a child in the convention
audience who would have benefited from his health insurance plan.
Last week George W. Bush introduced children of a middle-class
couple who supposedly would benefit from his proposed tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Even nonparent Ralph Nader has got into the
do-it-for-the-children racket, going so far as to claim he has
millions of children all over the world. This is one puritan who
gets around.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle last week,
Nader said he wants to protect children from unhealthy corporate
influences such as violent TV, junk food and even computers donated
by companies to schools.
</P>
<P>
   One foresees Pokemon buy-backs, Teletubby burnings and activist
figures instead of action figures.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he'd open federally funded ``children's community
centers'' but I'm not sure how much fun the kids will have in these
centers. Will they sit around playing Anti-Monopoly?
</P>
<P>
   In schools, Nader would teach reading and writing as a
``byproduct of contextual citizen skills,'' such as learning how to
file a Freedom of Information Act request, put on news conferences
and develop coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Then kids can make coalition signs instead of gang signs. And
the school uniform will be unfashionable black suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nader may want to make kids eat spinach and read bureaucratese,
but at least he doesn't want to execute them or throw them into
prison with hardened adults.
</P>
<P>
   He's not a hypocrite like some politicians, who play upon
children's innocence, yet are quick to start the lethal injection
when a jury declares a child guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Americans say they love children, yet we tend to fear and hate
them.
</P>
<P>
   If we didn't fear kids, we'd discipline them.
</P>
<P>
   If we didn't hate kids, we wouldn't give them terrible schools,
ritual doses of Ritalin, parentally organized sports and, yes, the
junk food and TV Nader decries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we say children are ``precious'' and ``must come first.''
Children are valuable, all right, as human shields for politicians
and special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want gun control say they're doing it for the
children. Those who want universal health care say they want to
start with children's health care. If these things are so right,
what's wrong with doing them for adults?
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream politician don't dare declare a war on poverty.
Instead they pull heartstrings by saying they want to fight child
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that children can't be accused of owning a welfare
Cadillac, unless it's a toy one.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes a child poor? It's not a lousy allowance. It's
poor parents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made an issue of child poverty because Texas under Bush
has the second-highest rate of child poverty in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But then, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the
United States, of which Gore is second-in-command, has the
second-highest child poverty rate of 29 industrial nations. We're
just above Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This country's 13.5 million poor children represent a lot of
poor parents our major candidates would rather not talk about. But
children are so innocent, they're always good to include in a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are so innocent we've lost our innocence hundreds of
times, in everything from wars to school shootings. Maybe we're so
innocent we'll buy all the talk about children, education and
family values.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader is serious about his citizenship reading program, and
he's always serious, he'll include a course on political b.s.
detecting.
</P>
<P>
   Start by looking for the word ``children.''

   The idea is that children can't be accused of owning a welfare
Cadillac, unless it's a toy one.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes a child poor? It's not a lousy allowance. It's
poor parents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made an issue of child poverty because Texas under Bush
has the second-highest rate of child poverty in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But then, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the
United States, of which Gore is second-in-command, has the
second-highest child poverty rate of 29 industrial nations. We're
just above Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This country's 13.5 million poor children represent a lot of
poor parents our major candidates would rather not talk about. But
children are so innocent, they're always good to include in a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are so innocent we've lost our innocence hundreds of
times, in everything from wars to school shootings. Maybe we're so
innocent we'll buy all the talk about children, education and
family values.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader is serious about his citizenship reading program, and
he's always serious, he'll include a course on political b.s.
detecting.
</P>
<P>
   Start by looking for the word ``children.''

   THE `CAT FROM THE BRONX' IS A CLASSICAL ACTOR AT HEART
</P>
<P>
   WESLEY-SNIPES-STARBEAT _ Wesley Snipes doesn't deny that being
an action hero and scoring with audiences has given him clout in
Hollywood. ``I didn't get into the business to do action,'' he
reveals. ``I'm a classically trained actor and I love the more
dramatic stuff, whether it's in theater or in film. But doing films
like `The Art of War' (which opened Aug. 25) has afforded me the
opportunity to do other more sensitive projects. So I'm not
knocking it.'' By Jeanne Wolf. WITH PHOTO.

<P>
   FOR JAMIE FOXX, LUNACY EXTENDS TO ALL AREAS OF HIS LIFE
</P>
<P>
   JAMIE-FOXX-BAIT-STARBEAT _ Jamie Foxx had to bide his time in
comedy clubs and in TV comedies before his big film breakthrough in
Oliver Stone's 1999 hit, ``Any Given Sunday.'' ``I've always known
that once I got my foot in the door, people would eventually say,
`This kid has got the stuff,''' reveals Foxx, who's now starring in
``Bait'' (opening Sept. 15). But he is down to earth about his
fame. ``I've done a lot of work in a few short years and some
people might expect me to be cocky, but that's not true. In
Hollywood, we're all just commodities,'' he says. By Cindy
Pearlman. WITH PHOTO.

<P>
   DIRECTOR NEIL LABUTE CAN'T QUITE DEFINE HIS JOB
</P>
<P>
   LABUTE-NURSE-BETTY-STARBEAT _ ``Nurse Betty'' (opening Sept. 8)
will surely catch moviegoers and Neil LaBute aficionados off guard.
It features a woman in the central role and it's far sweeter than
director Neil LaBute's previous films. And although his earlier
films were not great hits, studios continue to take a gamble on
him, perhaps for his real talent, his vision and edge, and his
willingness to play on the cusp of the mainstream. ``I'm pleasantly
surprised that I keep getting to make my movies,'' LaBute says. By

   EMMY PICKS: WHO SHOULD WIN _ AND WHO WILL WIN

<P>
   EMMY-PICKS-STARBEAT _ If this year's Emmy nominations are any
indication, there are fewer than 20 worthwhile shows on TV right
now. The list of overlooked, quality series _ including ``Oz,''
``Action'' and even ``Buffy The Vampire Slayer'' _ is longer than
the list of Emmy nominees. Some of the shows, and the actors who
appear in them, that have the best chances of winning, however, are
``The West Wing,'' ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex &AMP; The City.'' By

 c.2000 TV Guide Canada 
 Not to be published in Canada before Sept. 10. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If this year's Emmy nominations are any indication, there are
fewer than 20 worthwhile shows on TV right now. The list of
overlooked, quality series is longer than the list of Emmy nominees
_ including the technical categories! If ``Buffy The Vampire
Slayer'' doesn't get some cred next year with the Emmy voters, I'm
going after them with a stake.
 &HT;    The lack of recognition of ``Oz'' cast members Lee Tergesen,
Rita Moreno and Christopher Meloni, and the series itself is a
crime worthy of landing Emmy voters in Emerald City.
 &HT;    In its short TV life, ``Action'' proved itself to be the rarest
of network series: Gutsy, groundbreaking and brilliantly written, a
coal-black indictment of the Hollywood lifestyle with killer
left-hook punch lines. Illeanna Douglas' tour de force as Wendy,
the child-star-turned-hooker-turned-movie-producer was, for my
money, the year's standout performance.
 &HT;    With sour grapes out of the way, let's get on to the
nominations:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING LEAD ACTOR _ COMEDY
 &HT;    Kelsey Grammer's ``Frasier'' nomination is almost a knee-jerk
reaction. Same can be said for Ray Romano's, although John
Lithgow's continuing Emmy support becomes more questionable with
every passing season of ''3rd Rock.'' The series just isn't
providing him with the material any more. Eric McCormack in ``Will
&AMP; Grace'' has turned into the show's Jerry Seinfeld, with one
Elaine and two Kramers. This is important grounding for the
longevity of the show. Michael J. Fox's emotional last season on
``Spin City'' was unfortunately poorly written, denying the
talented and beloved TV actor the chance to retire on a high note.
 &HT;    Who Should Win: Eric McCormack
 &HT;    Who Will Win: Michael J. Fox
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING LEAD ACTOR _ DRAMA
 &HT;    Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston of ``Law And Order,'' and even
Martin Sheen of ``The West Wing,'' did not get the delicious
balance between hardass and softie that Dennis Franz (``NYPD
Blue'') and James Gandolfini (``The Sopranos'') got to investigate.
Points against Franz include the tear-jerker feel of his
character's leukemia story line. Hasn't this guy been through
enough? On the other hand, Gandolfini's Tony Soprano walked a
supremely nuanced line, continuing to make a vulnerable monster
lovable.
 &HT;    Who should win: James Gandolfini
 &HT;    Who will win: James Gandolfini
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING LEAD ACTRESS _ COMEDY
 &HT;    There's no competition in this category. Jenna Elfman's kooky
Dharma is as stale as Woodstock acid. Patricia Heaton (``Everybody
Loves Raymond'') and Jane Kaczmarek (``Malcolm In The Middle'') do
good jobs as sitcom moms, but there's no heat there. Debra
Messing's Grace suffered this season from writers who were
determined to turn a successful, self-employed woman into a
neurotic update of Lucille Ball. Sarah Jessica Parker (``Sex &AMP; The
City'') leads the field by a mile with her finely tuned portrayal
of Carrie Bradshaw, the all-too-human romantic journalist.
 &HT;    Who should win: Sarah Jessica Parker
 &HT;    Who will win: Sarah Jessica Parker
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING LEAD ACTRESS _ DRAMA
 &HT;    Solid performances by Amy Brenneman (``Judging Amy'') and Sela
Ward (``Once And Again'') will likely be eclipsed by the other
women in this category. Since ``The Sopranos'' didn't utilize
Lorraine Bracco much this season, the battle will be between her
co-star Edie Falco, who took Carmela Soprano to new heights of
frosty determination, and Julianna Margulies, whose tastefully
conflicted departure from ``ER'' was among TV's great sign-offs.
 &HT;    Who should win: Edie Falco
 &HT;    Who will win: Edie Falco
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTOR _ COMEDY
 &HT;    Peter Boyle and Brad Barrett work well in ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' but don't stand out. David Hyde Pierce has turned Niles
into the jewel in the ``Frasier'' crown over the years, and his
value to the show is inestimable. Sean Hayes (``Will &AMP; Grace'') is
a laser blast of comic energy, and there's nothing quite like him
on TV these days. Still, it would be nice if the writers let him
calm down occasionally and develop a heart. Peter MacNicol's
slippery Cage (``Ally McBeal'') tempers the show's crazy-girl vibe,
but overall, ``Ally'' went south this year, which might hurt
MacNicol's chances.
 &HT;    Who should win: Peter MacNicol
 &HT;    Who Will Win: Sean Hayes
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTOR _ DRAMA
 &HT;    Another powerhouse field, with two nods each for ``The
Practice'' (Michael Badalucco and Steve Harris) and ``The West
Wing'' (Richard Schiff and John Spencer), but it would be remiss
for the Emmy voters to overlook Dominic Chianese's tightly wound
portrayal of devious Uncle Junior in ``The Sopranos.'' Watching him
squirm the entire season under house arrest _ whether becoming
hooked on ``The Bold &AMP; The Beautiful'' or courting an elderly
admirer while still trying to run the business _ was one of this
year's guilty pleasures.
 &HT;    Who should win: Dominic Chianese
 &HT;    Who will win: Dominic Chianese
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTRESS _ COMEDY
 &HT;    Let's face it _ if any of the female leads deserve an Emmy, it's
Courteney Cox Arquette, not nominees Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer
Aniston, whose characters veered awfully close to self-parody this
year. Doris Roberts shone with matriarchal glee on ``Raymond,'' but
didn't steal the show. Kim Cattrall could steal any scene she
appears in on ``Sex &AMP; The City,'' and it's a testament to her skill
as an actress that she knows when to pull back and give others the
spotlight. Megan Mullally, however, ain't afraid to chew the
scenery, and her hilarious schtick as the cashed-up lush is what
keeps millions of fans tuning in each week to ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
Mullally deserves the Emmy because this award is about acting _ and
Karen Walker couldn't be further from Mullally's sweet, earnest
real-life disposition.
 &HT;    Who should win: Megan Mullally
 &HT;    Who will win: Kim Cattrall
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTRESS _ DRAMA
 &HT;    The real ``Sophie's Choice'' of the night. An incredibly strong
selection of actresses, all talented and blessed with great
scripts. Picking between ``The West Wing's'' Stockard Channing and
Allison Janney, ``Judging Amy's'' Tyne Daly, ``The Practice's''
Holland Taylor and ``The Sopranos''' Nancy Marchand would be like
choosing one of five perfect yet different diamonds of equal value.
It's a matter of taste. Sadly, Marchand's recent death prevents her
from running again next year, so let's give it to her.
 &HT;    Who should win: Nancy Marchand
 &HT;    Who will win: Nancy Marchand
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING COMEDY SERIES
 &HT;    Of all the nominees, only ``Sex &AMP; The City'' is working outside
the standard sitcom formula, upping the ante of interpersonal
relationships and unexpected humor for the genre of TV comedy.
Three of the nominees, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Frasier'' and
``Friends,'' cannot count the 2000 season as their finest, and
while ``Will &AMP; Grace'' was able to build momentum from last year,
it's still maturing _ expect it to win this category next year.
 &HT;    Who should win: ``Sex &AMP; The City''
 &HT;    Who will win: ``Sex &AMP; The City''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTSTANDING DRAMA SERIES
 &HT;    Surprising choices in this category, mostly due to the omission
of HBO's ``Oz'' in a year where ``ER'' and '' Law &AMP; Order''
faltered somewhat, and ``The Practice'' suffered from creator David
E. Kelly spreading himself a bit too thin. The second season shone,
but ``The Sopranos'' didn't weave as wicked a web as the first
season. The brilliant team of writer Aaron Sorkin and director
Tommy Schlamme turned ``The West Wing'' into riveting drama, which
clearly deserves to win this category, despite the shootout in the
last episode!
 &HT;    Who will win: ``The West Wing''
 &HT;    Who should win: ``The West Wing''

 c.2000 Ian Spelling

<TEXT>
<P>
   Directing, notes the man behind the acclaimed films, ``In the
Company of Men'' (1997) and ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' (1999),
involves making a statement and shaping a piece of art. But it's
also about pleasing the masses, or at least some of the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're there to entertain an audience,'' film director Neil
LaBute says. ``If there's a statement, it's hopefully already in
the screenplay _ and you, the director, are just heightening it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment can be something different, can be an artistic
expression. When I think of myself as a viewer, I look at
entertainment strictly as something that's good. It can shock me,
make me cry, surprise me or just make me laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's latest film, ``Nurse Betty,'' which opens Sept. 8,
rates as both good and engaging, but also risky. Renee Zellweger
stars as Betty Sizemore, a small-town waitress who escapes her
boring existence and lousy husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) by
fantasizing about her favorite character, Dr. David Ravell (Gregg
Kinnear), on her favorite soap opera. Then, after witnessing Del's
brutal murder at the hands of father-and-son hit men, Charlie
(Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), Betty loses her grip on
reality and heads to Los Angeles to reunite with Dr. Ravell, with
Charlie and Wesley hot on her trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' will surely catch moviegoers and LaBute
aficionados off guard. It features a woman in the central role and
it's far sweeter than LaBute's previous films or any of his plays,
among them ``Filthy Talk for Troubled Times,'' ``Sanguinarians &AMP;
Sycophants'' or ``bash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what drew me to it,'' LaBute, 37, said excitedly on a
recent trip to New York. ``I admired the script (by John C.
Richards and James Flamberg) because there were such familiar
elements, but they were done in a very clever way. They took me by
surprise constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know exactly where anything was going to lead, and
that's the way I like to write _ and to watch _ something. The
writers conveyed a great regard for the characters throughout.
Reading this script, I felt the audience had really to like Betty
to see her through all the things she goes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone concerned that LaBute is turning soft need only watch the
sequence in which Wesley slays Del. Wesley doesn't just shoot, stab
or choke Del to death. He scalps him in a moment as nasty and
cold-blooded as anything ever depicted on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Gruesome as the scene is, it has been toned down significantly.
Test screening results impelled the director to pull back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I go the other way when people tell me to do
something, but in this case I watched the audience watch the scene
and they were very much taken aback,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris, even though he's the perpetrator of this event, wins
the audience back along the way. You find him funny. But I'd hit a
wall where I could feel the audience turn off ...''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute makes other significant strides as a filmmaker with
``Nurse Betty.'' It's vibrantly lit and full of long, wide shots
that soak in vistas and streets and crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew `Nurse Betty' required something different, so I worked
with a familiar production team, but a new cinematographer, Jean
Yves Escoffier, who had a great visual sense. And I relied a great
deal on him to create that more open look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also expanded a bit in terms of the actors I worked with.
They all have a lot more experience as actors than I do as a
director, but I felt ready to work with, stand up to or give in to
these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, for example, knows what's good for him as an actor. He
understands what works, and LaBute frequently deferred to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no ego involved,'' he says. ``It was all about what
was best for the performances, what was best for the movie. I
listened to everybody, and it was, `Whoever was right, let's go
with that.'''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's earlier films didn't wow anyone at the box office and
chances are that ``Nurse Betty,'' which cost $25 million to
produce, won't rake in a fortune. Nevertheless, studios continue to
take the gamble on LaBute, who will next direct Aaron Eckhart and
Gwyneth Paltrow in a film version of ``Possession,'' a
time-tripping romantic drama based on the novel by A.S. Byatt.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they appreciate real talent and that LaBute possesses
both a vision and an edge. It's also possible that they see a guy
who's willing to play on the cusp of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleasantly surprised that I keep getting to make my
movies,'' LaBute says. ``I understand that this is a business. You
put something in and you hope to get more out than you put in. I'm
very clear-eyed about that.''

   For Jamie Foxx, lunacy extends to all areas of his life. Take
his name. On his birth certificate, he is simply Eric Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go to these open-mike nights and I realized that women
got more time up at the mike,'' Foxx explains. So early in his
comedy career he changed his name. ``It was crazy. I would hear the
MC say, `Jamie Foxx? Where is she? We've got plenty of time for her
act!'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now Hollywood has plenty of time for his act. Foxx is
hot these days. And he knows the secret of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it easy for Hollywood. You don't have to teach me much
anymore because I've been around. Just give me a script. I just
have to learn my lines and then let me go,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Foxx gets his name above the title in ``Bait,'' which opens
Sept. 15. He plays Alvin Sanders, a man tossed in jail for stealing
a prawn. But old Alvin's services are needed when a treasury agent
(David Morse) enlists the con as bait to catch a dangerous thief
(Doug Hutchison) who is planning a gold heist at the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks that somewhere in jail Alvin picked up a
secret code that leads people to the gold,'' describes Foxx. ``It's
really a story, though, about redemption because all Alvin wants to
do is go straight so he can be with his girlfriend (played by
Kimberly Elise).
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are a lot of obstacles in his way, including the
cops, his rotten brother (played by Mike Epps) and all these
criminals who want to lure him back into the life,'' Foxx adds.
</P>
<P>
   The life, for Foxx, is movies. After a star-making turn last
Christmas in Oliver Stone's football epic, ``Any Given Sunday,''
the comic actor knew that he would not be content to stay on the
small screen for long.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take him so long to get to the multiplexes? ``You
know what's sad? I was so wrapped up in `The Jamie Foxx Show' for
so many years that I had no idea of what movie scripts were
actually out there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I would watch a great movie come out and say,
`Damn, why didn't anybody call me?''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Oliver Stone did just that for ``Any Given Sunday.''
And Foxx got his big film breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Foxx couldn't believe he got the call. ``I remember going over
to read for Oliver Stone. I thought it was for a smaller part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically you know when an audition is awful because the
director just sits there not saying much. You never hear, `What the
hell are you doing?' It's just total silence followed by, `Thanks
Jamie, you're not good for this one,''' he says, wincing. Stone
said just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back and read for another part and Oliver shook his
head again. I was like, `Is it me? Am I missing something?' But
Oliver said, `I dig you. And as a matter of fact the lead role is
open. Do you think you can do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs originally had the lead but had
pulled out of the film when the shooting schedule changed. But the
studio wasn't sold on the idea of Foxx, who didn't have much of a
name at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to put myself on tape. I said, `This is what we going to
do. I'll get six of my friends. We'll do a mock training camp. I'll
pretend I'm the new rookie and I'm getting out of a Mercedes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore my favorite Dallas Cowboys jersey. I even came up with
a rap, `I'm Willie Beemer. I keep the ladies screamin'.'''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. saw his tape and was convinced, which later lead to
the studio and director Antoine Fuqua (``The Replacement Killers'')
casting Foxx as the lead in ``Bait.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known that once I got my foot in the door, it
would just be a matter of time before people said, `This kid has
got the stuff,''' Foxx says.
</P>
<P>
   Foxx's own story has all the right stuff for a movie script. He
was born as Eric Bishop on Dec. 13, 1967 in Terrell, Texas. His
mother Louise experienced tough times when her marriage to Jamie's
father hit the skids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have money, but I was not allowed to become a punky
kid,'' Foxx says. ``I had the type of childhood where you weren't
allowed to hang out on the streets. I was put in Boy Scouts. I was
in the church choir.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also the quarterback of his high school football team. As
an athlete, Foxx was good enough that major Dallas newspapers
predicted he'd someday join the NFL. ``I had quite a following as
an athlete,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flipside to such young fame. ``It was a lot of
pressure. It was vicious. The fans would actually boo a 15-year-old
kid for missing a pass. Your self-esteem was nothing after those
kinds of games,'' Foxx says.
</P>
<P>
   But his lowest moment? ``The preacher of my church booed me like
I had sinned. He was screaming, `Lord have mercy! Boo. Foxx
stinks,''' says Foxx. ``This was my preacher! But it was a good,
humbling lesson in not believing in your own hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxx eventually ditched sports to study music in college, but
that fell by the wayside in 1989 when a girlfriend dared him to go
onstage during an open-mike night at a Dallas comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started talking. I don't even remember what I said that
night. But I could feel the waves of laughter,'' he says. ``It was
like lightbulbs had gone off in my head. This is where I
belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   After logging time at comedy clubs across America, the producers
of the TV series ``In Living Color'' caught Foxx's act and cast him
in 1990. The following year, he was cast on the TV series ``Roc.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie roles followed including ``The Truth About Cats &AMP; Dogs''
(1996), ``The Great White Hype'' (1996), ``Booty Call'' (1997),
``The Players Club'' (1998) and ``Any Given Sunday'' (1999).
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he finally released his first album, ``Peep This,'' and
two years later, he created ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxx is down to earth about his fame. ``When it comes to
Hollywood, we're all commodities,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of work in a few short years and some people
might expect me to be cocky, but that's not true,'' Foxx says. ``I
can easily be shut up. I'll meet a great director or actor and I
want to change everything I ever thought about life. I'm that much
into the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxx is upset about the lack of movie roles for African American
males. But he doesn't blame Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear brothers complain and say, `If only I was white.' I say
back, `Are you ever going to be white? No? Then stop complaining
and get to work. Find the right scripts. Get on with it. Don't talk
about how bad it is out there. Do something to fix it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a black man in Hollywood is not the most difficult
thing. It's also hard being a black man in society,'' Foxx says.
``But you've got all these different things you can do about it
now. Start your own production company. Write a script. Haul
yourself around to meetings. Stop whining and get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxx says he isn't immune to an occasional pity party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said at times, `Damn it, if I were white I'd be in that
film. No longer do I say those kinds of things. I say, `Damn it, if
I just looked for a good role, I would be in a film.'''
</P>
<P>
   These days he is being considered for most of the good roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a wonderful ride,'' Foxx says. ``I look at my life
and think, `You could be doing a lot worse things.'''
</P>
<P>
   He could still be at those open-mike nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still be hearing guys saying, `When is that Jamie girl
going to go on? I hope she's hot,'' he says, laughing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With chiseled features and a well-honed body _ which he's
displayed in more than a few films _ Wesley Snipes says he didn't
know he was a sex symbol until he got into movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had women come up to me and say, 'When are you going to
do something in which you take off your clothes again?' he says
with an ingenuous smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Claude (Van Damme) and all of them might want to do that
kind of stuff ... But I'm not that anxious to put my booty on the
screen anymore,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   In his current appearance in the action-thriller, ``The Art of
War,'' from his Amen Ra Films production company, Snipes doesn't
undress or even have a love scene with the heroine played by
Asian-American actress Marie Matiko.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy I play has no time to get it on with a woman,'' he
points out. ``It's like, 'Yo, the man is on the run.' He's too busy
saving himself to end up in the sack at some hotel! That would be
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who plays a covert agent for the United Nations, goes
underground after he's falsely accused of murdering the Chinese
ambassador. As the plot thickens with international intrigue, he's
placed in constant jeopardy _ and in the middle of some
death-defying action scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Stunt coordinator Michael Scherer says Snipes enthusiastically
participated in everything from martial arts combat to jumping from
buildings. ``Sometimes he scared the bejesus out of me because he'd
get right in there,'' Scherer confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes allows that he was often in a little peril. ``But that's
OK, I don't mind it,'' he says. ``I've been working with most of my
stunt men for 10 years and they know how far I'll go. We know each
other's styles and rhythms.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this movie he was a producer. So, when he wanted to take
too big a chance on a stunt, they'd remind him that if he got hurt
the whole production would be shut down. ``And I'd end up having to
pay everybody to sit around!'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got my attention!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Snipes first signed on to ``The Art of War,''
originally developed for Asian action star Jet-Li, he made sure
that he'd be doing some of his favorite things: martial arts and
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also wanted to beef up 'The Art of War,' which is the
title of an ancient handbook written by a very powerful Asian
general, Sun Tsu,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principles he lays down to win a war still apply today _
and my character embraces them,'' he continues. ``Then, you add the
action and, oh man, it's icing on the cake!''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes doesn't deny that being an action hero, and scoring with
audiences, in such thrillers as ``Passenger 57,'' ``Drop Zone'' and
the hugely successful ``Blade,'' has given him the clout he wants
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get into the business to do action,'' he reveals.
``I'm a classically trained actor, and I love the more dramatic
stuff whether it's on Broadway or in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doing films like 'The Art of War' has afforded me the
opportunity to do other projects that have more heart and
sensitivity. So I'm not knocking it!''
</P>
<P>
   Describing action scenes, he said he doesn't like ``straight up
formula stuff. I do fights that are right to the core, right to the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, nobody thinks about hitting a guy in the side of
the thigh. But it works. Pow! You hit him there and he's going to
stop what he's doing for at least a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who has studied martial arts as well as capoeira
(Brazilian dance-fighting), draws on his own street sense to keep
his screen fights authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the Bronx,'' he says. ``The Bronx teaches you to
survive. It's like, 'Bring it on!'''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``If you took me on, it wouldn't be easy. That's
part of my image. People don't mess with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Snipes was less a fighter than a performer when he
was in his teens. He enrolled in Manhattan's High School for the
Performing Arts where he flirted with the idea of becoming a dancer
or singer. Instead he decided on acting because it came easy to
him.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother abruptly moved the family to Orlando, Fla.,
Snipes completed high school while teaming up with friends to form
``Struttin' Street Stuff,'' a traveling puppet troupe that
performed in parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything. We created the puppets, we painted them, we
wrote the scripts,'' he remembers. ``I was just a whippersnapper
but I learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes readily concedes he also learned a lot from the
performance that opened the doors to his career _ an appearance in
Michael Jackson's ``Bad'' video. ``I was amazed by Michael's level
of concentration,'' he recalls. ``I thought if I could achieve
that, then people might react to me like they were reacting to
Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the tabloid headlines that dogged his rise to fame _
including his celebrated arrest in Florida after a high-speed chase
on his motorcycle, Snipes admits, ``No one can train you to be
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you deal with the loss of anonymity, the loss of
privacy? You have to be disciplined. You go back to what works.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes readily admits the biggest influence on his life and
career was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom told me something very simple _ 'Whatever you do, try
to be the best at it,''' he reveals.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made me study and read _ read, read, read. I remember
having a library card when I was about seven. It was mandatory that
I go to the library. My mom helped lay a foundation for me that I'm
now reaping with my success.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she gets the benefit, too. I get to send her around the
world. It's like, 'You want to travel, Mom? Go ahead. Wherever you
want.' It's a great feeling being able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes shared the thrill of his star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame with his mom. ``I thought someone was joking,'' he says.
``Nobody's nominated me for an Academy Award or even a People's
Choice. I didn't really think I was in the running. But it was a
hell of a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many cats from the Bronx have that kind of
experience!'' he chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not on location Snipes is usually at home in Malibu.
He shares custody of his son Jelani, 11, with his ex-wife, April,
from whom he was divorced in 1990. ``It's tough to be a good
father, and I'm definitely not cut out to be a stay-at-home dad,''
he says candidly, ``But Jelani and I have some nice times together,
and he would probably like to have me around a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes pauses to consider how he'd define what's behind his
screen image. ``If I end my career tomorrow,'' he says finally, ``I
don't want people saying, 'Oh, he's just an action guy, a sex
symbol ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be thought of as an actor.''

illegal in much of Mexico, grows as the governor of the state where
President-elect Vincente Fox used to be governor is set to announce

   BURMA-DISSIDENT (Bangkok, Thailand) _ The roadside standoff

sedition charges against Getullah Gulen, a religious leader who
lives in Pennsylvania. Gulen is the head of a prospering Islamic
community with hundreds of schools in Turkey, the Balkans and
Central Asia. For many years he was an unofficial ambassador for
Turkey who promoted a moderate brand of Islam. He preached
tolerance, meeting with Pope John Paul II and other religious and
political leaders, among them Turkey's prime ministers and

consider the area sacred ground. By Ross E. Milloy.

<P>
   WORKPLACE-WORRIES (Boise, Idaho) _ Few people still talk about
fretting over whether they can find work. Worries over the quality
of those jobs, however, remain a signature part of the economy for
many people. Many say they are concerned that they cannot keep up
with technological changes or that they are working too many hours
or that their health care coverage is inadequate. This insecurity
may be less significant than the version of early and mid-1990s,
and it may even be exciting for many young or well-educated
workers. But economists say the shift helps to explain perhaps the
most enduring mystery of today's economy: why wage pressures, while
on the upswing, remain more modest than they were in the milder and
shorter economic booms of the recent past. By David Leonhardt.

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS &LR;  (``e'' code)
</P>
<P>
   MET-ASIAN-ART (New York) _ Thirty years ago, Asian art led a
marginal life at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1970 the only
Chinese work on view was a room of Buddhist sculpture and a few
cases of ceramics. As late as 1990, Indian art meant an assortment
of objects crammed into dimly lighted vitrines on the Great Hall
balcony. Things have changed. The museum now has more than 50
permanent galleries devoted to the largest and most comprehensive
collection of Asian art under one roof anywhere. These days the Met
is fond of calling itself a ``museum of Asian art within a
museum,'' and it's justified in doing so. By Holland Cotter. (2000
words)
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-DESERT-EXHIBIT (Paris) _ With the arrival of photography
in the mid-19th century, the desert entered the European
imagination. Endless sand dunes in the Sahara became metaphors for
the grandiosity of Nature, camel trains and nomadic tribesmen
evoked romance and mystery. Of course the first desert
photographers were not artists, but explorers and scientists. Yet
their work passed one test of art: it made people dream. It is no
great leap, then, a century and a half later, to commission 10
European and American artists to travel into the desert and record
their reactions to it. The result is ``The Desert,'' a show at the
Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris through Nov. 5. By
Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Rebecca Goldstein's characters are
descendants of Ingmar Bergman's chilly intellectuals and
Hawthorne's cold-hearted curmudgeons. They want to subordinate the
heart to the head, the spirit to the word; they dream of perfectly
controlled worlds, where messy emotions are subjugated to the
ordering dictates of reason. Michiko Kakutani reviews Goldstein's
new novel ``Properties of Light.''

&HT;     LIFE ON THE STREET IN TIMES OF PLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The bright, mid-day sun did not enhance the
naughty school-girl masquerade she was offering for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Her sunken eyes were highlighted. So were the lines around her
mouth and the small sores on her skinny forearms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite little white ankle socks and high heels, a short skirt
and girlish blouse, she looked as if she were at least 50. Which
means she is probably not yet 30.
</P>
<P>
   Being a street prostitute has a way of aging a woman, fast.
</P>
<P>
   As I watched her _ standing on a street corner looking anxiously
up and down the block for johns as well as cops _ I remembered a
story I'd read recently about a pair of ``wild and crazy'' Russians
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The men from Moscow had flagged down a taxi and informed the
driver that they wanted to go ``where we can take a good look at
the hookers.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaded with booze and cash, the men complained about the quality
of San Francisco prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want some pretty ones like the ones we have back in
Moscow,'' said the more loquacious of the pair.
</P>
<P>
   They told about a friend of theirs who makes his living flying
Americans to Moscow for ``10-day blitzes with all the women they
ever dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought about the grim economic conditions that exist for
millions of Russians these days, about the widespread unemployment,
the rise in organized crime and the increased trafficking of women
and girls for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how it always works: The meaner and dirtier the economic
times, the prettier (and younger) are the females who turn to
selling their bodies to live.
</P>
<P>
   I thought, too, about a recent newsletter from the Rev. Glenda
Hope, director of San Francisco Network Ministries and co-founder
of SafeHouse for Women Leaving Prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   An extended-stay residential, rehabilitation and life-skills
facility for former prostitutes, the SafeHouse is 2 1/2 years old
and one of only five such residential programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with only 10 beds is the largest,'' Hope wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As for the makeup of the residents, all are recovering from
alcohol or drug addiction and more than half are high school
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 70 percent suffered long-term child abuse, including
incest and child prostitution. Some manifest significant cognitive
impairment caused in utero or by blows to the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most chilling statistic of all: ``The average age
for a female entering prostitution in the USA is 14.''
</P>
<P>
   An ordained Presbyterian minister (and one-time Southern
Baptist), Hope told me not long ago that people are always asking
her why she now devotes so much of her ministry to prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me, `What is it about these women?' Well, it's
because I don't see them as criminals or moral outcasts. I see them
as sisters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I see the situation they're in as an extension of the
stereotyping and thoughtlessness that all women are subjected to,
as a revelation of the worst of what a patriarchal culture has done
to women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   In her work with SafeHouse, Hope frequently teams up with Norma
Hotaling, a former prostitute who now directs an outreach and
advocacy program called S.A.G.E., Standing Against Global
Exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling has just secured a building that will serve as an
emergency shelter for prostitutes who are literally fleeing for
their lives _ from violent pimps or customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be about three to five beds,'' she said. ``But 20
would be more like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the woman in the school-girl masquerade try to change
her luck by crossing to a different corner, I wondered how many
times she has been beaten up or cut with a knife by a pimp or a
john. How old was she when she turned her first trick? How many
years _ or months _ does she have left before her body or mind
gives out?
</P>
<P>
   I tried to imagine what the woman looks like in that pitiful
outfit when the sun goes down and streetlights obscure all the
lines, sores and hollow eyes. Is she pretty enough for two drunken
Russian tourists?
</P>

&HT;     NOT MUCH ART IN WESLEY SNIPES' `WAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Note cast box at end)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Art of War,'' Wesley Snipes squares off against a
cartel of designer Chinese killers, and, to the surprise of perhaps
only his trail of dead, he looks better than they do in a leather
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   He'd probably look even better if the director and the
photographer had any idea how to light him. But Snipes doesn't seem
to have been hired to appear dashing or be terribly pensive. His
job is to run, kick, shoot, punch and be punched, and if he can
escape from a fight with his appeal as a matinee idol intact, more
power to him.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he and his stunt double are chained to
inexplicable action sequences that probably make more sense as
something you'd encounter at a PlayStation. As plot detours,
they're lame. Of course, this is also a movie that believes it has
discovered some ancient Chinese secret by naming itself after the
Sun Tzu military philosophy handbook. Sun's manipulation treatise
dates back at least 2,500 years, and so do the cliches rolled out
here.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell which was more inspirational: those writings
or every martial-arts flick ever made. Famous passages are spoken,
in ``The Art of War,'' by the likes of Donald Sutherland and Anne
Archer. You can see how they're meant to complement the tale of
international corruption the screenwriters don't seem to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   What we have is one of those ripped-from-the-headlines numbers
that, accordingly, has its characters walk and talk in tabloid. In
Archer's case the news sounds like it's being delivered by a
phone-sex attendant. She keeps hinting at a different kind of art
and a different kind of war. So do Snipes' needless ``snooping''
excursion to a Chinatown sex club and his demand that his
mysterious gal Friday (Marie Matiko) debug by tossing her clothes
out of the passenger-side window.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one caution-to-the-wind too many. Matiko plays a United
Nations translator with ties to an assassinated U.N. ambassador,
and wardrobe seems determined to keep her a 9-7-6 fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes plays Neil Shaw, a covert operator framed for the murder
of the ambassador. He's a member of one of those highly classified
teams that does the surreptitious international bullying when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's schedule doesn't permit.
Snipes glides along the margins of a far-reaching international
cabal involving the Chinese government. He actually gets North
Korea to submit to peace talks _ it must be the high-kicking and
that tuxedo. And we get a whiff of what a seductive Bond Snipes
would make.
</P>
<P>
   He also seems to be having fun pretending he's in a ``Mission:
Impossible'' dream. (At some point, for some reason, Snipes is
dressed to look like U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.) But
Christian Duguay isn't a director so much as a plagiarist with no
panache. (But his next assignment is the third ``Terminator,''
anyway.) When Snipes is framed minutes before China signs a pivotal
trade agreement, the film plunges into perpetual dinginess.
</P>
<P>
   Plot twists are served, but they have to curl through the plot
holes first. Thirty minutes in, Maury Chaykin shows up as an FBI
special agent, and I wanted to cash in my chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just like wrestling,'' he observes. It's also like
``The Matrix'' and all the staples in the Wesley Snipes oeuvre. But
just when you're ready to forgive ``The Art of War,'' a rumble
breaks out in the lower lobby of the United Nations, and a gun
spins through a plate-glass replica of the organization's trademark
insignia. And suddenly, peace talks never looked so stupid.

 &HT;    Marketing realities bring Coca-Cola into new era
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World of Coca-Cola is located next to Underground
Atlanta. But the New World of Coca-Cola is on the 14th floor of the
company's U.S. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Step out of the elevator and you'll experience a work
environment previously unknown to Big Red or its employees here.
</P>
<P>
   Drab gray carpet has been ripped up and replaced by a concrete
floor with chipped pieces of Coke bottles glazed into it.
</P>
<P>
   A bank of TV sets is stationed just a few yards from a fake Coke
fountain motif with countertop and stools.
</P>
<P>
   Right across from the ``media fountain'' is the ``bubble
conference room'' for the marketing and advertising gurus to bubble
up the latest ideas promoting their fizzy products. The room's main
wall is frosted glass, highlighted by sporadic see-through shapes
of round and oval bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   The floor, which houses the marketing, ad and innovation staff,
is organized in collective work bays to foster increased
communication _ both planned and spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creativity doesn't happen in cages,'' said Jeff Dunn, who is
now deputy president of Coca-Cola's North America operations but
will take over as president in October.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more conference rooms and far fewer partitions
and individual offices than in the rest of the building. The
conference rooms range from small ``cabins'' to large ``brand
trailers'' _ with walls made of erasable whiteboards so the
marketing and ad people can do their thing.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the ``consumer immersion room,'' with its
un-Coke-like orange floor and Jetsons-like chairs, where teens can
come and unwind while brand marketers pick their brains about the
latest fads.
</P>
<P>
   While dramatic, the recent changes on the 14th floor are more
than cosmetic. Coke execs and employees say they symbolize the
wholesale transformation taking place to turn the company around
after lagging profits and stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   Reshaping the North American operation _ the company's largest
regional group _ is key to the turnaround. And the challenges are
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, after posting gains for most of the decade, Coca-Cola's
carbonated soft drink business in the United States suffered a
decline in case sales while Pepsico and the overall industry posted
modest growth, according to Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, several industry analysts and observers worry that
U.S. consumers' love affair with carbonated soft drinks, especially
colas like Coke Classic, may be on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cola growth has been slow for a long time, and now we're
seeing a slowdown for brands like Sprite, Mountain Dew and Dr
Pepper,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage
Digest. ``Part of this has to do with increased pricing, but part
also has to do with consumers' growing interest in bottled water
and noncarbonated beverages, such as SoBe, Snapple and the sports
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with a potential change in taste buds, the company needs
to become a nimble innovator of new brands and products. But its
North American operation, which includes the United States and
Canada, has not had a particularly good record of innovating over
the past several years. Some analysts say it has been averse to
taking risks and bureaucratic in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   All that, however, is in the process of changing, Dunn and Steve
Jones, the company's worldwide chief marketing officer, said in
recent interviews with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dramatic shift in orientation,'' Dunn said. ``I
think it's just common sense. We need creativity, innovation and
new thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But not too much thinking, especially if it inhibits action.
Coke has the reputation for studying an issue to the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake you can make is overthinking,'' said Pina Sciarra,
brand director for Sprite and several other company beverages.
``You can miss the opportunity. ... We can't be so perfectionist.
Let's try some things.'' Sciarra, Dunn and Jones are trying to
implement Chairman Doug Daft's ``think local, act local'' mantra,
with hopes of creating a sleeker, more responsive company that
understands consumers better than it ever did before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-drink-at-a-time business,'' Dunn said. ``You build
it on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, Dunn said, Coke North America is transferring many
employees closer to the ground level, where its drinks are sold. In
the past, Dunn said, between 90 percent and 95 percent of the
decisions affecting the U.S. market were made in Atlanta, either by
corporate or North American executives. Less than 10 percent of
those decisions were made locally.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, about half the decisions are made in Atlanta,
while the other half are being made at the regional or local level.
The company has divided its North American market into 12 regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shortening the fuse between the local market and the
local decision-maker,'' Sciarra said. ``It's more real-time.'' Some
decisions are now being made in three weeks, compared with six
months under the old system.
</P>
<P>
   One of those decisions involved Coke's bottled water product,
Dasani, and Webvan, the online grocery delivery service. Coke
discovered that the demographics for both Dasani and Webvan _ busy
women over 25 who are looking for ways to simplify their lives _
are quite similar.
</P>
<P>
   So, in three weeks' time, the Dasani marketers came up with a
special promotion that gave a free six-pack to Webvan customers. If
the recipients buy Dasani five times through Webvan, they get
another free six-pack. It's a straightforward promotion that didn't
get lost for months somewhere in the Atlanta bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did a letter of intent between Coke and UPromise, which
was inked in 30 days, instead of what would have taken six months
under the old system, Dunn said. The deal, announced two weeks ago,
will set up tax-deferred savings accounts for kids, financed by
rebates from their Coke purchases as well as purchases by their
parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to make consumers more brand loyal over the long
haul _ year in and year out _ not just from one short-term
promotion to another.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term strategic alliances will become more common for Coke
in the United States, Dunn said, partly because of the knowledge
the company gets about consumers without having to reinvent the
wheel. America Online, for example, knows more about how consumers
use the Internet than Coke does. That's why the beverage giant
signed a multiyear agreement to develop innovative marketing
programs with the nation's largest Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 50 alliances in the hopper right now, in the
negotiating stage,'' Dunn said. ``We're much more open to different
types of business relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these alliances, Dunn said, the company is
changing its philosophy on introducing new products. Over the past
seven years in the United States, he said, Coca-Cola introduced
``very few big, new products. ... We didn't take many swings at the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, the company is poised to take many more swings, hoping
to at least hit some singles, if not home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be many smaller new products and packages,'' Dunn
said. ``Maybe one out of 10 will work. But it increases the odds,
and we'll be learning.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Red Flash, a sweet and fruity carbonated soft drink
recently developed for central and south Texas that will be rolled
out to some other markets in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is also experimenting with a smoothielike coffee beverage
in four U.S. markets, which will be sold at fountains _ not in
bottles or cans.
</P>
<P>
   While it sells canned ``Georgia Coffee'' in Japan, it has no
bottled or canned coffee product in the United States. That left a
void in the portfolio of its biggest bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises. So Atlanta-based CCE has decided to start distributing
``Planet Java'' bottled coffee in New York. The coffee is owned by
a Queens company.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn described CCE's deal with Planet Java as a ``short-term
relationship'' that will provide important information to both CCE
and Coke, which owns 40 percent of the bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn would not specifically comment on Coke's coffee plans in
the United States, or on what other new products may be on the
drawing board. But he said the U.S. innovation team is now fully
staffed and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer wants more variety and choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the company must grow its major
brands, such as Coke Classic, Diet Coke and Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation of the North American business is cola and,
therefore, the sustenance of that segment is vital to the overall
health of Coke's North American beverage business,'' said Scott
Wilkins, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. ``So much of
your basic business is cola. Clearly you have to reconnect with the
teenager, thereby lessening your dependence on the older cola
drinker. The marketing has to be clever enough to give new
consumers a reason to drink cola.''
</P>
<P>
   The company recently started airing new TV ads for Classic, with
more on the way targeting the teens Wilkins talks about.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sprite, which has been languishing lately after 12 years
of dramatic growth, the company will begin a new promotion
targeting online teenagers. Sprite has teamed with RocketCash, an
online gateway that allows teens to shop for a variety of products,
including music, books, sportswear and electronic games, without
using a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Oct. 15 and running at least through the end of next
year, Sprite will try to entice those teens to go to Sprite.com to
find out how much money they won from under a bottle cap.
</P>
<P>
   More than a billion caps on three different Sprite bottle sizes
will have a special code, indicating prizes from 20 cents to $1
that can be deciphered only on the Web site. That money can then be
used to purchase goods from RocketCash merchants. Each teen with an
account also can supplement it with money orders, checks or gift
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvigorating Coca-Cola's key brands in the United States is
critical. Dunn believes the combination of new and existing
products will allow the company to beef up its growth rate in case
sales to 4 percent to 6 percent annually. Last year, by contrast,
volume grew only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A better performance in the United States is needed, Dunn said,
for Coca-Cola to hit its worldwide target of 7 percent to 8 percent
annual growth, which is what Wall Street expects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke will definitely return to higher growth in the U.S. in
the balance of this year and next year,'' said Sicher, of Beverage
Digest. ``How strong that growth is depends on the pricing
environment, the success of its new advertising and marketing, and
its product innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its resources and powerful bottling system and brands,
there is no reason Coke shouldn't be poised for another chapter of
strong growth and success. That's the challenge, and that's the
opportunity.''

ROCK FESTIVAL SOFTENS RIGORS OF RUSSIAN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMENSKOYE, Russia _ They were stardust. They were golden. And
by the time they got to Ramenskoye, they were, if nowhere near half
a million, then certainly no fewer than 50,000 strong.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Ramenskoye was a massive Russian rock festival that
brought the flavor of Woodstock to this small town 30 miles east of
Moscow. Fow two days, 40 bands from Russia and around the former
Soviet Union played rock, dance, and alternative music from morning
to midnight. A large field near a semiabandoned hippodrome played
the role of Max Yasgur's dairy farm. And at times during the Aug.
20-21 festival, the clogged flow of cars on the New Ryazan Highway
looked a bit like the New York State Thruway on Aug. 15-18, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Ramenskoye festival's slogan _ ``Beer, Music and Love''
_ seemed to recall a more carefree time and place than the
tension-filled August Russia is enduring.
</P>
<P>
   For this has hardly been the summer of love. The daily bloodshed
in Chechnya, a blast in central Moscow that killed 11, and the
tragic sinking of the atomic submarine Kursk, with all of its 118
men, have led some pundits to dub this ``Black August.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramenskoye event was supposed to be the grand finale for a
summer of Russian rock festivals unprecedented in their size and
number. But it occurred at the height of the submarine crisis, when
many Russians were starting to conclude that their leaders had
covered up the scale of the Kursk tragedy and had bungled the
attempted rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Some Moscow officials suggested that holding rock festivals was
inappropriate for a time of national catastrophe. But the event
went on, and at times, like Woodstock, got rather political. On the
first day, Pavel Filippenko, the flamboyant lead singer of the
group IFK (who once performed an entire set naked in front of
hundreds), shouted from the stage as the band kicked into its cover
of ``We Care a Lot'' by Faith No More: ``This next song goes out to
the people who have (expletive) up our boys on the submarine!''
</P>
<P>
   That stirred up the crowd and gave the show a Woodstock-like
antigovernment bent, but organizers held back from turning the
event into a full-fledged protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too much anger and frustration about what was
happening with the submarine,'' said Mikhail Kozyrev, program
director of Nashe Radio (``Our Radio'') and one of the creators of
the festival. ``We decided we didn't want to do that just from the
point of uncertainty on how to control the rage if things get out
of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozyrev says the point of the festival _ called Nashestviye in
Russian, a play on the words for ``our'' and ``invasion,'' _ was to
give IFK and other younger local bands exposure to a larger
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have played for 50 people before,'' said Alexander
Lebedev, lead singer of the group Sansara from the Urals city of
Yekaterinburg. ``To play in front of 50,000 was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract the big crowd, the festival featured longer shows by
such Russian superstars as ChaiF, Russia's equivalent of Bruce
Springsteen, rock diva Zemfira (``She's as big here as Madonna in
the US,', says Kozyrev), and current Russian chartbusters such as
goth rockers Bi-2 and the Yekaterinburg hard rock quintet
Chicherina (who deleted a tune about a shipwreck from their song
list and instead dedicated a song ``to those who are waiting for
their sailors to come back.'')
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grim backdrop, Kozyrev said he was encouraged by the
festival's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer, and Nashestviye in particular, has definitely
been a step towards a better air and climate in the country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>

THE ARCHITECT WHO HELPED CLINTON RENOVATE GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you haven't noticed, what Democratic political
consultant Celinda Lake calls ``the dreaded F word'' is making a
strong comeback across the ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the federal government, of course. Whether it's
performance or need or the economy or whatever, the change in image
and confidence from Ronald Reagan's ``the problem'' of 20 years ago
to something Al Gore and George W. Bush compete to harness is
stunning.
</P>
<P>
   The thought occurred to me last week as President Clinton was
quietly marking (in newfound deference to Gore's presidential
campaign) the fourth anniversary of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Joining federal and state governments to the private and
nonprofit sectors to help stimulate and manage the transition from
dependency to self-sufficiency by 1.1 million welfare recipients
was at the heart of the president's vetoes of the first two
versions of welfare reform to reach his desk more than four years
ago, when he was battling the Newt Gingrich-led revolution that
wasn't. Clinton's final decision to sign a third, improved bill
divided Democrats, but the new law opened the door to what is now
called welfare to work, a work in progress that has had
considerable success to date.
</P>
<P>
   And it opened another door to service by an old Clinton friend
who stands as a symbol of the change in thinking about government
that is going to be one of the administration's legacies. He was
one of those who thought the president should not have signed the
welfare reform legislation, even in its third form, but who says
today, simply, ``I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli Segal is hanging out on Martha's Vineyard these days,
contemplating the rest of his barely middle-age life and waiting
for the completion of the building in Boston where his new condo
awaits, as befits a successful businessman who has been dabbling in
politics for a good 30 years. As Segal likes to say, his life until
1992 was ``a combination of business ventures and support of losing
Democratic presidential candidates,'' from George McGovern through
Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   But old pal Clinton changed his life. Instead of the top White
House job he thought he coveted after running the campaign
headquarters in Little Rock in 1992, Segal was given what turned
into a far more rewarding challenge: leading the effort to create,
sell, and then run in its formative period the national service
program Clinton had championed as a candidate and that new-thinking
Democrats had been championing for years, all the way back to
Robert Kennedy in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The result is Americorps, which, with something around 150,000
alumni, has twice the number in just a few years that the Peace
Corps has from its own proud history of nearly 40 years. For help
with college bills, young people give a year at very low pay of
service as everything from tutors to urban cleanup workers. By
broad consensus it works for both the kids and the communities.
</P>
<P>
   It also works because in setting it up, Segal had the sense to
reach out for maximum local inputs, local business support, and
Republican help. Americorps does not have the media cachet the
Peace Corps does, but in the areas it serves, its roots are very
deep. This is a classic example of a public-private partnership
that ends up being more than the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   And that is almost exactly the philosophy that Segal relied on
when Clinton tapped his buddy again four years ago to chair the
partnership created to make welfare to work more than just a name.
The results can't be summarized just by the numbers _ more than a
million hires within some 20,000 participating firms, plus some
50,000 hired by the federal government in an effort overseen by
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Just the sales job by Segal has been impressive. What is even
more impressive has been the way the partnership has changed both
the culture of business and the culture of poverty. The latest
report to Clinton from key CEOs involved in all this (representing
the likes of United Airlines, Marriott, and Sprint) reflects
important lessons. Among the most important is that the very idea
of risk associated with participation in this venture needs
reassessment in light of the higher retention rates exhibited by
most former welfare recipients getting their first real test of
real opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressive in the CEOs report is their understanding of
how much more needs to be done to make work pay, including
restoring funds cut from food stamp budgets and increasing
participation in Medicaid and child care programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the results so far are stunning. That these results were in
part the work of a guy who had just helped create another major
public-private partnership is even more stunning. Not a bad eight
years of work.

 UNDATED: ... did Stravinsky.''

   The new economics of the arts has enhanced the experience of
audiences and performers alike, says Ellen Highstein, director of
the Tanglewood Music Center. In the classical music realm, ``there
was the option of not paying attention to the rest of the world for
a long time.'' That is no longer the case. ``Organizations are
looking for new ways to present material'' to audiences made up of
people who may not all fully understand, say, ``a Mahler
symphony,'' she says, ``but all can appreciate it on different
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is to make people comfortable. That doesn't
mean playing easy-listening music or the equivalent thereof. By and
large, people are pretty smart and know when they're being pandered
to. The key is connecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting and ``contextualizing,'' says Ben Cameron, executive
director of the Theater Communications Group. Theatrical producers
now invite audiences to post-performance discussions, particularly
of new plays. ``Ten years ago,'' he says, ``a dramaturge would come
out and say `Here is how you should interpret this work; this is
the author's intent.' '' Today's audiences, who see theater as a
participatory and social experience, aren't interested, and ``arts
organizations are surrendering power,'' he says. ``Audiences are
taking their authority to interpret away.''
</P>
<P>
   Presenting work in contexts that draw nontraditional audiences
to the once elite arts is ``enriching the arts right now,'' says
Steve Maler, director of Commonwealth Shakespeare Company. People
who've never been exposed to Shakespeare are experiencing it, and
those who've only read it are ``seeing it as drama _ a public event
_ which is how it is meant to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on is quite the opposite of dumbing down.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does a surge of public enthusiasm for Puccini, Mozart, and
Verdi square with the contention that ``high culture'' is dumbing
down?
</P>
<P>
   --The US opera audience grew by nearly 25 percent between 1982
and 1992. According to Opera America, there are 114 professional
opera companies in the United States today. More than half of those
have been established since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   --The National Endowment for the Arts reports that in 1997, the
most recent year for which figures are available, nearly 5 percent
of the public saw at least one opera.
</P>
<P>
   --While many arts organizations are worried about the
``graying'' of their audiences, the median age of opera attenders
is dropping. Nearly one-third of the US opera audience is under the
age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   --The opera audience is racially and ethnically diverse. In
1997, minority group members were better represented in opera
audiences than in most arts and sports.
</P>
<P>
   --Opera is drawing people interested in both the old and the
new. Between 1990 and 2000 the number of North American works
produced by opera companies in the United States doubled.
</P>
<P>
   --Boston Lyric Opera is one of the fastest growing in its
league. In 1992, the Lyric counted 1,371 subscribers. In 1998, the
last year the company performed at the Emerson Majestic Theatre, it
sold 5,000 season subsciptions. Since it has moved to the Shubert
Theatre and expanded its program, the Lyric has grown again. In
late July, a spokeswoman said the organization had filled 7,038
orders for season tickets for the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Opera America attributes the success to the crossover influence
of pop culture: Broadway shows such as ``Tommy'' and ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' which have spurred interest in the art form;
audience outreach and accessibility, primarily through the use of
surtitles; and the fact that many operas tell big, visually
elaborate stories set to music _ in much the way that MTV does.

INNOCENCE 
By Jane Mendelsohn. Riverhead Books. 199 pp. $21.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As she more than confirmed with her best-selling 1996 novel, ``I
Was Amelia Earhart,'' Jane Mendelsohn knows a good myth when she
sees one. Combining a savvy intelligence with lyrical prose, she
recognized in the Earhart legend all the fertile ground that lies
between fable and history _ all the hopes and dreams and dark
what-ifs, enhanced by her own free-for-all imagination. This
shrewdness of judgment is not all that common in literary fiction,
where a certain loftiness of vision can preclude steelier insights
about democratic tastes. Mendelsohn has an appreciation for both:
She may love a finely wrought sentence for its own sake, but she
also understands why America might fall for the bedtime story
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   She grasps the allure of ``Carrie'' as well as ``Sister
Carrie,'' in other words, as ``Innocence'' testifies. It's a minor
but sophisticated little piece of Gothic Pop _ sinister, campy, as
sure of its intentions as Norman Bates. Borrowing classic
ingredients from the genres of horror films and popular literature,
Mendelsohn has concocted a coming-of-age tale about a Manhattan
girl's adolescence; this is a story of innocence, all right, but
that nebulous concept today means finding your way in a
media-saturated, sometimes dangerous culture. If Beckett Hirsch,
our desperate, likable protagonist, seems frozen somewhere between
``Revenge of the Vampire Sluts'' and ``Catcher in the Rye,'' that's
because the world she's grown up in is beholden to both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innocence'' began as a film treatment, and you can feel that
cinematic tilt from its opening scenes: shadowy fears and noir
angles and cross-cutting through time and space. (Mendelsohn is one
of the few people in America to have read the wonderfully titled
sleeper ``Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror
Film,'' and she acknowledges author Carol J. Clover for borrowing
the concept herein of the Final Girl _ the last heroine left
standing.) Having just moved to the Upper West Side from Long
Island with her father, Beckett is in some ways an archetypical
teenager: navigating her way through school cliques, encountering
the joys and terrors of sex, falling in love with a sweet kid named
Tobey. But the monster waiting in the wings is one who has already
taken vengeance: Beckett and her dad have moved back to Manhattan
because they just lost her mom to a drunk driver on the highway.
``Great heroines have dead mothers,'' she announces in the novel's
opening pages. ``That's what I told myself when she died.''
</P>
<P>
   That tone _ laconic and edgy and begrudgingly tragic _ suffuses
``Innocence,'' and makes the novel engaging in an eyebrow-cocked
kind of way. Watching Beckett's nightmares unfold, one feels
admiring but distant _ it's like watching a scary movie and
applauding its special effects instead of screaming over them. Dead
bodies appear in one of the first scenes of the novel; there are
also, fairly quickly, a rash of suicides, a demonic school nurse,
an untrustworthy shrink, and a dominatrix lurking in a basement
hallway. Beckett, marked as the Final Girl from the outset, is the
predator's mark _ a good girl by default, fighting evil and
banality and wicked witches everywhere she turns.
</P>
<P>
   But just how demented is this little Upper West Side universe?
Is Beckett really in peril, or are we seeing the unfolding of a
terrifying hallucination _ and thus listening to the ultimate
treacherous narrator, the voice of madness? Do the blood-stained
visions that Beckett shares with us belong to her own repressed
rage, a thirsty gang of uptown vampires, or the monthly mix of fear
and sexuality that every teenage girl can anticipate? So _
``Waiting for Menarche''! With its slippery descent into the world
of Eros and Thanatos, ``Innocence'' provides a simultaneous
allegory and sendup of such universal themes: It's an absurdist,
creepy entertainment cloaked in its own ironic commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the cheerful B-movie director, Mendelsohn tips her willing
audience to this device early on, when in English class Tobey is
introduced to the concept of the unreliable narrator. ``Oh,'' says
Tobey. ``So you mean like it's okay to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the teacher counsels the student; it's a literary technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' Tobey retorts, assuming position. ``I had sex with
every girl in this school.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the mouths of punks: Somehow this scene _ funny,
unpretentiously candid _ suggests the overall mood of
``Innocence,'' in spite of the shadowy milieu it assumes. The novel
is onto itself as well as the formulas it exposes, offering a
darkly appealing glance at popular culture and modern urban mayhem.
Like Jeffrey Eugenedies's ``The Virgin Suicides'' and Jay
McInerney's ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' Mendelsohn's story muffles
its death and sorrow in terminal irony, though the trait is less
irritating than it might be because ``Innocence'' doesn't try to be
more than it is. Following in the footsteps of all the Final Girls
who have gone before _ ``Persephone, Dorothy, Lolita,'' Beckett
tells us _ this heroine, too, tries to find her way back home. But
her yellow brick road is more redolent of subway tunnel than
flower-strewn path; in ``Innocence,'' there's nary a munchkin in
sight.

HISTORIAN AMBROSE RECREATES A NATION'S UNIFYING MOMENT

NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD 
The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869 
By Stephen E. Ambrose. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 416 pp. Illustrated. $28. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore D. Judah, the visionary who dreamed of building a
transcontinental railroad, called the notion ``the most magnificent
project ever conceived.'' The effort, said William Tecumseh
Sherman, would be ``a work of giants.'' The New York Tribune called
it ``the great absorbing fact of the West.'' And Stephen E. Ambrose
called it ``the greatest engineering achievement of the nineteenth
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The day the construction project ended, a telegram was sent to
President Grant: ``Sir: We have the honor to report that the last
rail is laid, the last spike is driven, the Pacific Railroad is
finished.'' Another went to the secretary of war: ``The great work,
commenced during the Administration of Lincoln, in the middle of a
great rebellion, is completed under that of Grant, who conquered
the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the railroad _ built by dreamers, financiers, surveyors,
engineers, construction crews, even politicians _ a
transcontinental trip took months. After the railroad, it took a
week. Before, it cost $1,000. After, $70.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose is no stranger to heroics; he is the leading biographer
of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the chronicler of Lewis and Clark, and the
poet laureate of the D-Day invaders. And in his latest volume,
``Nothing Like It in the World,'' he examines the heroics of
building the railroad, the symbol of the age.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad was a triumph of what you might think of as the six
essential elements of the American experience _ engineering,
technology, finance, natural resources, ingenuity, and audacity. It
was equal parts of all of them, and one thing more: It was a
metaphor. It bound the nation together, an iron belt that united
the country east and west after a war that had split it north
against south. It stood as a symbol of Americans' transcontinental
journey. It accelerated the movement of the machine into the domain
of nature. It was the last giant project accomplished predominantly
by muscle and sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to winning the Civil War and abolishing slavery, building
the first transcontinental railroad, from Omaha, Nebraska, to
Sacramento, California, was the greatest achievement of the
American people in the 19th century,'' Ambrose writes. Together,
the process of constructing the railroad and then the actual
running of the railroad transformed the country, shrinking
distances, creating new markets, opening up new areas to
settlement, even (because the railroad couldn't operate with a
patchwork of nonstandardized time) regularizing clocks across the
country and creating time zones.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad crossed miles of untouched territory, but the story
of the railroad is itself not exactly virgin territory; just last
autumn, for example, Viking published David Howard Bain's ``Empire
Express,'' which, at 797 pages, left few boulders unturned. That
said, this is a book with a difference. Its focus is on the men
(there were few women) who built the trestles, hammered the spikes,
blasted the tunnels, and constructed sheds that covered almost 50
miles of track and protected it from the snow. Almost nothing about
this story is on a human scale, and yet it was performed by humans
with superhuman endurance and all-too-human weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To build a railroad it would take real men, dedicated men,
adventurous men, men of muscle and brain power, men without
equal,'' Ambrose writes. ``They must be giants to build it without
steam shovels, pile drivers, or power saws, without pipes with
water running through them, without portable houses and hospitals,
with no internal-combustion-engine trucks and jeeps to move
materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroad caused change to sweep across the country like a
vast, irresistible storm. Omaha doubled in size in the year 1865
alone. The wilderness was tamed, or at least subdued. New
communities sprang up. New fortunes were made. Old fortunes were
lost. New tensions were created. Old tensions were muted. ``The
tame,'' as Ambrose put it, replaced ``the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a permanent change, wrought by a work force that had no
equal, mostly because it was organized along military lines; many
of the laborers who worked at the rate of three strikes of a
sledgehammer per spike and 10 spikes to a rail were veterans of the
Civil War. ``It was the best organized, best equipped, and best
disciplined work force I have ever seen,'' wrote Grenville Dodge, a
prominent general who helped direct the construction project. ``I
used it several times as a fighting force and it took no longer to
put it into fighting line than it did to form it for daily work.''
</P>
<P>
   Accidents were common. The men fought exhaustion, fires,
thieves, and Indians. Mostly they fought storms; there were 44 of
them in the winter of 1866-67 alone. They crossed mountains and
forded streams. One bridge was 126 feet above a streambed and 700
feet long. It swayed in the wind. But it held.
</P>
<P>
   This was a triumph, too, of the surveyor's art. Ambrose reports
that about a century later, when modern surveyors, traveling by air
and equipped with sophisticated technology, set out to find a route
for Interstate 80, they chose almost the exact route the railroad
surveyors had; the original tracks are often visible from your car
window as you speed along I-80.
</P>
<P>
   This was a great construction project, but it also was a great
race _ the Union Pacific against the Central Pacific. In truth, it
was the country that was racing _ across the continent, against
nature, against the notion that man's dreams should have limits.
When the Golden Spike was hammered into the last tie, the country
changed more than its principal mode of transportation. It changed
the way it thought.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of distance had been conquered, the danger of
transcontinental travel removed, the sovereignty of nature
compromised, the idea of the West changed. Westward movement became
attainable for ordinary Americans, and their destination became
vulnerable to mass culture and mass settlement. By the 1890s, the
Census Bureau would declare the frontier had disappeared. The
railroad was one cause. But in eliminating the frontier it also
created new possibilities.

`MAD MOVIES' SERIES HAS FUN WITH CLASSIC FILMS

   VIDEO ANTICS: There's nobody better to watch a movie with than
Kent Skov, an improv artist with the L.A. Connection. For years,
Skov and his band of merry men and women have performed live
talk-along bits at movie theaters. They'd sit in the front row
uttering inspired, improvisational dialogue and injecting
preplanned special effects, creating a unique movie experience. The
shows eventually evolved into a syndicated television program that
ran for years on various networks, including A &AMP; E and Comedy
Central. ``Mad Movies With the L.A. Connection'' hammers feature
films into a half-hour format with the wisecracks and newly dubbed
dialogue adding outrageous fun to such classics as Jose Ferrer's
``Cyrano de Bergerac.'' Skov is hoping that his success in theaters
and television will lead to success in the video marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying this as an experiment,'' he says of his plan to
offer fans 130 shows on VHS on a subscription basis. ``We're going
to release a new tape every two weeks for five years. A full
subscription costs about $400.''
</P>
<P>
   Skov realizes that might be a little pricey for people who can't
afford the entire plan, so they're developing reasonable
alternatives, including the possibility of offering each tape for
$15. Since it costs approximately $30,000 per episode to produce,
and Skov and his group are producing the first tape next month,
they need a solid subscriber base to bankroll their ambitious
efforts. You can check out their Web sites at

also said that they saw no signs of danger. They never saw him as a
potential killer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Saturday morning, Cote shot three people in three
different locations in less than 20 minutes. He finally turned a
gun on himself. Cote, 29, and his three victims all died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea what caused him to snap,'' said Cote's
mother, Rachael Cote. ``He knew right from wrong. He knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The first vicitm was Brian Miller, 30, Cote's upstairs neighbor,
with whom he was reportedly friendly. The two had purchased their
guns together and practiced together at a shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   Cote's second victim was Jamie Quinones, 38, reportedly his
former wife's boyfriend. Quinones, a firefighter, was collecting
money for charity when he was gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Cote killed Maria Hernandez, 39, his former
girlfriend's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cote spared his former girlfriend, Maria Perez, and her
children. Before releasing Perez, he told her he had killed her
mother ``to take away from her what she loved the most,'' said
Perez's brother, Marcelo Hidalgo, 22.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking his own life, Cote called his mother at work to
say goodbye. ``I'm sorry for what I did,'' Rachael Cote said her
son told her. ``I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to live.''
Then he hung up.
</P>
<P>
   The killing spree was a blow to Waterbury, an old indstrial city
of about 120,000. The blue-collar community, known as the ``Brass
City'' from its manufacturing days, has seen a spate of violence
this week. There were three shootings unrelated to Cote's Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cote's troubles began in the mid-1990s with his failed marriage,
which lasted for about a year and a half, Rachael Cote said. She
said his wife revealed that she had been having an affair when Cote
caught her with Quinones.
</P>
<P>
   Cote immediately filed for divorce, but his mother says his
former wife and Quinones spent years trying to make his life
miserable. They obtained restraining orders against him, then
haunted him by idling in a car outside his house, eating often in a
restaurant where his mother worked, Rachael Cote said. Quinones
came by the appartment the mother and son shared as recently as
Thursday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cote's former wife could not be reached Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cote had spoken of his desire to kill Quinones, said a friend,
Juan Nazario.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple of years, he said he was going to do it,''
Nazario said. But, he added, ``I didn't see it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazario insisted Cote was distressed but not mentally unstable.
``He was a beautiful person,'' Nazario said. ``He was my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Cote had dated Perez for about a year before they broke up
amicably, Rachael Cote said. But Hidalgo said Cote was jealous and
temperamental and had struck Perez before she decided to leave him,
just days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all liked him in the beginning,`` Hidalgo said. ``He was a
nice guy. I guess he couldn't handle breakups.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo said that a day or two before the shootings he saw Cote
in a parked car, watching the house where Perez lived with her
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had it planned already,'' Hidalgo said. ``He knew what he
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hidalgo said he believed Cote was plotting violence,
Rachael Cote said her son's behavior was normal as late as Saturday
morning, when he kissed his grandmother goodbye on his way out the
door. She said he had a pleasant phone conversation with Perez that
morning and planned to take her shopping for her childrens' school
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quinones I understand, although I don't condone,'' Rachael
Cote said. ``If I live to be a million years old, I will never
understand Brian and Maria's mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Cote and Miller were friendly, the mother said, although they
had normal neighborly disputes.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:50 Saturday morning, Cote shot his neighbor while
Miller was seated in his red Honda. He then pulled Miller from the
car and shot him again, before taking off in the Honda, according
to police.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Cote found Quinones collecting donations
for a ``fill the boot'' campaign for muscular dystrophy. He shot
the firefighter several times and took off again, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen minutes after that, police got a 911 call from Perez's
address, but the caller hung up. When the dispatcher called back, a
man answered and said everything was OK and hung up. When the
dispatcher called a second time, Perez answered the phone in
hysterics.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hidalgo, Cote had shot Hernandez as soon as he
walked into the house. Then he spoke briefly to Perez on the second
floor before allowing her to leave. While police were surrounding
the house, they heard a shot. After they entered, they found Cote
dead with two semiautomatic weapons, according to a police
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said Hernandez was a loving, motherly figure with
three children, four grandchildren, and five stepchildren. She had
also raised four other children, who were the offspring of
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't deserve to die like that; she deserved to die
old,'' said Ronnie Quintero, 17, who said Hernandez raised him
since he was a toddler. ``She was hoping to see all of our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinones was a dedicated firefighter, a six-year veteran of the
Fire Department who also served in the Marines for 11 years, said
the acting fire chief, James Trainor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very respectful and had a good military bearing.''
Trainor said. ``He was quiet. Just a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Miller could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Some Waterbury residents said they were shaken by the death.
``It's very sad to lose a firefighter who's out collecting charity,
because some loser decides to start killing people,'' said Alisha
Weinstein, a teacher who lives in the neighborhood where Quinones
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Rachael Cote said her son was happy at his job with a lab
company, where he took blood samples for people, often for drug
tests. She blamed what he did on his stress over the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it just ate away at him,'' she said.

RAISING PESSIMISM'S PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANTE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one who goes through life expecting the worst, I was
interested to read about a symposium titled the ``The Overlooked
Virtues of Negativity,'' which took place recently during the
annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in
Washington. It's about time somebody got positive about being
negative.
</P>
<P>
   For years I've been collecting notes for a book titled ``The
Power of Negative Thinking,'' but I can't seem to write it because
I keep telling myself that I'll never be able to get it published.
Reading about this symposium gave me new hope for the project, or
if maybe not hope, exactly, then a slightly more realistic view of
my prospects. Although maybe the word ``realistic'' is putting it
too strongly.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the problems with negative thinking. You're always
second-guessing yourself. Not that there's anything wrong with
that. In fact, there's a lot that's right about being negative,
according to some of the psychologists who participated in the
symposium. Actually, ``a lot'' may be overstating the case. But
it's probably fair to say that being negative isn't necessarily a
bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times report on the event quoted Barbara Held, a
clinical psychologist at Bowdoin College, as saying that her
profession, indeed America as a whole, has succumbed to the
``tyranny of the positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Held is the author of ``Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching,'' a
defense of creative complaining, in which she contends that
kvetching helps people see their problems more realistically. She
writes that we are all under enormous pressure from therapists,
self-help gurus, ``inspirational'' speakers, and others to be
happy, or worse, to act happy, even when we're not. This is very
stressful, according to Held, because life is hard, and it's harder
when we feel we have to deny just how hard it is.
</P>
<P>
   Held makes the point that being a pessimist doesn't mean walking
around in a state of perpetual gloom. ``Just because I hate life
doesn't mean I can't have fun,'' she writes. That could be the
pessimist's creed.
</P>
<P>
   One of those exerting the pressure to be happy is Martin
Seligman, former president of the American Psychological
Association, a leading light in what's known as the positive
psychology movement, and author of the popular book ``Learned
Optimism.'' Seligman believes that pessimists get the short end of
life's stick. He claims they don't do as well as optimists in
school, at work, in sports. They don't age as well as optimists.
They don't live as long. If it's true that pessimists die younger,
and I'm not convinced that it is, I suspect it's because optimists
wear us down, always telling us, ``Don't worry, be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Seligman believes pessimists can learn to be optimists by using
certain cognitive therapy techniques in his book. But why would a
pessimist bother to try to be an optimist? A true pessimist knows
you can't fool your brain into believing something that obviously
isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   The Times story described a coping strategy called ``defensive
pessimism,'' in which people anticipate all the possible outcomes
of a given situation, dwelling on everything that could go wrong.
Research has shown that those who approach life with this attitude
are prepared for anything, and are as likely to perform tasks as
well as optimists. All of which would be very encouraging, if I
believed it.

TAKING HEART IN SEOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ There is an unwritten code among reporters that we
should remain detached from the events and people we write about.
Objectivity is the name of the game, so we are careful not to
reveal our political or moral leanings, not to clap or boo during
impassioned speeches, not to cry or get angry over tragedies and
injustices that outrage us.
</P>
<P>
   We are weaned in a professional culture that tells us to be
tough, unflappable, and unmoved in the face of strong emotion _
partly to ensure fairness in our reports, and partly to protect
ourselves from being overwhelmed by what we experience.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes that doesn't work. This month, I cried on the job
for the first time in my decade as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   There were ample opportunities before. When I was a Boston
police reporter, I sympathetically stroked the arms of a number of
mothers who lost children to gang violence. In Chile and Indonesia,
I watched millions dance in the streets to celebrate the ouster of
military dictators and the birth of democracy. In Bosnia and East
Timor, I visited miserable refugee camps, counting rows of diseased
and dying, soothing women who had been raped and children who were
orphaned. Like my colleagues, I chronicled their grief, but kept my
own sadness to myself, knowing I had seen this before and would see
it again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing had prepared me for the half-century's worth of
agony, longing, and tears that flowed when 200 Korean families,
long divided by war, were reunited briefly this month in Seoul and
Pyongyang. These were not the pathetic and emaciated victims of war
we have come to expect. They were doctors and professors, writers
and laborers, common people like us who had the bad fortune to be
born at the wrong time in the history of their country.
</P>
<P>
   I watched as 100 aged Northerners walked with wobbly feet and
hopeful faces into a Seoul convention center to greet their
long-lost loved ones _ people they hadn't dared to dream were still
alive. I listened as the room rang with cries of ``My son!'' ``Oh,
how I've missed you!'' and ``Dear, I've come home'' _ cries that
laid bare 100 personal tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1945, Korea was divided into the Soviet-backed North
and the US-backed South. The North attacked in 1950 to force
reunification, but the conflict ended in permanent division. Phone
calls, letters, and travel were (and still are) forbidden, so
families whose loved ones vanished in the war spent their lives not
knowing whether the missing had died, or were alive in a place
beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
   I watched as 90-year-old mothers tried to climb out of their
wheelchairs to embrace 70-year-old sons; as husbands tried to
comfort wives who had waited all their lives and never remarried.
</P>
<P>
   The families hugged for minutes, patting each others' backs to
see if they were really there, clutching one another tightly as if
they would never let go. As I thought of my own parents, and how
lucky I am to be separated from them only by a long-distance
telephone call, I struggled not to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us who have grown up in the late 20th century in an
affluent democracy can imagine starving from famine, being
imprisoned for our religion, or being hacked to death in an ethnic
war. But all of us have parents and siblings, partners or children
from whom we cannot imagine being separated.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, I watched Korean families come together for
all-too-brief meetings, holding last rites for parents who didn't
live to see this day, sharing stories and photos and sentimental
gifts. I watched elderly mothers spoonfeed grown sons who had
vanished when they were still boys.
</P>
<P>
   I imagined the guilt that must have haunted the woman who
brought shoes to her now-grown son, whose small bare feet had been
cold in those final minutes before they were separated as they
tried to flee war-torn Pyongyang 50 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day, I weaved through the crowd, catching snippets
of desperate farewells as relatives were forced to part, probably
forever. Tears flowing, North Koreans pressed trembling hands to
the glass of the buses that would whisk them away. Shoulders
heaving, they mouthed kisses and last wishes. One man traced the
character for mother on the window again and again.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the parking lot of a luxury hotel in Seoul
seemed a sadder place than any refugee camp I had ever seen. Hong
Kil Soon, an 87-year-old woman whom I had shadowed that week,
watched her eldest daughter, now 67, sob and wave from the back of
the bus until it pulled out of sight. I am sure that Hong saw Kim
Ok Bae not as the aging woman she is now, but as the teenager who
disappeared from her school one day during the war.
</P>
<P>
   When the bus vanished, Hong turned to me and took me in her
arms, and I cried as inconsolably as she did, my body shaking as if
a member of my own family had disappeared into a black hole, never
to be heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 million members of separated Korean families, one
in seven citizens of the divided peninsula. In the south alone,
there are 1.23 million first-generation members of divided
families, and if only 100 Northerners visit each month, it would
take 1,000 years for everyone to meet.
</P>
<P>
   But after witnessing the heartbreak of these families along with
millions of Koreans who watched their televisions spellbound, it is
hard to believe it will take that long. Since the landmark leaders'
summit in June, every week has brought a surprising new
breakthrough. As in the former divided Germany, people-to-people
contacts seem the surest road to mutual trust, and emotion seems
more likely than negotiation to tear down the last Cold War
barrier.

RELISHING THE LANDSCAPE OF AGATHA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't resist encyclopedias, so naturally I took the advance
uncorrected proofs of Matthew Bunson's ``The Complete Christie: An
Agatha Christie Encyclopedia'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster/Pocket Books, $35
hard cover, $18.95 paper) off with me when I traveled down from
Oxford to Devon and Cornwall this month to visit the Burgh Island
Hotel, an art deco oddity where Christie wrote (and, it is said,
set) two of her mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Christie tourism is booming, with Torquay, where she grew up,
promoting an Agatha Christie Mile and Torre Abbey providing a
chance to look at her typewriter. I reread ``And Then There Were
None'' (first published in London under an appallingly racist
title, though yet other editions come out as ``Ten Little
Indians'') and thought it still held up as one of her three or four
best books, and I trawled through the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   It's full of interesting stuff, including summaries of all
Christie's books, short stories, film and television adaptations,
and plays, and, above all, a list of all the characters who walk in
and off Christie's stages. There is a good bit of Who Cares?
information _ how many Christie novels featured a butler _ and
Bunson doesn't provide much by way of critical judgment, but there
is plenty here to entertain during the dog days of summer, out on
the lawn in England, thankfully almost free of annoying insects.
</P>
<P>
   I have a similar affection for the work of Sarah Caudwell, from
whom, alas, there will be no more, as she died in January. Happily
her fourth mystery novel, ``The Sibyl in the Grave'' (Delacorte,
$23.95) was virtually finished, and also happily, it is her best
book. Caudwell invented an Oxford don, Hilary Tamar, whose gender
the reader is unable to determine; Tamar is Tutor in Legal History
at St. George's College, Oxford, and is mentor to four clever,
irritating, and trouble-prone young barristers. The plot here is
complex yet clear, and it is all about huge and perhaps improper
returns on short-term investments in the village of Parson's Haver.
These days, in England, one risks rebuke if one refers to a person,
book, or landscape as ``very English,'' since the English seem
quite confused about who they are. But I will stick by an earlier
remark: Caudwell's novels are very English and quite wonderful and
how very sad that this is the end.
</P>
<P>
   The last of my Devon days books was ``The Waters of Babylon,''
subtitled ``A Novel about Lawrence after Arabia'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $24), by David Stevens. I had high expectations, for the
dust jacket tells us that Stevens wrote the screenplay for
``Breaker Morant,'' but I guess writing a novel is not the same
thing, as the prose is stiff, flatly descriptive, and in fact reads
very much like stage directions. Still, a good intelligence is at
work here, and this novelized version of what we know or might
reasonably guess about Lawrence after he takes the name T. E. Shaw
is intermittently interesting and provides a plausible solution to
a mystery or two.
</P>
<P>
   Devon and Cornwall do tend to Anglophilia, and after a year here
in England, now ready to return to the States, I wanted to end my
summer languors with some gritty American noir. Stephen Hunter's
``Hot Springs'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) provides a homecoming with
bite: Set in Arkansas in summer 1946, the book tells of Earl
Swagger, a tough lawman in Polk County, a center of prostitution,
organized gangs, and plenty of racism. This is not an America one
would want to visit, much less live in, and yet people did and do,
and Hunter's account of what history calls the GI Revolt is terse,
convincing, and just right for reentry into the American
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   David Compton provides for the final stage to this reader's
reentry. ``Impaired Judgment'' (Dutton, $24.95) is about conspiracy
in high places, as was Compton's previous book: Paula Candler is a
federal judge in Virginia; she is also the nation's first lady and
_ surprise _ there is a shocking secret in her past. She is to
preside over the trial of a reputed member of the Mafia, whose
defense lawyer decides can best be defended by blackmailing
Candler.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds quite a bit contrived, and it is, but then so was
``And Then There Were None.'' And as Christie made her formula work
brilliantly, so too does Compton. This is the ultimate
end-of-summer book, and it sets just the right tone for the
upcoming election campaign. All that Christie and Caudwell share
with Hunter and Compton is the use of the English language, but
that's enough this time of year, in either country.

   RELUCTANT UNDERWEAR SHOPPER FINDS A METHOD THAT CLICKS
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-BUYING-UNDERWEAR-ONLINE _ Sara Lee, the underwear and
hosiery manufacturer that makes Hanes, Bali, Playtex, Wonderbra and
other well-known brands, reports that online sales have tripled in
the last year. Victoria's Secret's Web site, which debuted in
December 1998, has attracted buyers from 137 countries. The
company's first online fashion show, advertised just once, during
the Super Bowl in 1999, got so much traffic that the servers broke.
Clearly, underwear and hosiery are a booming business on the Web.

THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nonliterary fiction. Beach books. Page-turners. Whatever you
call them, these books are mainstays of bestseller lists. They can
be romances, or thrillers, or historical fiction. Some defy
categorization. Some even defy rational description. And some are
trash. (It's probably belaboring the obvious to note that the word
``trash'' isn't necessarily a perjorative when it comes to popular
fiction.)
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, a page-turner has a diverting story and interesting
characters. The writing shouldn't make you wince too often. And the
plot shouldn't require you to think a lot. It's the sort of book
you can read while keeping one eye on the kids, or eating a
solitary lunch, or riding the T, or listening to the Red Sox game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vineyard'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) is a portrait of family
pathology, thwarted passion, and life-changing love that seems
worthy of a TV miniseries. Even the title is made-to-order.
Asquonset, near the Rhode Island shore, is a successful
wine-producing operation presided over by 76-year-old Natalie
Seebring, who might be described as a strong-willed matriarch, but
isn't, to author Barbara Delinsky's credit.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie's grown children are shocked when, barely three months
after the death of her husband of 58 years, she announces plans to
marry an old friend, longtime vineyard manager Carl Burke. Natalie
has another surprise for the kids: She's writing her memoirs.
Angst-ridden single mother Olivia Jones, a Cambridge
writer/photographer, signs on to help with the project. Olivia and
her dyslexic 10-year-old daughter, Tess, come to live at Asquonset
for the summer. Olivia draws out Natalie's secrets, while
attempting to understand the Seebring family's complicated
resentments. She also finds herself feeling faint stirrings for
Simon Burke, Carl's attractively brooding son, the vineyard's
current manager, ``the kind of man she had spent a lifetime
fantasizing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky is the author of 60 novels, many of them bestsellers.
She is a straightforward storyteller whose prose neatly
accommodates plot and research (she has done her grape-growing
homework). And she has a deft way with a sex scene, not an easy
skill to master.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many women novelists, Rosamunde Pilcher has been tagged
``a Jane Austen for our time.'' The praise is doubtless well-meant,
but it is unfair to both writers. Pilcher's novels are fine on
their own terms, but Jane Austen she's not. She lacks, among other
things, Austen's sharp wit, although she has a dry sense of humor
that suits her understated style. ``The owner stood behind the bar,
and did not appear to be enjoying his job,'' she writes, describing
an austere pub in a bleak Scottish town. ``Around the place were
small round tables and uninviting chairs, and in a tiny fireplace a
peat-fire smouldered. Over the fireplace an enormous fish, with
cold eyes, hovered in its glass case, and all smelt of old beer and
whisky.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Pilcher is skillful at evoking place and atmosphere,
but her chief strength is her ability to create believably complex
characters, with recognizably human flaws and frailties. ``Winter
Solstice'' (St. Martin's, $27.95) is a big, comfortable novel that
you can sink right into. At its heart is a story of two people in
their mid-60s, wounded by separate tragedies. When the man she
loves dies of Parkinson's disease, Elfrida Phipps, a raffish
retired actress, leaves London and settles in a country village.
There she makes friends with Oscar and Gloria Blundell and their
12-year-old daughter, Francesca. Elfrida warms immediately to
Oscar, a retired choirmaster and organist who seems oddly matched
with the horsey, heavy-drinking Gloria. After Gloria and Francesca
are conveniently killed in an auto accident, Elfrida agrees to
accompany the grieving Oscar to Creagan, a town in northern
Scotland, where he owns a house. Pilcher's prose proceeds at a
leisurely pace as the plot expands to include three younger
characters, each in the throes of separate life-altering crises.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Steel's latest, ``The House on Hope Street''
(Delacorte, $19.95), is a two-hanky tear-jerker that shot to the
top of bestseller lists as soon as it was released. Her novels _
this is number 49 _ may be short, cliched, and formulaic, but with
420 million copies in print, Steel clearly is giving her readers
what they want. She dishes it up once again in this
write-by-the-numbers story about another strong yet vulnerable
woman coping with life's vicissitudes. Young lawyer Liz Sutherland
(``with her bright red hair and flashing green eyes'') struggles to
carry on after her husband and law partner, Jack, is murdered, and
on Christmas Day no less. There's the law practice to maintain and
five children to rear, the youngest of whom, Jamie, is
``learning-delayed'' and yearning to train for the Special
Olympics. When Liz's oldest child, Peter, is injured in a diving
accident, Dr. Bill Webster enters Liz's life (``He was tall, and
his dark eyes looked grim, but the gray at his temples made her
want to believe that he knew what he was doing''). Naturally he
knows exactly what he's doing, and Steel knows exactly what she's
doing too. Does she ever.
</P>
<P>
   Take a likable young priest who's battling cancer, his beautiful
sister, his FBI agent best friend, toss in one homicidal psychopath
and you have the main elements of ``Heartbreaker'' (Pocket Books,
$24.95), Julie Garwood's first foray into the thriller genre.
Garwood can't write to save her life, but her many fans apparently
couldn't care less. She's made a huge name as a writer of romantic
fiction, and it shows. ``Lordy, lordy, he had blue eyes. Brilliant
blue eyes that didn't miss a trick,'' muses Laurant Madden on first
meeting her brother's federal agent friend Nick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Father Tom Madden, whose ``boyish good looks had earned him the
amusing nickname `Father-What-a-Waste' from all the high school and
college girls,'' hears the confession of a nut who says he has
killed one woman and plans to kill Father Tom's sister. The priest
calls in his old friend Nick to keep an eye on Laurant, and he
does, in more ways than one. He tries to keep a professional
distance, but he can't help noticing, ``those incredible long legs,
the soft swell of her breasts under the thin fabric, her beautiful
neck, her flushed cheeks, and that perfect mouth of hers.'' One
thing inevitably leads to another. Garwood knows how to move a plot
in unexpected directions, but her writing is stiff and
cliche-ridden, with too many rough edges. Basically, this is a
romance/thriller as opposed to a thriller/romance. If you're not
too particular about your prose, and you're looking for a
fast-paced story that won't tax your brain, ``Heartbreaker'' could
be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Rivers Siddons's ``Nora, Nora'' (HarperCollins, $25) is a
charmer, set in Lytton, a small town near Atlanta, in 1961. Peyton
McKenzie is 12, an awkward girl haunted by guilt because her mother
bled to death shortly after giving birth to her. She lives in a big
house with her emotionally distant father, Frazier, and the
family's longtime housekeeper, Clothilde. Peyton's only friends are
the two fellow misfit members of The Losers Club, who meet every
afternoon to decide which of them did the dumbest thing during the
course of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton's dispiriting existence gets a jolt of energy when her
cousin Nora Findlay drives up from Key West in her pink
Thunderbird. Nora is 30-ish, red-haired, freckled, sexy. She
smokes, drinks, and wears makeup. She assures Peyton, ``There is a
world beyond Lytton Grammar School, and it's a hell of a lot more
interesting.'' Everything about Nora shocks Lytton's conservative,
small-town sensibilities, but especially her liberal views on race.
She signs on as a substitute teacher and arranges an honors English
class that mixes students from the black and the white high
schools. She takes Peyton to a sit-in in Atlanta, and to Sunday
services at Saint John's African Methodist Episcopal Church. But
when Peyton discovers the cousin she idolizes is flawed, she's
forced to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Siddons, a perennial fixture on bestseller lists, has created
some wonderfully original characters. She also does a fine job of
portraying the strained social climate of a small Southern town at
the beginning of the civil rights movement. Occasionally her
writing is just a little too self-consciously beguiling (``A wind
from somewhere far off brushed her heart.''), but it never detracts
from the essential humanity of her storytelling.

 By LISA NAPOLI  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>

<P>
   I don't know about you, but I don't like to think much about
underwear. I always find it disturbing when people said you had to
have nice underthings on in case you were hit by a bus and had to
be taken to the hospital, where an utter stranger might witness
your tattered skivvies.
</P>
<P>
   Call me crazy, but what I was wearing, should I need to be
carried somewhere on a stretcher, seemed low on the list of Things
to Lose Sleep Over.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as I grew up, I learned there were other reasons that
would make a woman attend to her underlayer. But even they haven't
made lingerie one of my raisons d'etre. Heck, I'm not even into
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is why, for me, the idea of buying underwear online _
buying anything online, really _ is so appealing. I can do it when
I want without going out of my way, I can do it fast and I feel as
if I'm getting a present in the mail as a bonus for my trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that I'm not alone. The grande dame of underwear
and hosiery manufacturers, Sara Lee, which makes Hanes, Bali,
Playtex, Wonderbra and other well-known brands, reports that online
sales have tripled in the last year. And it sells only irregulars
and discontinued styles on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that the intimate-apparel shoppers of the
world are flocking to Web sites in such numbers that the lingerie
clerks at the department stores are standing around like Maytag
repairmen.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rachel Strasser, the vice president for business
development at the Web business Figleaves.com, is banking that some
day soon, they will be.
</P>
<P>
   Figleaves.com, which opened in March, is all about what the
apparel industry calls ``essential wear'' _ a niche Strasser said
she and her colleagues focused on after first considering a broader
plan to get into the online apparel business.
</P>
<P>
   She ticked off a list of reasons she contended had made
underwear and hosiery a workable business on the Web: ``You can't
try packaged underwear on in the stores, anyway. People often know
what size they wear. The only way to reorder is to go to the
department store. Upscale brands are primarily sold in department
stores, but they don't have as extensive a selection because square
footage is limited on the selling floor _ both from a style and
size perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short time that Figleaves.com's virtual doors have been
open, Strasser added, she has discovered another benefit to the
medium: it attracts men. While women buy 75 percent of the
underwear sold over the counter, online shoppers at her site are,
so far, evenly divided between the sexes, according to her analysis
of credit card transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Not all online underwear shoppers, though, are after hassle-free
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   For Christine Butler, the Web is a lifeline to her favorite
underwear store. When her family was relocated to London from
Chicago, she was worried about losing access to Victoria's Secret.
The company, based in Columbus, Ohio, has 900 stores in the United
States, but does not have any abroad, nor does it plan to open any.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, have a Web site, which has been open for
business since December 1998. Since then, the site has attracted
buyers from 137 countries, said Anne Marie Blaire, the director of
Internet brand development for Intimate Brands, Victoria's Secret's
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret executives are also aware that their catalogs
are famous as entertainment as well as sources of information, and
they are trying to capitalize on that success online. Last month,
the company held its second online fashion show, a live video
recording from Cannes, France, during which viewers could click on
a model's garment and place it in a virtual shopping cart. The
first show, advertised just once, during the Super Bowl in 1999,
got so much traffic that the servers broke, a gaffe that the
company saw as a sign of success.
</P>
<P>
   Video specials are one way Intimate Brands intends to use the
Victoria's Secret site. Visitors to the site can sign up for
memberships, which entitle them to announcements by e-mail
messages. There is also an interactive bra finder, which allows
buyers to specify a particular bra need (for example, strapless)
and find a product to match it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun for the customer,'' Blaire said, adding that it was
also an easy way to indulge in a guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the ultimate pick-me-up for a girl?'' she asked. ``It's
lingerie or a lipstick. It makes you feel pampered and indulged.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the expatriate Victoria's Secret shopper, had a baby
recently, and wanted to treat herself to ``some pretty p.j.'s and
lingerie,'' she said. Without the Web site, she would have had her
sisters send her catalogs, place her orders and then bring the
goods on their next visit. This way, she skips those steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great way to get the things I liked without the
hassle,'' she said in an e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   Even a lingerie Luddite like me knows that Victoria's Secret is
not for everyone. Susan, my friend and lingerie adviser, who
declined to be identified by her last name, emphasized this as we
discussed bras and panties on the phone from our workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Susan wax rhapsodic about underwear is enough to make
even a colorless plain-cotton gal want to rush out and expand her
collection.
</P>
<P>
   But would Susan buy this stuff online? She ruminated over this
serious question as we both called up Figleaves.com, a site she had
not seen yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a bra shopper, I generally buy the same stuff over and
over,'' she said. ``It's a little nerve-racking, but I guess you
could do it'' online, she added. ``But I don't think most women
would feel comfortable buying a new brand online. Bras are so
individual. I kind of like to touch them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the online purchases didn't fit, she reasoned, she could send
them back. But then she remembered merchandise she had bought from
a catalog months ago, which had been sitting under her desk,
waiting to be returned.
</P>
<P>
   She confessed, however, that despite her misgivings about online
clothes shopping, she liked the look of Figleaves.com, as well as
the brands it offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still don't know what they feel like,'' she said. ``Oh,
DKNY. Let's go see that.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand name lured Susan, as Strasser had hoped. Susan was
particularly enamored of an underwire bra that could be converted
to strapless. ``It's hard to find a good strapless bra,'' she said.
But she worried about size.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out that Figleaves.com offered customer service online
with the click of a mouse. Seconds later, a representative who
called herself Eve responded vaguely to Susan's query about what
size DKNY bra she might need.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her skepticism, Susan found her mind filled with
possibilities. ``I could see how you could get addicted,'' she
said. ``If I buy a new bra and panties, I feel so much better. It's
like buying new barrettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, I bought the strapless bra and matching panties for
myself _ in case a bus did make unwanted contact with my body, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   They turned out to be so nice that I'm thinking of having a new
set shipped every three months.

flash across the screen, and no one is trying to sell, buy, trade
or solicit. ``This is a nonprofit organization,'' said Jeffry Blake
Johnson, the church's associate director of music and its Internet
coordinator. ``We're in the business of providing community, and
not in the business of making money. Everything we do, we lose
money. Why should the Web site be any different?''
</P>
<P>
   While almost everyone is trying to figure out how to make money
on the Web, most congregations remain commercial-free zones. But
that does not mean they are not thinking about e-commerce. The
challenge for religious organizations is incorporating e-commerce
into their primary missions and making it consistent with their
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of, `How are we going to steer our way around
commerce?''' said Edward J. Murray, the president of the National
Interfaith Cable Coalition, which will soon introduce a virtual
network called Faithandvaluesmedia.org. ``The answer is, we won't.
We'll be there to offer people what they need to carry out their
missions. But whatever commerce we'll do, it will be related to our
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray noted that his group, like its constituent church groups,
was a nonprofit corporation. But ``that doesn't require you to lose
money,'' he said. ``We'll operate within the not-for-profit
boundaries; any margin will go back into our ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some churches and religious organizations are cautiously
experimenting with a limited amount of e-commerce, like the sale of
religious books and gifts. But deciding what fits and what does not
is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone would agree that selling Bibles fits. But what
about best sellers like ``Chicken Soup for the Teen-age Soul'' or
New Age music? Kosher and hallal foods? Acupuncture and reflexology
treatments? Funerals? Then there is the highly profitable area of
spiritual and religious travel _ trips to the Holy Land and Rome,
as well as to Lourdes, the Ganges River and Tibet. Do these fit?
Should they be priced for profit or for maximum dissemination?
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it all together and we're talking about a $40 billion
market,'' said Robert Nylen, a co-founder and co-chairman of
Beliefnet.com, a commercial Internet business that offers an online
spiritual community for prayer and knowledge against a backdrop of
advertisements. Beliefnet will soon introduce Web Start, a template
for congregations to create sites linked to Beliefnet and its
commercial ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The number of congregations with Web sites is unknown, but it is
clearly growing. Tens of thousands of churches have them, with
Roman Catholics leading the way. Of the 189 dioceses in the United
States (each with dozens or hundreds of churches), 82 percent are
on the Internet. Of the 11,000 congregations in the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, about 2,000 are on the Web. Of the 800
Conservative Jewish congregations, roughly half are online.
</P>
<P>
   One church that has taken the plunge into e-commerce is Grace
Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco. At www.gracecathedral.org,
users find an archive of sermons and inspirational columns and
features. There is also a virtual tour of the Gothic cathedral and
a church bulletin, Gracenotes. But the home page included an icon _
computer, not religious _ with prayerful hands that said, ``Support
Grace Online by Shopping at Amazon.com.'' The church receives a
commission for sales made through the site.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Gracecathedral.org can also join the church online
(credit cards accepted) and shop at the cathedral gift shop for
books, videos and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie Ward, a spokeswoman for the church, said the items sold
online were related to the church, like labyrinths, the medieval
meditation paths that people walk through or trace with their
fingers. Ward said that the cathedral had not signed up with any of
the virtual-religion networks and that it was proceeding cautiously
into e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jerome M. Epstein, the executive vice president of the
United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, acknowledged that a few
years ago, he considered Web sites to be passing fads. Today, Rabbi
Epstein said, they are becoming essential tools that link
congregants to one another and to their synagogues. People use the
sites to stay in touch when they are away. Others looking to move
into a community will often use the sites to see what a
congregation offers.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for church and synagogue sites seems limitless,
religious leaders say. Users can stay at home and hear and see the
choir and the delivery of the sermon. If they miss the service,
they can catch it later.
</P>
<P>
   And the growing religious presence on the Web means potential
customers. ``We've been getting all kinds of pressure to sign up
with different businesses and nonprofits,'' the rabbi said. ``We've
resisted because we don't want to make our congregations feel that
what we're about is merchandising.''
</P>
<P>
   One person struggling to find a balance between commerce and
faith is John Lynner Peterson, the director for public media at the
Lutheran Church Association and a consultant to
Faithandvaluesmedia.org. He drew a distinction between the
Internet's dot-orgs and dot-coms like Beliefnet.com and
Christianity.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not responsible to venture capitalists who are putting
pressure on their relig.coms to turn a profit,'' Peterson said.
``We're more interested in being prophetic than in being
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   What his dot-org group would like to do is link houses of
worship from a cross section of denominations. The interfaith group
that is sponsoring Faithandvaluesmedia.org is a coalition of 70
religious groups with thousands of churches. United under one
network, these groups will be able to share intellectual and
spiritual resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be using e-commerce, but commerce won't be the final
arbiter of who we are,'' Peterson said. ``We are about ministry. We
are about connecting with people where they are on their spiritual
journey.''

SPINAL TAP ROCKS ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There is a fine line between stupid and . . . '' says
English-accented singer-guitarist David St. Hubbins, who then gets
stuck for the next word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clever,'' chimes in bassist Derek Smalls.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic moment from a cult classic film, Rob Reiner's
directorial debut, ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' a mockumentary about a
would-be mighty faux rock band called Spinal Tap. It debuted in
1983 and quickly became noted as the rock movie _ or, at least the
one that hilariously captured the arrogance, self-absorption,
pretentiousness, and self-delusion with which many a rock band
carry with them unaware. A portrayal of simple, shaggy-coifed,
bandwagon-hopping musicians who believe themselves to be artists,
visionaries maybe. ``This Is Spinal Tap'' is a band-on-the-road
film that takes most every rock 'n' roll cliche _ introduces us to
the nasal, whiny publicist (played TAP, Page N &QL; 
by Fran Drescher) and the sycophantic A&AMP;R man (played by Paul
Shaffer) _ and satirically spins them so that the inanities of
Spinal Tap are just one small step removed from the inanities of
many a real rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Spinal Tap'' _ which screens starting Sept. 8 at the
Nickelodeon and is being released by MGM on DVD Sept. 12 with an
hour's worth of outtakes and other sundries tacked on _ is so
realistic it has fooled people into believing parts of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Halpern, a vice president of special projects at the film
company StudioCanal, was at a bachelor party in England not long
ago and the subject of Spinal Tap came up. The musicians who played
Spinal Tap were writers/comic-actors Michael McKean (St. Hubbins),
Harry Shearer (Smalls) and Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel). His
bachelor party friends _ born not long before ``This Is Spinal
Tap'' came out _ were certain the band was comprised of real Brits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, New York talk show host Joe Franklin interviewed Spinal
Tap without doing any prep work and did the interview believing
they were indeed a real band. (This is captured on the new DVD.)
</P>
<P>
   Talk to anyone in the music business today _ nearly two decades
away from Spinal Tap's inception _ and they will tell you the
essence of ``This Is Spinal Tap'' still rings true. As to the
Spinal Tap of 1983 and the rock scene today: The sound may change
and the players certainly do, but behind the scenes it's the same
as it ever was. The song remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   Real musicians love the (in) joke. Fleetwood Mac's Mick
Fleetwood took the drummer's stool for their recent appearance on
VH1's ``The List'' and may play with them in the future. Spinal Tap
legend has it he answered a newspaper ad reading, ``Drummer Died,
Need New One.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Spinal Tap _ the entity itself _ lives again. The group has
released a new song called ``Back From the Dead,'' which St.
Hubbins has described as ``a good hard-rock-industrial-Latino
-desperate-attempt-at-a-hit-single, really.'' It is downloadable
via Tapster. That's right, Tapster. There is only one song you can
download with Tapster.com. Spinal Tap reckons this makes it a whole
lot less confusing than the myriad choices Napster offers. About
85,000 fans have downloaded the tune in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tap canon
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Said Tufnel: ``There's nothing wrong with being shameless.
There's a fine line between opportunism and exploitation.'' Added
Smalls: ``We're not unnecessarily concerned about intellectual
property _ this isn't about Harvard, Yale and Oxford.'' Lyrical
bits from the song: ``There's nothing more fun than flipping off
the reaper'' and ``Give me resurrection or give me death.'' ``Back
From the Dead'' joins the Tap canon with ``Tonight I'm Gonna Rock
You Tonight,'' ``Big Bottom'' ``Bitch School'' and ``Hell Hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Halpern, 32, was the guy who discovered 30 hours of outtakes
from the movie. He had seen the movie dozens of times. As vice
president of special projects, his job for StudioCanal, the French
company that bought the roster of the defunct Embassy Pictures (the
original home of ``This Is Spinal Tap''), involves cinematic
excavation. Halpern was aware of a blurry 4 1/2-hour (!) version of
the movie that had made the bootlegging circuit. He says after
StudioCanal took over Embassy, he was searching in a salt
mine-cum-storage facility in Kansas, where he found 30 hours of
footage. ``We brought it back to Paris,'' he says, ``where Rob
Reiner said he was happy to have the outtakes used, but the film
that came out (originally) is the director's cut of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans will see Tufnel tediously explain how Spinal Tap
incorporated Indonsian scales into their music and they'll witness
much of the _ now they can be named! _ Shut Up and Eat mime troupe
that caters a Spinal Tap party. Billy Crystal is fabulous as the
profane and verbally ticked-off head mime/waiter. Other scenes are
less scintillating, more banal. And, yet, as banality is central to
Spinal Tap's ethos, even that makes sense _ just as their
ponderously long (two-and-a-half hours) show at the former Great
Woods Center for the Performing Arts in 1992. Message: You've got
to love rock 'n' roll in order to loathe it. Or vice versa.
Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the movie communally, says Halpern, can be a ``Rocky
Horror Picture Show'' type of thing, with audiences reciting the
lines along with the actors.
</P>
<P>
   When we spoke to Tufnel back then, he championed the generic
nature of Spinal Tap's music. ``I don't think it's anything to be
ashamed of,'' he said. ``We are, in record shops in England, listed
under `generia.' They've got hard rock, speed metal, industrial,
slash and thrash and bash _ stupid names like that to make it sell
_ and then generia. It's much more shameful to say we are thinking
of a new description of music.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Spinal Tap is an amalgamation of cliches, we always
thought two bands at the core were the British groups Status Quo _
who like the Tap had an early psychedelic-pop hit and then went
hard rock _ and Judas Priest. Christopher Guest, who first created
the Tufnel character in 1975 for a series of National Lampoon radio
shows, wouldn't drop any names when we talked. He did say this
inspired him: ``I saw a band check into a hotel I was staying in in
Los Angeles and these guys walked in _ I don't remember what band
it was _ and they were English and one of the musicians said to the
manager `I don't know where my bass is.' The manager said `What do
you mean?' And he says `I think I left it at the airport.' And the
manager says `You left your bass at the airport?' `Yeah, I don't
know where it is,' says the musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this went on for about 20 minutes and I thought, `This
is insane, here are these guys, they're incredibly dim and they're
traveling around in a cloud of stupidity. Boy, this is funny. Some
day, God, I've got to get this on film.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, Spinal Tap is with us again. Spinal Tap plays a concert in
Los Angeles at the Hard Rock Cafe Sept. 5 to celebrate its
re-emergence. There are plans for a show in London and the
possiblity of a US tour. Will they be with us always? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``They absolutely love these characters,'' says Halpern of the
three writer-actors, ``and they love doing Spinal Tap. They stay in
character the second they walk out of the dressing room.'' Coming
soon, maybe: Action figures and an animated TV series.

ARE THE ARTS DUMBING DOWN? 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this era of infotainment, Americans are supposed to be glued
to their tubes. But as anyone who's been to an art museum, theater,
or concert hall recently can attest, what was used to be called
``high culture'' is wildly popular right now.
</P>
<P>
   Museum of Fine Arts galleries are thronged with visitors on wet
winter evenings and weekend afternoons in high summer. Commonwealth
Shakespeare Company drew 1,500 to 2,000 people on clear nights to
see ``The Tempest'' on Boston Common in early August. The Boston
Lyric Opera scrambles to keep up with subscription demand.
</P>
<P>
   Public enthusiasm for art, music, theater, and dance is raising
some highbrow eyebrows, however. Academics, connoisseurs, and
critics maintain that as arts organizations market themselves to
draw new audiences, the quality of their offerings has been
``dumbed down.'' ``Popularity is not necessarily a measure of
success'' in the arts, cautions James Cuno, director of the Harvard
Art Museums. Too many institutions, he says, are compromising their
standards as they scramble to respond to ``bottom-line pressures
that reared their ugly heads in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now a common perception in visual arts circles that
museums in general and the MFA in particular pander to the palate
of an unsophisticated public with a steady diet of blockbuster
exhibitions (see sidebar). Boston Symphony Orchestra musicians
complain that the classical repertory of the Boston Pops is
devolving to meet the demands of television and mass audiences.
Accusations of ``dumbing down'' crop up more and more often in
cultural news and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dumbing down'' surfaced as a buzz phrase in the early 1980s
and has since been used ``to describe the perceived deterioration
of almost anything,'' says sociologist Herbert J. Gans, author of
``Popular Culture and High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of
Taste.'' It is bandied about a lot these days to describe political
discourse, TV quiz shows, the world as seen through the lens of the
Farrelly brothers _ and the state of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   But is a Monet exhibition really comparable to ``There's
Something About Mary''? Does a megamusical like ``The Phantom of
the Opera'' diminish or increase the vitality of theater and opera?
(See sidebar.) Is keeping an eye on the bottom line really
detrimental to art?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, says Gans. As he sees it, some of the most vocal
avatars of aesthetic standards are in high dudgeon not because the
arts are getting dumber, but because they're increasingly
democratic. As elite arts institutions have been forced out of
``commercial necessity'' to expand their constituencies, he says,
the people who used to control them and ``use them for status''
have gone into a ``cultural panic.'' To some traditional patrons,
the market-minded museum is dumbing down, he says. ``To people who
are seeing it for the first time, it's smartening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cri de coeur over cultural deterioration emanates
from what John Seabrook, author of ``Nobrow: The Culture of
Marketing _ The Marketing of Culture,'' calls ``townhouse
culture.'' It is, he says, the once rarified realm of a largely
``Ivy League educated, mostly Protestant establishment'' whose
aristocratic taste for painting, music, theater, ballet, and
literature for many years functioned as ``high culture for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, they were able to present their standards as
a matter of common sense and good taste,'' he observes. During the
culture wars of the 1980s, as ``it became clear that this
particular subculture's values did not represent the culture at
large, the jig was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Government arts funding was slashed. The self-made and
business-minded started displacing men of inherited wealth on
institution boards, and they encouraged new efficiencies and the
building of new constituencies. In-house academics accustomed to
curating exhibits for the art savvy, musicians used to playing for
experienced concertgoers, and playmakers who once mounted shows for
theatergoers who knew Chekov and Shakespeare had to change their
assumptions about presenting a performance.
</P>
<P>
   The sizes of all arts audiences surged. The latest figures
available from the National Endowment for the Arts show that more
than half of American adults go at least once a year to one or more
of the following: a jazz or classical music concert; opera; the
ballet; stage musical; play; or an art museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status that one used to get from going to hear classical
music _ the assumption that you went because you were a sort of
tasteful person _ isn't guaranteed anymore,'' says Seabrook.
Townhouse denizens were losing social as well as institutional
power. ``As they felt their power to uphold standards eroding, they
started crying `dumbing down' about everything.'' They complained
about crassness, marketing, ``the masses,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the public that is coming in the townhouse door is hardly
uncivilized, Seabrook says. ``The masses are watching Martha
Stewart and going to Pottery Barn.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments certainly seem to be disturbing a very vocal
sector of the local culturati: the critics of MFA director Malcolm
Rogers who Rogers says have dismissed his successful audience
outreach efforts, telling him, ``Well, it's fine that more people
are coming to the museum, but they're not really `museum people.'
'' Or the small-town music critic FleetBoston Celebrity Series
executive director Martha Jones saw ``get up at intermission and
blast three people for clapping between movements'' at a symphonic
concert at Jordan Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Concerts and plays are shorter today than they were a decade
ago. Museums have upgraded their retail outlets and restaurants for
the simple reason that Americans like to eat and shop when they go
out. Most arts organizations have beefed up ``branding'' efforts to
increase public awareness in a time of information overload. The
buses emblazoned with Vincent van Gogh portraits this summer bring
the artist, the show, and the MFA to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that barely recognized one another's existence as
recently as five years ago are doing joint programming and
cross-promotion. Last winter's ``Egypt in Boston'' collaboration
among the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Lyric Opera, the Wang Center,
and the Science Museum did boffo box office business for one and
all. Chicago cultural organizations essentially replicated the
program this summer when ``Pharoahs of the Sun: Akhenatan,
Nefertiti, Tutankhamen'' went from the MFA to the Art Institute of
Chicago, and the Boston Lyric Opera production of ``Akhnaten'' was
mounted at the Chicago Opera Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that all of us have become more market
oriented,'' says Don Sturdy, director of artistic operations at
Boston Ballet, and a veteran arts administrator. In the last
decade, arts organizations have ``had to balance our budgets on the
basis of marketing, and when you do that, you have to find out what
people want.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of competition out there, it's harder to get and
hold people's attention. It's a challenge to maintain your artistic
agenda and meet the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   But any organization ``worth its salt in this town'' is doing
that, Sturdy says. ``Sure we've seen examples of bad art produced
because someone thought it would be commercially successful. We've
seen bad art that isn't commercial'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Celebrity Series is among arts presenters that are scaling
back ``the number of presentations and the number of events within
each discipline,'' says Jones. ``When we had six or seven classical
music concerts, the halls were not full. We now have two to five. I
have many more subscribers in the past two years than I had five
years ago and more people are coming to classical music concerts
than there were five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The BSO has moved some of its youth concerts out of Symphony
Hall and into churches in Roxbury and South Boston. It plays more
free concerts now. ``For a long time, we had a very inward focus,''
says BSO managing director Mark Volpe. ``In this world, that's
counter to your best interests. Orchestras are fighting for
relevance in ways they didn't have to 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Symphony and Boston Pops belong to everyone. We had
to broaden,'' says Volpe. ``It's a change. That threatens some
people. But democratizing isn't dumbing down. When we played in
Franklin Park, we did some popular music. We also did Stravinsky.''

 BOSTON: ... cold tones.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gilot was able to leave Picasso in 1953 with their two children
_ Paloma and Claude, who is now a Paris-based designer _ because
she had both guts and money. While Picasso later rejected the
children, she's stayed close to them all their lives. (She has a
third, a daughter, Aurelia, from her marriage to artist Luc Simon
from 1955 to 1962.) Images of her children close the BC show, and
while they're hardly sentimental _ sentimental isn't Gilot's style
_ they're the work of a loving mother. They're essays in roundness,
as some of Picasso's baby portraits of Claude and Paloma are as
well. Gone are the needly angles with which Gilot drew their
father. In Gilot's ``The Door,'' Claude enfolds his little sister
like a blanket and tickles her chin. In the background is a
Lilliputian door, the kind that might lead to a fairy-tale land.
</P>
<P>
   As for Picasso, ``The whole thing around him is hysteria,''
Gilot says. ``Everybody knows that name. You ask people if they
know Jasper Johns, and many don't. Good or bad, a book about
Picasso will sell.'' She's written a couple herself: ``Life With
Picasso'' and ``Matisse and Picasso: A Friendship in Art.''
Meanwhile, a huge book about her comes out this fall: the 450 page
``Francoise Gilot: Monograph 1940-2000,'' to be published by the
Lausanne-based Acatos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pablo is good subject matter,'' she says, ``but he didn't
produce that many masterpieces. There will be a reassessment of
him, to eliminate the rubbish. It takes time to assess a career.
There are misconceptions, and anecdotes take over. Not so much
would be written about van Gogh if he hadn't cut his ear off.
Cezanne had a quiet life, so not that much is written about him.
The life of the artist doesn't explain the art. Verlaine was a
drunk, but that doesn't explain Verlaine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of 20th century art, the reputations of precious
few women artists have matched those of their male artist
companions or spouses. Frida Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe, whose
reputations soared posthumously, come to mind. Not many others do.
Gilot believes that the painter Lee Krasner, who was married to
Jackson Pollock, ``eventually will come into her own.'' As for her
own status, ``I am being recognized,'' she says. ``If I'd been a
man, I would have been recognized earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after those covered in the BC show, she's stayed
prolific as a painter. Her marriage to Salk was as unconventional
as other aspects of her life, structured so each could focus on one
thing at a time. ``We agreed to spend six months of the year
together and six months apart,'' she says. ``We got all our
separate business done during the months apart. Why should Jonas
have to go to an art opening? Why should I have to go to a
scientific congress? During our time together, we had no
interruptions.'' Ditto for when they were in lab or studio. ``Jonas
once told his first wife, when she said something to him while he
was working, `You have my undivided inattention.' I feel the same
way when I'm painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, Gilot inherited her grandmother's house in the chic
Parisian suburb of Neuilly. She immediately sold it, because ``My
grandmother was still in the rooms for me. I did the same when
Jonas died; I sold the house right away. I want the memory, not the
thing. It would be unbearable to be there. When someone I love
dies, I usually can't paint for about six months. My paintings look
intellectual, but they're based on very strong feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   From her years with Picasso she kept just one of his paintings _
his famous 1946 portrait of her, ``Woman-Flower.'' It's Picasso's
response to Matisse's comment that if he were to paint Gilot, she'd
have blue skin and green hair. Picasso, ever competitive, beat him
to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Gilot finally sold ``Woman-Flower.'' ``I thought
it was bringing me bad luck,'' she says. ``It's important to detach
from the past _ so you can move into the future.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``There was never anything tentative in my work,'' says
Francoise Gilot. ``I was a good painter when I was 12 years old.''
Nothing remains of her earliest art, though. It was all on a truck,
laden with her family's valuables, that was bombed by the Germans
as it headed south from occupied Paris in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Gilot, now 78 and based in New York, has built a
six-decade track record as an artist who has exhibited and sold
internationally. Her current show at Boston College's McMullen
Museum attests to her talent _ especially in works on paper, where
she is first-rate. Banners up and down Commonwealth Avenue outside
the museum reproduce one of her drawings: The subject is Pablo
Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Gilot had the decidedly mixed blessing of a decade-long
association with the 20th century's most famous artist. She was as
un-tentative in their relationship as she was in her art. Of all
his wives and long-term mistresses (she's in the latter category),
she was the only one to walk out on him, after a history of such
incidents as his burning her cheek with a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Gilot later had a much calmer 25 year marriage to Jonas Salk,
developer of the polio vaccine, which ended with his death in 1995.
She is the mother of Paloma Picasso, the high-profile jewelry
designer. She is more famous by association than on her own,
although her face is eerily familiar from Picasso's portraits, at
least from the less scrambled-looking ones, and from the iconic
Robert Capa photograph of her walking triumphantly on the beach as
a beaming Picasso trails behind, holding a huge umbrella to shield
her from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilot's 1944 drawing of Picasso _ the one on the BC banners
_ is severe, and hints at his celebrated sadism. The lines of his
forehead suggest an arcane geometry lesson. His eyes are huge and
hypnotic; his mouth drawn, as if his teeth were clenched. His
Adam's apple is a protruding egg.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Adam. Gilot reverses the roles of the biblical Adam
and Eve in her 1946 drawing of ``Adam Forcing Eve to Eat the
Apple.'' ``I was always annoyed at the biblical story,'' she says,
standing in front of the drawing during a recent visit to BC. ``One
of the most important things in my character is I always wanted to
know by myself, and not swallow what I was told just because it was
in a book.'' Her Picasso/Adam stuffs the apple down Gilot/Eve's
throat, while pounding his other fist. It's a sexually violent
image, the bold, black angles on Picasso's face an economical way
to suggest nastiness. Gilot's hands, meanwhile, lie awkwardly on
the table, as if she were momentarily unable to force their muscles
into action.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso was world-famous and 40 years older than she when they
met in 1943. One strategy she used to skirt the danger of imitating
his potent art once she moved in with him in 1946 was minimalism,
paring down both color and composition. She calls it ``my white
period. When I started to live with him, I preferred to work in a
more restricted palette.'' She learned that ``If you have the means
to say 10 things, say 3. Keep it powerful.'' Picasso is present in
some of her paintings, in the liberties she took with the human
figure. But Matisse is there, too, in the liberties she took with
color, and some of her work calls Gauguin or van Gogh to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pablo once asked me, `If you were condemned to death by a
judge and had to do a drawing very fast to save your life, what
would you draw?,' '' she recalls. ``I said, `a circle, which I
could do perfectly, without a compass.'' Which is what she did in
``The Painter,'' an austere exercise in balance. Against a snowy
white gouache ground floats a long rectangle with a single knowing
eye in it, her eye. An arrow _ her symbol, as a Sagittarius _
points directly up from it, barely touching a balloonlike orb, a
perfect orb. The arrow seems both creator and potential destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   Francoise Gilot has impeccable posture, vivid features capped by
the eyebrows Matisse compared to circumflex accents, blunt-cut hair
a convincing shade of auburn, and stamina: She stood for a two-hour
interview in the BC museum, so we could look at her art while we
talked. She was wearing a long chiffon print dress and, among her
other jewels, a gigantic ring, designed by her daughter, in which
peridot and amethyst jostle for space.
</P>
<P>
   She and McMullen director Nancy Netzer deliberately restricted
the BC show to work from 1940 to 1950, the first decade of her
career. Gilot wanted BC students to see what she was doing when she
was their age. Whether this will inspire or intimidate them will be
seen after the fall semester starts. Gilot hardly revolutionized
painting, but her art, even early on, is both beautiful and sure.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by her work, she talked about the formidable feminist
heritage that has at times kept her going: a great-grandmother who
was a disciple of George Sand; a grandmother who knew Marie Curie.
Her own mother was a watercolorist who started teaching her
daughter to paint when Francoise was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received the Legion d'Honneur'' _ France's highest award _
``for being a feminist and as a painter,'' she says proudly. ``I
said, `What did I do as a feminist?' They said, `It's not what you
do, it's what you are.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she is solitary. ``I was an only child. And
as a painter, you're alone in your studio. You're kind of a monk.''
When students ask her if they have what it takes to become a good
painter, she poses a question to them: ``How many hours can you be
alone in a week, a month, a lifetime?''
</P>
<P>
   While she knew from early childhood that she wanted to be a
painter, Gilot enrolled in law school in Paris, following the
wishes of her father, a wealthy agronomist. In 1940, as a law
student, she joined a rally at the Arc de Triomphe to protest the
German occupation. ``There was a little fighting,'' she recalls, ``
and I was put on a list of hostages.'' If the French killed any
Germans, she'd be jailed _ or worse. She had to report to the
police daily, until her father bribed them to remove her from the
list. ``It was a very strange feeling: I was alive because my
parents were affluent.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't finish law school, although ``I must say I did not
dislike it. It teaches you to analyze. I just didn't want to do it
all my life.'' She attended art schools in Paris, ``but I didn't
learn anything so special. I knew painting from the beginning. What
was interesting to me was drawing and composition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never been easy to enter the art world, but for a woman
it's more normal in France than here,'' she says, citing a list of
French predecessors from Rococo portraitist Marie-Louise-Elisabeth
Vigee-Lebrun to the Impressionist Berthe Morisot. ``Wanting to
paint was not exceptional for a woman in France,'' she says, ``but
the US was still a century behind when I came here the first time,
in 1961.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 1941 ink portrait of Hungarian painter Endre Rozsda hangs in
the BC show. I refer to him as her ``teacher.'' ``He was my
mentor,'' she corrects, as if by then she didn't need teaching. The
drawing of Rozsda and one of herself, also from 1941, both show
that by the time she was 20, Gilot was a completely confident
draftsman. She looks straight out of the picture, with a stunned
expression, as if she's seen Hell but is not about to be cowed by
it. The line is as unflinching as her expression. ``This was made
during the War,'' she says. ``We didn't know if we'd be alive at
the end of it _ or even the next day. I had to make a complete
testament in my art, to be decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned to camouflage her subjects through symbolism to
avoid persecution by the Germans. The 1943 ink drawing of ``Dead
Rooster on a Piece of Newspaper'' is ostensibly just that. But the
rooster is also a symbol of France, and the newspaper bears the bad
tidings that France has died. Both are emblems of agony: The paper
is crumpled; the rooster is contorted, its claws flailing in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1942 ``Fish and Knife'' is, on the one hand, a version of an
age-old still-life subject. But she painted it to show how she felt
about the slaughter of French culture. It's a riveting little
picture, with the purplish fish oozing blood, a dirty yellow table
and black background all setting off the blade that became a
recurring symbol of the Nazis in her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish and Knife'' is a fine example of Gilot as daring
colorist; so is that head of Picasso, which is backed by a
brilliant saffron yellow. ``I've always favored primary colors,''
she says. ``I'll use one of them for two or three years, then
switch. The yellow behind Pablo expresses the intensity of his
being. I thought my own personality was more blue, symbolized by
those cold tones.''

CRY OF INNOCENT TRUMPS MORAL CLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The full-page advertisement by the American Civil Liberties
Union shows a man in an electric chair, strapped in and hooded and
ready to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to modern science,'' the ad says, ``17 innocent people
have been removed from death row. Thanks to modern politics, 23
innocent people have been removed from the living.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's bold and unattributed assertion _ that 23 innocent
men and women have been executed in the United States _ is
compelling stuff, an example of the new tactics by which the foes
of the death penalty have transformed the debate over capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   By raising the specter that innocent people have been condemned
to die _ rather than employing the more traditional argument that
capital punishment is immoral _ the ``innocence movement'' has
caught supporters of the death penalty by surprise, put them on the
defensive, and taken a huge bite out of public support for capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the death penalty has dropped from 80 percent to 66
percent in some public opinion polls, and to below 50 percent when
respondents to the poll are guaranteed that criminals will serve
life without parole as an alternative. ``Death Knell for Death
Row?'' asked the headline in the June edition of the ABA Journal,
the publication of the American Bar Association, which has called
for a national moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   All this despite the fact that _ the ACLU's advertisement
notwithstanding _ no one has ever proved that a specific innocent
person has been put to death in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The innocence argument is powerful, its proponents say, because
it can generate sympathy and concern for members of a decidedly
unsympathetic group _ death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most sympathetic person in a death penalty case is always
the victim,'' says Richard Dieter, director of the Death Penalty
Information Center, an advocacy group opposed to capital
punishment. But as DNA technology and other developments have led
to the release of a growing number of prisoners in recent years,
``we have gotten to see innocent people, who had been released,
telling their story,'' said Dieter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That generates sympathy. And the system becomes the focus:
that there must be systemic problems if this many mistakes are
being made.''
</P>
<P>
   The innocence movement ``has had an enormous impact,'' said US
Representative William Delahunt, the Democrat from Massachusetts, a
former prosecutor who opposes capital punishment and has coauthored
one of several bills in Congress to overhaul the system. ``There is
no doubt this is a sea change, an absolute sea change.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of capital punishment, while conceding that the
innocence argument has been an effective rhetorical device for its
foes, accuse their opponents of manipulating the truth and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steady drumbeat of the abolitionists is that prosecutorial
misconduct and police misconduct is rampant, that eyewitnesses
frequently misidentify people, that jailhouse snitches lie, and as
a result we have literally scores of innocent people languishing on
death row,'' says Joshua Marquis, the district attorney in Astoria,
Ore., speaking on behalf of the American District Attorney's
Association. ``It is very deceptive . . . and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Marquis: ``The people of which there are real questions of
factual innocence is an infinitesimal tiny number.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Globe review of the 660 executions since the US
Supreme Court reinstituted the death penalty in 1976 shows that
about 9 out of 10 of those put to death were anything but innocent:
They pleaded guilty, confessed, volunteered for execution, or
apologized to the families of their victims as they were about to
be executed. Still others claimed to be innocent of the actual
murder, but admitted they participated in the robbery or rape that
led to the homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such proof of an innocent executed in the US since
1900,'' says Dudley Sharp, a representative from Justice For All, a
Texas-based victims' rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of capital punishment have cause to gripe about the
abolitionist tactics. The ACLU ad campaign, with its elastic
definition of the phrase ``modern,'' demonstrates why.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the ``innocent'' who were executed can be found on
the ACLU Web site. They were compiled by Hugo Bedau, a philosophy
professor at Tufts University, and a colleague for a 1987 article
in the Stanford Law Review, which the ACLU cites as its source.
Ninety percent of the men on the list were executed in the first
part of the 20th century, among them such debatable ``innocents''
as Bruno Hauptmann, executed in 1936 for the kidnap-killing of the
Lindbergh baby; union organizer Joe Hill, executed in Utah in 1915;
and anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were
executed in Massachusetts in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man on the ACLU list _ James Adams, who was executed by
Florida in 1984 _ is among the 660 people put to death since 1976.
And like Hauptmann, Hill, and others on the list, the case for
Adams's innocence is far from settled.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was arrested shortly after the robbery and murder of a
Florida rancher in 1974. Though there are questions about
eyewitnesses and physical evidence in the case, Adams was found
with the victim's eyeglasses, and with money and clothing stained
with the victim's type blood, in his possession. A witness saw
Adams's car parked at the victim's house at the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bedau can show that hundreds of innocent people were convicted
of murder and sentenced to die in the 20th century, only to be
freed from death row when a lawyer, court, or media organization
revealed the flaws in the state's case. But he acknowledges that no
scientist or historian has conclusively proven, nor any judge or
government agency ruled, that an innocent has actually been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, in a follow-up to their Stanford Law Review article,
Bedau and his colleages wrote that ``We have not proved these
executed defendants to be innocent; we never claimed that we had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that lawyers with access to the
evidence in these cases are so overwhelmed by the cases of the
living that they don't have time to worry about the dead,'' Bedau
says now.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most educated supposition is a poor basis for the
setting of public policy, especially in such an emotionally
charged, life-and-death matter as capital punishment. But advances
in DNA testing may allow news organizations to re-test the evidence
in a handful of well-known ``innocence'' cases in the coming
months, contributing the first scientific answers to the debate.
(In Georgia last month, the Globe won the first court order to
conduct such tests.)
</P>
<P>
   If no one can name an innocent who was executed, how has the
innocence movement made such gains? The real power of the
abolitionist argument is a matter of odds and logic: If the
judicial system is so prone to error, the abolitionists ask, is it
reasonable to believe that it has never made the ultimate, fatal
mistake?
</P>
<P>
   ``With the number of executions now over 600 and the number of
wrongful convictions . . . I don't have any doubt we have executed
innocent people,'' says William Lofquist, a professor of sociology
at the State University of New York in Geneseo. ``I think it is a
certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Bloodsworth, for example, was convicted of raping and
killing a 9-year-old Baltimore girl in 1984. He had been placed at
the scene by several eyewitnesses, who picked him out of a police
lineup. The jury took just two hours to find him guilty, and he was
condemned to death. It was not until 1994 that Edward Blake, a
pioneer in the new science of forensic DNA analysis, tested a tiny
semen stain on the victim's underwear and proved Bloodsworth
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodsworth is a figure on two lists of innocents saved from
prison or death. The first is the list of inmates convicted of
serious felonies who have been cleared and released from prison
and/or death row by DNA tests. It now stands at 70, according to
the New York-based ``Innocence Project,'' led by lawyers Barry
Scheck and Peter Neufeld.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty's defenders, nothing if not determined, refuse
to concede that all the inmates on the DNA list are innocent. When
DNA testing of semen and hair found at the crime scene freed Dennis
Fritz from life in prison and Ron Williamson from death row in
1999, the case was trumpeted by the innocence movement as a typical
injustice that resulted from the perjurious testimony of jailhouse
snitches and faulty, old-fashioned forensic hair analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But Oklahoma officials continue to maintain that Williamson was
involved in the crime. ``Scheck . . . can claim Williamson as
poster material for actual innocence, but I would look further
before creating federal legislation based upon his case,'' Oklahoma
Attorney General W. A. Drew Edmondson told a US Senate committee in
June. ``It is arguable whether he is innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson's accusation is a variation of what death penalty
critics contemptuously call the ``unindicted co-ejaculator''
theory, in which law enforcement authorities are forced to concede
that the convicted man may not have performed the crime, but insist
that he could have been present while an unnamed accomplice
assaulted the victim.
</P>
<P>
   A second, and somewhat overlapping list, of ``innocents,'' is
maintained by the Washington DC-based Death Penalty Information
Center. The DPIC list contains the names of 87 condemned men who
have been freed from death row because of either DNA tests or other
legal maneuvers. It has its own critics.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp says that the DPIC list is misleading because fewer than a
third of the people on the list can be said to be factually
innocent; the rest are categorized ``innocent'' because a retrial
or legal technicality voided their original conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Muneer Deeb's lawyers, for example, got his death sentence
overturned on appeal, and at a subsequent retrial he was acquitted
of his part in the brutal murder of three young people in Waco,
Texas. But Sharp notes that three of Deeb's alleged accomplices in
the case were convicted on the same evidence and one, David Spence,
was executed. While the legal outcome of the case raises questions
about the capriciousness of capital punishment _ If they were all
guilty, why was only Spence executed? _ it is not proof that Deeb
was factually innocent.
</P>
<P>
   For the abolitionist community _ largely comprising idealistic
professionals, civil libertarians, and underpaid lawyers who have
watched their clients march off to death _ any fudging of the facts
is justified by the scope of the moral evil they believe they are
battling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am troubled by some of the claims of innocence,'' Lofquist
acknowledges. ``On the other hand, I take the perspective that we
as a nation are doing something that is clearly wrong and barbaric
and out of step with the rest of the world.''

<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``Aimee and Jaguar'' Affecting, handsomely made,
superbly acted German film based on a true story about a
dangerously impassioned lesbian love affair in Nazi Berlin in
1943-'44. Maria Schrader is the bold, flirty Jewish cosmopolite
with doom in her flashing eyes. Juliane Kohler is no less affecting
as a hedonistic housewife who can't resist smiling a goofy smile as
her bourgeois world is turned upside down. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Bring It On'' Kirsten Dunst stars in a comedy of Southern
California high school cheerleading angst, squeaking her way
through one crisis after another with improbable allure, aided
mightily by a couple of much cooler big-city girls played by
Gabrielle Union and Eliza Dushka. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``The Crew'' Retired mobsters Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds,
Dan Hedaya, and Seymour Cassell get into trouble in Miami Beach
when, faced with the loss of their low-rent hotel, they revert to
their old bungling ways. A few laughs, but mostly it's as lame and
poky and predictable as its geezers with guns. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Steal This Movie!'' An earnest but scattered biopic about
counterculture radical and street theater provocateur Abbie
Hoffman. His charismatic antics, persecution by the FBI, and years
on the lam are depicted with gusto, but only intermittent success,
by Vincent D'Onofrio in a piecemeal film that never quite
convincingly captures the superheated '60s and '70s. (R)

FROM SACCO AND VANZETTI TO DNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The origins of the modern innocence movement can be traced to
Massachusetts, and to Sara Ehrmann, a foe of capital punishment
whose husband was one of the lawyers for Nicola Sacco and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two anarchists who were executed in Boston in
the Red Scare of 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the Mother Courage of the anti-death penalty
movement,'' says Hugo Bedau, 73, a Tufts professor of philosophy
who knew Ehrmann and read ``a little article she wrote, published
about 1960, in which she mentioned some cases in Massachusetts and
New England where she believed there was pretty strong evidence the
executed person was not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedau took up the cause, and published a series of works on
capital punishment, which culminated in the 1987 article for the
Stanford Law Review that he turned into a book, ``In Spite of
Innocence: Erroneous Convictions in Capital Cases,'' with
co-authors Michael Radelet and Constance Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``That book spurred a strong response,'' says Richard Dieter,
the director of the Death Penalty Information Center. The Reagan
administration assigned its own legal experts to rebut Bedau's
work. In 1993, a US House Judiciary Subcommittee chaired by
Representative Don Edwards of California asked the DPIC to assess
the question of wrongful executions. The DPIC's subsequent report
contained the first list of modern ``innocence'' cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing political tide was running the other way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, President Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress expanded the federal death penalty for dozens of new
crimes. In 1995, Clinton and Congess eliminated financing for
federal Death Penalty Resource Centers, where lawyers for indigent
defendants got expert advice. In 1996, Congress passed and Clinton
signed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which
curbed the ability of death row inmates to appeal their cases in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The abolitionists responded as best they could, and stumbled
upon the effectiveness of the ``innocence'' argument
</P>
<P>
   The new science of biotechnology, meanwhile, was evolving at a
rapid pace. In 1988, DNA testing led to the first exoneration of a
wrongfully convicted man, who had spent more than a decade in
prison for a rape he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of subsequent reports, the US Justice Department
warned prosecutors across the nation that DNA testing was exposing
the inherent flaws of eyewitness testimony, jailhouse informants,
forensic hair analysis, and other standard tools of the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   A milestone was reached in November 1998, when Lawrence
Marshall, a professor of law, and David Protess, a professor of
journalism at Northwestern University, organized a national
conference on wrongful convictions and the death penalty. Dozens of
former death row inmates came to Chicago, including some who had
been freed by the work of students in Protess's journalism classes.
A year later, Illinois Governor George Ryan, a pro-death penalty
Republican, announced a moratorium on executions in his state.
Illinois, it turned out, had released more innocent men from death
row (13) than it had executed (12) in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, conservative icons like The Washington Times,
columnist George F. Will, and evangelist Pat Robertson _ noting
that the taking of innocent life and liberty is the ultimate sin of
big government _ have emerged as critics of capital punishment as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events has left longtime abolitionists shaking their
heads in wonder. ``If you had asked me in August 1998 whether I
thought that in less than two years there would be a moratorium on
executions in Illinois, and growing distress among politicians and
the media and the general public over the risks of executing the
innocent, I would have said it was impossible _ not a snowball's
chance in hell.'' Bedau says. ``But it seems we are beginning to
face up to the realities of what is going on in this country.''

<P>
   As medical breakthroughs go, no one thinks it will be as
revolutionary as the female contraceptive that celebrates its 40th
(non)birthday as a commercial product this month.
</P>
<P>
   But now, four decades after the advent of the pill that finally
divorced the joy of sex from the fear of pregnancy, male hormonal
contraception appears to be on the not-so-distant horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Not just a pill, mind you; it's not quite that simple. This
contraceptive will probably require an implant or injection to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of experiments, including, most recently, one
conducted at the University of Edinburgh, have come up with a
hormonal combination that has proved remarkably successful in
suppressing sperm production in men.
</P>
<P>
   Details are expected early next month, when researchers offer a
fuller presentation of their findings at the International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics meeting in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But initial reports on their work have raised new hope for an
effective male hormonal birth-control method. Richard Anderson, a
clinical scientist working on the project, predicts the day will
arrive in the not-so-distant future when a male method will hit the
market. ``It is not going to be within five years, but within five
to 10 years, I would be very disappointed if there isn't something
available,'' says Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it will mark the solution to a complicated biological
puzzle, for the science of male birth control is more complicated
than that of the female pill.
</P>
<P>
   First, a female hormone, or gestagen, is used to stop sperm
production. But because that hormone also blocks the body's
production of testosterone, which fuels the libido and supports
other functions, men must also be given a replacement androgen, or
male hormone.
</P>
<P>
   In some subjects the University of Edinburgh research team has
succeeded in effectively eliminating sperm production while
maintaining libido through a pill of the synthetic female hormone
desogestrel, combined with implants that slowly release
testosterone to replace that suppressed by the female hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Male birth control has its skeptics, to be sure. Robert Friar, a
professor of human physiology and sexuality at Ferris State
University in Michigan, insists that, however promising the
research, basic biological differences make an effective male
``pill'' unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to reduce fertility in men, there is a way
to do it that is highly effective, easy to do, very inexpensive,
and safe: It is called vasectomy,'' says Friar.
</P>
<P>
   And why not a hormonal method? A matter of math, says Friar.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman releases one egg a month. A man's ejaculate is from
330 to 500 million sperm, so even if you are 99 percent effective,
there will still be thousands of sperm.''
</P>
<P>
   That warning aside, the Edinburgh researchers are confident an
effective male birth control combination is possible. And if the
early promise of their project proves out, then within the next
decade, a male method could bring about a seismic shift in sexual
responsibility roles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increased condom use, specialists say birth control has
remained primarily a female responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many men have more or less taken the position that it is the
woman's responsibility,'' says Howard J. Ruppel Jr., executive
director of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors,
and Therapists. ``I think that is the predominant attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   According to United Nations estimates, two-thirds of couples
practicing contraception worldwide use a female method.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a leading nonprofit in
family planning and reproductive health, shows that 28 percent of
American women practicing contraception rely on sterilization,
while 27 percent use the pill.
</P>
<P>
   By gender contrast, 20 percent use male condoms, while 11
percent said their partners have had a vasectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Women even tend to bear the responsibility in those cases when
logic suggests men could more easily do so, says Lawrence B. Finer,
PhD, senior research associate at the institute, who points to the
disparity in sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that male sterilization is a simpler and
safer procedure, it is still that cases that among couples who get
sterilized, female sterilization is much more common than male,''
says Finer.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises several interesting questions.
</P>
<P>
   How willing would men be to use a new birth-control technology _
and how willing would women be to trust them with the
responsibility of birth control?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly most men seem to agree that they don't play a major
part in contraceptive decisions. A 1997 survey by the Kaiser Family
Foundation, a national health research and education organization,
found that more than two-thirds of men and woman said men should
play a bigger role in choosing and using contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one-fifth of men surveyed confessed to knowing little or
nothing about the range of choices, with another 37 percent saying
they knew only ``some'' about contraceptive options.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Glass, a Baltimore clinical psychologist and marital
therapist, says some men would have masculinity issues with a
birth-control method that stops sperm production.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a man has an empty ejaculation, as occurs in men who have
vasectomies, they might feel emasculated by that,'' Glass says.
Still, in several surveys, men have shown a receptivity to at least
trying such a hormonal method of contraception.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser survey found that 71 percent of men said they would
be willing to consider at least one male birth control option,
while 29 percent said they would not try any male methods. Men
showed most receptivity to birth-control pills, with 66 percent
saying they would try those, compared to 43 percent who said they
would try an injection and 36 percent said they would try an method
that used implants.
</P>
<P>
   International surveys show similar interest in a possible
product, but a marked preference for a pill. In a 1996 study of men
in Edinburgh, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Cape Town, 44 percent (Hong
Kong) to 83 percent (Edinburgh) said they would try a male pill,
but were less receptive to injections. Only about one-third of Hong
Kong, Shanghai , and Edinburgh men said they would try that method,
compared with 55 percent of the Cape Towners.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the rub: Real-life choices for men aren't likely to
be as simple as swallowing a pill. Although there are a number of
effective female hormones that can be taken orally, thus far no
effective androgen, or male hormone, has been formulated that can
be consumed that way.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, supplying both sperm-suppressing female hormone and the
replacement male hormones will likely require more than a pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oral options are either not very safe or very effective,''
acknowledges Anderson. ``So we need to give it by injection or
implant across the skin,'' through a patch similar to those that
people use to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that if there is ever going to be a product men
are going to be using . . . it will be injectable or an implant,
something that is long acting,'' says Jeff Spieler, chief of
research division of US Agency for International Development's
population office.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear that if the method gets complicated (a
combination of two methods), inconvenient or uncomfortable
(injections), men will be less inclined to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only know that in clinical trials, men find the procedure
relatively acceptable and would continue using them if they were
available,'' says Spieler.
</P>
<P>
   At least one study of experiment participants explored why men
agreed to try the new birth control method, which in that test
required somewhat painful weekly injections.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequent reason given was a need to change
contraceptive method because their partners had had experienced
problems from the pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every focus group participant whose partner had used
the pill mentioned that she had experienced . . . side effects,''
wrote researcher Karin Ringheim in the June 1995, issue of
International Family Planning Perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Several other prominent reasons suggested similar concerns,
saying their partner or doctor had urged them to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is particularly interesting in light of the
possible male hormonal method: Some men simply didn't trust their
partner to take birth control regularly.
</P>
<P>
   If some men don't trust women in that regard, would women trust
men with a birth control method that, after all, separates primary
responsibility from primary consequence?
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hoff, director of public health information and
communications for the Kaiser Family Foundation, who has conducted
a number of focus groups on issues of contraception, remains
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises some real trust issues,'' says Hoff. ``For a lot of
women, I think the sense is that it is still up to them to make
sure they are protected since they are the ones who will get
pregnant.'' That, after all, is the message sexual educators and
counselors have long hammered home, says Ruppel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In committed relationships, it certainly could be a symbol of
a man's consideration,'' says Glass, the clinical psychologist and
therapist. ``But in casual relationships, I think that women would
be suspicious about whether a man had really taken it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests male contraception may hold its primary promise
for committed, modern, monogamous couples, particularly those who
have had problems with female contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Anderson. He points to a recent survey
connected with his project that showed women overwhelmingly thought
a male hormonal method was a good idea and that only 2 percent said
they wouldn't trust their partners to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even an optimist like Anderson acknowledges that male
hormonal contraception isn't likely to find the open embrace that
the pill has met with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not going to rival the supremacy of the pill, but there
are a lot of other methods around that are only used by small
percentage,'' he says. ``And considering that everybody has sex,
even a small percentage is an awful lot of people.''

A LAND OF SALMON WELCOMES THE BAGEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ In just a generation, the Irish capital has reinvented
itself: Sleek, continental cafes have elbowed their way alongside
the traditional, wooden pubs where the likes of Brendan Behan and
Patrick Kavanagh would trade insults as often as literary bons
mots.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that the only readily available ethnic
food here was fish and chips, which some Dubliners considered
foreign because so many chippers were run by Italian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dublin is as cosmopolitan as most European capitals, and
you can dine on anything from Belgian moules (mussels) to
Indonesian rice.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, it was impossible to get a decent bagel in
Dublin, not to mention all of Ireland. The bagels produced in
Portobello, home to Dublin's dwindling Jewish community, were a
pale imitation of those being made in Jewish bakeries in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As Dublin began attracting an increasingly cosmopolitan
population of both tourists and residents, a French bakery tried to
fill the void. But their mass-produced bagel, sold in supermarkets,
tasted like a bread roll.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Kemp sisters. Though they are both accomplished
equestrians, Peaches and Domini Kemp are also enterprising
entrepreneurs. Having sampled the real thing in New York, they knew
there was a market in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   And so itsabagel was born. Nestled on Lower Liffey Street, the
shop has become a shrine for those in search of a bagel fix in
Dublin. At lunchtime, crowds snake around the corner toward the
river for which the street is named.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing better than we could ever have hoped,'' Peaches
said, taking a break from one of her 14-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters grew up in the Bahamas. Their father was Scottish,
their mother Irish. Peaches, the elder, went to high school in
Virginia. But after their father died in 1983, their mother decided
to move back to Ireland. Peaches and Domini became accomplished
riders and show jumpers, but they also knew that they had to pay
for their horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a catering business in the early '90s, doing mostly
dinner parties, and Domini helped me,'' said Peaches. ``Domini went
to England to work, and did a course at the Cordon Bleu in
London.''
</P>
<P>
   Domini returned to Dublin and became the business partner of
Conrad Gallagher, one of the most imaginative chefs in Ireland,
helping him to establish Peacock Alley, one of Dublin's most
celebrated restaurants. But when the relationship ended, Domini and
her sister became partners again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domini had the idea about bagels,'' Peaches said. ``We had
bagels in the States, and we knew there was nothing like it in
Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the sisters assumed they would bake their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it was more complicated than we thought,'' Peaches
said.
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, it was more attractive to import
bagels from New York than to bake them in Dublin, or even bring
them in from North London, where there is a plethora of Jewish
bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   So, displaying a business acumen and chutzpah that goes down
well in New York, the sisters Kemp asked the venerable bagel maker,
H &AMP; H of New York, if they could be its exclusive agents in
Ireland. Given that no one was knocking their door down for the
rights to the Irish market, H &AMP; H agreed and the rest was, well,
itsabagel.
</P>
<P>
   If H &AMP; H is good enough for Barbra Streisand, Peaches reasoned,
they're good enough for the punters in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took some convincing,'' Peaches reported, noting that a
company that bakes more than 200 million bagels a year for export
to Germany, France, Japan, and the ultimate bagel critics in
Israel, was somewhat taken aback by the approach from two Gentile
sisters from the most Catholic country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between the kosher company and the Irish
entrepreneurs has proved a mutually beneficial one.
</P>
<P>
   When the first shipment of 80,000 bagels arrived at Dublin
Airport in January 1999, perplexed customs officials scratched
their heads, never having seen anything resembling the mass of
dough before them. But they eventually let in the consignment.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up shop in the Epicurean Food Hall, a temple to the
changing tastes of a Dublin that once considered a balanced diet as
three pints of Guinness and three sausage rolls, itsabagel took off
and hasn't looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had New York Jews come in here and praise our bagels,''
said Peaches, offering perhaps the ultimate testimonial.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, bagels are on offer in some of Dublin's better hotels.
You can get a big, fat New York bagel at the K Club, the exclusive
golf course just outside Dublin. The Kemp sisters are the
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Not ones to rest on their laurels, the Kemp sisters are putting
their own stamp on the New York bagels, garnishing them with Caesar
salad, goat cheese and roasted red peppers, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Kemp sisters been born a century ago, they would, no
doubt, have been part of literary history. One can imagine Leopold
Bloom, the protagonist of James Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' taking a pass
on his gorgonzola sandwich at Davy Byrnes's pub and instead making
a beeline across the Liffey for itsabagel.

EDUCATION NEEDS A HUMAN FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember correspondence courses that promised you the equivalent
of a Harvard education ``from the comfort of your own home?''
</P>
<P>
   A new brand of the old hucksterism was legitimized last week
when the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education gave
degree-granting authority to the first for-profit, online college
in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt Higher Education is a subsidiary of the Newton-based
publishing conglomerate, Harcourt General Inc. It is not affiliated
with any accredited college. It has no track record in teaching.
It's a start-up, gambling that there is profit to be mined in the
public's infatuation with new technology.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a computer-phobic Luddite to have some
doubts about a university without classrooms and a faculty without
faces. The rush to embrace this virtual college _ the board
approved a November start date with little input from educators _
reflects the kind of thinking that has elevated the standardized
test to godlike status. The Internet, like the MCAS, is a tool to
supplement traditional education, not supplant it. Computers are an
efficient means of delivering facts to students, just as
standardized tests are a handy method of retrieving them. But
education is more than information-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt paints a cyber-world in which chat rooms will be
electric with critical analysis and impassioned debate, where shy
students will blossom behind computer screens, where e-mail
exchanges will trump the human interactions of the classroom.
Maybe, but it is hard to imagine a substitute for the spontaneous
magic that happens when an idea catches fire, when one student's
analysis sparks another's reinterpretation, when one student hears
her unarticulated thoughts voiced, and validated, by that very real
fellow across the room. How do you go out for coffee after a
virtual class to continue the discussion?
</P>
<P>
   The most reputable universities are experimenting with online
courses, but not because they are better. They're cheaper. Watching
a lecture online is also more convenient than having to show up at
an appointed place and time and run the risk that the professor is
having an off day. But pre-taped lectures preclude the random
thought, the tangential aside, the relevent anecdote, which occurs
to the lecturer in midstream.
</P>
<P>
   At base, this enterprise is about money. Why else would Harcourt
insist that its ``professors'' use Harcourt-published texts, easily
downloaded from the Harcourt database, in their ``classes''? This
company did not have $2.1 billion in sales last year for lack of
interest in the bottom line. But Harcourt is selling its college as
a noble act of outreach to the elderly, the disabled, and the
working poor. Why should college be accessible only to the young,
the healthy, and people of means? Good question. But if
cyber-learning is the equal of a world-class education, why hasn't
Harvard put those ivy-covered bricks on the block and John Kenneth
Galbraith on videotape?
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Stoll, an astronomer and self-described ``computer
contrarian,'' bristles at inflated claims for the instructional
value of cyberspace. ``Who'll get the live teachers?,'' he asked
last year in his book, ``High Tech Heretic.'' ``The affluent, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoll recounts the experience at Vanderbilt when the university
enrolled 250 students in technology workshops over the Internet.
Only one completed completed the work, but the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation renewed the project's grant to build more cyberspace
courses. ``No pilot project in educational technology has ever been
declared a failure,'' Stoll wrote. `` . . . most (educators) have
been cloyed by a river of money flowing into such `research'
projects. Who do you think gets the grants: those who promise
wonders from electronic classrooms or those who challenge the
results?''
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt expects 1,000 students of health sciences, technology,
and business to enroll the first year, 20,000 in five years. It
doesn't say how many it anticipates will actually earn a two-year
or four-year degree. Like those correspondence courses before it,
Harcourt can make as much money from the dropouts as the graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt may sell itself as a real college but the buyers are
likely to be the same people who thought that ``Survivor'' was
``reality-based'' television.

GORE ATTACKED LIEBERMAN'S DONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the most dramatic moments of Al Gore's
speech at the Democratic National Convention arose when he assailed
HMOs, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical firms. He even cited
the case of a family that had been told to consider putting a sick
child up for adoption because insurers would not pay for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's populist attack may have left his running mate,
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, more than a little uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has accepted more campaign money from insurance
companies in the current election cycle than any other senator, and
has taken the third-highest amount of drug company contributions,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the insurance company responsible for the sick child's
coverage, is based in the senator's home state of Connecticut. And
Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, worked in the early 1980s as director
of policy planning for one of the biggest pharmaceutical firms,
Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign proceeds, Gore may try to make a point of
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's support from
various industries. But because of Lieberman's fund-raising record,
the Bush campaign would have some grounds for a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign aides said there is no real disagreement between
Gore and Lieberman on the health insurance and pharmaceutical
companies, at least not any longer. While Lieberman's ties with
Connecticut's top industries had led him to urge compromise with
the insurance companies, the senator now is in agreement with
Gore's populist attacks, campaign aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Al and Joe are both pushing for a real
prescription-drug benefit opposed by the drug industry and a real
patients' bill of rights opposed by insurance industry,'' said a
Gore spokesman, Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's close ties to the insurance and health industries
are especially striking when Gore's and Bush's campaign
contributions are contrasted. Nearly all of the industries that
Gore has attacked have contributed relatively little to his
campaign, while they have poured money into the coffers of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the insurance industry has contributed nearly $1.5
million to Bush while giving around $300,000 to Gore, and health
professionals have given $2.5 million to Bush compared with
$610,000 to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the oil and gas industry has given $1.6 million to
Bush while providing only $104,000 to Gore, and the auto industry
has given $1.1 million to Bush and just $90,000 to Gore, according
to the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that researches the
ties between money and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is another story. A self-described ``probusiness
Democrat'' whose state is known as the insurance capital of
America, Lieberman has tended to be more accommodating toward the
health and insurance industries than Gore has. For example,
Lieberman was no fan of the health care coverage proposal put
forward by President Clinton in 1993. Instead, he called it ``a
top-down, big welfare-state kind of program.'' The proposal
eventually died in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A Lieberman spokesman, Dan Gerstein, acknowledged that the
senator had opposed the Clinton health bill and often worked to
help the insurance industry in his state. But Gerstein added that
Lieberman also fought the insurance industry over the years,
including an antitrust suit that Lieberman filed when he was the
state's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Senator Lieberman is ashamed in any way for
helping one of the biggest constituents in his state that provides
thousands of jobs to people in Connecticut,'' Gerstein said. ``He
would be remiss in his duties as senator not to be sensitive to the
interests of a major employer in his state.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of those interests are now at odds with the
Gore-Lieberman campaign theme. Gore's convention speech took on
various industries, as he assailed ``big tobacco, big oil, the big
polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's broadsides against health insurance and drug companies
were particularly striking because they are similar to the way
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked those
industries in 1993. At the time, the Clintons hoped their campaign
would lay the groundwork for passing their health-care bill, but
they wound up galvanizing the industries to spend tens of millions
of dollars to kill the measure. The president eventually said he
``bit off more than I could chew'' in urging passage of such a
sweeping bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a narrower set of goals. His criticisms of health
maintenance organizations, for example, are aimed at winning
passage of a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dramatized his point by telling the story of Ian Malone,
who the vice president said suffered a medical mistake at birth and
needed costly treatment. ``Their HMO had told the Malones it would
no longer pay for the nurse they needed, and then told them they
should consider giving Ian up for adoption,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not identify the HMO, but Connecticut-based Aetna has
acknowledged being the parent company. An Aetna spokeswoman, Jill
Griffiths, denied that the HMO had made any suggestion about
adoption. ``Based on discussions with the nurses and case managers
who have been involved in this case, we have absolutely no
knowledge of any statement being made suggesting adoption, which
would be totally against our policy,'' Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ian's father, Dylan Malone, said in a telephone interview
from Everett, Wash., that an Aetna representative did say in a
``delicate'' way that ``if you surrender your custodial rights, the
state would step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he was an unpaid volunteer in Gore's 1988
presidential bid and became involved in this year's campaign after
Gore successfully put pressure on Aetna to pay for Ian's care.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, asked if he had any concern about Lieberman's ties to
the insurance industry, responded: ``I admire the vice president
because he can choose someone who is not lock-step with him on
every issue.'' He also expressed gratitude that Lieberman has
supported a version of the patients' bill of rights that would
enable an independent review of decisions made by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Gore has had mixed feelings about the drug companies.
For instance, Gore successfully advocated more spending on research
and development that helped drug firms, especially through
increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. But Gore
also became convinced the industry is more interested in high
profits instead of lower-cost drugs that would be more widely
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the vice president and Senator Lieberman have been a good
friend of the pharmaceutical industry over the years,'' said Judith
H. Bello, executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America, a 100-company industry group. ``They
have supported better funding for basic research, modernization of
the Food and Drug Administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the past year, many companies belonging to the trade
group have been financing a television ad campaign aimed at
defeating the Clinton administration's current plan to extend
Medicare coverage to prescription drugs, which nearly mirrors
Gore's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad campaign, a group called ``Citizens for Better
Medicare'' revives the successful strategy used in 1993 against the
Clinton health proposal, saying the drug plan would put big
government in everyone's medicine chest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grass-roots-sounding name of the group, the ads,
costing millions of dollars, are paid for mostly by the drug
industry. ``Almost all of the money comes from pharmaceutical
companies,'' said a spokesman for the group, Dan Zielinski. ``A
very small amount comes from citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to use some of the budget surplus to expand Medicare
to include prescription coverage, with the government paying half
the cost of drugs up to $5,000 per year per person. Gore says that
would provide tens of billions of dollars in new sales for a drug
industry that is already highly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry argues that the Gore plan could lead
to price controls on many prescriptions and could limit research
and development of new drugs. Gore, however, said his proposal
would ensure that senior citizens and people with disabilities
could afford prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, as well as Bush, prefers a plan that would rely on
more competition among insurance companies.

TEXAS PRISON GROWTH IS FASTEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JOHN MORITZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas prison system grew faster than any
other in the country over the past decade, and one out of every 20
adults in the state is under the watch of the criminal justice
system, according to national study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer numbers of people in prison and jail in Texas are
signs of system fixated on punishment and devoid of compassion,''
said Vincent Schiraldi, the director of the Justice Policy
Institute of Washington, D.C., and a co-author of the report,
``Texas Tough: An Analysis of Incarceration and Crime Trends in the
Lone Star State.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the institute's study, Texas also has the nation's
largest populations of probationers and parolees.
</P>
<P>
   The report confirms statistics that have long been known to
state criminal justice policy analysts, and several proponents of
tough sanctions for lawbreakers said the numbers represent the
sentiments of most Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have this prison building boom by happenstance,''
said Dianne Clements, president of the crime-victims advocacy
group, Justice for All. ``It happened because the citizens and
taxpayers who live here every day determined that they would no
longer abide a revolving-door prison system. We realize there is a
cost, and we are ready to foot the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   That cost was high and will probably get higher. In the early
1990s, Texas voters authorized spending $1.7 billion in bonds to
triple the size of the state's prison system, which now exceeds
150,000 beds.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers return to Austin in January, they will be asked
to send a $500 million bond package to the voters for the
construction of three maximum-security units.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 163,190 state inmates are in custody in Texas, compared
with 163,107 in California, according to the institute, which
supports alternatives to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabelo, who heads the Texas Criminal Justice Policy
Council, which assesses prison needs for state lawmakers, said the
institute's figures include inmates housed in low-risk
substance-abuse treatment facilities and those in county jails
awaiting transfer to state facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Other significant findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Texas prison population's average annual increase of 11.8
percent during the 1990s was not only the highest growth in the
nation, but was almost twice the average annual growth of the other
states.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Texas were a country, it would have the highest
incarceration rate in the world, easily surpassing that of the
United States and Russia, the next two finishers, and would be
seven times that of the next biggest prison system in China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blacks in Texas are incarcerated at seven times the rate of
whites, and nearly one in three young African-American men in Texas
is under some form of criminal justice control.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is a think tank of the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice, and the study was paid for with a grant from the
Center on Crime, Communities and Culture. The groups provide
programs for families of inmates and look for other solutions to
criminal behavior beyond prisons, such as substance abuse
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The institute determined that Texas added 98,000 inmates to its
prison system in the '90s, which is almost 25,000 more inmates than
the population of New York's entire system. Yet, since 1995, New
York's decline in crime was four times greater than that of Texas,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Texas have almost the same population.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, the crime rate declined much more slowly
in Texas than it did in other large states. From 1993 to 1998,
crime in the Lone Star State fell 5.1 percent, half the national
average, and the least of any of the nation's five largest states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If locking more people up really reduced crime, Texas should
have the lowest crime rate in the country,'' said Jason Ziedenberg,
another co-author of the study. ``The cost of having one in three
young black men under criminal justice control is a steep price to
pay for the states' lackluster crime declines.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, defended the state's criminal justice
policies as tough but fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Texas was right to develop strong laws for dealing
with criminal activities and strong laws covering juvenile crime to
let them know that there are consequences for their behavior,''
said Bush press aide Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the authors of that study might not understand is that
Texas also has been very aggressive in using rehabilitation efforts
and faith-based organizations to change people's hearts. The bottom
line to all these efforts is that, under Gov. Bush, Texas has the
lowest violent crime rate in 26 years and the lowest murder rate
since the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said Texas should be
receptive to critical assessments of its institutions and open to
suggestions of policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is helpful that groups such as this force us to
take a look at impact of our policies,'' Ellis said. ``I firmly
believe in punishing those who break the law, but these are some
pretty graphic statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize that our `lock them up and throw away the
key' mentality is costing us a lot of money. Maybe there is too
much emphasis on dealing with criminal justice issues on the back
end of life rather than on the front end.''

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WRESTLE OVER PHANTOM SURPLUS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By J.R. LABBE 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are
working themselves into a lather, seeing who can impress the most
voters with plans for the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore wants to spend it on more federal programs. He has such
a long litany of new programs, in fact, that his promises extend
way beyond the money projected for the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush wants to give a goodly portion of it _ $1.3
trillion _ back to the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Don't parse this campaign promise too carefully. Even if the
surplus materializes, it's not as if every American _ or even just
the rich ones _ will be getting checks in the mail. Bush doesn't
mean to literally give it ``back''; he means that the government
shouldn't exact as much in taxes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore may be diametric opposites when it comes to
governing philosophies, but they are blood brothers on the subject
of the surplus: Neither can afford to have the American people
figure out that it is nothing more than political smoke and
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Never were two men more happy about the fact that journalists
run from numbers stories like Willie Nelson from the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   People, there is no federal budget surplus _ not if you remove
Social Security taxes from the mix of money rolling into the U.S.
Treasury. Yes, thanks to a firecracker-hot economy, the nation's
operating budget last year was just about balanced for the first
time in almost four decades. But one good year does not make up for
39 years of deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   How best to explain this ... Say your family's living expenses
for a year total $50,000. Last year, because of a generous boss and
sales bonuses, the income-earners in the household brought in
$60,000. You're 10 grand ahead, right? Hello, surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Because you've conveniently overlooked the $25,000
balance you owe on those credit cards _ a balance that you've just
been chipping away at by paying the minimum amount every month plus
interest. Even if you put the total $10,000 toward paying off this
debt, you're still $15,000 in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation's deficit spending has put the national debt at a
staggering $5.6 trillion, appropriately known in government
parlance as the Gross Federal Debt. The interest alone in 1999 was
$353 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly held debt _ money borrowed from the private market _
was $3.6 trillion at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the mathematically challenged, this means the government
owes itself a whopping $2 trillion after borrowing from places like
trust fund surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   And what would be the trust fund of choice from which the
government borrows? Social Security, which for now takes in more
money than it pays out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, use the word ``borrow'' and the implication exists
that one day _ someday _ the money will be paid back. Baby boomers
need to be asking _ no, demanding _ that ``someday'' is now. 'Cause
when they start to retire in droves come 2010, the money they
believed would be available to fund part of their golden years
isn't going to be there.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pushed the surplus deception headlong into the
public psyche when he announced that America had a $124 billion
federal budget surplus in 1999. In June, he added to the
misinformation by telling America that the federal budget surplus
would total nearly $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   One tiny little detail was left out of the press release: Almost
every last dime of it was in the Social Security trust fund, which
is not part of on-budget accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Office of Management and Budget's ``A Citizen's Guide
to the Federal Budget'' explains it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the unified budget first booked a surplus of $69 billion
in 1998, the on-budget accounts were /still in deficit by $30
billion.'' In 1999, the unified budget ran a $124 billion surplus,
nearly all of which was the result of the Social Security surplus.
The on-budget accounts were almost exactly in balance'' (emphasis
added).
</P>
<P>
   The ``surplus'' is almost all in an account that isn't supposed
to be touched for anything other than Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear the presidential candidates talk about projected
budget surpluses that reach into the trillions, and about only
using that portion of the surplus that isn't needed to shore up
Social Security, remember that Gross Federal Debt. Even if they
repaid the $2 trillion taken out of the trust fund, talking about
tax cuts and new federal programs when we're still $3.6 trillion in
debt is ... well, gross.

&HT;     BUYER OF DINOSAUR FOSSIL TO GIVE ITEM TO MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A retired businessman who spent $167,500 to buy
a 200-million-year-old flying reptile fossil has thrilled
paleontologists with his pledge to give the significant find back
to a New York museum.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Spight said he decided to buy the fossil after reading
about it in the newspaper and then discussing it with
paleontologists at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that science has access to these kinds of
things,'' he said. ``I couldn't stand the thought of it going into
a private collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists who have railed against the sale for profit of
scientific artifacts were delighted that the sale of the fossil
Sunday night was hardly a blockbuster. Instead, it brought in the
minimum bid required to keep Butterfields auction house from
pulling it back off the block.
</P>
<P>
   Resembling a large dragonfly and preserved on a shale slab,
Icarosaurus siefkeri has a storied and controversial 40-year
history. It once convinced scientists that vertebrates glided
through the air millions of years earlier than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the fossil has given flight to a debate about whether
scientific artifacts should be sold on the open market _ a debate
that has escalated with the growth of Internet-based auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil was discovered in 1960 by three teen-agers in North
Bergen, N.J. One of them claimed ownership and 10 years ago removed
it from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, saying
he needed to sell it to pay his medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfields, which is owned by the eBay Internet site and has
locations in Los Angeles and San Francisco, offered hundreds of
natural-history relics for sale during Sunday night's auction. The
house also auctioned a grab handle from the Apollo 11 module that
landed on the moon in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sale is being probed by the National Aeronauts and
Space Administration, a 41-year-old retired computer industry
executive from Monterey Bay, Calif., who declined to give his name,
spent $34,500 on the piece and said it was ``just a really cool
thing'' that he wanted all his friends to touch.
</P>
<P>
   The highest drama of the night occurred courtesy of Spight.
Spight in 1996 sold Diablo Communications, an antenna tower
company, to the larger American Tower Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Auction officials said Spight was one of at least three bidders
interested in the late Triassic-period fossil, and one of at least
two who planned to donate it to a museum. They declined to identify
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Spight successfully bid $150,000 for the fossil. He also must
pay a $17,500 buyer's premium.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at his New Jersey home Sunday evening, the seller of
the fossil, Alfred Siefker, 56, was shocked to hear the price,
which he said was the minimum allowed. It was listed at $250,000 to
$350,000 in the auction guide, and Siefker years ago had hoped it
would fetch up to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my god, I can't believe that,'' Siefker said. ``I had a
stroke 10 years ago, I'm in pain 24 hours a day. That was my lease
on life _ I don't know what I'm going to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Siefker, who had been criticized by some paleontologists for
trying to profit from the artifact, said he was glad to learn that
the buyer planned to donate it to a museum.

   WORKPLACE-WORRIES (Boise, Idaho) _ Few people still talk about
fretting over whether they can find work. Worries over the quality
of those jobs, however, remain a signature part of the economy for
many people. Many say they are concerned that they cannot keep up
with technological changes or that they are working too many hours
or that their health care coverage is inadequate. This insecurity
may be less significant than the version of early and mid-1990s,
and it may even be exciting for many young or well-educated
workers. But economists say the shift helps to explain perhaps the
most enduring mystery of today's economy: why wage pressures, while
on the upswing, remain more modest than they were in the milder and
shorter economic booms of the recent past. By David Leonhardt.

 (ART ADV: Illustrations showing the Robomow and the Auto Mower are
available on Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at
212-499-3355.)
 By REBECCA DAY 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few chores evoke such dread as the weekly lawn cut, and new
grass-munching robots that take over that job promise to make more
than a few Christmas lists this year. Robomow ($695) from Friendly
Robotics and Auto Mower ($1,999) from Husqvarna run off
rechargeable batteries and mow lawns with up to 20-degree grades.
The computerized cutters pack on-board sensors that receive signals
generated from a permanently installed perimeter wire that defines
the area in which the mowers roam. If the mower moves beyond the
perimeter wire, it stops.
</P>
<P>
   Husqvarna's Auto Mower is making its U.S. debut this year after
a two-year run in Sweden where the company has sold more than 5,000
devices, according to Dennis Willis, product manager for Husqvarna.
Auto Mower can handle up to a half-acre of grass and is designed to
maintain the property daily, rather than on the typical once-a-week
schedule. Because it is trimming the grass rather than going for a
full cut, the mower can cover a wider area in less time than it
could on a less frequent mowing schedule with longer grass.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy is dictated largely by battery capacity. The
nickel-metal-hydride battery runs for 1.5 hours off a single charge
and requires an hour for recharging. When the mower reaches half
its battery capacity, it looks for a signal that comes from the
docking station and motors itself over to it for recharge. A
recharging wire extends from the docking station and guides the
mower onto its power booster.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Mower cuts in a random pattern, which Willis says hits
all the different areas of the property frequently enough that the
grass will be kept at the length you've programmed the mower to
maintain. It takes about an hour to cut 1,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The robotized mowers make strong environmental claims as well.
Since the mowers don't use a gasoline-powered engine, there are no
emissions and blade noise is barely perceptible. In fact, says
Willis, you can program Auto Mower to do late-night manicures
without disturbing the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood, the Auto Mower has a 24-megahertz processor,
software and sensors. Two collision sensors react to obstacles the
mower hits, such as a tree or an object in the yard. When the mower
hits an object, it stops, backs up and then turns right or left to
continue mowing. A lift sensor shuts off the blade rotation if
someone tries to raise the 15-pound mower above three-quarters of
an inch, and a tilt sensor stops the blades if the mower shifts
from its level plane.
</P>
<P>
   And if the neighbor's curious 5-year-old tries to reach under
the machine while no one's looking? The blades only rotate when the
machine is moving forward, Willis says. The only way for someone to
be cut is to walk along the side of the machine as it is moving and
reach an arm under the mower without touching the machine's
collision sensors, which is an unlikely feat.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than mowing in a random pattern as the Auto Mower does,
Friendly Robotics' Robomow scoots in a forward-and-back ``V''
pattern from one side of the lawn to another. Its navigational
system is a floating compass that uses two settings for forward and
backward direction. Once the mower reaches the perimeter wire and
knows it can't go any farther, the on-board computer issues two new
compass settings and the mower mows in the same V-shaped pattern
against the previous path. In the process the mower fills in any
spots it missed on the last pass, according to John Bunton, who
heads sales and marketing for Friendly Robotics. ``It mows in the
most efficient way possible,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Robomow measures 42 inches long, 23 inches wide and 16.8 inches
high. It weighs 120 pounds _ due largely to its two 12-volt
lead-acid batteries. The mower will cover 5,000 to 6,000 square
feet at a clip, depending on the thickness of the grass and turf
type, according to Bunton. Robomow cuts until the owner shuts off
the machine using a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Robomow packs 10 sensors, including four bumpers on each side of
the machine. When the bumpers hit an object, the impact sends a
puff of air through a hose to a diaphragm on the mower's computer
sensor board. The sensor board issues a command for the mower to
stop and change direction. In addition, proximity sensors in the
front and rear send out a sonarlike signal that tells the mower to
slow down when it comes within 3 feet of an object, Bunton says.
</P>
<P>
   Robomow comes with batteries, charger, perimeter switch and
wire, pegs to secure the wire, a manual controller, instruction
manuals and video. Bunton says users can have the mower out of the
box and running in four hours, which includes tacking down the
perimeter wire, programming in a security code and programming
on/off times for the mower to operate.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-bit Hitachi microprocessor, the brain of the mower, is
supported by 128KB RAM and 512KB upgradable flash memory.

   DINO HAD A WARM-BLOODED HEART
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech look at a fossilized dinosaur heart suggests the
beasts that once ruled the Earth may have had more in common with
humans than lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this specimen have a heart, but computer-enhanced
images of its chest strongly suggest it is a four-chambered,
double-pump heart with a single systemic aorta, more like the heart
of a mammal or bird than a reptile,'' according to Dale Russell, a
paleontologist at North Carolina State University.
</P>
<P>
   The 66 million-year-old Thescelosaurus, found in South Dakota in
1993, was later acquired by the state's Museum of Natural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The specimen is unique because it has an intact heart. Russell's
colleagues at his state's veterinary medicine school made
two-dimensional computerized tomography scans, from which they
created a 3D model. ``It challenges some of our most fundamental
theories about how and when dinosaurs evolved,'' he says.

<P>
   ICE HINTS AT WATER ON MARS
</P>
<P>
   Geologic structures associated with ice on Earth have been
spotted on the first close-up images of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The features, which are about the size of an SUV, look like
gullies and the deposits of soil and rocks caused by flowing water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The features appear to be so young that they might be forming
today,'' says Michael Malin, of Malin Space Science Systems, San
Diego, Calif., the principal investigator for the Mars Orbiter
Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists previously discounted water on Mars because the
atmospheric pressure at the surface of the red planet is so low
that water would immediately begin to boil.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers now conjecture that when water evaporates, it cools
the ground. Water behind the initial seepage site freezes, creating
an ice dam. When it breaks, it pushes a flood of debris down the
gully.
</P>
<P>
   To follow up on this discovery, NASA plans to put
instrumentation on its 2003 mission to Mars to confirm that the
structures are indeed formed by ice.

   TARANTULA IS A HEART-STARTER
</P>
<P>
   University of Buffalo biophysicists have identified an
ingredient in Chilean tarantula venom that can be used to treat
patients with congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, called GsMTx-4, is one of 150 components isolated
from the venom. It can interfere with the swelling that occurs
during congestive heart failure. The way it interacts with cells
suggests it might be useful in treating other conditions, such as
brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to turn the venom component into a drug for
humans.
</P>
<P>
   SEEING HOW RADIATION DAMAGES CELLS
</P>
<P>
   Add to the list of accidental scientific discoveries the first
``movie'' of radiation damaging a protein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The observation was stunning,'' says Joel Sussman, a visiting
biologist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that the energy associated with
various types of radiation can split apart proteins. While
attempting to image the chemical reactions that take place in an
important enzyme of the nervous system, scientists found that the
X-ray beam they were using to illuminate their target was
systematically destroying it. ``It looks like we are seeing weak
points in protein structures that are particularly sensitive to
ionizing radiation,'' says Sussman.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhaven scientists now plan to examine the anti-radiation
potential of various chemicals for use in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   PINBALL TEACHES PHYSICS
</P>
<P>
   Students at Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Ill., have
found a way to harness the powerful force of pinball machines to
learn physics.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a $10,000 grant from Toyota Motor Sales USA,
students constructed the Imagination Maze _ a 9-by-11-foot vertical
pinball machine.
</P>
<P>
   The student-designed maze uses a screw lift to bring a billiard
ball to an elevated starting point. The ball then randomly falls
into one of four tracks. On the way down it strikes a series of
bells, ramps, trampolines, dominoes, loops and jumps before coming
to rest. At the bottom, it's back up the screw lift for another
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with giving this year's students the hands-on experience
of creating a real machine, we intend to use this to teach future
physics students,'' says adviser Scott Welty.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE TEAMS BOW TO CADETS
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how to stretch a gallon of gasoline, talk to
the cadets at St. Thomas Academy in Mendota Heights, Minn. The
military school's entry into this year's Supermileage competition
achieved an astounding 1,131 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   The team not only beat the second-place winner in the high
school category by 500 mpg, they also out-drove all 10 college
teams. The best that first-place winner Cedarville College of Ohio
could do was 632 mpg. And the trip to the Eaton Proving Grounds in
Marshall, Mich., wasn't even the cadets' best race. Their car
reached 1,322 mpg at the Minnesota Technology Education Association
Supermileage Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-pound, 3.5-horsepower car is built around a carbon-fiber
and foam-core body.

 (ART ADV: Illustrations showing each of the saws and a chart of
specifications of each are available on Newscom or by calling
William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.)
 By THOMAS KLENCK 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first question we all want answered when any new cordless
tool hits the marketplace is how close does it come to corded-tool
performance. Face it, 120-volt AC is still the standard. And until
someone fits 100 of those 1.2-volt cells in a battery pack, we'll
have to make a few compromises in power and performance. But
circular saws are looking better and better.
</P>
<P>
   To get the real story, we rounded up eight of the latest,
high-voltage cordless saws built for both consumers and
professionals. What did we find? Well, don't buy one to build a
house, but for everything from light-duty remodeling to modest
framing projects, these tools are real contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE SAWS
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when a cordless circular saw was only suitable
for handling 1/4-inch-thick panels. The saws we tested are all
designed to handle 2-inch stock, and the high-end tools even cut
through standard framing lumber with the blade set at 45 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   All of the saws come with thin-kerf, carbide-tipped blades for
good reason. More than any corded saw, the performance of these
tools is dependent on the blade _ there's no reserve to force it
through if it is at all dull, and a narrow kerf requires less
energy because there's less wood to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are not selling just cordless saws, they're
selling cordless systems. So, a good portion of our test tools are
marketed in combination packages with one or more other tools that
use the same battery pack. Skil, for example, doesn't offer its saw
as a stand-alone product, and the only way to buy a Ryobi 18-volt
saw without a drill is to buy it without a battery pack and
charger.
</P>
<P>
   Most experienced carpenters view an unplugged power tool as a
safe tool. However, it's easy to forget that when the battery pack
of a cordless saw is in place, the tool is effectively plugged in.
Extra care is needed with these tools as it is dangerously easy to
get the blade spinning without intending to.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK &AMP; DECKER CS144
</P>
<P>
   The B&AMP;D Firestorm consumer-level entry has a few design features
that make it stand out, even when compared to the high-end tools.
For example, instead of placing the handle over the motor housing,
B&AMP;D puts it directly over the blade. While balance suffers when the
tool hangs in your hand, the idea works because it centers pushing
effort behind the blade. And B&AMP;D makes an honest stab at improving
blade visibility with a clear plastic window in the blade guard.
It's a great idea as long as you keep it clean.
</P>
<P>
   While the Firestorm cuts 2-by-4 lumber at 90 degrees, it won't
cut at 45 degrees. And, at 14.4 volts, you can tell that framing
lumber is an effort. However, our test places this tool's
performance near that of Ryobi and Skil, and you don't need to buy
a drill with the saw.
</P>
<P>
   BOSCH 1660K
</P>
<P>
   With 24-volt power pushing a 6 1/2-inch, 18-tooth, thin-kerf
blade at 3500 rpm, you may just forget that the Bosch 1660K has no
cord.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of features, we liked the highly visible blade-depth
scale on the rear of the blade guard, and there's a hinged dust
port for a shop vacuum. We found the rubber-backed grip
comfortable, and the trigger and trigger-release both worked
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   While the bevel quadrant has a setscrew stop for 90-degree cuts,
there isn't one for 45 degrees. Instead, the saw has a spring-clip
stop that you push out of the way to allow the blade to go beyond
45 degrees. We found this mechanism uncertain and clumsy. Finally,
at 9.6 pounds, the Bosch is almost as heavy as a corded saw.
</P>
<P>
   DEWALT DW007K
</P>
<P>
   Like the Bosch, the 24-volt DeWalt DW007K is heavy, powerful and
big. Unfortunately, blade visibility is not very good. The saw's
cast-aluminum baseplate is the largest in our group, providing a
stable, heavy-duty feel. The base has an integral bevel quadrant
and a setscrew for 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   DeWalt uses a battery pack that slides in laterally, rather than
the plug-in version most other makers prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Without a dust port, blade-depth scale, on-board blade wrench,
45-degree bevel capability and adjustable kerf indicator, this is a
no-frills saw, but one that's sure to meet the requirements of most
power users.
</P>
<P>
   HITACHI C6DC
</P>
<P>
   If the Bosch and DeWalt are the heavyweights of this test, the
Hitachi C6DC falls in the middleweight category. The 18-volt saw
feels relatively light and handy _ qualities that might easily be
more important than sheer power for many cordless users.
</P>
<P>
   This carefully detailed saw is well-balanced with comfortable
grips and an easily accessible trigger release. It has good blade
visibility because the pivot link for the baseplate is on the motor
housing rather than the front of the blade guard. What really
helps, though, is a small lamp that illuminates the area in front
of the blade as soon as the trigger release is depressed.
</P>
<P>
   The baseplate is a nickel-plated casting with integral quadrant
and adjustable kerf indicator. The degree scale is precise and
there's a setscrew for the 90-degree position.
</P>
<P>
   MAKITA 5620DWA
</P>
<P>
   As the Bosch and DeWalt saws encourage comparison, so do the
Hitachi and Makita. Both are 18-volt, both just over 7 1/2 pounds
and both combine good power with cordfree user friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   Makita's businesslike entry features a heavy, 5/32-inch-thick
aluminum baseplate instead of the ribbed cast versions on most
other high-end tools. And in place of the integral bevel quadrant
on cast bases, Makita has a simple screwed-on steel quadrant. While
it lacks the glamour of a casting, this base may better handle
abuse, and the saw should be easier to repair. The base has scales
to help determine blade position on the work, and the kerf
indicator is a simple, fixed notch.
</P>
<P>
   This saw is well-balanced and smooth running. The
trigger-release button is very easy to reach and engage _ almost
too easy to be an effective safety device.
</P>
<P>
   PORTER-CABLE 9845
</P>
<P>
   The 9845 is the cordless version of Porter-Cable's popular Saw
Boss circular saw. It features a stamped-steel baseplate with
oversize levers that lock bevel angle and blade depth, cast blade
guards and a hinged dust port.
</P>
<P>
   P-C uses a unique 19.2-volt battery pack that slides into the
rear of the tool, much like the DeWalt design. Although the saw is
not that much longer than the DeWalt, it seems like it is. To
accommodate the pack, the handle is elongated toward the rear,
which makes the tool very nose heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The 9845 has a 6-inch blade, but still manages to saw 45-degree
bevels in 2-inch stock. In fact, it cuts deeper at 45 degrees than
the Makita and Hitachi 6 1/2-inch saws. The bevel quadrant features
setscrew stops for 90 degrees and 45 degrees, and the base has an
adjustable kerf indicator.
</P>
<P>
   RYOBI R10730K2
</P>
<P>
   The 18-volt Ryobi saw comes in a combination kit with a drill,
and is aimed at medium- to light-duty use. We found this left-blade
saw comfortable to handle , and the bevel and depth adjustments are
easy to make. It has a stamped-steel baseplate that adjusts to 50
degrees, with a setscrew stop at 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   While Ryobi usually combines performance with good price, we
found this saw on the light side for the tasks it seems intended to
handle. Crosscutting 2-by-4 lumber is an effort, and ripping 2-inch
stock was out of the question. In fact, we easily managed to
overheat the saw's motor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tool has an arbor lock to facilitate blade
changing, it didn't work on our tool. And, the 5 1/2-inch blade
doesn't cut as deeply as the 5 3/8-inch blade on the Skil or B&AMP;D
tools.
</P>
<P>
   SKIL 289SK
</P>
<P>
   Like the Ryobi, the Skil saw is bundled with a drill for those
who want an entry-level cordless system. Like both B&AMP;D and Ryobi,
this tool won't handle 45-degree bevel cuts in 2-inch stock. It
features a small stamped-steel baseplate, fixed kerf indicator,
50-degree bevel capacity, and it comes with a rip guide. The Skil
has a dust-collection port, although it's covered with a plug that
looks easy to lose.
</P>
<P>
   We found this tool comfortable to use and easy to adjust, even
though the motor sounds considerably rougher than the other tools.

<P>
   LIGHT SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time it's drizzly and cold out, my car won't start _ at
least not until the sun comes out for a few hours and things dry
out. Really cold weather is fine, it's just rainy days and nights.
</P>
<P>
   I opened the hood to look at the engine and had my wife turn the
key. Arcs and sparks danced up and down the wires. Is my car
possessed by rain-hating aliens? Do I have to move to the desert?
</P>
<P>
   _ Henry Fishbine, Bangor, Maine
</P>
<P>
   A: The short-term solution is to use a hair dryer, and just dry
out the wires when this happens. Be sure you use a heavy-gauge
extension cord because your hair dryer uses a lot of current. Those
arcs you see in the dark are the high-voltage pulses intended to
fire the spark plugs running to ground down the lower-resistance
path created by the moisture along the wet outer insulation of the
wires.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term solution is to replace the wires with new ones.
This might be expensive _ new wires for some cars are over a
hundred bucks. Try removing the wires one at a time and cleaning
them with some mild detergent. Don't use any solvent-based
cleaners, as this might degrade the insulation on the wires. In
fact, detail the entire engine compartment to keep the area clean
and, consequently, drier.
</P>
<P>
   Tow-truck operators see this no-start condition a lot. Their
quick-start fix is to spray the wires with some petroleum-based
water-displacing penetrating lubricant. It gets the car started,
but it leaves a gummy, dirt-retaining film on the wires. If you are
forced to do this, be sure to clean up afterward.
</P>
<P>
   WIMPY WAGON
</P>
<P>
   Q. We bought a 1997 Ford Escort LX wagon, figuring it would be a
good second car. It has been running fine. But when I turn the
heater or air conditioner on, the engine really lags. There's a
noticeable drop in performance when the air-conditioning compressor
cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a common problem with Escorts? Are the electrical power
requirements of the heater and air-conditioning equipment too
demanding for its electrical system?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ernest Hardee, Newport, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not the electrical demand. It's the pure mechanical
input needed to spin the air-conditioning compressor and pressurize
the refrigerant. The horsepower needed for this represents a
substantial proportion of the excess power available from the
Escort's underpowered four-banger. And when you load it up with
several people and luggage, passing reserve is pretty much a joke.
</P>
<P>
   I drove a rental car in Colorado Springs a few years back that
didn't have enough power to pull third gear in the automatic
transmission on the freeway if the air conditioner was on. I had to
either shut off the air conditioning, or leave the transmission in
second to keep it from hunting back and forth between third and
second when I tried to use drive. The high altitude sapped enough
power to leave the engine totally maxed out just keeping up with
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   TIME TO DIAGNOSE ABS
</P>
<P>
   Q: My ABS and brake lights came on after pulling a trailer and
boat home. I took my time and did not overuse the brakes. Trying to
get the light to go off, I unhooked the battery for 30 minutes, but
the light was still on when I hooked it back up. I've changed the
front brake lines and the brake fluid is clear. The only code on
the truck was 12 after I hooked up the battery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott, via Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: I doubt that towing a trailer was responsible, unless, of
course, you towed this boat out of the water on a boat ramp and
water got into the ABS sender. If you're sure the system is bled
properly, and all the normal hydraulic and mechanical bits are up
to snuff, it's time to start diagnosing the ABS.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately that's difficult to do without access to the
computer-based diagnostic tool designed for this purpose. It could
be something as simple as a loose connector on one of the ABS
tone-wheel sensors or something as complicated (and expensive) as a
failed ABS hydraulic pump/controller. Get the appropriate manual
and start diagnosing, if you feel up to it. Judging by the tone of
your letter, you're already over your head. It's time to consult a
mechanic who works on Dodge ABS systems regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ALONE IN THE GARAGE
</P>
<P>
   A. Recently my 1996 Infiniti Q45 was left in a closed garage
with the motor running for five hours. When I discovered it, the
temperature gauge was reading normal. The engine oil had been
changed three weeks before. The car seems fine. But should I
perform any preventive maintenance or other diagnostics? Should I
worry about any future problems?
</P>
<P>
   _ Manny Gonzalez, via Internet
</P>
<P>
   It's fine. I normally don't recommend warming a car up for more
than the time it takes to set your seat position and rearview
mirrors and buckle your seatbelt. You should have no problems. I
wouldn't even bother to change the oil early.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that police cars are subject to extensive periods of
idling during their life spans, as well as ambulances and other
types of working vehicles. If the cooling system is up to the task,
the only real concern is premature camshaft wear. That shouldn't be
a problem with the overhead-cam valvetrain on your Q.

HEALTH CARE IS ONE LINE IN THE SAND FOR GORE AND BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM WRIGHT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basic, irreconcilable difference between Vice President Al
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, and between their respective parties,
comes into sharp focus when we consider the issues relating to
public health.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to work toward universal health care insurance for
every citizen, starting first with the children. Bush, in response,
asks why President Clinton didn't compromise this matter out with
the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to provide by law that the cost of prescription drugs
be covered under Medicare. Bush says he prefers a GOP resolution
that merely encourages HMOs and insurance companies to include
drugs in their health care packages.
</P>
<P>
   Gore unequivocally endorses the Patients Bill of Rights pending
before Congress. The bill, among other things, places
decision-making power on individual cases in the hands of attending
physicians, not insurance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refers vaguely to a substitute being considered by GOP
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore points to studies showing that more and more Americans have
no health coverage at all; that medical bills are going up much
faster than wages (with prescription drugs rising fastest of all);
and that Americans of modest income increasingly find
hospitalization unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responds that Gore, by reciting these facts, is promoting
class warfare.
</P>
<P>
   So the general debate proceeds on issue after issue. A pattern
is forming. The vice president offers a specific proposal to abate
a specific problem. Bush retorts by attempting to discredit Gore
personally.
</P>
<P>
   On the need to reform campaign finance, Gore in June laid out
his plan to curb abuses. Bush, ignoring the substance of the plan,
demanded that Gore explain again why he attended a fund-raiser at a
Buddhist temple four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Again, in his acceptance speech, Gore declared that the first
bill he'll send to Congress will be to clean up campaign spending.
He also said he'd eagerly sign the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill
to outlaw ``soft money'' if Congress will pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Without revealing whether he'd sign such a measure, Bush
reiterated simply that the vice president has ``no credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did opine once during the New Hampshire primary that any
Republican would be foolish to vote for McCain's bill. He said it
would amount to ``unilateral disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   These widely differing attitudes in both substance and campaign
style come to a head on that range of issues affecting health care.
The public has an increasing stake in their outcome. Consider the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _ During the 1990s, the cost of drugs more than doubled. In the
last two years, prices for the 50 most prescribed drugs for older
Americans have shot upward four times faster than the rate of
inflation. Some of them have risen by 100 percent or more.
Clorazepate, a monopoly of Mylan Laboratories, rose by 3,200
percent!
</P>
<P>
   More and more, elderly citizens living on modest fixed incomes
face daily choices between buying prescribed medications or buying
food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medical expenditures, the typical family's fastest-escalating
economic necessity, already cost Americans about $1 trillion
annually. They're predicted to double by 2007 and then to gobble up
16 percent of our entire gross national product. (That's more than
twice the share in any other advanced democracy.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The personal outlay required of average citizens has grown,
while corporations shuck off health care costs by outsourcing
contracts and downsizing their own employment rolls. The number of
firms offering health benefits to employees fell sharply in the
'90s. As result, more individual citizens are left without
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of uninsured Americans keeps growing. About 46
million have no health insurance today. An estimated one-fourth of
all adults between 18 and 64 go without needed treatment because
they can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Others who want and need insurance can't buy it because of their
medical histories. They're adrift. Need it, can't buy it, can't get
treatment without it.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to go more than a week without hearing of some new
outrage involving denial of physician-prescribed treatment to some
suffering patient by bottom-line-oriented health care providers on
strictly financial _ not medical _ grounds.
</P>
<P>
   This issue may be the real sleeper this year. It won't be solved
by tax cuts or by flailing at ``big government.'' Nor is it an
answer to silence debate by decrying ``class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is real, and people want solutions.

   HAZING _ WASHINGTON _ The biggest high school hazing survey ever
is to be released Monday. The survey on the extent, nature and
consequences of ``Initiation Rites in American High Schools'' was
conducted by researchers from Alfred University in New York, who
last year surveyed colleges on hazing nationally after one of
Alfred's students died. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 16.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Paul Thompson has a pig farm
three miles west of Stuart, Fla. where he, his wife, and the pigs
have lived happily since 1957 _ until recently. In the mid-1990s a
developer bought the neighboring land and built a golf course and
some swanky houses. Now they want the pig farmer to go because the
newcomers are objecting to the smell, and to the country music
Farmer Thompson plays most days to keep his porkers happy. You tell

cafeterias, bars, offices, gyms and student unions everywhere. When
faced with these conversations do you say, ``No, I have no
knowledge of this 'Survivor' thing of which you speak'' and sound
like a snob? A spoilsport affecting the air of an ethical
vegetarian at a weenie roast? (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal)

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: New ways to view the English
countryside
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Friend of mine called from England last week to
tell me what a good time he and his wife were having.
</P>
<P>
   I have a theory about people calling from faraway places to tell
me what a good time they're having.
</P>
<P>
   The more they call, the more they're wishing they were back
home.
</P>
<P>
   My friend called twice in two days.
</P>
<P>
   First day he called, he was telling me how exciting it was to be
traveling the English countryside. Flowers were everywhere. The
villages were delightful. The quaint little inns were everything
you could wish for.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly good.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, I have traveled somewhat in the English countryside.
I don't remember the flowers so much, but it was very exciting.
</P>
<P>
   It was very exciting to be driving on the wrong side of the road
on country roads about the width of a driveway back home.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why I didn't see the flowers. I was too occupied
seeing my impending death by car crash about to unfold before my
very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the villages, they are nice enough. Never mind the
pungent odor of burning plastic. That's from their major industry _
American tourism. This time of year the credit card imprinting
machines are fairly smoking.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, have stayed at quaint little inns. The operative word is
``little'' _ room, bed, bathroom, food portions _ everything but
the rate.
</P>
<P>
   Groucho Marx said it well about a Hotel Hovel where he once
stayed:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing thinner than the towels were the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend, when he called that first time, was all aglow about
the Old English ambience of their inn, what he called a manor, on
the outskirts of the village. Later he and his wife planned to walk
into town to enjoy the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The manor staff, he said, had suggested they go across hill and
vale rather than along the road, for a real taste of the English
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   He called again the next day. It was much the same story.
Flowers were still everywhere, villages were still delightful,
quaint little inns were still everything you could wish for.
</P>
<P>
   Except... Well, he wished the manor staff hadn't directed them
to take the route into the village over hill and vale.
</P>
<P>
   It seems he got a real taste of the English countryside, indeed,
when he managed to trip and fall face first into an expansive area
of muddy English countryside.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time they finally reached the village, his appearance
being what it was _ and to the English, appearance being everything
_ weary and hungry though they were, no restaurant would allow him
entrance. His lovely wife, yes; the muddy American, no.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could any taxi driver be convinced to take them back to
their quaint little inn _ not for even double the fare, not if it
meant the muddy American defiling a public conveyance.
</P>
<P>
   Not so jolly. Not so good.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a pub owner took pity on them and, for a price that was
exceedingly more than a pittance, allowed them a serving fish and
chips at the bar and use of the toilet for my friend to tidy
himself up. Eventually, they were able to find a cab back to the
manor.
</P>
<P>
   And they're back home now. Fact is, they returned a day earlier
than planned. But when I asked my friend if he were glad to be
home, he just sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, England, he said. How he wished they were still in England.
The flowers, the villages, the inns ...
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, England, I said. Let us toast England. The flowers, the
villages, the inns ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's mud in your eye.

<P>
   Ah, the weird twists and turns life in Hollywood can take. Once
upon a time, Bob Saget was a moderately successful white-bread
stand-up comedian. He became better known as the Olsen twins'
on-screen dad in the saccharine kiddie sitcom ``Full House,'' then
scored again as the host of ``America's Funniest Home Videos.'' Now
he turns up tonight as the director of ``Becoming Dick,'' a comedy
about the terrible things you have to do to make it in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, debuting at 9 on cable's E!, stars Harland Williams
as Richard, an unemployed actor whose best friend (Saget again, in
a small role) tells him he's just too nice a guy to succeed in the
industry. Richard wakes up four years later, a major star and a
major creep, and tries to figure out what happened to him. The
supporting cast includes Robert Wagner as his butler (Talk about
twists and turns!) and Elizabeth Berkley as his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   If it's backstage savagery you want, of course, just flip on
``E! True Hollywood Story.'' But you can't blame Saget if he wants
us to know that he does, in fact, have an adult thought in his
head. He's suffered so much, the least we can do is watch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Open Tennis, 7:30 on USA: There's also a wrap-up show at
12:35 a.m. on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: Allegations have surfaced over the
last couple of weeks that this repellent ``reality'' show is even
more manipulative than we've suspected. (Check out the online
magazine Salon.com for details.) One more reason not to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends,'' NBC at 8: It's the one with Bruce Willis as the
father of the student Ross is dating. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Smackdown!'' UPN at 8: Regis Philbin hosts. (Kidding! Just
checking to see if you're paying attention!)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC at 9: Regis Philbin
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave,'' CBS at 8:30: Popular 1993 comedy about an everyday Joe
who's drafted to impersonate the president, who's had a stroke
while committing a Clintonian indiscretion. Kevin Kline stars.
There are nice turns by Sigourney Weaver (as the first lady) and
Kevin Dunn, but the best is Bonnie Hunt in a now legendary bit as a
goofy White House tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC at 8:30: Two reruns air back-to-back. In
the second, Sydney Pollack, the director (``Tootsie'') and actor
(``Eyes Wide Shut''), guests as Will's father, who isn't as
comfortable with Will's gayness as he seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali: An American Hero,'' Fox at 8: Lively biopic covers Ali's
struggles with the American government as well as with Joe Frazier

   It's the start of a holiday weekend, the end of summer, too, and
the television outlook is dismal. So we might as well go all the
way and answer the question, what's the worst we can watch?
</P>
<P>
   Made-for-cable movies are always likely candidates. ``Best
Actress,'' a TV movie debuting at 9 on E!, has potential. It's the
sudsy story of behind-the-scenes Oscar machinations, and the cast
includes Thomas Calabro, Rachel Hunter and Gary Busey, plus Anthony
Stewart Head _ better known as the guy in the Taster's Choice
commercials, and more recently, that English guy on ``Buffy.''
Sounds grim. ``The Darkling,'' on Sci Fi at 9, also seems
promising. F. Murray Abraham _ remember him? _ plays a guy who
makes a pact with a demon and _ duh! _ lives to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is often a good place to look for bad TV. On ``The Strip,''
at 8, Vegas gumshoes Elvis and Jesse probe an arrogant magician's
death. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   On pay-per-view tonight, ``Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo'' is all
over the schedule. And Will Smith's ``Wild, Wild West'' disaster is
on HBO at 8.
</P>
<P>
   For news fans, there's ``Is America No. 1?'' with John Stossel
on ABC at 10. Stossel's tilting against the windmills of political
correctness once seemed endearing, but now his ego alone makes this
a candidate for the night's worst show. The recent brouhaha in
which some test results were misrepresented in one of his segments
adds flavor. And if that's not enough, it's a rerun.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, as on most nights, the winner of tonight's
worst-show award is ... ``Big Brother,'' on CBS at 8. If this is
reality, give me UPN anytime.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence,'' NBC at 8: One of those wacky episodes that
long-running series occasionally indulge in to break the monotony.
Tonight, a migraine puts Syd (Melina Kanakaredes) in Alice's
Wonderland. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Blues,'' WB at 8: Back-to-back reruns of the animated
comedy based on the popular comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the Band,'' ABC at 8:30: The boys hit Cancun for some R
and R. Think they'll meet some girls in bikinis? (Last week's
episode is rerun at 8.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' NBC at 10: One complaint
about this show has been that there's not enough of Detective
Munch, the mordant cynic that actor Richard Belzer transferred over
from ``Homicide'' when that series was canceled. Tonight, Munch
steps to the fore, befriending a TV reporter (Jennifer Esposito)
who was assaulted. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``U-Pick,'' Nickelodeon at 8: An hour of viewer-chosen segments
includes bits from ``Real Monsters,'' ``SpongeBob'' and
``Rugrats,'' some more entertaining than most of what passes for
adult TV tonight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Open Tennis,'' USA at 7:30: There's also a wrap-up on CBS
at 12:35.
</P>
<P>
   ''1999 Video Music Awards,'' MTV at 8: Warm up for next
Thursday's 2000 festivities with this rerun of last year's Chris
Rock-hosted ceremony. Performers include Ricky Martin and Kid Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``VH1 Confidential,'' VH1 at 8: Why is age 27 so dangerous for
rock stars?
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues,'' Showtime at 8: James Van Der Beek and Jon
Voight star in a 1999 high school football drama that's better than
it sounds. Voight is the martinet coach who needs an irreverent
replacement player (Van Der Beek) to lead the team to victory.
Rated R.

Ullman and band Stone Temple Pilots. Rerun.

   GARDENS THAT HARNESS NATURE'S HEALING POWERS
</P>
<P>
   HEALING-GARDENS-LIFEBEAT _ It was a sunny day in the garden at
the Pleasant Bay Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Brewster,
Mass. Bill Ellis, a former manufacturing executive from Wisconsin,
found out he had Parkinson's disease six years ago, and has been a
resident of the center for more than a year. His wife, Pam, visits
daily, along with their dog, Kaleigh. The garden, they have found,
is a cheerful place to congregate. Just off the dining room, it is
nestled in the northwest corner of the X-shaped complex. The
triangular space measures about 5,000 square feet, with views of
pines and sky to the west. By Anne Raver. 1,200 words.

<P>
   CHILD-EATING-DISORDER-LIFEBEAT _ Jack is a vegetarian. ``I don't
want to kill animals to eat,'' he told his parents one night. Soon,
however, his ban on red meat was extended to chicken, fish and
anything with the smallest amount of fat. Caitlin, star of the
school play, goes to the girls' bathroom two or three times a week,
puts two fingers down her throat and throws up before going on
stage to rehearse. Youngsters today are more concerned than ever
about their body images. Many are developing unhealthy eating
habits that can become full-blown disorders with potentially
life-threatening consequences. By Margery D. Rosen. 1,200 words.

   THE TOP FIVE SUPERMARKET TRAPS

   SUPERMARKET-TRAPS-LIFEBEAT _ My kids and I stopped at the
supermarket to pick up a loaf of bread, 100 percent fruit juice and
a few other staples. We raced around the store and sped through the
express lane. But when I unpacked the groceries I realized that I
didn't buy whole wheat bread or the 100 percent fruit juice. I
picked up a brown loaf made with white flour and a beverage that
was 100 percent natural, but only 10 percent juice. So you (or I)
don't fall into these traps again, children's nutrition experts
went shopping to find the five most common types of products
masquerading as health foods, and tell you how to spot a phony. By

   PIPER-PERABO-LIFEBEAT _ Piper Perabo had to beat out a lot of
other actresses to get ugly _ ``Coyote Ugly.'' The 23-year-old

<P>
   A few months ago, my kids and I stopped at the supermarket
before soccer practice to pick up a loaf of bread, 100 percent
fruit juice and a few other staples. We raced around the store,
sped through the express lane and made it to practice with a minute
to spare. I was proud of my speediness until I unpacked the
groceries and realized that I didn't buy whole wheat bread or the
100 percent fruit juice. I picked up a brown loaf made with white
flour and a beverage that was 100 percent natural, but only 10
percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you've made some similar mistakes. Who could blame you?
With the typical grocery store stocking 50,000 items, twice as many
as a decade ago, it's impossible to read every label, let alone
wade through an entire ingredients list. So we often rely on visual
shortcuts to size up nutritional value _ pictures of fruits and
vegetables on the package must mean it's healthy; grainy-looking
brown bread must be whole wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers know you're in a rush at the supermarket and
some do whatever they can to make their products seem more
nutritious than they really are,'' points out Bridget Swinney,
R.D., of El Paso, Texas, author of ``Healthy Food for Healthy
Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   So you (or I) don't fall into these traps again, Swinney and
other children's nutrition experts went shopping to find the five
most common types of products masquerading as health foods, and
tell you how to spot a phony.
</P>
<P>
   MULTIGRAIN BREADS: A FAKE TAN
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Manufacturers may add caramel coloring or molasses
to bread made with mostly white flour so it will appear darker and
more nutritious, says Sandy Nissenberg, R.D., a Buffalo Grove,
Ill.-based author of children's cookbooks. Then they give the bread
a healthy-sounding name, like ''12-grain,'' ``multigrain'' or even
``whole grain.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, breads made with mostly white flour aren't bad, but
they contain about half the fiber, magnesium, zinc, vitamin E and
potassium, as well as far fewer phytochemicals (healthy plant
compounds) as loaves made with only whole grain flour. That's why
the USDA recommends that half your child's daily six to 11 grain
servings _ a slice of bread, an ounce of cereal or a half-cup of
rice or pasta counts as one _ be whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: See if enriched wheat flour or enriched flour is
the first ingredient. Those are fancy names for white flour _ the
same kind of flour used in white bread, explains Nissenberg.
</P>
<P>
   To find a whole grain loaf, check for the word ``whole'' in the
name of the first ingredient. Or skip the ingredients list and buy
a brand with the words ``whole wheat'' in its name. The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration requires that the only flour in ``whole
wheat'' breads (unlike ``multigrain'' or even ``whole grain''
breads) be whole grain.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Stroehmann 100(percent) Whole Wheat, Pepperidge
Farm Natural Whole Grain, Wonder Stoneground 100(percent) Whole
Wheat, Freihofer's Stone Ground 100(percent) Whole Wheat, Sahara
100(percent) Whole Wheat Pita.
</P>
<P>
   SKIM-MILK PUDDINGS: OIL SLICK
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Manufacturers plaster the phrase ``made with
wholesome skim milk'' or ``made with nonfat milk'' on the label.
You think the pudding is made entirely with skim milk, but, for
creaminess, manufacturers have added several grams of partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil, points out Dr. Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an
associate professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York City. Not only do these puddings end up with
four grams of fat _ the same as those made from whole milk _ but
the type is trans fat, which Ayoob says is as risky for heart
health as saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Look for the phrase ``partially hydrogenated oil''
in the list of ingredients. That's a sure sign that the product
contains trans fat, explains Ayoob. (The FDA is considering a
proposal that would require the amount of trans fat to be listed on
the label.) Choose a brand that is ``fat free'' or is made with
skim milk and canola oil, which is heart-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Fat-Free Jell-O, Swiss Miss Fat Free, Handi-Snacks
Fat Free.
</P>
<P>
   POULTRY HOT DOGS: PLUMPED WITH EXTRA FAT
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: You may presume that poultry hot dogs are made
with low-fat white-meat turkey or chicken. Truth is, many
manufacturers throw in the skin and dark meat for extra moistness.
As a result, most poultry franks give you a paltry fat savings when
compared with their beef counterparts. Furthermore, some brands may
have exactly the same amount of fat as beef franks _ up to a
whopping 13 grams!
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Zero in on the frank's fat content. If each frank
has more than four grams, it's probably made with dark meat and/or
skin. Choose the lower-fat versions instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Oscar Mayer Fat-Free, Ball Park Fat Free, Dietz &AMP;
Watson Gourmet Lite, Butterball Fat Free.
</P>
<P>
   100 PERCENT NATURAL JUICE BOXES: WHERE'S THE JUICE?
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Manufacturers often highlight the phrase
''100(percent) Natural'' on the package and show pictures of fruits
or vegetables. You think you're buying 100 percent juice, but that
claim, and the photos, have nothing to do with the amount of juice
in the product. It simply means the product is free of artificial
additives or preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these products contain only 10 percent or 25 percent
juice,'' says Swinney. ``Since kids like 100 percent juice as much
as they do 10 percent juice, why not buy the product that's
healthier for them?''
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Check the side panel to see the percentage of
juice the product packs. Buy a brand that's 100 percent natural
(also called all-natural) and 100 percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Minute Maid Apple, Orange, Grape or Cherry juice
boxes with calcium; any flavor of Juicy Juice, Mott's, Sesame
Street or Apple &AMP; Eve.
</P>
<P>
   PASTA AND RICE SIDE DISHES: SHRINKING VEGGIES
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Call it photographic license. The meal shown on
the package is chock-full of veggies. ``Unfortunately, when you
cook the side dish at home, you realize there are hardly any
vegetables at all. In fact, some brands have as little as a quarter
of a teaspoon of vegetables per serving,'' says Ayoob.
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Check the Nutrition Facts label on the package. If
the product doesn't contain at least 20 percent of the Daily Value
of vitamins A or C per serving, it's probably skimpy on veggies,
since these are the nutrients that are abundant in most produce.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Bird's Eye Italian Style Vegetables &AMP; Bow-tie
Pasta, Cascadian Farm Mediterranean Pasta Salad, Green Giant
Broccoli &AMP; Cheese Flavored Sauce (add to pasta or rice).

   Jack is a vegetarian. ``I don't want to kill animals to eat,''
he told his parents one night. Soon, however, his ban on red meat
was extended to chicken, fish and anything with the smallest amount
of fat. He also placed himself on a strict exercise program, doing
sit-ups and calisthenics every day, and running around the school
track every afternoon for an hour. ``At first, we thought it was
great that Jack was into being fit,'' his mother explains. But over
the course of six months, not only did Jack not gain weight, he
lost more than 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin, star of the school play, goes to the girls' bathroom
two or three times a week, puts two fingers down her throat and
throws up before going on stage to rehearse. Her best friends know
what she does but are sworn to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like typical teen-age angst about body image, right? Not
exactly: Jack is 8 years old. Caitlin is 9. According to experts,
these children's stories are becoming increasingly common.
Youngsters today are more concerned than ever about their body
images. Many are developing unhealthy eating habits that can become
full-blown disorders with potentially life-threatening
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At age 3, children already show a dislike for those who are fat,
rating drawings of fat children more harshly than those of
youngsters with disabilities, according to a series of studies
conducted by Ohio State University psychologist Susan C. Wooley.
They also attribute negative qualities to fat people, labeling them
mean, lazy, cheating and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   By early grade school, some children are not only counting
calories, they're using laxatives and diet pills, and forcing
themselves to vomit in an attempt to drop pounds. A study of more
than 3,000 middle-class, fifth- through eighth-graders by
researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina, in
Charleston, found that 40 percent felt fat and/or wished they could
lose weight; 30 percent had already dieted; 8 percent had fasted;
30 percent had pilfered a parent's diet pills or diuretics, and
almost 5 percent had forced themselves to vomit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the study, most of us thought that eating
disorders were pretty much limited to college-age women. To hear
kids as young as 10 years old confess to taking laxatives to lose
weight was eye-opening,'' says Dr. Timothy Brewerton, director of
the Eating Disorders Program at the Medical University of South
Carolina and the study's lead author.
</P>
<P>
   Eating disorders in teens and adults are notoriously difficult
to recognize, and those in children even more so. As a result, such
disorders are often misdiagnosed or missed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young children may be brought to a pediatrician because
they're overeating, refusing to eat or chewing food and then
spitting it out,'' says Dr. Susan Sherkow, a New York City-based
psychiatrist who directs a therapeutic and preventative nursery for
mothers and children with eating disorders. ``But instead of
considering the possibility of an eating disorder, doctors assume
these kids are merely picky eaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Third- and fourth-grade girls are fearful of getting fat, says
Dr. Catherine Steiner-Adair, a clinical psychologist and director
of education prevention and outreach at the Harvard Eating
Disorders Center. What Steiner-Adair dubs ``fat talk'' starts
early. By age 6 or 7, it's not unusual for a girl to ask her mom
``Am I too fat?'' Around age 9 or 10, girls often begin to appraise
their own and each others' appearance and compare themselves with
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Early grade school is also a time when children begin to link
their self-worth to the concept of good and bad. ``I've heard
preteens turn to each other and repeat comments like: 'I'm so fat;
I hate myself.' ... 'Let's be really bad today _ let's eat
dessert!' ... or 'I was so good _ I just had a salad' _ that they
may have first overheard from their parents,'' says Steiner-Adair.
</P>
<P>
   Boys are by no means immune. Steiner-Adair recalls when a boy in
her neighborhood came home from camp and announced that he wanted
'a six-pack.' ``He'd learned from the older guys that 'having a
six-pack' means you're so buff, so muscular, that your lower three
ribs on each side show'', she says. ``I realized that 'fat talk'
was becoming part of a boy's experience, too. They're becoming just
as vigilant about their bodies as girls are.'' Indeed, 28 percent
of normal-weight boys in Brewerton's study reported being
dissatisfied with their weight.
</P>
<P>
   And just when fitting in and looking ``right'' becomes the Holy
Grail, the unpredictable pacing of puberty means that growth rates
and body shapes become as varied as fad diets. There are girls who
are so distraught by their new womanly curves that they believe
starvation is their only option. Unchecked, such erroneous beliefs
and hazardous habits can develop into a diagnosable eating
disorder, putting a child at risk for serious, sometimes
irreversible, medical problems, including stunted growth, the
cessation of menstruation and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, our cultural preoccupation with thinness presents an
unreasonable and, for most, forever unattainable ideal. While we
may tell our kids that real beauty is found on the inside, just
about everything from Hollywood to Madison Avenue, magazines to
music videos, rewards the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Today's kids are the first generation to be raised by parents
who target their heart rates, analyze their body fat and purchase
fat-free cookies. If Mommy moans that she can no longer zip her
jeans, berates herself for having eaten that whole corn muffin or
precisely monitors every last morsel that her child puts in her
mouth, she's not teaching healthy attitudes about food and
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many mothers who struggled with weight issues when they
were young and are so worried that their kids will, too, that they
begin talking about counting calories when their child is in
preschool,'' says Dr. Melanie Katzman, assistant professor of
psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.
``That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   So is eliminating fat from the diet of toddlers and
preschoolers, says Sherkow. ``Kids need a certain amount of fat in
their diet to develop normally,'' she says. ``Fat is not a dirty
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperament also plays a key role. ``There is a high correlation
between kids who have eating disorders and kids who have trouble
coping in social situations,'' says Brewerton. ``Someone who is
inflexible, withdrawn, perfectionistic and obsessional may be at
greater risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Susceptible kids often come from famlies in which one or both
parents are overachieving, overcritical or rejecting, notes
Katzman. ``When a child feels powerless or helpless, eating, or
refusing to eat, is the only way she can exert some measure of
control over her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, parents play a huge role in shaping their child's
self-image and confidence, at least partly through their attitudes
toward food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to help your child avoid an eating disorder is to
stop it before it starts,'' says Brewerton. ``The youngster who has
open communication with his parents, who feels loved regardless of
her achievements, mistakes or looks, will stand strong against peer
and media pressure.''

 ART ADV: Photos of the residents and garden at Pleasant Bay Nursing
and Rehabilitation Center are available on Newscom or by calling
William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355. 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 New York Times   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a sunny day in the garden at the Pleasant Bay Nursing and
Rehabilitation Center in Brewster, Mass. So sunny that Kaleigh, a
yellow Labrador, would not leave the shade of his favorite zelkova
tree, where he kept an eye on his person, Bill Ellis, 69, reading
in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, a former manufacturing executive from Wisconsin, found
out he had Parkinson's disease six years ago, and has been a
resident of the center for more than a year. His wife, Pam, visits
daily, along with Kaleigh. The garden, they have found, is a
cheerful place to congregate. Just off the dining room, it is
nestled in the northwest corner of the X-shaped complex. The
triangular space measures about 5,000 square feet, with views of
pines and sky to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hospital-like inside,'' Ellis said. ``But the garden
makes all the difference. Out here, you have birds all around, you
feel the sun on your body. I think it's a semblance of having your
own backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   A wide trellis, planted with honeysuckle, serves as a portal
into another part of the garden where a concrete path loops around
an oval of grass and yellow marigolds.
</P>
<P>
   These flowers might look garish to a sophisticated eye, but they
have been planted with a purpose. ``I wanted something bright and
colorful, almost as a landmark,'' said David Kamp, the landscape
architect who is designing a series of gardens for the center,
which serve a wide variety of needs. ``It might be an urn or a
Christmas tree. Some people with Alzheimer's disease, for example,
see only a small sphere, not the trees beyond. They can't
comprehend something on a big scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Trees might actually look threatening to some Alzheimer's
patients. ``Like a forest where you could get lost,'' Kamp said.
``So there should be clear avenues where you can decide, 'I won't
go there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Portals, or clear entrances, can help, he noted. Tinted concrete
cuts glare, while a gradual transition from bright sun to dappled
light to shade helps those whose eyes adjust slowly to changes in
light.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellis family moved to Cape Cod from Wisconsin. They settled
in a little town near Pleasant Bay, knowing that Ellis would
eventually need its nursing and physical-therapy services, which
have received high marks from state and federal health inspectors.
The complex serves a mixed population of short-term patients
undergoing rehabilitation, long-term residents and people with mild
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   A day care center within the building provides contact with
children; Kamp plans to redesign the playground. An assisted-living
complex of 40 units will be built in the adjacent woods, a rolling
terrain of scrub oak, pine and high bush blueberry.
</P>
<P>
   If Kamp has his way, that natural landscape will be as
undisturbed as possible. ``Some people will say, 'Well, it looks
like you didn't do anything,''' he said. ``But I think we should
celebrate the fact that we're out on the Cape.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp's firm, Dirtworks Inc., is one of the few in the country
specializing in gardens for people with AIDS, Alzheimer's or other
illnesses. Here at Pleasant Bay, he is drawing on as much of the
natural landscape as he can.
</P>
<P>
   The north garden, for example, is flanked by a steep berm
thickly planted with juniper, Scotch broom, shadblow, beach roses
and other shrubs that evoke the Cape's salty, sandy landscape. ``I
look down on that from my room,'' said Dorothy Harthan, an avid
gardner from Wellfleet, Mass., who is here recovering from a back
injury. ``It looks so soft, I want to lie down on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature's healing powers were evident to the ancients, who fled
to sacred springs and mountains when they were injured or ill. The
Egyptians and Greeks built labyrinths for walking meditations; the
Persians made paradise gardens, with rills of water flowing through
fruit trees. By the Middle Ages, cloistered gardens with flowering
trees and water fountains soothed the sick.
</P>
<P>
   In later centuries, monasteries that were used as hospitals
offered shady courtyards and airy rooms with views of greenery. But
with the advent of surgery, radiation therapy and the miracle drugs
of the 20th century, hospitals turned from nature to concentrate
their space and staff on machines, laboratories and surgical wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing dissatisfaction internationally with
traditional health-care environments,'' said Dr. Roger Ulrich, an
environmental psychologist and professor at the Center for Health
Systems and Design at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich's 1984 study of patients recovering from gall bladder
surgery found that those who could view trees and sky recovered
faster, with fewer painkillers and complaints, than those viewing
brick walls. His findings jolted medical administrators out of
their windowless corridors. Subsequent studies registered
reductions in blood pressure, anxiety, pain and other symptoms of
stress when patients were offered just a videotape or a photograph
of a natural scene.
</P>
<P>
   Most hospitals are increasingly seen as ``functionally
effective, but sterile, cold, unsuited to the psychological needs
of patients and staff,'' said Ulrich, who spoke by telephone from
Stockholm, where he was attending the Second International
Conference on Health and Design, titled ``Design and Care in
Hospital Planning 2000.'' ``Changes are being made at the level of
site planning,'' Ulrich said, ``so that people have appropriate
views, and atriums and a variety of nature experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp is bringing these changes to Pleasant Bay, working closely
with its owner and executive director, Joshua Zuckerman, who opened
the center five years ago with 135 beds. He had been impressed by a
garden that Kamp designed for AIDS patients at the Terence Cardinal
Cooke Hospital in East Harlem, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp designs by talking with patients, nurses, therapists,
families and maintenance workers _ everyone associated with a
space. ``You have to be sensitive to the emotions of illness,'' he
said. Some residents, for example, might feel a wave of pleasure
touching a fragrant rosemary plant. Another might be nauseated by
the smell. And needs can vary greatly from day to day for the same
person.
</P>
<P>
   Patients learning to walk again will be able to practice going
up steps that lead to an inviting pergola. There will be room for
stretching classes and tossing beach balls, having cookouts and
socials.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation garden will open out from the physical
therapy rooms, and will include a ramp for wheelchair users to
practice maneuvering slopes that descend to different surfaces,
like concrete or cobbles. Residents will be able to grow flowers,
vegetables and herbs in raised beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll start some tomato plants,'' said George Simmons,
the activities director, who has seen people's self-esteem rise
with useful work, like growing what they can eat. He has also seen
how familiar plants can comfort people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one resident with dementia who looked out on the
daisies and said, 'Wow, I used to pick those with my brother,'''
Simmons said. ``So I'm going to take him out one day. Picking two
or three would make all the difference to that guy.''

<P>
   Piper Perabo had to beat out a lot of other actresses to get
ugly _ ``Coyote Ugly.'' The 23-year-old virtual unknown nabbed the
lead in the Jerry Bruckheimer produced film, a project that has
been widely anticipated as the career-making vehicle for aspiring
Hollywood starlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is about a girl from New Jersey who moves to New
York to pursue her dreams in the big city,'' explains Perabo, a
Toms River, N.J., native who now lives in Manhattan. ``Right away I
thought, this is me.''
</P>
<P>
   Having announced their intention to cast only newcomers in the
main parts, the filmmakers auditioned literally hundreds of
actresses. Perabo says that at her first audition she simply told
first-time director David McNally that it was kind of ``scary'' how
similar her life was to the character's, which she thinks helped
win him over. ``I should start all my auditions that way,'' she
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, which sounds a lot like ``Cocktail'' meets
``Flashdance,'' follows an aspiring singer-songwriter named Violet
who leaves home but can't land a job. She gets work pouring shots
and strutting her stuff at Coyote Ugly, a rowdy bar with a tough
owner (Maria Bello) and even tougher fellow bartenders (Tyra Banks,
Izabella Miko and Bridget Moynahan). ``Her biggest fear is stage
fright,'' says Perabo of Violet, who literally has to sing for her
supper in the film. ``And at Coyote Ugly, the deal is that the
waitresses get up on the bar and hoof it. She shows up on the first
night, and it's her worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Stage fright has not exactly been a problem for Perabo, who
talks so fast and with such enthusiasm that her words seem to blend
together. She graduated from Ohio University in 1998 with a theater
degree and was promptly cast in the indie film ``Whiteboys,''
playing the girlfriend of a white guy from Iowa (Danny Hoch) who
wants to be a gangsta rapper. Perabo, who came across as a more
free-spirited Natalie Portman, played her exasperation with
effortless charm.
</P>
<P>
   She was shooting a role as FBI agent Karen Sympathy in the
current ``Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' when her agent sent
her the ``Coyote'' script. She auditioned first for McNally, and
then for Bruckheimer. ``It was real,'' says Bruckheimer of Perabo's
reading. ``What you look for in an actor or an actress is honesty,
and she's got it.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Perabo actually failed Waitressing 101 when working in
a New York City bar not too long ago. ``I'd always sit down and
talk to people,'' she says now. ``I would end up chatting in a
booth, with my 10 other tables going, 'Hel-lo?''' No bar dancing
was required.
</P>
<P>
   As for her unusual handle, chalk it up to her family's literary
bent. ``My dad is a poetry teacher, so I think he just thought it
was a good alliteration,'' she says of her first name (the last is
Portuguese). ``My parents chose it from a long list of hippie
names.'' Indeed, she was almost India Star Perabo. She adds with a
laugh, ``I'm really happy with Piper.''

&HT;     RESEARCHERS OFFER NEW EVIDENCE LINKING SUN TO SKIN COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists studying why human skin comes in such
a diverse palette of colors have found a ``strong correlation''
between the skin color of indigenous peoples in different parts of
Earth and the amount of ultraviolet (UV) light falling on each
region.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, Nina Jablonski and George Chaplin of the
California Academy of Sciences, lends powerful support to the
belief that over evolutionary time, bodies change their skin colors
to adjust to different levels of UV light. Light skin absorbs lots
of UV, while dark skin absorbs less.
</P>
<P>
   UV light, which affects the skin's production of important
biochemicals, is both good and bad: Exposure to too little UV means
the skin doesn't generate enough of these chemicals, some of which
enhance one's chances of successful reproduction, while too much UV
risks destroying those same chemicals or triggering skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The research shows that evolution modifies skin colors to adjust
to the regional intensity of UV light. This helps the body strike a
reproductively healthy balance between the extremes of too much UV
and too little UV.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements by the Total Ozone Spectrometer satellite run by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration support Jablonski
and Chaplin's thesis. As humans have migrated around the globe,
evolution has altered their skin color with extraordinary subtlety
to match local levels of solar UV, technically known as UV
``flux.'' Solar UV varies from place to place because of latitude,
humidity, cloudiness and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution adjusts skin color to regional UV levels to boost the
chances of reproductive success, according to Jablonski, an
anthropologist, and Chaplin, a geographic information systems
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   UV affects the likelihood of reproduction by influencing bodily
production of two bio-molecules vital for healthy offspring: folate
and vitamin D-3. The findings are reported in the July issue of the
Journal of Human Evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Folate, considered part of the B vitamin complex, occurs
naturally in many foods, and is found in highest concentrations in
green, leafy vegetables, beans and grain. It is essential for
proper development of the nervous system in fetuses and for sperm
production in adult males.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin D-3 helps build and maintain strong bones and an alert
immune system, particularly in fast-growing human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis may also explain why human females tend to be
slightly lighter skinned than males. Light skin admits more solar
ultraviolet light, enhancing female production of vitamin D-3
needed to support fetal growth during pregnancy, and to nourish a
newborn via breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
   C. Loring Brace, a biological anthropologist at the University
of Michigan, said the paper written by Jablonski and Chaplin is
``an excellent piece of work . . . a marvelous survey.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brace has technical reservations about certain aspects
of the paper, all in all ``I don't think you're going to find a
skeptic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jablonski, 46, received her doctorate at the University of
Washington in 1981. Chaplin, 46, is her husband and a specialist in
geographic information systems (GIS), which are computer systems
for the analysis and visualization of geographic data.

</P>
<P>
   For centuries, scientists have debated the cause of differences
in human skin color. They have long known that skin lightness and
darkness vary with skin levels of melanin, a large organic
molecule. The more melanin in your skin, the darker it is.
</P>
<P>
   The melanin levels in a newborn's skin are genetic: For example,
dark-skinned people are more likely to give birth to dark-skinned
children.
</P>
<P>
   But why do melanin levels vary so dramatically from one human
population group to another?
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time,'' Jablonski said in a telephone interview,
``scientists have thought that skin color varies from place to
place to balance out the advantages and disadvantages of local
variations in solar UV light. On the one hand, UV stimulates the
production of vitamin D in the skin; on the other hand, too much UV
can cause skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this explanation was considered weak by some scientists
because skin cancer has little or no effect on people's ability to
reproduce, which is really the bottom line of every evolutionary
spreadsheet.''
</P>
<P>
   The research provided what Jablonski called strong evidence for
the old thesis about UV light and skin color. They have done so by
showing exactly how UV modifies skin color over time via evolution
and human reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   They say their research refutes the old notion that skin color
differences can be used to understand evolutionary relationships
among human populations living in different places on Earth. This
notion, Jablonski noted, endures in popular folklore _ especially
racist mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all the same under the skin,'' Jablonski said. ``What we
think of as racial categories or racial groupings are actually
highly variable constellations of physical and physiological
characteristics.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A retired businessman who spent $167,500 to buy
a 200-million-year-old flying reptile fossil has thrilled
paleontologists with his pledge to give the significant find back
to a New York museum.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Spight said he decided to buy the fossil after reading
about it in the newspaper and then discussing it with
paleontologists at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that science has access to these kinds of
things,'' he said. ``I couldn't stand the thought of it going into
a private collection.''
</P>

   Paleontologists who have railed against the sale for profit of
scientific artifacts were delighted that the sale of the fossil
Sunday night was hardly a blockbuster. Instead, it brought in the
minimum bid required to keep Butterfields auction house from
pulling it back off the block.
</P>
<P>
   Resembling a large dragonfly and preserved on a shale slab,
Icarosaurus siefkeri has a storied and controversial 40-year
history. It once convinced scientists that vertebrates glided
through the air millions of years earlier than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the fossil has given flight to a debate about whether
scientific artifacts should be sold on the open market _ a debate
that has escalated with the growth of Internet-based auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil was discovered in 1960 by three teen-agers in North
Bergen, N.J. One of them claimed ownership and 10 years ago removed
it from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, saying
he needed to sell it to pay his medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfields, which is owned by the eBay Internet site and has
locations in Los Angeles and San Francisco, offered hundreds of
natural-history relics for sale during Sunday night's auction. The
house also auctioned a grab handle from the Apollo 11 module that
landed on the moon in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sale is being probed by the National Aeronauts and
Space Administration, a 41-year-old retired computer industry
executive from Monterey Bay, Calif., who declined to give his name,
spent $34,500 on the piece and said it was ``just a really cool
thing'' that he wanted all his friends to touch.
</P>
<P>
   The highest drama of the night occurred courtesy of Spight.
Spight in 1996 sold Diablo Communications, an antenna tower
company, to the larger American Tower Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Auction officials said Spight was one of at least three bidders
interested in the late Triassic-period fossil, and one of at least
two who planned to donate it to a museum. They declined to identify
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Spight successfully bid $150,000 for the fossil. He also must
pay a $17,500 buyer's premium.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at his New Jersey home Sunday evening, the seller of
the fossil, Alfred Siefker, 56, was shocked to hear the price,
which he said was the minimum allowed. It was listed at $250,000 to
$350,000 in the auction guide, and Siefker years ago had hoped it
would fetch up to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my god, I can't believe that,'' Siefker said. ``I had a
stroke 10 years ago, I'm in pain 24 hours a day. That was my lease
on life _ I don't know what I'm going to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Siefker, who had been criticized by some paleontologists for
trying to profit from the artifact, said he was glad to learn that
the buyer planned to donate it to a museum.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Aug. 29:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BLOOD-PRESSURE (Undated) _ The calcium channel blocker drugs
that are commonly prescribed to lower high blood pressure are less
effective than other drugs and their use is leading to nearly
85,000 unnecessary heart attacks and cases of heart failure each
year worldwide, according to a new study being reported today.
Calcium channel blockers are not harmful. Because they are less
effective users do not gain the benefits they would by using other
types of anti-hypertensive drugs. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1200
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VENICE-SINKING (Venice, Italy) _ An American achaeologist
studying the origins of Venice has stumbled upon clues suggesting
that a multi-billion-dollar plan to save the city from rising flood
waters is doomed to failure. w/photos and graphic. By William J.
Broad. (1900 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GRAVITY (Undated) _ Can empty space be stirred like pancake
batter? According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the gravity
of a spinning object should tug slightly on the surrounding space
and slowly drag it around in circles. Any matter would be pulled
along, even though ordinary gravity can only attract matter, not
push it sideways. Observational astronomers have remained skeptical
of that supremely bizarre prediction, since they have never found
clear, direct proof that the phenomenon exists. But with the
discovery of a strange new signal by the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer, a NASA satellite designed to measure X-ray sources in
deep space, a few more astronomers may be ready to get on board. By
James Glanz. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-INDIAN-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ As part of a new emphasis on
the astronomy of other cultures, Chicago's Adler Planetarium and
Astronomy Museum has revived Skidi Pawnee astronomy in a sky show
that is unusual among cultural shows. To create the show, ``Spirits
From the Sky, Thunder on the Land,'' the Adler astronomers took
their research beyond books and records and onto the Pawnee
reservation where they sought out members of the Skidi Pawnee tribe
to work with them in creating the show. Ann E. Ruderman. (575
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NORTH-POLE (Undated) _ Recent eyewitness reports of open
water from melting ice at the North Pole have prompted
climatologists and other scientists to make a closer study of
satellite imagery and other observations of northern sea ice, past
and present. They have found substantial evidence that on average
Arctic temperatures in the winter have risen 11 degrees over the
past 30 years and in the late 20th century were the warmest in four
centuries. By John Noble Wilford. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TURKEY-ARCHEO (Undated) _ Reconstructing a damaged ancient
sculpture recently excavated was a small but satisfying triumph for
archaeologists working in Aphrodisias, Turkey, a field of dreams
for the study of art and architecture of antiquity. Spreading over
a broad plain is an extravagance of well preserved stone remains of
a prosperous provincial city: from a huge theater on high ground to
the squares and building walls of the civic center and beyond to
the standing and fallen columns of the Temple of Aphrodite and then
the stadium that once seated 30,000. By John Noble Wilford. (2175
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on new
uses for lard as a fuel, crocodile hearts and space dust. By Henry
Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEN-OSTEOPOROSIS (Undated) _ Osteoporosis, known as the
``silent disease,'' often has no symptoms until the bones are so
comporomised that a minor trauma causes a fracture. As awareness of
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women has grown, it has become more
common for them to get routine bone density tests. Men, though, are
rarely given bone density tests unless they have significant
symptoms. Even when an older man breaks a lesser bone or loses
height due to bone loss, two red flags in postmenopausal women,
many physicians still don't consider that he may have osteoporosis.
By Laurie Tarkan. (1580 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-FEEDING (Undated) _ A recent study in India suggests
that breast-feeding alone may not provide enough sustenance to
babies in developing nations when their mothers are severely
malnourished. The report adds to a renewed debate about a
decade-old campaign by the World Health Organization and other
United Nations agencies that advocate an exclusive reliance on
breast milk for the first six months of life. By Barbara Crossette.
(860 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IRRITABLE-BOWEL (Undated) _ Citing ``rare but serious
risks'' from Lotronex, a drug prescribed for women with irritable
bowel syndrome, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered that a
warning pamphlet be attached to each bottle of pills to alert
consumers to early signs of dangerous side effects. By Denise
Grady. (860 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: In the
United States, the incidence of melanoma, the most serious form of
skin cancer, is rising at an exponential rate: 4 percent a year for
20 years, accompanied by an increase in melanoma deaths. One person
in 74 can now expect to develop melanoma at some point, up from one
in 1,500 in 1935 and one in 250 two decades ago. By Jane E. Brody.

   SCI-WEIGHTS-RISK (Undated) _ With more people training with
weights, many more are being injured, especially those over 50. By
Linda Villarosa. (825 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A study from Penn State examined what happened to the
appetites of men who were given pre-lunch milkshakes that were
whipped to varying degrees of frothiness, and found that those
given glasses filled twice as full ate 12 percent less a half hour
later.
</P>
<P>
   _ A recent study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine found that children who were enrolled in daycare or who
had an older sibling were less likely to have asthmatic episodes
between the ages of 6 and 13 than those who were cared for at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ A review of clinical trials over the last decade has found
mounting evidence that some herbal medicines can be effective in
treating mild psychiatric symptoms. But researchers cautioned
consumers to be aware that many herbal products did not contain
what their labels stated and urged them to tell their doctors
before taking the substances.
</P>
<P>
   _ All young children should be screened for signs of autism at
all routine visits to the pediatrician, the American Academy of
Neurology recommended last week in a new set of practice
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors whose elderly patients are asking to be discharged
early from the hospital should consider whether a pet has been left
at home, a letter this month in The Annals of Internal Medicine
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   _ A growing number of athletes are using nasal dilators _ nose
attachments that hold the nasal passages open _ in the belief that
the dilators allow more oxygen into the body and enhance
performance.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answred: If I had a pet
bald eagle, which I could never have, of course, how long could
expect it to live? (300 words)

   Entertainment and culture stories from The N.Y. Times News
Service for Tuesday, Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   MET-ASIAN-ART (New York) _ Thirty years ago, Asian art led a
marginal life at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1970 the only
Chinese work on view was a room of Buddhist sculpture and a few
cases of ceramics. As late as 1990, Indian art meant an assortment
of objects crammed into dimly lighted vitrines on the Great Hall
balcony. Things have changed. The museum now has more than 50
permanent galleries devoted to the largest and most comprehensive
collection of Asian art under one roof anywhere. These days the Met
is fond of calling itself a ``museum of Asian art within a
museum,'' and it's justified in doing so. By Holland Cotter. (2000
words)
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-DESERT-EXHIBIT (Paris) _ With the arrival of photography
in the mid-19th century, the desert entered the European
imagination. Endless sand dunes in the Sahara became metaphors for
the grandiosity of Nature, camel trains and nomadic tribesmen
evoked romance and mystery. Of course the first desert
photographers were not artists, but explorers and scientists. Yet
their work passed one test of art: it made people dream. It is no
great leap, then, a century and a half later, to commission 10
European and American artists to travel into the desert and record
their reactions to it. The result is ``The Desert,'' a show at the
Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris through Nov. 5. By
Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Rebecca Goldstein's characters are
descendants of Ingmar Bergman's chilly intellectuals and
Hawthorne's cold-hearted curmudgeons. They want to subordinate the
heart to the head, the spirit to the word; they dream of perfectly
controlled worlds, where messy emotions are subjugated to the
ordering dictates of reason. Michiko Kakutani reviews Goldstein's
new novel ``Properties of Light.''

   MINIMUM-WAGE (Washington) _ Dennis Hastert, the House speaker
has written President Clinton saying he's willing to bow to
Democratic demands to approve a $1 increase in minimum wage over
two years, instead of three, and drop some other provisions
objectionable to Democrats. The move shows that Republicans are
afraid Democrats will use the wage issue against them and are
trying to narrow their focus to a couple of the more popular tax
bills. A majority of both the House and Senate have approved a wage
increase, but the bill has been bogged down in procedures for

TEN YEARS LATER, NO ONE HOLDS A CANDLE TO STEVIE RAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first hint there might be something wrong was on early
morning wire service reports that greeted us as we arrived at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helicopter didn't arrive ... possibly carrying a musician ...
took off from Wisconsin bound for Chicago ... several helicopters
left the site after the show, which featured Eric Clapton and Texan
Stevie Ray Vaughan...'' and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the rumor was that Clapton and Vaughan were on the
missing helicopter, a prospect that brought a co-worker to tears.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the hope was that the missing helicopter had set
down in a field after having mechanical problems. Or maybe it made
an emergency landing at some small airport between Alpine Valley,
Wis., (where Vaughan and Clapton had performed with Buddy Guy and
Jimmie Vaughan).
</P>
<P>
   But soon, our worst fears on Aug. 27, 1990, were realized.
Stevie Ray Vaughan, one of the greatest bluesmen ever, was dead at
35, his helicopter having crashed just minutes after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram newsroom was as close to silent as
a newsroom gets at midday. There were tears, there was disbelief
and there was, for me, numbness. I had been too young to fully feel
the impact of the deaths of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King
Jr., so the closest I had come to feeling a loss was the death of
John Lennon a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   When there is tragedy in my life, I don't get weepy. I get
angry. And I remember thinking something along the lines of, when I
get up to heaven, the first thing I'm going to do is ask why this
was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan was a stunningly intense, brilliant guitarist; when I
saw him performing in bars in the early '80s, just before he hit it
big, there would be times when he would be playing so well that
everyone (the dancers, the waitresses, the guys talking at the bar)
would simply stop and stare, sometimes with a bottle of beer
hoisted halfway to their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   He was beyond the boundaries of technique, of absorbing the
licks and sounds of his heroes, such as Albert King. In Texas, a
place with dozens of worthy guitar-slingers, he stood out like a
beacon of light on a lonely country road. He just had that
undefinable ``thing'' that says, pay attention, because you won't
be seeing the likes of me again.
</P>
<P>
   And, 10 years later, we haven't. With old heroes dying off,
mediocre songwriting everywhere and a sack of obvious Stevie Ray
clones who think volume and a long guitar solo equal being a bona
fide bluesman (it doesn't now, it never did, and it never will,
thanks), the blues are at their lowest artistic ebb ever.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Ray would have earned his place in the blues pantheon if
all he'd done was make memorable records and astound people in
concert. But that was only part of his legacy: After years of
substance-abuse problems, he cleaned up and returned with 1989's
``In Step.'' This was his finest hour, a collection of songs with
fierce playing and a palpable sense of renewal and progression.
</P>
<P>
   He had turned the cliche of the drunk/stoned/troubled bluesman
on its head and showed us that inspiration does not come from a
bottle or a vial.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a year later, he was gone. We missed him
horribly then, but we miss him worse, perhaps, now _ because of his
warmth of spirit, because of his mix of passion and technique,
because he transcended the musical and social cliches of the blues.
And, finally, because those qualities seem to be in shorter supply
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the best way to honor Vaughan's memory is to make a
point of not sounding like him. Don't copy the licks. Don't buy the
Fender Stratocaster and try to get his tone. And, for heaven's
sake, don't wear the hats.
</P>
<P>
   Learn from him, but learn more about yourself and what you want
to express and how you want to express it. Find out who you are and
put your own spin on his music, and the music of Muddy Waters and
Jimi Hendrix and B.B. King and whoever else you love.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Stevie Ray Vaughan did it, and that's why so many
people are marking the decade he's been gone.

&HT;     RAIDERS HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE BEING NO. 1 IN AFC WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Sports Illustrated predicts the Oakland
Raiders will finish the regular season in first place in the AFC
West. This is either another example of superb investigative
reporting by the magazine that was the first to bring you nearly
naked babes on the beach or a wild guess no more reliable than
something divined by Madame Magda, who earns her living reading tea
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon Kaufman plays football for the Raiders, which should
make him a better source than either SI or Madame Magda. He says he
doesn't know how good his team will be this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see so many ups and downs,'' the running back said of the
team's preseason performance. ``So many glimpses of greatness. . .
. And then the next week, you come out and you don't do quite as
well. So the best thing is just to wait until the season starts.
Get rolling into the season a bit. That's when you find out what
the team is going to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with predictions is that they are often based on how
a team does in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, wise to ignore this so-called evidence,
remembering instead that they are exhibitions. That's why regulars
play sparingly or not at all if they are troubled by as much as a
hang nail, and the suckers who paid regular-season prices instead
see guys from Sewanee Tech wage spirited battles for roster spots
that will earn them the right to be mangled on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   So the Raiders concluded the 2000 preseason with a 20-0
destruction of Seattle Thursday evening at the Coliseum and won
three of their four games.
</P>
<P>
   Just a reminder for those who are now contemplating wagering the
next year's house payments on the Raiders to go all the way: The
games didn't count. Mike Holmgren's Seahawks are not likely to be
embarrassed again Oct. 22 at the Coliseum, when the game counts.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Raiders know they will be as ready as they possibly
can for the start of the real games. They emerged from the
preseason for the most part in excellent health. The players who
line up against the San Diego Chargers Sunday afternoon at the
Coliseum will be the ones coach Jon Gruden wanted to have out
there.
</P>
<P>
   The only consequential player to be seriously hurt in the
preseason was reserve wide receiver Terry Mickens, who suffered a
season-ending spinal injury in the game against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Management wasted no time bringing in Andre Rison, who'd been
cut by Kansas City. Perhaps because Oakland's general managing
partner, Al Davis, has spent the last few decades profitably suing
the rest of the NFL, the Chiefs did not provide the Raiders with a
heads-up that Rison was facing new legal problems, which surfaced
on Friday when the player was indicted for bouncing checks worth
$158,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Raiders management says it is investigating this new
difficulty confronting an athlete already facing trial for
allegedly swiping a $1,000 tape recorder, the team appears to have
no intention of dismissing Rison, who made an impressive debut in
the victory over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He joins a veteran offense that appears confident it will be
able to move the ball either on the ground, with Kaufman and Tyrone
Wheatley doing the bulk of the work, or through the air, with
accurate passing supplied by quarterback Rich Gannon, who played
well in limited duty in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   This is predicated on the offensive line doing its job, which is
to either open holes for Kaufman and Wheatley or protect Gannon.
This is, however, a reconfigured line, with Matt Stinchcomb the new
left tackle after missing his entire rookie season with a shoulder
injury and Mo Collins shifting to right guard.
</P>
<P>
   Although line coach Bill Callahan labored long and hard to turn
these large men into a cohesive unit, it is still too soon to know
how well his tutoring took. If the line does not play well, then
the offense will struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Tim Brown remains the offense's marquee player.
Brown is one of those guys who probably will be buried in great
shape. However, he is 34 years old, has lost at least one step and
is now a possession receiver instead of a deep threat. One more
lost step could be trouble. And since he hardly played in the
preseason, it's difficult to know if that step is still his.
</P>
<P>
   The two best players on the defense _ corner Charles Woodson and
tackle Darrell Russell _ are young and spry. They should continue
to improve and make things extremely difficult for opposing
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodson is the lone sure thing in the secondary. The other
corner, 35-year-old Eric Allen, has been playing even longer than
Brown, and works at a much more demanding position. If he loses a
step, it's six points. Two offseason additions _ Marquez Pope and
Anthony Dorsett _ are the new safeties. Pope's a survivor, having
been a member of all three California NFL teams plus the Rams when
they called Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett is starting for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line has been rebuilt, with at least one and
possibly two new starters joining Russell and end Lance Johnstone.
But Johnstone was held out the final two exhibitions with an
injury. Grady Jackson, the new nose tackle, sat out the Seattle
game. Off-season addition Regan Upshaw was invisible for most of
the preseason until rousing himself against the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   How well this unit does now that the games count obviously is
critical. Only the experts from SI and the good Madame can pretend
they know for sure.

 &HT;    A tome that takes you over the ballpark
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only book a baseball fan will want to read until Richard Ben
Kramer's book on Joe DiMaggio arrives, is ``The Ballpark Book''
(The Sporting News), a lovely coffee-table guide to the evolution
of the baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They're all here, the quick and the dead, but as part of every
baseball fan is a preference for the dead over the living, the part
that most fans will turn to are the sections on places like Shibe
Park (Philadelphia), League Park (Cleveland) and the Polo Grounds
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the book particularly valuable are the aerial photos
of the stadiums and their surroundings, which give a vivid
impression of the often bizarre configurations that no on-the-field
shot can ever quite capture.
</P>
<P>
   They're all here, along with sections on the impersonal,
short-lived behemoths such as the Astrodome, and the new, retro
stadiums that attempt, with considerable success, to re-create the
Zeitgeist of the old parks that were torn down with such alacrity
in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   A must-have for the sports fan.
</P>
<P>
   Just the facts ...
</P>
<P>
   Viking's series of brief biographical lives has aroused
competition with a new series called Oxford Portraits. The first to
be published is ``George Orwell: Battling Big Brother,'' and it's
quite well done; although the book is only 109 pages long, Orwell
died at 47 _ there's less of a sense of ruthless concision than
with some of the Viking books.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford series introduces some nice sidebars into the mix,
such as manuscript pages, interesting stills and excerpts from the
work.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford books _ the series includes volumes on Thomas Paine
and Arthur Conan Doyle _ are $22 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Prize roundup ... The James Michener Prize of $10,000, for
authors who publish their first book at 40 or later, has been
awarded to William Gay, author of ``The Long Home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Prize for fiction ((British pound)30,000) has been
awarded to Linda Grant, author of ``When I Lived in Modern Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicola Barker won the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award of 100,000
Irish pounds for her book ``Wide Open,'' beating out others on the
short list that included Philip Roth, Michael Cunningham and Toni
Morrison.

up eight or ten times a day, sometimes in Philadelphia.''

 &HT;    Stick a fork in it: This `Road' is done
 &HT;    FORK IN THE ROAD, by Denis Hamill. Pocket Books; 480 pages;
$24.95.
 &HT;    RUN, by Douglas E. Winter. Knopf; 259 pages; $23.
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With sincere apologies to Yogi Berra: If you're browsing a
bookstore and come to ``'Fork in the Road,'' don't take it.
</P>
<P>
   But if you see a copy of ``Run,'' buy it, run home, read it.
It's gonna make a great action movie, although the book will not
long be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fork in the Road,'' however, is doomed on both counts, movie
and book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' begot the revival in and fashion of
Irish/Celtic literature, memoirs and histories, all things Erin.
``Fork in the Road'' will set it back, if not kill it outright.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero, Colin Coyne, is a young American screenwriter who
seeks inspiration in Ireland because his dying mom told him to go
there. This from mom on her deathbed: ``Colin, love, I must tell
you something I never told anyone else. You have another brother, a
brother you don't even know about.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half of that sentence seems a tad superfluous, no?
But the description of Colin's response to mom's revelation boggles
the reader: ``Colin is startled.''
</P>
<P>
   So Colin goes to Ireland to plumb the family past. Immediately,
a Gypsy pickpocket goes to work on his pocket as he sips a
Guinness. He turns around, and the pickpocket is drop-dead
gorgeous, ``more woman than Maureen O'Hara in ``The Quiet Man,''
and Colin says, ``Buy you a drink?'' Then the tinker woman says,
``Good Irish women don't need your durty Yankee dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin tells her she's beautiful. She says: ``Go way out of dat,
you moldy eijit.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book there is much use of the word eijit.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself using it, as in: I must be an eijit to keep
reading this book.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it Mark Twain who said if you're going to write
vernacular dialect, get it right or don't even try it?
</P>
<P>
   So Colin brings the pickpocket home to America and they settle
down to kids and screenplays, and she shoplifts and yells a lot,
stuff like ``You eijit.'' But I don't want to spoil the tale, so
read it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Or, read ``Run.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a romp. And, blessed be the day, 'tis not an Irishman
or dying Irish mother in sight, leastwise nobody saying ``eijit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about guns, gunrunners and gun battles. It's so
preposterous, it's fun. More people are killed in a single shootout
between white gun dealers, black drug dealers, cops, Feds, a
minister, phony cops and phony Feds than died in the Gulf War. And
that's just the scene that sets up the big shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The hero, Burdon Lane, is a Vietnam vet with an atrophied
conscience. He sells guns. Legally. Sort of. He's more arms
merchant than gun dealer. He loves his gats, packs three or more
Glocks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He's the good bad guy, surrounded by bad bad guys, a good bad
guy and one good bad girl, or bad good girl as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of this narrative is Elmore Leonard on amphetamines.
The book is aptly named and slows only when Burdon unloads his
political philosophy on the reader.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Winter has an imaginative ear and a gift for dialogue, a
gift occluded at times by scenes in which dialogue is inserted into
the most unbelievable of circumstances. At one point, two guys of
few words _ shoot-first, talk-later types _ who have been gunning
for each other for 12 chapters face each other down and start ...
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you know a showdown is coming, Armageddon actually.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some nice plot twists. And a black gang leader,
Doctor D, who speaks some of the most memorable lines in print. I
see Samuel L. Jackson playing that role. Bruce Willis plays Burdon
Lane. Fun movie. The NRA will not approve.

   But ``Run'' is not yet a movie. That's the problem. It's a book.
Remember the name, though. If money's tight, borrow the book, wait
for the movie.

   New book an entertaining look at musical giant Miles Davis

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - All right, immersion therapy time.
Everyone repeat after me:
</P>
<P>
   ``$&AMP;%!''
</P>
<P>
   Again! And again!
</P>
<P>
   Good. Now that we're past the profanity, on to its prince.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Davis gets his Boswell in ``Miles and Me,'' a personal
take on the genius by the poet who helped write his autobiography,
``Miles .'' That filthy yet fascinating frolic _ a tour de force on
the F-word that spoke some ugly truths and stung some beautiful
people _ made Quincy Troupe famous. It also made him one of the few
to penetrate the mask and glimpse the heart behind the horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miles and Me'' is a much lesser book, but it's an
indispensible and entertaining look at the musical giant in his
more mundane moments. Just remember to duck whenever the big man
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Miles embrace his adoring, autograph-seeking fans: ``(at)$%
you, you jive $(! Get the (at)$% outta my face and take yo silly
little %$(at)&AMP; with you!''
</P>
<P>
   Eavesdrop as the Prince of Darkness acknowledges a buddy's
Howdy-do: ``(at)$% you, man! I don't hafta speak to your (at)$%
every time I see you. (at)$%, who the (at)$% you think you are?''
</P>
<P>
   Or listen in as our hero butters up a journalist before an
interview: ``Well, (at)$%, don't just sit there. Ask me some (at)$%
questions!''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that Miles Davis, what a swell guy.
</P>
<P>
   Except he really was a swell guy _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Because we also see Miles playing sweetly with the poet's young
son, caressing his horses, crying when his longtime pal James
Baldwin dies, laughing with his St. Louis homeboys, stressing over
the shade of his skin and forming a grudging but lasting friendship
with Troupe as they sit together day after day recording the tapes
that would become the notorious ``Miles.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one complicated dude _ ``irascible, contemptuous,
brutally honest, ill-tempered when things don't go his way,
complex, fair-minded, humble, kind, and a son of a bitch,'' Troupe
says.
</P>
<P>
   He's also someone we need to figure out, for he was one of the
greatest musical minds the world has ever known, according to the
poet, and the driving force for musical art in this country for
more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Troupe spends dozens of pages making his case for Miles'
greatness, tracing the music's effect on his development as man and
writer and arguing that race is the reason we teach Bach and
Beethoven and ignore Miles and Coltrane in our schools.
</P>
<P>
   Troupe is a soulful, sharp and persuasive commentator _ and he
might even get you to give ``Bitches Brew'' another chance _ but
he's a better reporter. The book's at its best when he's in Miles'
face, hanging out in his New York apartment, taking his heat,
hearing his passion and filing away the details.
</P>
<P>
   Who was the voodoo woman? What did Miles eat? Did he have AIDS?
What was all the gum-chewing about? What movies did he watch? How
did he talk, practice, work, live?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, those details _ those bits of trivia that point
toward truth _ make up the meat of the book, and it's tasty meat
indeed.

   Documentary on baseball great Hank Greenberg runaway hit
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Passy
</P>
<P>
   c, 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - He didn't have Babe Ruth's
larger-than-life appeal. He didn't marry a movie star a la Joe
DiMaggio. And if you look up his name in the books, you'll find
he's not at the top of the list in any career categories.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is a movie about Jewish baseball great Hank Greenberg
the runaway documentary of the year?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that no one can easily answer, not even Aviva
Kempner, the 53-year-old writer and director of ``The Life and
Times of Hank Greenberg.'' What should have been a picture that
only ran in major markets and small festivals _ it was shown last
year at the Palm Beach International Film Festival and the Palm
Beach Jewish Film Festival _ is now in the midst of a full national
release.
</P>
<P>
   It's already among the top 20 grossing documentaries in the
United States, making more than $1 million at the box office.
Granted, those aren't Star Wars numbers, but this is a film that
begins with a rousing rendition of Take Me Out to the Ballgame _ in
Yiddish!
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of films that three generations can go to,
and in that respect it's real rewarding,'' Kempner says.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the picture's unexpected popularity, she says that
``there are two natural audiences who gossip _ the Jewish-American
audience and baseball mavens.'' It's such gossip that she believes
has helped Hank Greenberg find its way to moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   John Vanco, co-president of the picture's distributor, Cowboy
Booking International, agrees. ``I can't remember such a pure
word-of-mouth film with as much momentum,'' he says. ``We expect
the film to continue to break records.''
</P>
<P>
   For those unaware of Greenberg's name and reputation, here's a
crash course: The product of a middle-class Jewish family from New
York, Greenberg, who died in 1986 at 75, ignored his parents'
advice that he pursue a ``professional'' career _ say, as a lawyer
or doctor _ and let his love of baseball be his guide.
</P>
<P>
   Although never a particularly nimble athlete, he had a natural
strength and commanding presence, standing 6-foot-4. He was signed
by the Detroit Tigers in 1933 and soon established himself as one
of the American League's premier power hitters, nearly topping Babe
Ruth's record of 60 home runs in a single season when he belted 58
in 1938. He also led his team to World Series appearances and was
selected the league's Most Valuable Player in 1935 and 1940. He
ended his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1947, playing his
final year for the record-breaking sum of more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg's story is only partly about baseball. As the
first Jewish superstar in any professional sport, he became a
symbol for the hundreds of thousands of first- and
second-generation Jewish-Americans who were shedding their ties to
the ``old country'' and looking to establish an identity for
themselves in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although not particularly religious, Greenberg never denied his
Jewish heritage _ and his decision not to play on Yom Kippur, the
most sacred Jewish holiday, during a 1934 pennant race made
national headlines, with gentile fans respecting his move. Even
more noteworthy was that Greenberg did all this in Detroit, a city
that was home to such notorious anti-Semites as auto magnate Henry
Ford and radio personality the Rev. Charles E. Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Kempner makes sure to include footage of Ford and Coughlin at
the Tigers' ballpark, one of the film's many subtle ways of
underlining Greenberg's triumph against the odds. The director and
writer came to the subject naturally. The daughter of Jewish
immigrants from Europe _ her mother is a Holocaust survivor _
Kempner was born and raised in Detroit and remains an ardent
baseball fan. Although she never saw Greenberg play, she remembers
hearing plenty about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank's name was invoked so much growing up, I thought he was
part of the Kol Nidre liturgy,'' she says, referring to the Yom
Kippur religious service.
</P>
<P>
   Kempner, who lives in Washington, decided to do the film as soon
as she heard of Greenberg's death. She had just completed the
widely praised ``Partisans of Vilna,'' a documentary about Jewish
resistance against the Nazis, and was looking for a new subject. If
Partisans was about the Jewish experience in Europe in the '30s and
'40s, Greenberg would reflect the American side of the coin. It's
the story of one man, but in a larger sense, it's the story of an
emerging people in a new society.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary covers Greenberg's life through his retirement
in 1947 and builds with the quiet intensity of a dramatic film.
Greenberg essentially ``narrates'' the picture _ through interviews
captured either on video or audio (he was recording his memoirs at
the time of his death). Complementing the package are newsreel
clips and interviews with everyone from Greenberg's family members
and former teammates (Bob Feller, Charlie Gehringer, Ralph Kiner)
to such prominent Jewish-Americans as lawyer Alan Dershowitz and
Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The latter are especially important because they give a sense of
Greenberg's importance to a younger generation of Jewish-Americans.
Although there were other Jewish role models in politics and law,
they couldn't compare with a star slugger. ``It's just the same
with Jackie Robinson and blacks. It meant for blacks they could
enter that arena (of popular culture),'' says Kempner. ``For Jews,
it made them feel more American.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the film, Kempner poignantly captures the
first encounter between Greenberg and Robinson, when the Jewish
great offered words of encouragement while the emerging black star
praised him as a role model. For New York Times sports columnist
Ira Berkow, who's also Jewish, that one moment distills the essence
of Greenberg _ and the film. ``You would hope a person of Jewish
background would act the way Greenberg did toward Robinson. ...
Hank never let us down,'' says Berkow, who helped edit Greenberg's
autobiography and served as a consultant on the film.
</P>
<P>
   Such special moments weren't necessarily easy to come by.
Kempner spent more than a decade doing research and interviews. She
says the process was largely slowed by a lack of money. Even though
the film cost only $1 million to make, it was hard finding
financial support, particularly since Kempner started working
heavily on the project at the same time Ken Burns was doing his
baseball documentary for public television.
</P>
<P>
   When Kempner approached potential contributors, be they
individuals or private foundations, she was told, ``Ken's doing it
all.'' In the end, she had to rely on support from the Greenberg
family _ and she admits she still hasn't paid all the bills,
including her own salary.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the project is that it's unlikely Greenberg, an
extremely modest man, would have approved of it. ``He didn't
realize how important he was to the American people. He had no
idea,'' says the slugger's sister-in-law, Marilyn Greenberg, an
Atlantis resident who appears in the film. ``He thought he was a
good ballplayer, but this would have come as a big shock to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many women who knew the twice-married athlete during his
lifetime, Marilyn Greenberg, who is married to Greenberg's brother
Joe, was consistently awed by his looks and charm, another facet
that comes across in the film. ``He was the handsomest guy I have
ever seen in my life,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and you almost wonder why Greenberg didn't
make a stab at politics during his post-baseball career; instead,
he worked in management with the Cleveland Indians and Chicago
White Sox and eventually retired in California, where he played
tennis regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Kempner can't help but compare Greenberg's story to that of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, who recently became the first Jewish-American to
be nominated on a presidential ticket. But even she admits,
Lieberman may have an easier time in his run with Al Gore for the
White House. Greenberg had to endure anti-Semitic taunts in
ballpark after ballpark. As Kempner notes, ``It's more a political
and social glass ceiling with Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took Kempner's mother to put the Lieberman nomination and
the film's success in proper perspective. She told her daughter
that it took a baseball great to pave the way for the vice
presidential nominee _ and the picture is the conduit that conveys
that idea to the public. Lieberman ``can do it now because of your
film. People feel proud,'' said the elder Kempner to her child.
</P>
<P>
   That may be overstating the case, but who's to argue with a
Jewish mother? Certainly, not Kempner, who says Jewish-Americans
``don't forget our heroes.'' And like the man himself, The Life and
Times of Hank Greenberg proves that there's no predicting the path
of glory.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone's surprise, this 95-minute, independently made
documentary has become a home run of a release.

WIRED: NERVY WORD THAT BUGS OUR TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 3)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Bill Clinton expressed contrition at a preconvention
interview at a church gathering in Illinois, the Rev. Bill Hybels,
one of his pastoral advisers, put his hand on the president's
shoulder and prayed with him, saying, ``Thank you, God, that you
 &UR; wired him up &LR;  the way you did.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wired &LR;  bids fair to be the most multisensed ``hot'' word on the
American linguistic scene. No other old word has more new meanings.
Up to 1980, according to a search engine that puff-puffs its way
through all the libraries in the world, 61 books had  &UR; wired &LR;  in the
title, but in the past 20 years, almost 400 more have been added.
</P>
<P>
   The noun began in the Latin  &UR; viere &LR; , ``to plait,'' and the Greek
 &UR; iris &LR; , ``rainbow.'' The Old High German  &UR; wiara &LR;  meant ``fine gold
work.'' As a verb, its early definitions _ ``fasten or strengthen
with a metal tie'' and ``connect in an electrical circuit'' _
remain, but in our technological time the wound-together word has
burst into a rainbow of senses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wired for sound &LR; , applied in the '50s to people wearing hearing
aids, was the name of a 1986 song by Michael W. Smith and Wayne
Kirkpatrick. This was in the Christian contemporary rock section of
music stores, deploring the difficulty of studying the Word of God
amid the cacophony of ``a world that's  &UR; wired for sound &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   An entirely different meaning of  &UR; wired for sound &LR;  was emerging
at the same time: ``The joint is  &UR; wired &LR;  ....'' wrote J.D.
MacDonald in a 1957 novel, ``A Man of Affairs.'' ``The next step is
cameras and infrared and tape recorders, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The single word  &UR; wire &LR;  stood for ``electronic eavesdropping.'' A
person fitted with a surreptitious recording device to help others
spy on conversations is said to  &UR; wear a wire &LR; . This was what Monica
Lewinsky refused to do for investigators for the independent
counsel looking into her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, beginning in 1969, another meaning of  &UR; wired &LR;  was
taking root: ``high on amphetamine drugs; manic.'' A mild precursor
of this, reported by John Farmer in his 1890 slang dictionary, was
``irritated; provoked.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of its modern offshoot, not necessarily drug-related,
ranges from ``edgy, jumpy, uptight'' to ``pumped up, visibly
nervous'' to ``feverishly excited.'' It was the title of Bob
Woodward's 1984 book, ``Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of
John Belushi.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense also first cited in 1969 is from the computer world:
``having circuits connected permanently and designed for an
unchangeable function.'' Scientific American noted in 1981 that
``it is a rule of thumb in computer science that an operation can
be executed fastest when it is  &UR; hard-wired &LR;  into the computer
rather than specified as part of a program.'' Why ``hard''? Because
that differentiates it strongly from the software, which is not
part of the machine's wiring.
</P>
<P>
   This computer meaning was quickly transferred to neuroscience
and applied to the workings of the brain. ``These cells are
 &UR; hard-wired &LR;  and ready for action,'' wrote The New Scientist in
1971, ``as soon as the kitten opens its eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few years the professor of astronomy Carl Sagan was
writing, ``The brain is completely  &UR; hard-wired &LR; : Specific cognitive
functions are localized in particular places in the brain,'' an
assertion since largely confirmed by imaging technology, though
experience or accident can cause ``rewiring'' to take place.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the New York Times architectural critic Herbert
Muschamp, writing about the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla,
Calif., noted that the Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman's institute
was ``partly inspired by Edelman's theory that the brain's
architecture is shaped by our experiences. Tell me what you like,
and I will tell you how you're  &UR; wired &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   That sense was later applied to more general opinions or
abilities. When Joseph Lieberman was chosen by Al Gore to be his
running mate, Rabbi Avi Shafran told The New York Times that
concern about Jewish visibility in politics was ``sort of
 &UR; hard-wired &LR;  into our system, for better or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a coach for the California Bears recently told The
San Francisco Chronicle that he had high hopes for a young player
because ``he's  &UR; wired &LR;  the right way for a quarterback'' _ that is,
he had the stable temperament and quick reactions suited to that
position.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet came into being, another new sense was applied:
``adept at the use of the computer, tuned into the culture of the
Internet.'' In Paris, a group that had tried to launch a magazine
called Electric Word was reaching for a new name for a magazine
addressed to the cyberworld. Jane Metcalf said to John Rosetto,
John Plunkett and Barbara Kuhr, `` &UR; Wired &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   George Shirk, editor of that successful publication's
independent offshoot, Wired News, sees their role as heralds of
``the Virtual Class, people in technology, finance, marketing,
media, law, politics and education who are driving the Digital
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   A related sense, beyond the specific Internet culture, is ``part
of a network of people with related interests; integrated into a
social set or part of an informatrix.'' A more pejorative side to
this is ``set up to take advantage of high-level contacts'': a deal
that is rigged, its outcome arranged beforehand not on the basis of
merit or fair competition, is subject to the charge of being
 &UR; wired &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the question ``Is he  &UR; wired &LR; ?'' can mean ``Is he sure to
get the job?'' Or ``Is he tense, excited, on `speed'?'' Or ``Is he
 &UR; au courant &LR; , with-it, where it's at?'' Or ``Is his brain's
activity predetermined?'' Or ``Is he fitted with a secret
microphone?'' Or ``Is he temperamentally disposed for this?'' Or
``Is he on the Net?''
</P>
<P>
   How will this past participle of a short verb, in future
permutations, further transform its meaning and vivify our tongue?
Nobody, no matter how well connected, can tell which senses will
prevail and which will pass into archaisms. Stay  &UR; wired &LR; .

   New Use for Lard
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to making a flaky pie crust, home cooks of a
certain generation know that there's nothing quite like lard.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have learned that
when it comes to firing up an industrial boiler, there's nothing
quite like lard either. They found that lard, along with inedible
fat from the pig (a substance with the delectable name of choice
white grease) can be used to replace No. 6 fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, at the university's Energy Institute, worked
with a regional meat packer that processes 7,000 hogs a day.
Needless to say, that makes for a lot of lard, which the processor
sells as animal feed (by the tanker-truckload to veal producers) or
as human feed (by the drum- or tub-load to bakeries and
restaurants). The processor was concerned about what would happen
if these markets for lard were to dry up.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers showed that lard and choice white grease could
be burned in a boiler that normally runs on No. 6 oil (which is
heavier than the oil used in home furnaces) with little or no need
to modify the equipment. They found that gallon for gallon, the
pork fat produces slightly less energy than oil, but it burns
cleaner. (Although lard is a solid at room temperature, boilers
that burn No. 6 oil generally heat the oil first to about 120
degrees, which is high enough to melt the fat.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, lard and choice white grease sell for more than fuel
oil. But should that change, the meat processor, which has several
boilers at its main plant, might have another option _ to keep the
home fires burning with its own byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Crocodile Hearts
</P>
<P>
   The typical car motor has a simple valve that keeps the engine
coolant running through the radiator, cooling it down. It works
this way unless the engine is cold, in which case the valve shunts
the water away from the radiator, keeping it circulating around the
engine until things warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Crocodiles, it turns out, have a special heart valve, called a
cog-tooth valve, that works in somewhat the same way. Under certain
conditions it shunts blood away from the lungs, keeping it
circulating around the body.
</P>
<P>
   The cog-tooth valve is apparently found in all crocodiles, and
had long puzzled scientists as to its function. Researchers in
Sweden and Australia, examining a type of crocodile found in
Australia and Papua New Guinea, were finally able to determine what
the valve does. Their work is reported in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Most heart valves act passively, allowing the blood to flow in
one direction while the heart is pumping and preventing it from
backing up while the heart is at rest. The cog-tooth valve has a
more active role, and the researchers found that its function is
affected by adrenaline and similar hormones. The researchers
suggest that the valve helps crocodiles extend the amount of time
they spend underwater, in effect rationing the oxygen in the blood
so that vital organs continue to get nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking Space Dust
</P>
<P>
   It's a fact of life in the aerospace business _ rockets
occasionally blow up. When an explosion happens on the launching
pad or soon after liftoff, it is a spectacular, costly and
potentially life-threatening event.
</P>
<P>
   But rockets can also explode in space, and that can create
problems of a different sort. Last March, leftover propellant
caused the upper stage of a Chinese rocket to explode, spewing a
cloud of ultrasmall debris particles that have the potential to
damage other spacecraft and satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a space-dust experiment has detected debris from the
Chinese rocket. The experiment, run by scientists from the
University of Chicago, records the impact of the orbital dust and
debris coming into contact with a collector device. This is the
first time that space dust impacts have been tied to destruction of
a spacecraft or satellite, and should help in planning how to keep
their satellites away from damaging debris.

   The Information Age is opening up a new world of economic
possibilities _ but not for everyone. Those who don't have access
to computers and the Internet are being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Unless countries and communities find a way to bridge the
digital divide, the economic disparities between rich and poor will
likely worsen.
</P>
<P>
   But just throwing dollars at the problem won't be sufficient. As
technology guru Esther Dyson recently wrote, ``Just as in venture
finance, money alone isn't always enough if it's used inefficiently
and support systems aren't in place ... The skills it takes to
build companies must translate to the task of building a better
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Martin Varsavsky. A 40-year-old entrepreneur based in
Madrid, Spain, he has founded six companies over the past two
decades, including telecommunications and Internet start-ups
Einsteinet, Internet Factory, Jazztel, Ya.com and Viatel.

   Having made his fortune in high tech, Varsavsky is now applying
his entrepreneurial expertise to the philanthropic work of closing
the digital divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivations of an Internet entrepreneur and a
philanthropist are essentially the same,'' he says. ``They both
pinpoint problems, economic or social, and set out to solve them in
a new way. At best, they both have people's interests at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   AN EDUCATIONAL PORTAL
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Varsavsky's venture philanthropy is his native
Argentina. He is donating $11.2 million to help the country's
Ministry of Education launch an Internet portal that will give
Argentina's 10 million grammar, high school and university students
access to learning tools, online texts, e-mail, chat rooms, forums
and research.
</P>
<P>
   He is also helping the ministry establish a company, Educar SA,
to operate the portal. The company will sell online advertising and
e-commerce capabilities, generating funds to buy computers and
networking hardware for the country's 40,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the company will be privatized, providing even more
money for improving the schools' technological infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   For Argentine educators and government officials, Varsavsky's
proposal must seem like a dream come true: According to the current
plan, all the country's schools will be wired within four years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its educational benefits, the project makes business
sense as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, teachers and school workers account for one in three
Argentines,'' Varsavsky says. ``That's a huge market, representing
$50 billion in annual spending, and companies will pay handsomely
to reach it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any criticism about mixing commerce and education,
Varsavsky has a blunt reply: ``The ideal, of course, would be to
have a portal without advertising, but we need the ads to generate
the money to get computers into the schools. No ads, no access.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING PERSONAL
</P>
<P>
   Varsavsky has a large personal stake in the venture. In 1977,
when he was just 17, his family was forced to flee Argentina, which
at the time was ruled by a military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a family of Jewish intellectuals,'' he says, ``and
we were chased out of our home for refusing to buckle under the
fascist government. We were reluctant to leave, but when the
military kidnapped and killed my cousin, David Varsavsky, my father
realized that we had to go in order to protect ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience left Varsavsky with deeply divided feelings about
his former home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a part of me that will never forgive Argentina for
putting my family and many others through such pain,'' he explains.
``But when I saw that Argentines were being left out of the new
economy, that the Internet revolution was passing the nation by, I
felt like I had to do something. The better educated the Argentines
are, the less likely a terror like the one I lived through will
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Varsavsky's effort in Argentina may provide a
template for other successful entrepreneurs who want to give
something back to society.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to closing the digital divide, business-building
skills may be more valuable than cash, and lending those skills may
be more fulfilling than just writing checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you donate money, you feel happy to have contributed,''
Varsavsky says, ``but the feeling is not nearly as profound as when
you put your time and energy into helping create something out of
nothing.''

</P>
<P>
   Joe Castle, Dave Souza and Ryan Bahar had been close friends
since their freshman year in college, when fate brought them
together as roommates.
</P>
<P>
   They were an unlikely threesome. Different backgrounds,
different interests. But as business partners, they were a perfect
fit. Socaba.com, the company they founded six months after
graduation, had taken off, and they hadn't looked back in the four
years since then.
</P>
<P>
   Socaba.com sold furniture, office supplies, computer equipment
and office-management services to small professional service firms.
</P>
<P>
   Dave had come up with the original idea for the business, so he
was the president, CEO and chairman. A computer geek, he oversaw
the site's construction and had the clearest ideas about strategic
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, the English major, had been the company's marketing guru
from day one.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, whose parents owned a chain of discount stores, handled
the company's back office.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ryan and Joe were senior vice presidents, but the titles
meant little to the team. When they had to make any major decision,
they made it together.
</P>
<P>
   Early customers were drawn to Socaba's one-stop shopping. And
now that it had a large network of customers, it was able to
negotiate discounts on equipment and services from a broad set of
suppliers. It had also recently added new service offerings, such
as low-cost group insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company had electronic bulletin boards where
customers could discuss the products, seek advice and network.
</P>
<P>
   But predictably, Socaba's success had created a need for more
help at the top to handle fulfilling the orders, negotiating
contracts with suppliers, integrating new software and managing
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The team had struggled with these new tasks for months when
Karen Poole had begun to talk with them about bringing in managers
from outside. She was the venture capitalist from a small local
firm that was Socaba's biggest source of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, guys, you'll still have plenty of say in running
the business,'' she had promised them, ``but you need to get some
professionals in here to bring the company into the major leagues.
Face it, Socaba is growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders realized she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Karen recruited a COO, a CIO and a CFO about six months ago. The
COO, Margaret Satchel, had come from the top management ranks at a
major office supply company.
</P>
<P>
   The CIO, Cliff Singer, had launched a successful e-tail business
of his own and sold out at a tremendous profit not long before
coming to Socaba.
</P>
<P>
   And the CFO, Darlene Seibel, had been second in command at a
major HMO. Besides her financial skills, she was widely respected
as a progressive thinker on the potential of the Internet to
improve health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have a full team,'' Karen had said at the lunch to
welcome the three new executives. ``This business is really going
to grow and prosper.'' Apart from this initial cheerleading
session, though, she had pretty much left them on their own.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's first projects: to seriously consider an
offer from OfficeOne to merge with Socaba.com.
</P>
<P>
   INNOCENT MISTAKES?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, while the business continued to do well, the team
never gelled.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the group of six had started off by holding regular
Monday morning meetings. Over time, however, several of the
meetings had been canceled for various reason, and formal meetings
between the insiders and outsiders had become sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   The three senior people found themselves taking counsel with one
another more and more frequently and generally ignoring the younger
trio.
</P>
<P>
   On day, during a meeting of the top dozen or so people in the
company, Joe had casually mentioned that he was ready to sign a
partnership agreement with an accounting services firm.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret interrupted him immediately with a terse ``What are you
talking about?'' and Darlene followed up with a short, heated
speech on the importance of sharing information. Cliff just folded
his arms and stared into space.
</P>
<P>
   Joe insisted that he hadn't left the managers out of the loop
intentionally. Along with Dave and Ryan, he pledged to do better in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENED?
</P>
<P>
   In Dave's apartment, the three young friends rehashed the events
of the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been them against us,'' Dave said. ``It's not that
they grew apart from us. We never really joined ranks in the first
place. And that's our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not entirely,'' Joe disagreed. ``They started out talking more
to each other than to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like we really made an effort?'' Dave countered. ``Like we're
making an effort now? Look at us. Why are we having another meeting
before a meeting?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, you're the one who wanted to talk about this tonight,''
Ryan said. ``Do you really think it's that much of a problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do'' Joe said. ``Almost every day we find an excuse to meet
without them _ to make some decision behind their backs. Karen
called today, and she's worried. Cliff is ready to walk. Says he's
frustrated. The only thing holding him here is the options.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan looked horrified. ``You waited until now to tell us that?
What the hell were you thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Dave opened his mouth to agree, but Joe put his hand up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying an experiment,'' he said. ``I was trying to make
you feel like they must feel. Left out. I think it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a long silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point taken,'' Ryan conceded. ``But we still have a big
problem: the OfficeOne deal. I wouldn't be surprised if our three
colleagues weren't also holed up somewhere discussing their
strategy. Who's in charge here, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Joe said, ``we can't make the deal with OfficeOne. If
we do, we'll lose our relationships with all the other big
suppliers. We didn't start this business to be a unit of some fat
incumbent. Socaba can be bigger than OfficeOne.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan shook his head. ``Yeah, but if we say that, it'll just
confirm what they all believe: that we're just three naive dreamers
who've been lucky so far. They want the sure bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that the OfficeOne deal is a bad idea,'' Dave said,
``but if we just go in and say no, we'll lose Cliff, and we might
lose Karen. We lose Karen, we're in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOULD SOCABA'S CO-FOUNDERS DO TO KEEP THE COMPANY ON
TRACK?
</P>
<P>
   FIRST ANALYSIS: Tom Scott is the co-chairman of Nantucket
Nectars, a Cambridge, Mass.-based juice company that he founded in
1989 with former college classmate Tom First.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Dave, Joe and Ryan didn't know what they were
getting into when they accepted VC funding and then, at the VC's
urging, brought in new managers. They probably saw dollar signs and
knew they could get the money.
</P>
<P>
   To me, building a great company isn't just about making money.
It's also about creating something of value that can last. The guys
probably had that view initially, but they now seem to be stuck in
a situation in which they've given up control over the company's
vision and direction. Their best bet may be just to get out of the
business. I'd rather do that than work with people I didn't see eye
to eye with.
</P>
<P>
   In our case, Tom First and I have always retained control over
the board and management. In my view, 75 percent of a startup's
success comes from emotion, and 25 percent comes from skill and
experience. We always had the commitment to making our company
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no matter what percentage of the company you own, you have
to have the skills to be CEO _ or else you shouldn't have the job.
You should be in the job because of the value you bring to the
company, not for legal reasons. It's hard to know if Dave is really
suited to be Socaba's ongoing CEO. If he is, he's got to start
acting like a leader _ and the OfficeOne deal is a good place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with OfficeOne needn't be a problem. Tom and I sold
half of Nantucket Nectars to Ocean Spray in 1998, and we did so
because they wanted us to stay on as presidents of the company and
run it as a separate corporation. So if control is the issue, the
OfficeOne partnership may be right for the Socaba founders,
provided they retain their authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Socaba guys started off as entrepreneurs, but by taking on
venture funding, they may have lost the chance to see their ideas
through to the end. Now they must decide if their problems with the
new managers are because of poor communication or deeper concerns
that stem from their gut feelings about the business. If it's the
latter, and they don't feel they can work with the outsiders, they
should take their money and move on.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND ANALYSIS: Christine Comaford is a managing director of
Artemis Ventures, a Sausalito, Calif.-based company that invests in
start-ups which offer business-to-business Internet software and
services. Comaford's analysis:
</P>
<P>
   The problems are clear: lack of leadership, passivity from all
the players and a failure to define roles and company direction.
</P>
<P>
   Dave, Joe, Ryan and Karen should have hammered out who would own
what area. Karen just parachuted the executives in and expected
things to work out. But without clear roles, the two sides will
fight for turf.
</P>
<P>
   I would have made Dave the CTO and Cliff the CEO _ Cliff seems
like a seasoned entrepreneur. Ryan would likely report to the COO,
Margaret. Joe could still handle marketing. At this stage, you
wouldn't need both a COO and a CFO.
</P>
<P>
   And who's in charge of sales? It's a bad sign that people were
hired without a thoughtful plan based on Socaba's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the regular Monday meetings is a major problem.
The VC should know who's driving the marketing team, who's driving
the operations, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The executive team should hold weekly meetings, as well as
monthly meetings with their VCs. The latter would include an
operational review, followed by a board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The kids must realize that they must give up the control they've
enjoyed for the past four years. That's what happens when you seek
out venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   About the OfficeOne deal, it will be impossible to make an
informed decision until roles are defined and a leader emerges.
</P>
<P>
   If Socaba continues to drift internally, it will end up as
nothing more than a blip on the screen of e-commerce.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Information Age is opening up a new world of economic
possibilities _ but not for everyone. Those who don't have access
to computers and the Internet are being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Unless countries and communities find a way to bridge the
digital divide, the economic disparities between rich and poor will
likely worsen.
</P>
<P>
   But just throwing dollars at the problem won't be sufficient. As
technology guru Esther Dyson recently wrote, ``Just as in venture
finance, money alone isn't always enough if it's used inefficiently
and support systems aren't in place ... The skills it takes to
build companies must translate to the task of building a better
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Martin Varsavsky. A 40-year-old entrepreneur based in
Madrid, Spain, he has founded six companies over the past two
decades, including telecommunications and Internet start-ups
Einsteinet, Internet Factory, Jazztel, Ya.com and Viatel.
</P>
<P>
   Having made his fortune in high tech, Varsavsky is now applying

   Socaba.com sold furniture, office supplies, computer equipment
and office-management services to small professional service firms.
</P>
<P>
   Dave had come up with the original idea for the business, so he
was the president, CEO and chairman. A computer geek, he oversaw
the site's construction and had the clearest ideas about strategic
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, the English major, had been the company's marketing guru
from day one.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, whose parents owned a chain of discount stores, handled
the company's back office.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ryan and Joe were senior vice presidents, but the titles
meant little to the team. When they had to make any major decision,
they made it together.
</P>
<P>
   Early customers were drawn to Socaba's one-stop shopping. And
now that it had a large network of customers, it was able to
negotiate discounts on equipment and services from a broad set of
suppliers. It had also recently added new service offerings, such
as low-cost group insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company had electronic bulletin boards where
customers could discuss the products, seek advice and network.
</P>
<P>
   But predictably, Socaba's success had created a need for more
help at the top to handle fulfilling the orders, negotiating
contracts with suppliers, integrating new software and managing
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The team had struggled with these new tasks for months when
Karen Poole had begun to talk with them about bringing in managers
from outside. She was the venture capitalist from a small local
firm that was Socaba's biggest source of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, guys, you'll still have plenty of say in running
the business,'' she had promised them, ``but you need to get some
professionals in here to bring the company into the major leagues.
Face it, Socaba is growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders realized she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Karen recruited a COO, a CIO and a CFO about six months ago. The
COO, Margaret Satchel, had come from the top management ranks at a
major office supply company.
</P>
<P>
   The CIO, Cliff Singer, had launched a successful e-tail business
of his own and sold out at a tremendous profit not long before
coming to Socaba.
</P>
<P>
   And the CFO, Darlene Seibel, had been second in command at a
major HMO. Besides her financial skills, she was widely respected
as a progressive thinker on the potential of the Internet to
improve health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have a full team,'' Karen had said at the lunch to
welcome the three new executives. ``This business is really going
to grow and prosper.'' Apart from this initial cheerleading
session, though, she had pretty much left them on their own.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's first projects: to seriously consider an
offer from OfficeOne to merge with Socaba.com.
</P>
<P>
   INNOCENT MISTAKES?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, while the business continued to do well, the team
never gelled.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the group of six had started off by holding regular
Monday morning meetings. Over time, however, several of the
meetings had been canceled for various reason, and formal meetings
between the insiders and outsiders had become sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   The three senior people found themselves taking counsel with one
another more and more frequently and generally ignoring the younger
trio.
</P>
<P>
   On day, during a meeting of the top dozen or so people in the
company, Joe had casually mentioned that he was ready to sign a
partnership agreement with an accounting services firm.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret interrupted him immediately with a terse ``What are you
talking about?'' and Darlene followed up with a short, heated
speech on the importance of sharing information. Cliff just folded
his arms and stared into space.
</P>
<P>
   Joe insisted that he hadn't left the managers out of the loop
intentionally. Along with Dave and Ryan, he pledged to do better in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENED?
</P>
<P>
   In Dave's apartment, the three young friends rehashed the events
of the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been them against us,'' Dave said. ``It's not that
they grew apart from us. We never really joined ranks in the first
place. And that's our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not entirely,'' Joe disagreed. ``They started out talking more
to each other than to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like we really made an effort?'' Dave countered. ``Like we're
making an effort now? Look at us. Why are we having another meeting
before a meeting?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, you're the one who wanted to talk about this tonight,''
Ryan said. ``Do you really think it's that much of a problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do'' Joe said. ``Almost every day we find an excuse to meet
without them _ to make some decision behind their backs. Karen
called today, and she's worried. Cliff is ready to walk. Says he's
frustrated. The only thing holding him here is the options.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan looked horrified. ``You waited until now to tell us that?
What the hell were you thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Dave opened his mouth to agree, but Joe put his hand up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying an experiment,'' he said. ``I was trying to make
you feel like they must feel. Left out. I think it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a long silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point taken,'' Ryan conceded. ``But we still have a big
problem: the OfficeOne deal. I wouldn't be surprised if our three
colleagues weren't also holed up somewhere discussing their
strategy. Who's in charge here, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Joe said, ``we can't make the deal with OfficeOne. If
we do, we'll lose our relationships with all the other big
suppliers. We didn't start this business to be a unit of some fat
incumbent. Socaba can be bigger than OfficeOne.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan shook his head. ``Yeah, but if we say that, it'll just
confirm what they all believe: that we're just three naive dreamers
who've been lucky so far. They want the sure bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that the OfficeOne deal is a bad idea,'' Dave said,
``but if we just go in and say no, we'll lose Cliff, and we might
lose Karen. We lose Karen, we're in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOULD SOCABA'S CO-FOUNDERS DO TO KEEP THE COMPANY ON
TRACK?
</P>
<P>
   FIRST ANALYSIS: Tom Scott is the co-chairman of Nantucket
Nectars, a Cambridge, Mass.-based juice company that he founded in
1989 with former college classmate Tom First.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Dave, Joe and Ryan didn't know what they were
getting into when they accepted VC funding and then, at the VC's
urging, brought in new managers. They probably saw dollar signs and
knew they could get the money.
</P>
<P>
   To me, building a great company isn't just about making money.
It's also about creating something of value that can last. The guys
probably had that view initially, but they now seem to be stuck in
a situation in which they've given up control over the company's
vision and direction. Their best bet may be just to get out of the
business. I'd rather do that than work with people I didn't see eye
to eye with.
</P>
<P>
   In our case, Tom First and I have always retained control over
the board and management. In my view, 75 percent of a startup's
success comes from emotion, and 25 percent comes from skill and
experience. We always had the commitment to making our company
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no matter what percentage of the company you own, you have
to have the skills to be CEO _ or else you shouldn't have the job.
You should be in the job because of the value you bring to the
company, not for legal reasons. It's hard to know if Dave is really
suited to be Socaba's ongoing CEO. If he is, he's got to start
acting like a leader _ and the OfficeOne deal is a good place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with OfficeOne needn't be a problem. Tom and I sold
half of Nantucket Nectars to Ocean Spray in 1998, and we did so
because they wanted us to stay on as presidents of the company and
run it as a separate corporation. So if control is the issue, the
OfficeOne partnership may be right for the Socaba founders,
provided they retain their authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Socaba guys started off as entrepreneurs, but by taking on
venture funding, they may have lost the chance to see their ideas
through to the end. Now they must decide if their problems with the
new managers are because of poor communication or deeper concerns
that stem from their gut feelings about the business. If it's the
latter, and they don't feel they can work with the outsiders, they
should take their money and move on.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND ANALYSIS: Christine Comaford is a managing director of
Artemis Ventures, a Sausalito, Calif.-based company that invests in
start-ups which offer business-to-business Internet software and
services. Comaford's analysis:
</P>
<P>
   The problems are clear: lack of leadership, passivity from all
the players and a failure to define roles and company direction.
</P>
<P>
   Dave, Joe, Ryan and Karen should have hammered out who would own
what area. Karen just parachuted the executives in and expected
things to work out. But without clear roles, the two sides will
fight for turf.
</P>
<P>
   I would have made Dave the CTO and Cliff the CEO _ Cliff seems
like a seasoned entrepreneur. Ryan would likely report to the COO,
Margaret. Joe could still handle marketing. At this stage, you
wouldn't need both a COO and a CFO.
</P>
<P>
   And who's in charge of sales? It's a bad sign that people were
hired without a thoughtful plan based on Socaba's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the regular Monday meetings is a major problem.
The VC should know who's driving the marketing team, who's driving
the operations, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The executive team should hold weekly meetings, as well as
monthly meetings with their VCs. The latter would include an
operational review, followed by a board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The kids must realize that they must give up the control they've
enjoyed for the past four years. That's what happens when you seek
out venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   About the OfficeOne deal, it will be impossible to make an
informed decision until roles are defined and a leader emerges.
</P>
<P>
   If Socaba continues to drift internally, it will end up as
nothing more than a blip on the screen of e-commerce.

WEIGHING THE POVERTY FACTOR IN BREAST-FEEDING GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A recent study in India suggests that
breast-feeding alone may not provide enough sustenance to babies in
the developing nations when their mothers are severely
malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   The report adds fuel to a debate about a decade-old campaign by
the World Health Organization and other U.N. agencies that advocate
an exclusive reliance on breast milk for the first six months of
life.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ an Indian National Family Health Survey report
titled ``Are WHO Guidelines on Breast-Feeding Appropriate for
India?'' _ concludes that babies can and should be given
supplementary liquids or soft foods as young as 2 or 3 months to
overcome the deficiencies in the milk of a malnourished mother.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey drew immediate criticism from officials from the
World Health Organization and Unicef, the U.N. Children's Fund.
Both groups say that breast-feeding provides the safest, most
health-giving nourishment, providing antibodies against diarrheal
disease and eliminating risks posed by contaminants often
introduced into baby formula or other supplements through the use
of dirty water.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about breast-feeding in the developing world have
arisen because of AIDS, with studies still assessing the possible
transmission from mother to baby of the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization's guidelines say that
breast-feeding should begin immediately after birth and that
infants should receive no other food until they are 4 to 6 months
old, when supplements may be added to provide additional nutrients.
Breast-feeding, in combination with other foods, is recommended
until a child is at least 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In India, with a population of 1 billion, decades of maternal
health programs have failed to dent significantly the high
incidence of malnourishment among children, according to the World
Bank, which says that more than half the children under 4 in India
are severely malnourished and 60 percent of mothers are anemic. Put
another way, 40 percent of all the world's malnourished children
are Indian. Infant mortality in India is still high, at 79 for
every 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the new survey on the role of breast-feeding in
nutrition and mortality was published jointly by a state
demographer from South India and a specialist in population and
health studies from the East-West Center in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   The report looked at breast-feeding practices measured against
not only infant mortality statistics but also social and economic
factors in the lives of the mothers in three groups of
high-mortality, medium-mortality and low-mortality Indian states.
Breast-feeding is the norm everywhere in India and usually
continues beyond infancy, providing a common backdrop for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   While the authors _ Ravilla Anandaiah, demographer for the Tamil
Nadu directorate of family welfare, and Minja Kim Choe, a senior
fellow at the East-West Center _ did not dispute the value of
breast-feeding, they wrote that the purpose of their survey was
``to shed light on how infant survival in India can be improved by
modifying infant-feeding practices and to evaluate the
appropriateness of the WHO guidelines for breast-feeding _
especially the guideline recommending exclusive breast-feeding up
to 4 to 6 months.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors surveyed mothers of children born in the previous
four years, asking them at how many months a baby was regularly
given plain water, other milk, other liquids or solids or mushy
food.
</P>
<P>
   They found that almost everywhere, babies were being given
supplementary liquids or solids at an age lower than international
health officials had recommended, and that the food was apparently
safe because the presence of supplementary food was not related to
higher death rates. Advocates of only breast-feeding say that the
risk of contamination, particularly by dirty water, rises when
other foods are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey found that in all mortality groups, both
exclusive and nonexclusive breast-feeding seemed to lower mortality
rates in the early months. But the benefits of exclusive
breast-feeding dropped for older infants, the authors concluded,
because ``children's nutritional needs are not met completely by
mother's milk after the first few months of infancy.''
</P>
<P>
   By 3 to 6 months in states with high mortality rates, the survey
says, ``mortality is higher among those who are breast-fed
exclusively.'' In these high-risk states _ Assam, Bihar, Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh _ ``breast-feeding with
supplements has the most beneficial effect on child survival.''
Mothers who breast-fed exclusively were the poorest, most
illiterate and likely to be the most malnourished.

RUDY SURVIVES HIS POLITICALLY INCORRECT ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something about Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   As in, bigot. As well as public favorite and media darling.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Survivor'' is over, he's either going to fade back
into his Florida retirement oblivion or stay in the limelight to
cash in on his streak of celebrity. He might even turn up on the
next ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, Rudy became a sort of national cuddly bear by the
time the TV series ended last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' inadvertently gave us American television's first
openly gay male lead, Richard Hatch, who effectively defined the
show and won the million-dollar competition.
</P>
<P>
   But it also gave us Rudy Boesch, who apparently stood for the
endearing side of unabashed homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get home (and) my wife asks me about who was with
you,'' he said at one point on the show, ``I'll say a queer who ran
around bare-assed half the time, for one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He was Archie Bunker all over again. But Rudy wasn't the
caricatured invention of a liberal TV producer, as Bunker was.
Rudy's puss is the face of real-life, bad-ass bigotry. And viewers
loved him.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy's popularity was partly because of his age, 72, and his
military record _ two Bronze Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly because of his this-too-shall-pass stoicism. He
didn't whine or sulk; he just sat and gazed. It was partly because
of his hidebound sense of honor. He gave his word and kept it.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also because he didn't run his comments through the
laundry bleach of political correctness. When Rudy spoke at all, he
said pretty much whatever popped into his little mind, usually in
single syllables.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think it was entirely guileless. In the
post-``Survivor'' town hall show on CBS on Wednesday, I was struck
by the little smile that accompanied one of his ``queer''
references to Richard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a smile that said he knew he was being amusing, and
knowingly naughty. I'll bet he's ribald fun at cocktail parties
with his old Navy buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I called him `queer' is so all my good SEAL team
buddies will know what I'm talkin' about,'' Rudy told Bryant
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting. In the recesses of the Pentagon, did some Navy
public relations officer slam his palm to his forehead when he
heard that?
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel tried to nudge Rudy into one of those feel-good TV
revelations, asking him if his island bond with Richard had changed
any of his preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   You can lead a bigot right up to the creek, but you can't make
him drink. ``Nah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gumbel should have practiced a variation of the don't ask,
don't tell doctrine. But you knew the subject would come up.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed and applauded. That's just Rudy. Besides,
there's something oddly liberating about the vicarious experience
of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   But what might gay viewers have thought? That this is what Rudy
learned in wearing the uniform of the United States of America for
more than 40 years?
</P>
<P>
   And mightn't it have occurred to gay viewers that Rudy was paid
and equipped all those years by taxes collected in sizable measure
from the very people he curled his lip at on national TV?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously it wouldn't have occurred to Rudy himself. He's a
product of the tight sphere of the U.S. Navy, and there's a dark
side to Navy tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Seomin, entertainment and media director for the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in Los Angeles, says that among
the branches of the U.S. military, ``overall the two most
homophobic are the Marines and the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation
of Southern California charged that the Navy penalized homosexual
activity more severely than it punished sailors for child
molestation or rape.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it was the Navy that tried to blame a gay
sailor, Clayton Hartwig, for an explosion that killed 47 sailors,
including Hartwig, aboard the battleship Iowa in 1989. Hartwig was
later exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of that. Back to Rudy, the grumpy gay-basher. Seomin
also noticed the laughter and applause when Rudy talked about
``queers'' on the post-``Survivor'' special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy is one thing,'' Seomin said, ``but America's reaction to
him is something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had called Gervase (a black contestant on the show) the
N-word, the audience would not have been laughing or applauding.
They'd have been gasping. ... Any attack on any other minority
would not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rudy was a sufficiently appealing figure to make TV safe
again for gay-bashing, if only for the 13 weeks of ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a throwback. The pertinent question is whether the
country laughed with him or at him.
</P>
<P>
   Some of each, I suspect. The ratio is a fair measurement of how
far we've come, and how far we have to go.

 MONSTER IN A BOX: Virtual pet can make every day a living hell
_  in a good way  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many evil people in the world, but not one of them
deserves to be insulted by a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not a droll verbal piranha like Seaman. This digital
amphibian with a human face pretends to be a virtual pet game from
Sega. He's not. He's more a conniving roommate hell-bent on running
his owner's life.
</P>
<P>
   Try working while, in the next room, a voice calls, ``Hey, skin
puppet! You out there? I'm hungry!''
</P>
<P>
   Try making dinner as, from the virtual television fish tank, an
oily Seaman coos, ``Hell-ooo-oo, my little fuzzy one. Can we
talk?''

   Seaman likes to tell his owner to ``get a life.'' This is
impossible. The owner is too busy catering to Seaman to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   How is such an abomination possible? Easy. Sega's virtual pet
simulation uses the Dreamcast console's voice-recognition system to
create a chatty interactive environment. One of Dreamcast's
best-selling titles to date in Japan, the game requires players to
raise a humanoid fish from an egg, then bond with him and be driven
crazy by him for more than a month before he evolves and gives them
a little peace.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the nuts and bolts: The Seaman game comes with a
special Visual Memory Unit, which records the fishy one's progress
and vital data. Players communicate with Seaman using a microphone
attached to the Dreamcast controller. The console's digital pad
operates various functions such as lighting, water temperature and
oxygen content.
</P>
<P>
   The game boasts Leonard Nimoy as narrator and guide. In his
inimitable drone, Nimoy introduces each session with insights into
Seaman's needs and personality quirks. All action _ can swimming
lazily and offering droll commentary be considered action? _ takes
place in Seaman's aquarium, with the ability to toggle to a food
screen and a terrarium where larvae are raised to meet the scaly
one's culinary requirements. He must be fed twice a day or perish.
</P>
<P>
   Once hatched from his egg, the soon-to-be-Seaman evolves into
four little humanoid ``gill-men'' who soon graduate from baby talk
to monosyllabic conversation. Time passes, and through a hideous
process of natural selection, the gill-men eliminate one another
until only two adult Seamen remain. Eventually one of these knocks
off the other in a gut-churning mating ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: Seamen in ecstasy are not a pretty sight. Warning: The
surviving Seaman _ your pet _ is not above making indecent
propositions to humans. Proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   As his vocabulary develops, the inquisitive fish will troll the
player's personal life, asking about age, sex, marital and
employment status and other pertinent data. At his most garrulous,
Seaman will launch into monologues on the state of Internet
culture, sports, politics and the nature of being. Seaman loves the
sound of his voice when he's dissembling.
</P>
<P>
   The human can always take revenge, however. Use the cursor to
tickle Seaman, flick him or lift him squealing out of his tank. For
the ultimate cruelty, chant ``PlayStation,'' a word guaranteed to
rankle Dreamcast's star fish.
</P>
<P>
   He might dish out scads of grief, but Seaman is also a hoot to
have around. He looks cute paddling around on the TV screen,
singing to himself and ruminating on scaly metaphysics. His dry
asides can brighten an afternoon. When times are hard, he'll even
deign to offer solace.
</P>
<P>
   For all the weird fun, there's also lots of downtime with
Seaman. If he's grumpy and uncommunicative, the game is reduced to
hours of tedious fish-tank voyeurism. Watch Seaman swim. Swim,
Seaman, swim.
</P>
<P>
   Potential boredom isn't Seaman's only drawback. The speech
recognition system often garbles messages, leading to surreal
conversations in which the player chats about the temperature and
Seaman talks about Toshiba laptops. Game play can be slow when
there are too many objects onscreen _ say, multiple moths and
spiders in the terrarium _ and the visuals, while lovely, are
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman is great for those who enjoy verbal sparring or just want
a little virtual companionship. Those looking for the thrills of
``Crazy Taxi'' or other high-energy Dreamcast games might want to
consider taking up bungee jumping instead.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's always swordfishing.

<P>
   Over the last decade, more Americans have been heading to the
weight room.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimates that one in five people lifts weights
regularly. The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association reports an
89 percent increase in the number of people lifting free weights
and a 50 percent increase in those using weight machines from 1987
to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But as more people get involved in weight training, more people
get hurt. A new study from the University of Arkansas looked at
more than 20,000 weight-training injuries from 1978 to 1998 and
found sharp increases in injuries. In men over 50, weight-training
injuries jumped 331 percent over the 20-year period, while injuries
among their female counterparts rose 212 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study, believed to be the largest to look at weight-training
injuries, was published in a recent issue of the journal The
Physician and Sportsmedicine. Overall, the increase was found to be
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure may be deceivingly low. ``We only looked at
emergency room data,'' said Dr. Chester S. Jones, associate
professor of health science at the University of Arkansas in
Fayetteville. ``There are many, many more kinds of strains and
sprains that happen when you weight train that don't send you to
the ER.'' Twenty years ago, he added, weight lifting was strictly
for young men, Jones said. ``But over the past two decades, older
men, and women of all ages have discovered the benefits of weight
training, so they are participating more and more. But that also
means they are getting injured more.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of strength training for those over 50 can be
significant. A number of recent studies show that building strength
can sharply reverse the loss in muscle and bone density that occurs
as the body ages. That may explain why the percentage of men and
women over 45 who are lifting weights has more than doubled in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But because the rate of injuries has outpaced increases in
participation among certain groups, experts suspect that many of
these converts may not be lifting correctly. Or, they may be
squeezing in workouts on the weekends. between work, family and
other responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in their 40s and 50s are often `weekend warriors' who
tend to do very intense activities for small amounts of time,''
said Dr. Edward R. Laskowski, co-director of the Mayo Sports
Medicine Center in Rochester, Minn. ``When you do too much on those
weekend days, you raise the risk of overload injuries. Plus, it's
important for older adults to remember that the aging body can't
get away with as much.'' The Arkansas study also pointed to
increases in injuries among those who work out at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at home rarely have someone overseeing them, so they
lift much too fast,'' said Thomas C. Purvis, a physical therapist
in Oklahoma City, who uses resistance training with his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pointed out another hazard: ``At home, weights are often
lying around, and children can get injured. Children under the age
of 4 are particularly susceptible.''
</P>
<P>
   Most common in the University of Arkansas study were soft-tissue
injuries like bruises, sprains and strains, with the hand as the
most frequently hurt body part. But because the research looked
only at injuries severe enough to require an emergency-room visit,
it most likely is skewed toward more serious acute injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In his practice at the Mayo Clinic, Laskowski points out that he
frequently sees problems of the shoulders, like rotator cuff injury
and tendinitis. His patients also commonly complain of
musculoskeletal pain in the upper and lower back, often from
exercises that combine upper and lower body movements, like squats.
He also sees large numbers of knee problems, mainly from people
doing knee extensions incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent weight-training injury, Laskowski, Jones and
Thomas Purvis offer these suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _Work out consistently. That means finding time to lift weights
several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   _Do not rush through a resistance workout. Lower the weights
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   _Get help from a professional.
</P>
<P>
   _Use weights properly at home. Those who have never tried weight
training or haven't lifted for years should take a class or hire a
trainer, even for just a few sessions. Even when working out at
home, participants should wear shoes when lifting weights and store
the weights in a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   _Use the weights only as intended. In his study, Jones found 34
deaths associated with weight training, all but one related to
unsafe use of the weights. For instance, one person drowned in a
swimming pool after using a weight belt as an anchor for a
breath-holding exercise.

 &HT;    FEW CALL WINDOWS 2000 A SMOOTH SELLER &HT;    By KELLY ZITO
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Microsoft introduced its most ambitious
software project to date in February to the wailing guitar of
Carlos Santana, the company said Windows 2000 was a ``bet the
ranch'' product.
</P>
<P>
   But now, six months after the final notes of ``Smooth'' have
faded, some wonder whether the product has inspired the fervor
embodied by the launch party.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Windows 2000, the software for running corporate
computer networks and desktops, have fallen short of some analysts'
expectations. And that has left some to speculate whether the
company, known for setting off around-the-block lines for its
consumer software, will make good on its goal to elbow its way into
the high-end business market, now dominated by the likes of arch
nemesis Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it's right on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales of Windows 2000 have met and in some cases exceeded our
expectations,'' said Jim Ewel, vice president of Microsoft's
Windows 2000 servers division.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Redmond, Wash., software titan said it had sold
about 3 million Windows 2000 licenses through June 30. While that
figure sounds impressive, it fell roughly 20 percent short of
influential Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund's benchmark for
that time period _ though Microsoft contends Sherlund was comparing
the product to Windows 95, the wildly popular consumer operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   And because Microsoft didn't disclose which licenses were for
desktop versions of the software and which were for servers that
run corporate networks _ the market Microsoft clearly is trying to
capture _ some industry watchers believe most of the licenses were
for the former.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Microsoft has `gazillions' of units on
small machines, but their real goal is to be a player on large
machines,'' said Jeff Tarter, editor of industry newsletter
Softletter. ``If a lot of those units are desktop machines, that
doesn't buy them anything against Sun or Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Microsoft and some analysts who track the company
have stressed that the successor to the NT product would take time
to catch on, since big organizations often take more time and money
to install so-called enterprise systems. Microsoft has not released
any target figures for Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enterprise product, not a departmental product,''
said Melissa Eisenstat, analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. ``As a bigger
enterprise product, it requires a longer evaluation cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some analysts suspect a certain confluence of events in
the information technology industry may be gnawing at Windows 2000
sales. First of all, some companies just lifted their Year 2000
spending freezes this summer, meaning they're just beginning to
evaluate or install Windows 2000 now.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many businesses, be they mom-and-pop operations or giant
multinationals _ are trying to ``fatten their pipes'' for
transmitting data and build Web sites for selling goods and
services online, said Laura DiDio, analyst at Giga Information
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the latest operating system from Microsoft
simply isn't as sexy as e-commerce or Internet infrastructure, or
even Linux, the Unix variation that has garnered a grassroots
following by painting itself as the anti-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the product's sheer complexity _ it represents
about 35 million lines of code _ translates into more time in the
training room for IT workers and additional ramp-up time for
third-party developers _ which means there may not be as many
Windows 2000-compatible applications on the market yet for some
tastes (Ewel said that 10,000 applications run on Windows 2000 and
that 500 are being added per month).
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft wanted to make sure that when Windows 2000 shipped,
it had a very high level of applications compatibility,'' DiDio
said. ``So they made the certification and testing requirements
more stringent for third-party developers, which is a great idea in
theory, but a lot of them are small _ they're not Oracle or Seibel
_ and it takes longer for these vendors to make sure their
applications qualify, and not all of them have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor in Microsoft's favor: Many of those who have
installed the product give it high marks for reliability, speed and
cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo estimates that it will save several million dollars
in redundant, inefficient software and hardware when it finishes
shifting all of its 125,000 employees to Windows 2000 by October
2001.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, some analysts believe the product will catch
on _ famously, in fact. But with some companies just starting to
look serious at Windows 2000, it may not happen until very late
this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NT 4.0 was a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house, this is
akin to packing up all your stuff and building a mansion that you
have to design, rewire and buy new furniture for,'' said DiDio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not something people can just jump into,''
said Dustin Sauter, enterprise systems engineer at Wells Fargo.
``That would be like giving yourself a self-inflicted gunshot
wound.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not give financial analysts _ who often expect
Microsoft to see a major bump in revenues immediately following a
release _ anything to crow about in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   But over the long haul, many do expect the product to give
Microsoft a firmer footing in the corporate marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major product,'' said IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky.
``It's going to change the way people do things. It's just going to
take awhile.''

 &HT;    TECH 21: TAKING STOCK OF INTEL'S ACTIONS (COLUMN) &HT;    By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last week, I cranked out four news stories about
Intel Corp. and the technologies and initiatives it was announcing
at the fall edition of its semiannual technical conference, the
Intel Developers Forum (IDF).
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of coverage _ probably more than The Chronicle has
given to any other tech company in years, except those in deep
trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a friend of mine who suggested that the paper put an
``Intel Inside'' logo on the front, I haven't received any
complaints about the quantity of ink we devoted to the IDF, but a
couple of readers wrote in to grouse about the quality. In effect,
they suggested that I had succumbed to a snow job from the
chipmaker.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they're right _ I  &LR; am &LR;  impressed with Intel. Of
course, I'm not alone in this _ Wall Street seems to feel the same
way. The company's shares ended last week just shy of the all-time
high they hit on Wednesday. During the past year they have nearly
doubled, and during the past five years they have grown roughly
tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've followed the company closely since the early
1990s. At that time I worked in the Macintosh trade press, and
Apple, of course, didn't _ as it still doesn't _ use Intel
processors. But two seemingly contradictory developments persuaded
me to study up on the Santa Clara chipmaker.
</P>
<P>
   One was that the Mac, then based on Motorola 68000-family chips,
always seemed to be struggling to keep up with the latest PCs in
processing performance. The other was that Apple had joined with
IBM and Motorola to develop a new chip family called the PowerPC,
and those companies were claiming that they were about to deliver
processors with twice the performance of Intel's best _ at only
half the price.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip, they argued, would turn the industry on its head,
forever shattering the desktop dominance Intel had acquired when
IBM adopted its chips for the first PC.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this rhetoric came from marketers paid to hype the
upcoming PowerPC. More of it came from Mac zealots who made up in
enthusiasm what they lacked in knowledge. But in those years, many
genuine experts were also talking trash about Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the issue was that the company's PC chips _ the
so-called x86 family, including the 386, 486 and what was soon to
become the Pentium line _ were based on a design philosophy known
as complex instruction-set computing, or CISC for short. Motorola's
68000 series was, too, but the PowerPC reflected a newer approach
called reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC.
</P>
<P>
   In essence (propeller heads please pardon the simplification),
CISC chips include circuitry specially designed to carry out some
complicated kinds of calculations _ even some that programs use
relatively rarely _ on a single command. The idea behind RISC was
to get rid of much of this specialized circuitry and concentrate on
executing basic, commonly used instructions as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   With RISC, a complex calculation would require multiple
instructions to the processor, but streamlined hardware could
perform each of them faster. The net effect was supposed to be a
sharp increase in overall performance as well as reduced costs.
</P>
<P>
   The case for RISC sounded pretty plausible, and most academic
computer scientists seemed to buy it. Most persuasively, all the
leading workstation makers _ Sun, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and others _
had moved from CISC to RISC for their high-performance products.
</P>
<P>
   But I did notice a few flies in the ointment. One was that
serious people from Intel, although very familiar with RISC _ the
company had produced several RISC designs of its own, for non-PC
applications _ were insisting that their CISC-based x86
architecture had decades of life left in it.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem was the empirical data. In general, according
to technical benchmarks, RISC chips did outperform their CISC
cousins. But over time Intel's x86 chips weren't falling any
farther behind _ when you graphed the improving performance of
successive generations, the curve was parallel to that of the RISC
processors.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1993 I raised this issue with a top technical
manager at Apple, a former professor of computer science at a
distinguished university, who had been laying out the standard case
for RISC to me. He leaned close and said, ``Yeah, but you know what
the problem is? They (Intel) aren't playing fair _ they're throwing
 &LR; too much money &LR;  at the problem!''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped. What else did he expect? What did ``fairness'' have to
do with anything? Intel's near monopoly on the desktop generated so
much revenue that, practically speaking, there were no limits on
what it could afford in R&AMP;D, and the company had every incentive to
spend whatever was necessary _ including hiring some of the
brightest engineers around _ to defend its position at the center
of the PC world.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the brilliant engineers it was hiring were busy
assimilating the lessons of RISC. To maintain compatibility with
the software that customers already had, they couldn't change the
x86 instruction set, but they adopted many other design features
common in the RISC chips _ technical tricks like
``superpipelining'' and ``out-of-order execution.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, internally, x86 chips have gradually grown more similar
to RISC processors. They just decode the complex x86 instructions
into simpler ``micro-ops'' that are roughly equivalent to RISC
instructions. That entails some extra work upfront, but once it's
done, the ``execution engines'' that do the actual data crunching
inside the chip can operate as efficiently as anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel has also taken advantage of its vast resources
and talents to push ahead on the manufacturing front, developing
ways to etch ever smaller and faster transistors onto its silicon.
IBM may be the technical leader here, but Intel is the champ in
terms of high-volume production. The result has been declining
costs and increasing frequencies, which translate into ever-better
performance from a given chip architecture.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, many RISC proponents refused to accept the
reality of all this. Another memorable moment in my dealings with
Apple came in 1995, when I listened to Michael Mace, then head of
the Cupertino company's competitive-analysis group, deliver a
presentation about the ``brick wall'' he argued Intel was about to
hit.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail exchange afterward I pointed out that Intel's
financial results looked a whole lot better than Apple's at that
point. He assured me that Intel's top executives would be ``out on
the street'' within a year, once the company's board realized that
they had steered it down a technical dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   I offered to bet my annual salary against his that that wouldn't
happen. Unfortunately for me, he refused to accept the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Mace, by the way, is now ``chief competitive officer'' at Palm.
For that company's sake I hope he doesn't underestimate Microsoft's
Pocket PC and other challenges as badly as he did Intel's
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few well-publicized but quickly corrected screw-ups
_ for example, the Pentium math bug, the privacy-threatening serial
number issue and some slowness in recognizing the trend toward
lower-cost PCs _ Intel ``executed,'' as the MBAs put it, almost
flawlessly through most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years it has had more problems. This year, for
example, it badly underestimated demand, thereby opening the door
for rival Advanced Micro Devices to capture significant market
share with its own increasingly impressive x86-compatible
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has also suffered a number of serious delays and even
recalls, mainly stemming from its efforts to push the PC industry
into a new style of memory called Rambus or Direct RDRAM. The
company seems to have overestimated the performance benefits of
this new technology and underestimated how much memory
manufacturers would charge for it. And when it met with determined
resistance in the marketplace, Intel whipped up a technical quick
fix _ an intermediary chip that was supposed to make it possible to
use older-style RAM with Intel products originally designed for
RDRAM _ that turned out to be so problematic the company finally
had to scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett acknowledges that these
glitches have been embarrassing. ``I don't believe in bad luck,''
he said in a conversation last week. ``It was a series of
management failures _ we kind of dropped the ball.'' But he
insisted his team knows what to do to prevent recurrences: ``We're
just going back to the basics _ the same techniques we've relied on
in the past, like monitoring the critical paths and making sure the
key projects get the staffing they need to get done on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that will be sufficient, or new approaches will be
required to deal with the exponentially increasing complexity of
the products the company develops, only time will tell. Based on
the record, though, I don't think it pays to bet on Intel failing.
</P>
<P>
   But over the long haul the company confronts some larger issues.
Its bread-and-butter business, PC processors and chipsets,
continues to grow, but not at the astronomical rates of years past.
And within that arena I think Intel is bound to face an
increasingly difficult challenge in trying to persuade customers,
whether at home or in business, to keep trading up to newer and
faster processors every few years. I know I used to consider myself
a performance junkie, but I'm having a hard time justifying
replacing my 400-MHz Pentium II system.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, I'm convinced it's going to get harder to
persuade people to pay the premiums Intel has always commanded for
its top-of-the-line processors. And those chips make grossly
disproportionate contributions to Intel's margins and thus its
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, for instance, a 1-GHz Pentium III carries a wholesale
price of $990, while the 800-MHz version goes for only $294 _ even
though both are made of the same materials on the same equipment,
probably on the very same production line.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett pooh-poohed this issue when I posed it to him last week.
``For 10 years that's the most common question I've been asked,''
he said. ``It's usually reporters who are getting old who ask it.''
</P>
<P>
   Touche.
</P>
<P>
   (The gruff tone, by the way, is characteristic, but Barrett may
have been especially testy when I met him, for very understandable
reasons: He was just back from a weekend fighting the wildfires
that had already swept 5,000 acres of his 10,000-acre ranch in
Montana. He had also been dealing with firefighting officialdom
that, to hear him tell it, was ``government bureaucracy at its
worst.'')
</P>
<P>
   To the substance of my question, he said, ``The good news is
that there are younger people coming along doing MP3s, digital
video, voice recognition, and so on'' _ activities that soak up
processor cycles like they're going out of style.
</P>
<P>
   He has a point, of course, and he has the sales figures to prove
it. At least for now, Intel's biggest challenge is too much, not
too little, demand for its products.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, Barrett recognizes that the company has to
diversify if it is to maintain anything close to historic rates of
growth. That's why he has extended its processor line up-market,
into the lucrative server arena (with the Xeon and soon the
Itanium), and engineered the dozens of acquisitions that are making
Intel into a powerhouse in the burgeoning field of networking and
communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, it remains to be seen how all these new ventures
will work out. Many of the products and services Intel has
announced in these areas are just beginning to reach the market,
and Barrett acknowledges some mistakes in assimilating its
acquisitions, mainly by ``smothering them with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   But networking and communications are obviously the places to be
at this point, and the speed with which Barrett and his team have
been moving to get the company there is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not involved in the PC industry, there's something
else about Intel you might not know: Over the last decade the
company has gradually adopted the role of point man in pushing the
PC forward, not just by making faster processors, but also by
developing or rallying support for innovations in other parts of
the platform.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Intel-led initiatives have produced many of the key
features of today's PCs: the PCI standard for expansion cards, the
Universal Serial Bus (USB) for external peripherals and the AGP
slot for graphics cards. Others, like Serial ATA, a superfast new
interface for hard drives, and Bluetooth, a low-power radio
technology that will link up computers, peripherals and cell phones
wirelessly, will almost certainly enter the mainstream during the
next year or two. And many other such efforts are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Intel doesn't always succeed in these efforts. As I noted last
week, its attempts to promote more stylish and consumer-friendly
industrial design by funding the development of ``concept PCs''
hasn't yielded much fruit yet. Another effort, a once-promising
plan for an expansion scheme called Device Bay, has pretty much
evaporated. And in at least one area _ wireless home networking _ I
happen to think the company has been backing the wrong horse,
pushing a new standard called HomeRF instead of 802.11, a rival
technology that already works well and has wide industry support.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it do all the work by itself. In each area the company
brings together other key industry players in a working group to
set goals, hammer out standards, test for interoperability and
develop marketing materials and programs. And Microsoft, for better
or worse, plays a key role in determining whether and when these
innovations make it into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But the main point is that by taking leadership Intel has filled
a serious void. IBM, of course, originally defined the PC standard,
but during the course of the 1980s, as it lost market share to what
were then called ``IBM compatibles'' or ``clones,'' it lost the
clout to steer the industry in new directions. Compaq tried,
notably with its ``EISA'' card standard, but few of its jealous
rivals were willing to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The result, for a while, was technical stagnation _ or, perhaps
worse, fragmentation into multiple incompatible standards. Remember
the proliferation of video-card technologies in the early 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   Intel's leadership has gone a long way to alleviate this
problem. Of course it doesn't do it out of charity _ its goal is
plainly to sell more of its own processors, chipsets and in some
cases more specialized products. But insofar as it promotes its own
interests by making the PC more versatile and, especially, easier
to use, we're all the beneficiaries.

&HT;     VISITS IN PLEXIGLAS BOOTHS PROPOSED FOR CALIF. DEATH ROW
INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Death row inmates in California, who were facing
the possible end to a long-standing tradition of open-room contact
visits, might instead be visiting their relatives and friends
inside Plexiglas booths.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal awaiting formal approval, assorted Plexiglas
booths would be constructed for condemned inmates at San Quentin
State Prison.
</P>
<P>
   While the booths are triggering consternation and anger from
some inmates, visitors and prisoners' rights advocates, they
represent a compromise of sorts. A few months ago, San Quentin
Warden J.S. Woodford favored outright termination of all contact
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad that the prison now recognizes that some form of
contact visits should be reinstated,'' said Kevin Neel, a spokesman
for the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the Campaign to End the
Death Penalty. ``But the restrictions inherent with the Plexiglas
booths are still unnecessary. There's a community feeling in the
visiting room that would be lost because everyone would be
isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Contact visits, which for years have taken place inside a
spartan room that functions much like a social hall _ inmates could
freely circulate among friends and family _ were suspended after a
violent outburst March 31 between two inmates, rival gang members,
in the East Block visiting room.
</P>
<P>
   The clash marked the first time in prison history that two
inmates had fought within the ``neutral territory'' of the room,
according to San Quentin spokeswoman Lt. Patricia Blanson.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, prison officials curtailed contact visits
because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of only a few states permitting contact visits
for condemned prisoners deemed to be on good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Following disclosure of a proposed permanent halt to contact
visits, as well as tightened restrictions requiring appointments
and limiting the number and duration of visits, relatives and
prison rights activists unleashed a storm of protest, calling the
crackdown unduly harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, a copy of a protest petition signed by 178
condemned inmates was delivered to the San Francisco office of Gov.
Gray Davis. A new petition, protesting the Plexiglas booths, is
being circulated on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fama, a staff attorney with the Prison Law Office who has
been involved in discussions with San Quentin over the visiting
program, said that about a dozen booths are expected to be
constructed in the East Block visiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Fama said that ``a less expensive answer is for the prison to
return to the program that existed before, and more carefully
consider who they put into the waiting room at the same time. Many
inmates believe the March 31 incident was isolated and wouldn't
have happened if prison officials had kept apart the two
individuals who they had previously determined shouldn't be allowed
on the same exercise yard.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fama, the booths are a modification of an earlier
proposal to install a U-shaped table in the East Block visiting
room _ inmates would have sat within the U while their visitors
lined the table's perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to build the Plexiglas booths there needs to
be improvement in terms of San Quentin's telephone system and
increasing staff to handle the calls and addressing the special
needs of those who travel long distance,'' Fama said. ``Problems
with the scheduling process threaten to undermine the entire
visiting program. I think they ought to go back to the way it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Vernell Crittendon, a San Quentin spokesman, declined to
address any specifics, including costs, of the proposed plan,
saying that approval from the California Department of Corrections
may take several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a plan,'' he said. ``We're not going to publicly
release it. We are working to develop a safe visiting procedure.''

 MONSTER IN A BOX: Virtual pet can make every day a living hell
_  in a good way  
 (Eds: Game details at end)  
 By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many evil people in the world, but not one of them
deserves to be insulted by a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not a droll verbal piranha like Seaman. This digital
amphibian with a human face pretends to be a virtual pet game from
Sega. He's not. He's more a conniving roommate hell-bent on running
his owner's life.
</P>
<P>
   Try working while, in the next room, a voice calls, ``Hey, skin
puppet! You out there? I'm hungry!''
</P>
<P>
   Try making dinner as, from the virtual television fish tank, an
oily Seaman coos, ``Hell-ooo-oo, my little fuzzy one. Can we
talk?''
</P>
<P>
   Seaman likes to tell his owner to ``get a life.'' This is
impossible. The owner is too busy catering to Seaman to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   How is such an abomination possible? Easy. Sega's virtual pet
simulation uses the Dreamcast console's voice-recognition system to
create a chatty interactive environment. One of Dreamcast's
best-selling titles to date in Japan, the game requires players to
raise a humanoid fish from an egg, then bond with him and be driven
crazy by him for more than a month before he evolves and gives them
a little peace.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the nuts and bolts: The Seaman game comes with a
special Visual Memory Unit, which records the fishy one's progress
and vital data. Players communicate with Seaman using a microphone
attached to the Dreamcast controller. The console's digital pad
operates various functions such as lighting, water temperature and
oxygen content.
</P>
<P>
   The game boasts Leonard Nimoy as narrator and guide. In his
inimitable drone, Nimoy introduces each session with insights into
Seaman's needs and personality quirks. All action _ can swimming
lazily and offering droll commentary be considered action? _ takes
place in Seaman's aquarium, with the ability to toggle to a food
screen and a terrarium where larvae are raised to meet the scaly
one's culinary requirements. He must be fed twice a day or perish.
</P>
<P>
   Once hatched from his egg, the soon-to-be-Seaman evolves into
four little humanoid ``gill-men'' who soon graduate from baby talk
to monosyllabic conversation. Time passes, and through a hideous
process of natural selection, the gill-men eliminate one another
until only two adult Seamen remain. Eventually one of these knocks
off the other in a gut-churning mating ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: Seamen in ecstasy are not a pretty sight. Warning: The
surviving Seaman _ your pet _ is not above making indecent
propositions to humans. Proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   As his vocabulary develops, the inquisitive fish will troll the
player's personal life, asking about age, sex, marital and
employment status and other pertinent data. At his most garrulous,
Seaman will launch into monologues on the state of Internet
culture, sports, politics and the nature of being. Seaman loves the
sound of his voice when he's dissembling.
</P>
<P>
   The human can always take revenge, however. Use the cursor to
tickle Seaman, flick him or lift him squealing out of his tank. For
the ultimate cruelty, chant ``PlayStation,'' a word guaranteed to
rankle Dreamcast's star fish.
</P>
<P>
   He might dish out scads of grief, but Seaman is also a hoot to
have around. He looks cute paddling around on the TV screen,
singing to himself and ruminating on scaly metaphysics. His dry
asides can brighten an afternoon. When times are hard, he'll even
deign to offer solace.
</P>
<P>
   For all the weird fun, there's also lots of downtime with
Seaman. If he's grumpy and uncommunicative, the game is reduced to
hours of tedious fish-tank voyeurism. Watch Seaman swim. Swim,
Seaman, swim.
</P>
<P>
   Potential boredom isn't Seaman's only drawback. The speech
recognition system often garbles messages, leading to surreal
conversations in which the player chats about the temperature and
Seaman talks about Toshiba laptops. Game play can be slow when
there are too many objects onscreen _ say, multiple moths and
spiders in the terrarium _ and the visuals, while lovely, are
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman is great for those who enjoy verbal sparring or just want
a little virtual companionship. Those looking for the thrills of
``Crazy Taxi'' or other high-energy Dreamcast games might want to
consider taking up bungee jumping instead.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's always swordfishing.

 &HT;    BOOK PUBLISHERS LEARN FROM NAPSTER &HT;    By BENNY EVANGELISTA
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the online release of his electronic
novella ``Riding the Bullet,'' scare master Stephen King has proved
the power of the printed word is the same even without the ink and
paper.
</P>
<P>
   But King's venture into the unknown realm of digital is also
helping to put a scare into the publishing industry, which sees the
rapidly developing e-book revolution as both filled with promise
and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, book publishers want to avoid getting slashed by
an unforeseen menace like their counterparts in the music industry
discovered with digital music, MP3s and Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry let the genie out of the bottle _ letting
digital music get out before anyone anticipated that was a
problem,'' said Gene Gable, general manager of Seybold Seminars,
host of this week's major publishing industry conference.
</P>
<P>
   E-books will be the hottest topic at Seybold San Francisco 2000
as about 30,000 publishing industry representatives converge on the
city's Moscone Center to discuss how they can control and master
the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the book production process has been digital for
years, but the final product remained in print, allowing publishers
to maintain control of the distribution, Gable said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the final product also starting to come out in
electronic form, authors like King can reach their public directly
and consumers can access reading material they couldn't before,
like research material and out-of-print books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most publishers think of themselves as distribution
companies,'' Gable said. ``Now, manufacturing and distribution is
less of a part of their business than their content. In some ways,
both the opportunities and the threats get much larger. It's a
little bit scary, too, because losing control is a concern.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of companies, from well-known players such as Microsoft
and Adobe to newcomers Mightywords and Barnes and Noble-backed
IUniverse, will occupy an 11,000-square-foot ``e-Book showcase'' on
the floor of the Moscone Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a dozen firms that have some sort of service or
technology'' for digital rights management of electronic books,
said Mark Walter, editor of the Seybold Report on Internet
Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical time for the publishing industry: Emerging
e-book platforms must maintain enough copyright protection without
making it so complicated that consumers will choose easier but
illegal methods of downloading books. That's the conundrum the
recording industry still hasn't been able to solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is, digital rights management is not just
protection, but for promotion,'' Walter said. ``How do publishers
sell books in a new way to new people in a way that doesn't let the
genie out?''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, digital music in formats like MP3 is still far more
popular than e-books because music is already widely available in
digital form on CDs. The publishing industry, which has basically
controlled the distribution of the printed word almost since the
invention of the Gutenberg press, had been wary of making its
content widely available in digital form.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the popularity of e-books _ novels, reference books and
other printed matter made available for reading on computers or
handheld devices designed to make the reading experience similar to
that of a print book _ has so far been limited because consumers
still prefer reading text on paper instead of on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   But King's ``Riding the Bullet,'' released only in e-book form
in March, was the first book from a best-selling author to be
released in all-digital form. His three-part serial ``The Plant,''
which premiered July 24, was also all-digital.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Riding the Bullet,'' downloaded about 400,000
times in just the first 24 hours, opened eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, big publishing houses like McGraw-Hill and Time Warner
books have their own e-book divisions. Just last week, Simon &AMP;
Shuster became the latest major publisher to get in on the act. The
company, a unit of media titan Viacom, announced plans to publish a
list of titles _ including ``Star Trek''-related books and one
about the ``Blair Witch Project'' _ in digital form.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomson Multimedia, which makes the well-known RCA consumer
electronic products, last week said it will jump into e-books with
an RCA-brand device. The RCA REB1100, which will have a 51/2-inch
touch-screen display, will use technology developed by Rocket
E-Books, the Bay Area company bought by Gemstar-TV Guide
International Inc. earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Adobe, with its widely distributed Acrobat software,
and Microsoft, which recently introduced its Windows Book Reader
software for personal computers, are jostling to make their
software the dominant e-book reader platform in another potential
Microsoft-versus-Netscape battle, Walter said. Both software
companies are expected to make important e-book announcements this
week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An often-quoted study by Andersen Consulting said the demand for
e-books will grow to $2.3 billion in the United States by 2005,
representing a significant new revenue stream for the $24 billion
U.S. book industry.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of EBOOKS28 (20066 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But a Seybold study to be released today shows publishing
industry insiders have a slightly more skeptical view of e-books
than the Andersen study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   A random sample of Seybold seminar attendees in Boston and San
Francisco during the past year found only 11 percent believed print
books, newspapers and magazines will be replaced by electronic
print in the next 20 years. And only 33 percent of those who
already tried using an e-book reading device said they would buy
and read a book on a computer or handheld device.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also indicated that the Seybold attendees who were
e-book users did not want leisure reading material like a horror
story, but that 64 percent wanted to use computers to read
reference books, maps and travel guides.
</P>
<P>
   Seybold's Walter said that while recreational books are now
grabbing the headlines, reference books and text books figure to
generate more revenues in the short term. Publishing houses that
now edit and lay out books digitally are experimenting with using
the same process to create custom printed books.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a college professor can compile the best
chapters from five different text books and have then printed into
one custom textbook for his students.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe Chief Executive Officer John Warnock says he believes
``print on demand'' e-books will outpace the sale of e-books
downloaded into ``cute'' book-reading devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see if any of these devices takes off,'' Warnock said.
``But I don't think that's the compelling part of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   E-books may be still in their infancy, but they could grow up
quickly, Gable said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people say `I love books' (that) they're never going
to replace the feeling of a real book,'' Gable said. ``But when you
start to think about the kids now using the Internet, they're not
going to have that romantic attachment to the printed word as we
had.''

 &HT;    SEEING GREEN IN GENES &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now that the map of the human genome is nearly
complete, investors are wondering how to profit from the knowledge
locked in the double strands of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the various companies involved in genomics _
the study of how genes influence health and disease _ have taken
different paths toward the pot of gold at the end of the double
helix.
</P>
<P>
   One group, including Incyte Genomics of Palo Alto and
DoubleTwist Inc. of Oakland, aspires to be information brokers,
selling genetic data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms,
which pay millions for clues that might speed the development of
billion-dollar drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A second group of genomics players, including Neomorphic Inc. of
Berkeley and Hyseq Inc. of Sunnyvale, has decided to get into the
drug business, using their understanding of genes to find and
develop promising potential drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This clash of business plans is echoed on the national stage.
Celera Genomics, the Maryland company that was first to sequence
the human genome, has adopted the info broker model. Its neighbor
and rival, Human Genome Sciences, has taken the drug development
route, as has Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Massachusetts, another
genomics leader.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to predict which of these firms will succeed, or
which business model will win. But the stories of these San
Francisco Bay Area genomics players provide a microcosm of the $1.5
billion gene-research industry that is widely expected to change
the way drugs get developed.
</P>
<P>
   INCYTE
</P>
<P>
   Genomics wasn't even a common term, much less an industry, back
in 1991 when Roy Whitfield and Randy Scott founded Incyte. During
the 1990s, Incyte helped pioneer modern gene discovery techniques,
which rely on sophisticated instruments to extract DNA from cells
and then figure out how DNA's chemical code makes the body work.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Incyte has amassed information about thousands of
specific genes that seem to be involved in cancer, heart disease
and other medical conditions. It has already received patents on
hundreds of genes or gene fragments, and has thousands more
applications pending before the patent office.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of the world's 20 largest drug companies pay Incyte
millions of dollars annually to mine this huge repository of
proprietary gene data for hints about how they can fashion new
drugs that might switch bad genes off or turn good genes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first espoused the principle of selling a database of
information in the biological field, people called us nuts,'' said
Incyte chief executive Whitfield, who presides over a company with
1,300 employees and projected revenues of more than $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech world was wedded to the notion that the only way
you made money was by putting drugs into clinical trials, or doing
the early discovery and licensing them off,'' said Whitfield, who
likens early-stage drug development to ``putting money in the slot
machines at Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whitfield has plunked plenty of quarters into his
drug-discovery factory in Palo Alto, where the machines run
round-the-clock, threshing DNA samples for potential gene patents.
Incyte, which was profitable in 1997 and 1998, has been losing
money ever since it made huge investments in gene-discovery
equipment to build its database of patented genes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Oakland, Incyte faces competition in this
data-for-sale business from an upstart that hasn't spent a penny of
its own on gene discovery.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLETWIST
</P>
<P>
   Privately held DoubleTwist is a reincarnation of Pangea Systems,
which was founded in the early 1990s to write software to analyze
biological data. Pangea sputtered along on venture capital _ the
record shows at least two cash infusions totaling $25 million by
1999 _ until earlier this year when new chief executive John Couch
pulled off a remarkable transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Couch focused the company's software tools on the biggest set of
free genetic data on the planet _ the information being generated
by the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, this government-funded effort has been posting
genetic data on the Internet. But this raw data, though free, is
not easy to sift through. Nor is this data cross-linked with other
sources that might be useful to drug researchers _ such as patent
libraries showing whether a gene of interest is controlled by a
rival.
</P>
<P>
   In this genetic babel, Couch saw an opportunity to become the
Yahoo of the genome, creating an Internet portal that didn't need
to create any new gene discoveries. Rather, his goal was to polish
the free data to make it more useable, and then to license and
resell proprietary data provided by niche companies that could
never hope to match Incyte alone.
</P>
<P>
   With this vision in mind _ and an additional $45 million in
investment capital _ Couch rechristened the company as DoubleTwist
earlier this year. Unlike Yahoo, however, DoubleTwist appeals to
such a narrow audience of people in lab coats that advertising
support is minimal. Therefore DoubleTwist hopes to make money by
selling annual subscriptions, ranging from $5,000 to $5 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 15,000 registered users already,'' said Couch, who
declined to say how many were paying and how many were freebies.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Bay in Palo Alto, Incyte's Whitfield views tiny
DoubleTwist _ it has a staff of about 170 _ with disdain. ``They're
competing on the basis of tools to view and manipulate the data,''
he said. ``They have no content of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist argues that its growing network of data sources will
ultimately pull together a more-useful array of information than
Incyte's gene discovery factory can produce on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can be the best at everything,'' said Rob Williamson,
DoubleTwist's second in command. ``We're going to aggregate the
best-of-breed (genomic data sources) from across the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   NEOMORPHIC
</P>
<P>
   While Incyte and DoubleTwist vie to be a one-stop-shop for
genetic data, Berkeley's Neomorphic Inc. is trying to evolve from
the software world into an early-stage drug-discovery company.
</P>
<P>
   Neomorphic was founded in 1997 by three University of California
graduate students who had written software to analyze fruit fly
genes. It turned out that drugmakers like SmithKline Beecham and
Novartis were willing to pay up to $500,000 for their programs,
which analyzed human genes as well as those of fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   With orders in hand, the three students _ Cyrus Harmon and Gregg
Helt of UC Berkeley and David Kulp of UC Santa Cruz _ bootstrapped
Neomorphic. After running their 40-person private firm in the
black, and without venture capital, they decided this year to use
their own software to mine gene data for clues about creating new
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (software development) was a great business, but it's a
small business,'' said Harmon, Neomorphic's chief executive. ``The
real money comes from creating drugs and diagnostic tests.''
</P>
<P>
   To fund its drug discovery dreams, Neomorphic got $2.5 million
in outside financing earlier this year, and plans to seek an
additional $15 million or so. The money will help move the company
out of its proletarian warehouse offices in West Berkeley into the
sort of stainless steel facility they will need to do laboratory
work for early-stage drug discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The young entrepreneurs _ at 33, Helt is the trio's ``old man''
_ say they are helping invent the genetic tools that will change
the way drug discovery is done.
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to a single word: targets. All drugs target some
bodily process. When the drug hits its target it triggers a domino
effect; angina pills, for instance, dilate the arteries, which ease
blood flow, which relieves heart pain.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 100 years, beginning with the discovery of
aspirin in 1899, drug discovery has been a hit-and-miss process
that owed a great deal to serendipity _ some scientist noticing
that a chemical thrown into a batch of sick cells seemed to do some
good.
</P>
<P>
   And during that same 100 years, according to Bert Spilker, vice
president for science at the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturer's Association in Washington, D.C., all of
pharmaceutical research has discovered about 500 targets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the human genome data coming into focus, drug
discoverers have, for the first time, bits and pieces of the master
blueprint for how the body works. That blueprint, said Spilker,
probably contains 10,000 new drug targets _ a twentyfold increase
over all the targets identified since aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why there's this excitement about genomics,'' Spilker
said. ``With all these new targets, drug researchers are bound to
discover new drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Neomorphic view, therefore, it doesn't matter that it's a
company of fresh-faced kids _ because gene analysis is such a new
field that most drug and biotech firms don't have the expertise to
simply buy data from DoubleTwist or Incyte, and find those 10,000
putative drug targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will partner exclusively with drug companies to do their
target research,'' said Neomorphic's Harmon, who envisions signing
a series of multimillion-dollar collaborations with drugmakers.
</P>
<P>
   HYSEQ
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the young turks at Neomorphic, across the bay in
Sunnyvale, one of the patriarchs of biotechnology hopes to lead
Hyseq Inc. into the promised land of genomic-based drug
development.
</P>
<P>
   George Rathmann, 72, took over Hyseq earlier this year, in what
could be the last hurrah of a long career that includes being a
founder of biotech giant Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   Hyseq is a curious contender in the genomics game. It was
founded in the early 1990s around a technology that proved useful
in identifying rare genes. Led by patent attorney Lewis Gruber,
Hyseq went public in 1997 and competed with Incyte, Celera, Human
Genome Sciences and Millennium Pharmaceuticals in the race to
discover and patent genes.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, the Hyseq technology, while more
sensitive perhaps at detecting rare genes, wasn't as fast as the
process used by its competitors. As it became obvious that Hyseq
didn't have the critical mass of proprietary data to compete with
the other gene-discovery contestants, Rathmann decided to turn the
company into a drug developer _ figuring Hyseq's technology had
discovered some rare and useful genes the company's swifter rivals
might have missed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rathmann faces a series of tough tasks. Hyseq has filed
thousands of patent applications, but so far none has been granted.
From among that pile of potential discoveries he must pick a
handful of gene targets and start lab tests to see if any of them
respond to possible drugs. Since such experiments are costly, he
must persuade a drug company to help him co-develop these
compounds. And in his spare time he must go back to Wall Street for
money because Hyseq needs more cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to undergo a metamorphosis,'' says Rathmann, with the
calm assurance of one who has been there and done that.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who want to bet on any of these pioneers have got to
be ready to accept the risks inherent in doing business at the
frontiers of biotechnology. Ultimately, the main premise of
genomics is probably sound, that new gene knowledge will provide
the maps that point to new drug targets, and the profits that lay
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Neomorphic's Harmon, is that no one can really
say for sure which of the various genomics companies will hit pay
dirt in the next two or three years _ the time horizon of many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you look back 20 years from now, you know the change
will be historic,'' he said.

<P>
   The beautification of  &UR; Alexander Hamilton &LR; , as he appears on the
new $10 bill, is grist for the mill of Allure, a magazine that
focuses on the looks of people.
</P>
<P>
   Engraver  &UR; Kenneth Kipperman  &LR; of the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing was responsible for the new face, which he told the
magazine is ``99 and nine-tenths'' true to a portrait of Hamilton
that he used for reference. That other tenth:
</P>
<P>
   ``I did take some artistic liberties,'' he said, including a
chin reduction. ``I didn't want it to look like  &UR; Jay Leno &LR; 's.''
Kipperman also did a minor makeover on Hamilton's hair, which in
the portrait ``reminded me of ice cream and the Lollipop Guild kids
from `The Wizard of Oz.' I knew if I interpreted it the way I saw
it, it would be too comical.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Meanwhile, thanks to all the little guys who go that extra
mile to help out women in need. ``Soon it won't be necessary to
wait for the results of an allergy test to get collagen
injections,'' Allure reports. ``By early next year, the McGhan
Medical Corp. is expected to apply for FDA approval to market
collagen that's been produced from an unusual human source: the
donated foreskin tissue of a healthy newborn.''

RESIDENTS OF TEXAS COASTAL TOWN WORK TO COUNTER BIGOTED IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas _ The once quiet, rural towns that line Texas 6
from Sugar Land to Galveston are now swollen with suburban
commuters who have brought social and cultural change to this Gulf
Coast region.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, the changes have been profound. The community is no
longer virtually all Anglo, all Protestant, or all alone.
</P>
<P>
   The town of 10,000 residents, nestled southeast of Houston and
close to Galveston, was recently at the center of a U.S. Supreme
Court case banning official prayers at high school football games.
In the 1970s, Santa Fe was the site of a Ku Klux Klan rally that
some residents say still tarnishes the town.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the school district is facing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit
filed by a Jewish family who says that, two years ago, their son
was the target of anti-Semitic slurs.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who was 11 at the time, was circled by other students
who shouted, ``Hitler missed one,'' ``No more Jews,'' and ``Heil
Hitler,'' according to the suit filed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   It also says that students drew a swastika on the boy's books
and called him a ``dirty Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has moved, but the publicity from the lawsuit was
rapid and widespread, and the city quickly reacted by hoisting two
large billboards along Texas 6 that proclaim Santa Fe a place
unsuited for hate. A place where biases will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   But many residents say that hatred was never an issue here. It
was simple ignorance, they say. Ignorance of other cultures, other
religions and other races.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe, incorporated in 1978, was always an overwhelmingly
Anglo town, a Protestant town, they say, and when change came, the
attitudes remained unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (southern suburbs) are the areas that are undergoing
rather rapid cultural and social change, and that change
understandably can generate that feeling of `let's hold on to what
we've always had,''' said William Martin, a sociologist and
professor of religion and public policy at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cardella, who owns a car lot directly beneath one of the
town's new billboards, said that Santa Fe is still a provincial
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tight community,'' Cardella said. ``People don't
like change here. They look at the crime rate _ and there isn't one
_ and they worry things will change. I'm sure there is some racism
here, but I don't think there is any more here than anywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe doesn't look different from other towns along the
highway. It is flat and hot and marked with endless strip shopping
centers. There are franchised fast-food restaurants, but local
cafes still draw the pickups and cattle trailers.
</P>
<P>
   The largest building is the new high school on the north end of
town, along the four-lane highway.
</P>
<P>
   Down at Tibaldo's Feed and Supply on Texas 6, Daryn Hinze said
that Santa Fe's demographics are changing but that some of the old
sentiments still linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up here, it wasn't anything but rice fields and
cow pastures,'' the 25-year-old said. ``Everybody knew everyone
else and knew their families. There weren't any minorities going to
the high school when I was there, and I think there probably aren't
more than two or three now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the school district's approximately 4,360 students in the
1998-99 school year, about 89 percent were Anglo and 10 percent
were Hispanic, according to the Texas Education Agency. Those
demographics were almost unchanged from four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hinze laments that Santa Fe isn't the rural community it used to
be, the kind of town that prides itself on the county fair or
ribbons won at the livestock shows. But he understands the changes
that have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot more new neighborhoods around town now,'' he
said. ``We have a lot of commuters living here, and they didn't
grow up like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a good deal of misunderstanding in the community, he
said. Today's students aren't being taught how to deal with people
of different cultures and races, but there isn't any real hatred,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all this publicity _ the sign and everything _ has to
do with our reputation. People talk about the KKK here, and they
hear about the lawsuit and put the two together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have that earlier reputation, this deal with the
Jewish boy would just be considered an isolated incident,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Cominsky, regional director for the Anti-Defamation
League, tends to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Santa Fe is a hotbed of anti-Semitism,'' he said.
``I think the town and the school district were simply
underprepared for their changing demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   Cominsky and the league came to the city with the idea for the
new billboards. Cominsky said that he met with city, school and
Chamber of Commerce officials and that they all agreed that Santa
Fe needed to send a message.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to work together to promote diversity and to change
the town's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the 1970s, there were problems all along the Gulf
Coast area concerning the Vietnamese fishermen,'' Cominsky
recalled. ``And reputedly there was a meeting of the KKK here in
Santa Fe. But only a few people showed up, and none of the people
who came were from Santa Fe. But it gave the perception that the
community was hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cominsky also said that, according to popular folklore, a sign
once stood at the town's city limits warning African-Americans that
they couldn't stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one actually remembers seeing that sign. There are no
pictures of that sign. There is no record of it ever being there.
It is only a perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we wanted to do these billboards. It is not a
perception that the town doesn't want hatred here. It is a reality.
The signs exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Cominsky said the Santa Fe Police Department, the school
district and the city government have all agreed to increase
diversity training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Christian community,'' he said. ``There is not an
ingrained hatred here. We, the ADL, have a strong relationship with
a community that could have said, `Go away,' and they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the groundwork has been laid, and I would give the
town a pretty positive view.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice University's Martin said he also doubts that Santa Fe is a
town filled with anger or hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect a large number of people there are deeply
embarrassed and personally troubled about the anti-Semitic
incident. And I think it could bring about efforts to educate
children better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, while growing up, he often heard people say things
like, ``Jewing people down.'' Most of them didn't realize ``Jew''
was a noun instead of a verb.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were thoughtless, but not really anti-Semitic. But they
were reflecting an anti-Semitic ethos somewhere in their
background. They have to be taught not to do that. They're trying
in Santa Fe.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was built through the
area in 1877, but the community of Santa Fe grew slowly. It was not
incorporated until January 1978. By the 1980s, it had absorbed the
towns of Arcadia and Alta Loma. The 1990 census reported a
population of 8,429, of whom more than 90 percent were Anglo and 8
percent Hispanic. 2000 Census data are being compiled.

CHENEY SLIPS ON OIL CRITICIZING NATIONAL MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (In 10thgraf, corrects number and acreage of abolished
monuments.)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has written about public lands issues
for over a decade and is respected for his insight into these
issues. His e-mail address is levendos(at)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney
threw down the gauntlet, challenging the national monuments created
by President Clinton. It was a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney knows as much about national monuments as his
presidential running mate, George W. Bush, knows about foreign
policy. Cheney has spent too many years in board rooms in the
company of oil executives in Texas to speak knowledgeably about
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the assertion that if Bush and he were elected, Bush
might make the decision to rescind the national monument status of
the monuments Clinton has created.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush were president, he could not rescind a national
monument status. No president can. Only Congress has that
authority.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of the Interior's top legal counsel,
Solicitor John Leshy, ``The attorney general of the United States
issued an opinion in 1938 that said the president could not undo a
national monument, could not undo it in the sense of completely
repealing it. And no president has ever done that. Presidents have
made boundary adjustments, both enlarging and diminishing the size.
That's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the reasoning was pretty simple; it just said the
Antiquities Act authorizes the president to proclaim monuments but
not to unproclaim them. Only Congress, according to that view, can
`unproclaim' or outright repeal a national monument altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   And Congress doesn't unproclaim national monuments very often.
Practically, it's politically impossible to do so. The American
people want wilderness preserved and protected.
</P>
<P>
   In general, national monument status prohibits any new mineral
exploration, drilling for gas and oil, or mining. Under the new
policy of landscape monuments, the areas are left pristine and
protected from development, as the people want them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furor among some members of the Utah congressional
delegation and other Western congressmen when Clinton created the
Escalante-Staircase National Monument in 1996, there has not been a
successful move in Congress to abolish that monument.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the record: Approximately 64 million acres have been set
aside as 110 national monuments since the Antiquities Act was
passed in 1906. Congress has only abolished 10 national monuments _
comprising about 13,000 acres in total. One of the abolished
monuments was later redesignated as a monument under a different
name.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was mistaken in another criticism of the process of
creating national monuments during the Clinton administration. He
asserted that these proclamations are announced ``willy-nilly all
over the West'' without considering the desires of the people who
will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Cheney bashed the administration's monument
designations, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, in an Aug.
23 interview, repeated what he had said many times before, ``We
have a `no-surprise' policy when it comes to recommending national
monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   A no-surprise policy makes good political sense. Babbitt has
traveled from Western state to Western state repeatedly in order to
gauge residents' interest in having a particular locale set aside
as a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   The records show that Babbitt has met with congressional
delegations, with governors and state legislators, with mayors and
local stakeholders and any others who might have some say in the
matter. There have been public hearings in each state where a new
monument was nominated and then created. Discussions about possible
national monument status has been front-page news in the states
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has even suggested to congressional delegations that
they take the lead in creating greater protection for unique public
landscapes in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Claims that national monument status has been forced down a
state's throat have no factual basis. It would be political suicide
to take such a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, 80 percent of the population supports the
designation of Aqua Fria National Monument outside of Phoenix. In
other Western states, polls indicate the support for their new
monuments hovers at 75 percent. Nationally, the American people
have shown unwavering support for the new monuments.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, Babbitt sent the president a recommendation that
proposes the creation of the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in
northern Arizona. The Vermilion Cliffs proposal covers 293,000
acres of federal land and includes the Paria Plateau. It would
continue to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Babbitt recommended that Clinton expand the current
Craters of the Moon National Monument in central Idaho. The
original 54,440-acre monument was created by President Calvin
Coolidge in 1924. Babbitt proposes that it be expanded by 661,000
acres in order to include craters, cones, lava flows, caves and
fissures along a rift that is 65 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the end of it. Babbitt will make other
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   About other monument proposals, Babbitt said, ``We have a list
of areas that have been publicly discussed, where I have been out
on the ground and engaged all of the stakeholders: Steens Mountain
(Oregon), the Carrizo Plain in California, the Santa Rosa Mountains
in California, the Missouri Breaks (Montana), the Black Ridge area
in Colorado, the San Rafael in Utah. These areas are in the
congressional phase right now. At this point, these are all areas
of possible future recommendations, but they are areas where we
have emphasized our desire to see legislation coming out of the
Congress. With each of these places, we have stuff going in varying
degrees in the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no ``willy-nilly'' monuments, despite Cheney's
assertions. But, by his statements, Cheney has certainly broadcast
where he stands on environmental issues _ on the side of oil.

   &UR; HOW THE TEN GOT SO PRETTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The beautification of  &UR; Alexander Hamilton &LR; , as he appears on the
new $10 bill, is grist for the mill of Allure, a magazine that
focuses on the looks of people.
</P>
<P>
   Engraver  &UR; Kenneth Kipperman  &LR; of the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing was responsible for the new face, which he told the
magazine is ``99 and nine-tenths'' true to a portrait of Hamilton
that he used for reference. That other tenth:
</P>
<P>
   ``I did take some artistic liberties,'' he said, including a
chin reduction. ``I didn't want it to look like  &UR; Jay Leno &LR; 's.''
Kipperman also did a minor makeover on Hamilton's hair, which in
the portrait ``reminded me of ice cream and the Lollipop Guild kids
from `The Wizard of Oz.' I knew if I interpreted it the way I saw
it, it would be too comical.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Meanwhile, thanks to all the little guys who go that extra
mile to help out women in need. ``Soon it won't be necessary to
wait for the results of an allergy test to get collagen
injections,'' Allure reports. ``By early next year, the McGhan
Medical Corp. is expected to apply for FDA approval to market
collagen that's been produced from an unusual human source: the
donated foreskin tissue of a healthy newborn.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Honor roll: The Port Authority of New York will place a
larger-than-life statue of  &UR; Jackie Gleason &LR; , who played a bus
driver in ``The Honeymooners,'' in front of its bus terminal in
Manhattan. The work, commissioned by TV Land, a cable channel that
shows the series, shows Gleason in a bus driver's uniform, holding
a lunch box. Furthermore, the city of Gdansk, Poland, has made
 &UR; Margaret Thatcher &LR;  and  &UR; Ronald Reagan &LR;  honorary citizens for their
``historical role in dismantling the Iron Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   -In Leipers Fork, Tenn.,  &UR; Wynonna Judd &LR;  had a garage sale over
the weekend, unloading costumes, shoes, books, furniture, Christmas
decorations, household appliances and memorabilia. ``She knows a
lot of neighbors might want some of the stuff,'' said her
spokeswoman,  &UR; Kerry Hansen &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - O.J. Simpson &LR; 's children started school last week in Coral
Gables, near Miami. The assistant director of the Gulliver Schools,
where they are enrolled, told the Miami Herald that school
officials do not know where the children live, as they use a
friend's address for mail and will be driven to school by another
friend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - John McEnroe  &LR; tells the New Yorker this week that ``any good
male college player'' could beat either  &UR; Venus &LR;  or  &UR; Serena &LR;

   - Perusing a Cyber Youth Ministry chat room,  &UR; Marc Krizack &LR;  got
a history lesson from a correspondent describing the earth ``in the
beginning,'' when ``God created the heaven and the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time while billions of years could have passed,''
said the chatter, ``when scientists and evolutionists theorize the
Ice Age, Smithsonian, Jurassic era, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   - IBM measured the Q-rating _ a test of public popularity _ of
its chess-playing Big Blue supercomputer, and found it equal to
that of  &UR; Carmen Electra &LR;  and the Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   - Women in search of dewier legs might like Hanes' new opaque
tights impregnated with moisturizing beads, which Self magazine
says will last through five washings. The number of women fretting
about dry legs isn't great, but the new stockings will meet the
needs of bank robbers with chapped lips.

Sonora and forwarded to Personals by &UR; Rob Irwin &LR;  describes the
plight of a resident who reported that her garbage can had been
stolen. ``The can was returned but half her garbage is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   And what was that motorcycle cop from the ``Twin Cities'' of
Corte Madera and Larkspur doing taking his official vehicle to
lunch with a pack of biker friends in a Guerneville bar last
Sunday? The spy who saw him says it's true that he could have been
on a legitimate lunch break, but he definitely broke the law by
making a U-turn to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are very cynical with actors trying to tell
them what to believe in, or lobbying for any kind of changing of
government policy. ... There's just something annoying about having
Charlie Sheen tell me, `It's your responsibility to vote,' in an
admonishing way on MTV.''

CALIFORNIA DEREGULATION WOES MAY COME TO TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By R.A. DYER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In sun-drenched San Diego _ the first American
city to feel the full wallop of electric deregulation _ light bills
climbed so high that even school districts won't pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Should Texans, whose state lawmakers passed a deregulation law,
be concerned? Does calamity in California foreshadow tough times in
Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Under deregulation, the state government relinquishes much of
its control over the power system to the free market. Experts are
divided on the effect, but some say that hardship is a real
possibility. At the very least, consumer advocates predict that
Texans should prepare themselves for a bumpy ride.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas, co-architect of the Texas
deregulation law, was vacationing in San Diego this month when he
read accounts of residents seeing two- and threefold price
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when I picked up the newspaper,'' said Wolens,
who recalled telling himself: ```Holy smokes! I hope that this
won't happen to us.'''
</P>
<P>
   On reflection, Wolens says he's convinced that a deregulated
Texas will learn from California's costly missteps.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, administrators with the city's 141,000-student
school district were stunned by a nearly 200-percent increase. They
joined a growing boycott of San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric and paid this
month's bill at last year's rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses responded by increasing prices, reducing
operating hours, or both. The elderly, the poor and anyone else who
pays for electricity and lives on a fixed income have felt the
pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My measure for success _ in the medium-term and the long-term
_ is whether customers are paying less under deregulation,'' said
Richard Rosen, executive vice president of the Tellus Institute, a
Boston-based, nonprofit research organization that advises
government utility commissions and consumer advocates. ``I
personally predict failure. I see problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolens ushered his bill through the Texas House with Republican
lawmakers, supported by an unlikely coalition of environmentalists,
utility representatives and union leaders. With the very notable
exception of major consumer organizations, a wide range of groups
supported the law.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Wolens' success was much like that of his
California counterpart, state Sen. Steve Peace, who pushed through
deregulation without a single no vote.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Peace, witnessing the unfolding chaos in San Diego and
the prospect of rolling blackouts elsewhere, called upon California
Gov. Gray Davis to intervene. He also urged utility customers to
withhold payments for a month. It had become that bad.
</P>
<P>
   Wolens ultimately concluded that the California problems could
not happen in Texas. Like state Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, who
co-authored the bill, and Public Utility Commission Chairman Pat
Wood III, Wolens argues that the Texas law is different.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged California's grief but said it stems from
defective legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``California rushed their law so much,'' Wolens said. ``Before
we passed our bills, we went to California ... and we all got back
persuaded that we would not pass a restructuring bill in Texas. We
thought that we don't want that. California demonstrated what we
didn't want.''
</P>
<P>
   After further study trips to Britain, Pennsylvania and
elsewhere, lawmakers here became convinced that Texas could
successfully deregulate. In theory, market forces would drive down
prices and newly formed retailers would compete for customers.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to Wolens, Sibley, Wood and other
supporters: better deals for consumers, improved service, cheaper
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   A study issued Aug. 1 by the California Public Utilities
Commission pinpointed flaws in that state's newly deregulated power
system.
</P>
<P>
   Power wholesalers, it said, engaged in dysfunctional bidding
behavior. An organization overseeing the state's power grid did not
sufficiently represent the interests of the region's economy or
consumers. And the deregulation law simply gave away too much state
control.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area blackouts, the run-up in prices in the wholesale
electricity markets and the rise in retail electricity prices in
San Diego show that the new system is not working in California,
the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Californians will pay billions more for electricity because of
tight supply and serious market defects, it said. And higher prices
don't necessarily fund expanded generating capacity but may be
pocketed as profits, it warned.
</P>
<P>
   Something like this could happen here, says Janee Briesemeister,
an Austin-based analyst with Consumers Union. She contends that
Texas _ with its rapidly growing economy and sweltering summer heat
_ is not that different from California.
</P>
<P>
   Like Californians, she says, Texas consumers only have minority
representation on the nonprofit panel overseeing the state power
grid. And as with California, she said, the potential for
dysfunctional bidding in the wholesale market remains high.
</P>
<P>
   Like most industries, electric utilities deal with wholesale and
retail markets. Under deregulation, electric retailers would
purchase wholesale electricity from power generators, then send
that energy to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas does not face the energy shortfall now
confronting California, Briesemeister said demand pressures and the
structure of the Texas market can nonetheless lead to dramatically
inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   As an example, she cites the shortage of transmission lines from
Fort Worth-Dallas to other parts of Texas. Unable to bring in
wholesale energy from outside, a Metroplex electric retailer may
have no choice but to buy wholesale power from a major generator,
such as TXU. Under such a scenario, Briesemeister said, limited
transmission lines would lock out potential wholesale suppliers _
and could give one company at least partial monopoly control in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   So what if someone in Laredo is willing to sell you power
cheaper? Briesemeister says. If you can't get the power , it
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Unforeseen outages caused by natural disasters could further
tighten power supplies, thereby eroding competition, Briesemeister
said.
</P>
<P>
   TXU spokesman Christopher K. Schein acknowledged the
anti-competitive effects of transmission and power supply
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of companies, including TXU Electric, have identified
where the new lines need to be built, Schein said. Texas, he said,
is already in the process of permitting and building much of that.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern are new state environmental rules that
require the utility to make steep cuts in power plant emissions,
Schein said. The rules could restrict energy supplies in the
Metroplex, making deregulation more difficult, the utility
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Are there external factors that can change the carefully laid
groundwork? The answer is 'yes,' Schien said.
</P>
<P>
   Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the
University of California, also foresees Texas experiencing many of
his state's problems. His views are based on a few hard and fast
facts about electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of deregulation insist that electricity will be like
any other commodity, with market forces pushing down prices while
weeding out bad competitors. But Borenstein notes differences
between electricity and other commodities.
</P>
<P>
   First off, no economical way to store electricity exists.
Secondly, small shortfalls can have grave consequences, such as
giant blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   So even if one firm has only of the generating capacity, they'll
know the system needs them in the market or the whole grid will
collapse, Borenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, they can charge anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, the regulatory consultant, raises other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, regulators set electric prices that
compensate power producers for expenses, plus some moderate profit.
</P>
<P>
   With the new system, however, market competition sets prices.
This means that even cheaply produced power from, say, old
coal-fired plants, directly benefits from higher market prices even
though its production costs might not rise, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, a temporary rate freeze has protected consumers from
instability in the wholesale market. Under the deregulation law,
residential rates remain frozen until 2002, and then drop by 6
percent for five years or until the major utilities lose 40 percent
of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen notes that other states have created similar default
pricing as part of their deregulation laws _ and in most cases,
those defaults are the only thing between consumers and high bills.
</P>
<P>
   When the default rate was lifted in San Diego, prices went
through the roof. And when it expires in Texas, he said, it could
get so bad that the whole thing blows up.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood, the PUC chairman, said Texas electric consumers have
little reason to fear the future. Much of California's problems, he
says, are simply the result of a shortage of power.
</P>
<P>
   Power plant construction has not kept pace with a vibrant
economy _ no major plant has been built in California in a decade.
So on hot summer days, the Golden State comes perilously close to
blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Electric wholesalers can charge well beyond
production costs and remain confident that their power will sell.
But Wood, speaking in his trademark Port Arthur drawl, said, That
won't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Texas have more reserve generating capacity than
California, but more plants are coming online soon. Likewise, it
takes only two to three years to permit and build a plant in Texas
_ as compared to five to seven in California.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also limits utilities to no more than 20 percent of the
market when competition begins in 2002. This provision _
characterized by Wood as a key difference between Texas and
California law _ should also encourage competition.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas consumers have an escape hatch _ one last legislative
session, which opens in January 2001, before retail electric
competition starts 12 months later.
</P>
<P>
   We've been watching California closely, to make sure we don't
make the same mistakes, Wood said. I know it will work out. And
even if it doesn't, allows for customers to be held harmless and
for the Legislature to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again.

 UNDATED: same thing.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wireless phone industry, meanwhile, operates under its own
system. A wireless subscriber who dials 411 is generally connected
to a directory assistance operator affiliated with his wireless
carrier. Those operators generally use a national database.
</P>
<P>
   But no one disputes that the quality of directory assistance
service varies from provider to provider.
</P>
<P>
   The listings themselves are generally compiled and controlled by
the roughly 1,300 individual local phone companies around the
country. Big carriers like AT&AMP;T and Verizon contract with outside
companies to pull together phone listings from the multitude of
local phone databases around the nation. To save money, other,
smaller companies may sometimes try to compile listings by scanning
phone books, property records or other sources that are less likely
to be up to date and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, big phone companies say that directory assistance
listings are about 95 percent accurate. But if there are, as is
estimated, 3 billion directory assistance calls in a year (the
actual figure may be higher), that adds up to 150 million wrong
numbers annually.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Louis S. Richman is restive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a really annoying aggravation that when you call
for the headquarters number for a major corporation that you get
some branch office delivery dock,'' said Richman, finance editor of
Consumer Reports magazine, in New York. ``Or you call for a major
hospital in a major city and they never heard of it, or a
restaurant that you knew was there a week ago but they can no
longer find it or you get a fax number.''
</P>
<P>
   It may help if callers understand that there are gazetteering
limitations with today's patchwork directory assistance. And the
limitations begin with four words: United States Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone listings are almost always governed by the post office
address of the residence or business listed. Take Brighton, the
town in upstate New York supervised by Frankel. A letter to her
town must be addressed to Rochester; the Postal Service does not
recognize Brighton as an official mailing location. Given this, and
the fact that there is another community in New York known as
Brighton, near Buffalo, it is understandable that a directory
assistance operator in Omaha, Neb., or elsewhere may become a bit
confused.
</P>
<P>
   But the Postal Service rationale carries little weight with
Frankel. ``I would think that the telephone directory services are
something that should be upgraded,'' she said. ``The technology is
there to do it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may depend on which company is wielding the technology.
Although the main local phone company for most of New York state is
Verizon, the local phone company for the Brighton that is near
Rochester, and for Rochester itself, is Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In an unscientific test conducted from phones in Manhattan,
directory assistance operators for AT&AMP;T and Verizon were routinely
able to find numbers in Brighton for the Twelve Corners Apothecary,
the Bagel Bin Cafe and Frankel's two home numbers. In most cases,
though, the operator would note that the listing was in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   And in a second unscientific test, directory assistance calls
placed from Rochester and within Brighton, also succeeded without
exception in finding those same numbers. The volunteer tester,
Jennifer Leonard, president of the Rochester Area Community
Foundation, a charitable group, called various directory assistance
services to obtain the listings for the apothecary and Frankel's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who lives in Brighton, called a Frontier operator from
her office in Rochester, a Frontier operator from a pay phone in
Brighton, an operator affiliated with her local phone company, Time
Warner Communications, and a Verizon operator from her wireless
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the operators were located in Rochester and all of them
had both numbers and had no problem with the location of Brighton,
N.Y.,'' Leonard reported.
</P>
<P>
   Whether directory assistance in Brighton is as truly bad as
Frankel has found it, or as reasonably good as this informal test
might indicate, it is certain that there are many more paths than
there used to be to that tantalizingly helpful operator's greeting,
``What listing?''
</P>
<P>
   With all the variables, it may be that the best hope for a
caller _ besides keeping those keypad fingers crossed _ is to be
very, very precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases you can find the one you're looking for,'' said
Agerton at BellSouth, which handles more than 500 million directory
assistance calls a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what happens a lot of the time,'' Agerton said, ``is
someone calls and says, `I want Bill Smith in Roanoke, Va.' And so
you pull it up and there's Bill Smith, so you put them through. But
then they call back and in fact they wanted William T. Smith on
Lovers' Lane.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Each day I come to work and I try to hide my bullishness.
Sometimes I am simply embarrassed about it. Things just can't be
this good, I say to myself. Other times I simply say, we don't need
to play. We are having a good year, why press the issue?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the end, I come back to the fundamental tenets that a
ton of things are going right, and more could go right.
</P>
<P>
   So let's examine the bull case, by giving it a thorough
going-over, and explaining what makes me think that the opportunity
is up, not down, despite all of the warning signs of complacency
and lack of worry and stress.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST, the game of money management is a simple game. It's all
about beating the averages and making a lot of money. Some very
large funds this year aren't doing either. Note the clock is
ticking. Unless they get a selloff soon, they won't be able to go
into the fourth quarter saying anything good about themselves. This
money-management business has become extremely competitive as
individuals realize that they don't have to stay with the managers
that they picked if they aren't generating any performance.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be more specific. How much longer can Fidelity Contrafund,
for example, a multibillion-dollar fund, stay in the doldrums? (I
own shares in this fund, and I have for a long time.) At what point
do they say ``The heck with it, get me some winners, I have to make
some money here or be in a state of perpetual redemption and
withdrawal''? This giant pool of capital is a prime candidate to
jump into Nortel, Sun Microsystems and Intel in a very big way.
</P>
<P>
   The fund may already have large positions in these stocks. I
only have about $100,000 in the fund so I am not entitled to know
what is in it. But I figure Contra is going to step up in a much
bigger way than it already is in these fiber-optic/fiber-channel
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What makes me think this will happen? Because it happens every
year. Because this is the crummy business we money managers have
chosen. Take last year at this time. Right about now the folks at
Soros realized they had nothing to say for themselves in a year of
otherwise solid performance for the competition. So they loaded the
boat up with the Qualcomms and Veritas' of the world and generated
mucho performance. It was a brilliant move and they won the derby!
They gave themselves super performance.
</P>
<P>
   So, the first rule of money management: when in doubt, buy and
buy like there is no tomorrow, will certainly play a big role in
taking the stock market, particularly the winners, higher.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND, we like the way tech is shaping up for the fourth
quarter. Sure we had that overabundance of handsets in the system,
but that will clear up. And yes, maybe we had too many chips that
were being made for too few handheld devices. But the overall tone
of the personal computer market is healthier than it has been in a
long time and these stocks and their cohort aren't that expensive.
It makes me want to plunge in with both feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Cisco hasn't acted that well. And yes, Microsoft has
melted under federal scrutiny and soft Windows 2000 sales. However,
these stocks are well off their 52-week highs and nothing justifies
further price appreciation than being able to say ``I am buying
this much lower than it has traded before.'' That's a recipe for
higher prices if there ever were one.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD, we have a genuine, damn the torpedoes, full-speed-ahead
cycle happening in aerospace. We tend to forget that aerospace is a
giant part of our economy and when it is in full tilt it pulls up a
lot of players. We like to have a giant cycle that involves huge
Dow stocks like United Tech and General Electric and Boeing. Really
gets the fund managers going.
</P>
<P>
   FOURTH, the Net has settled into a winner-take-all situation,
and the two winners are America Online and Yahoo! When this
AOL/Time Warner deal closes, I believe we are going to see that
stock rip to new highs.
</P>
<P>
   FIFTH, oil, which is up huge, could, shockingly, go down, which
would take away one of the big bear cases out there that has kept a
lot of money on the sidelines. Can you imagine the hand-wringing if
the bears lost this prop? Dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   SIXTH, no more silly Fed watch. Things have cooled enough that
we don't have to sit on the sidelines waiting for the Fed to sound
the all-clear signal, which it never does anyway. That puts us in
the November 1994 portion of the time line where you could buy
financials, tech and cyclicals. Only the drugs and the Cokes of the
world rest during this period. Lots of positive moves coming in the
advance-decline lines!
</P>
<P>
   SEVENTH: Like it or not, neither candidate is bad for the stock
market. The Republicans would like to cast Gore in a light that is
negative for stocks, but I don't think that will have much traction
given how unbelievably positive the Clinton years were for the
market, and Clinton isn't as ``smart'' about the economy as Gore. I
personally don't like what Bush wants to do with taxes, but I know
better than to get into a political debate on this site, so I will
save it for other venues.
</P>
<P>
   EIGHTH: A whole new generation of kick-butt CEOS is coming up,
giving us a new group of stocks to buy. I read that unbelievable
interview with Keith Krach from Ariba this weekend and tell me you
don't want to bet with these guys. You want to bet against Greg
Reyes at Brocade, who had a battle plan ready if anyone ever tried
to pull an Emulex with his company? You may not believe in the
Exodus story, but I do. If you can't beat Ellen Hancock, at least
you can own shares in her company. And while I am at it, isn't this
John Roth from Nortel a serious heavy-hitter?
</P>
<P>
   NINTH: A couple of sleeping giants seem to be awakening. Last
year IBM got taken down by Y2K, as it should have (if anyone should
have seen this one coming from years away, it should have been
IBM). That's now behind them and I think this stock is rocking
here. AT&AMP;T, another stock that I felt betrayed, beaten up and
crushed by, seems to be turning the ship around. Yes, in the 50s
and 40s I saw no case for AT&AMP;T. Even in the 30s. But when this
thing trades back to the low 30s high 20s, it seems like the
essence of cheap. It owns a fantastic wireless division growing at
60 percent _ AT&AMP;T Wireless. It has assembled a massive cable
network, which could come on strong now that DSL seems to be
faltering again courtesy of labor problems in the East and who
knows what in the West. Its business unit may not have done that
well lately, but that can be turned around by management, as I
don't know anyone who is angry at AT&AMP;T or thinks it is a crummy
company. Sure, consumer is a drag, but if it can be contained
without spending a lot of money, what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of John Malone being angry or upset with
AT&AMP;T's management, but I think that is a pile of hogwash, just a
bunch of reporters trying to get a story going. I think Malone's in
there making some solid suggestions that will get traction with
stockholders eventually. In the meantime, when the Germans are
willing to pay $50 billion for some network nobody has ever heard
of, what is AT&AMP;T worth? Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   TENTH, and finally, the banks and the brokers. This group is
hot, hot, hot. And it is never a false tell. One thing I do a lot
of work on is group leadership. While there is always plenty of
splash behind technology leadership, the bulk of securities out
there trade off the financials, not off of Intel or Cisco. There
are literally thousands of financially related stocks out there
that really color the advance-decline line. When these stocks go
up, they create a healthy hue that forces bears to capitulate.
That's what is happening now.
</P>
<P>
   So, there's your list of why I expect the markets to rally here.
I am sure that there will be potholes along the way _ potholes that
will be well covered, no, make that overcovered, by the media. When
we stumble into them, refer to this list. It is more powerful than
any of those ruts in the road.

 &HT;    Disabled could lose life-enhancing services with closing of
Franciscan Rehabilitation Center
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Even though she is paralyzed below her neck and
breathes through a tube, Pat Bodie works for a living. She can type
and dial the telephone through her computer, moving and aiming a
radio signal on her forehead. She can operate her television and
stereo from her wheelchair or bed, flicking a special switch with
the slight movement she can control in one wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do so much more than when I was younger,'' said Bodie,
now 64 and paralyzed from polio since 1954. ``Without the
technology I have, I would not be as independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Access to that technology is in jeopardy with the liquidation of
Franciscan Medical Center, where Bodie was retrofitted for daily
life in the Franciscan Rehabilitation Center's nationally
recognized assistive technology services component. The doctors,
therapists and engineers there have been adapting technology for 10
years to help people get around and communicate when they otherwise
could not.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Franciscan's other marquee departments, rehab is not
landing intact at another hospital. Sports medicine is moving to
Kettering Medical Center. Psychiatry and the family practice clinic
are part of Grandview. Although parts of rehab are splintering off
from Wayne to Middletown, the assistive technology equipment is
being reduced to numbers on a liquidation inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going around putting price tags on stuff _ that's like
selling off the Taj Mahal brick by brick,'' said Dr. David
Mitchell, who directed rehab at Franciscan. ``This program is
priceless with all the pieces together. It's worthless brick by
brick. It's worthless without the therapists and engineers. The
community's losing a treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other comparable programs in Ohio are in Cincinnati and
Cleveland, and, as Bodie said, ``I can't just jump in a car and go
somewhere.'' She doesn't know what she'll do when her equipment
needs to be repaired or upgraded. But at least she has what she
has.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people who really need these things won't be able to
get them,'' she said. Even if they can travel elsewhere, rehab
engineer Heather Bridgeman said Franciscan treated a lot of
Medicaid patients and the unemployably injured who don't qualify
for funding through Ohio Rehabilitation Services Commission's
Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exceptional rehab program, something the community
will desperately miss,'' said executive director Joseph Baldasare
of United Rehabilitation Services of Greater Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   URS accepts Medicaid, offers augmentative communication
technology and plans to hire some more therapists, but it lacks
Franciscan's size and scope. Goodwill Industries of the Miami
Valley is ``very interested'' in assuming the whole assistive
technology program, president Amy Luttrell said, but is waiting for
information from Franciscan about accounting and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the therapists familiar with it are scattering to new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The sad irony is, there have never been so many technological
solutions available for overcoming disabilities, said Pat
Cashdollar, the program director and co-founder of the Technology
Resource Center, a nonprofit organization that procures such
equipment, especially for enabling vocal or visual communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for the most part it's affordable. But to find a place to
help you get the right solution for you, and to show you how it's
being done, that's hard to find. Franciscan had the team for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;  With multiple sclerosis, Ann Hitchcock has a lot of
doctors. ``It was so nice to have them all in one place,'' she
said. She'll follow one of them to Kettering, but the one going to
Sidney is too far from her Dayton home.
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of Franciscan patients, Baldasare said,
switching doctors and therapists will be the hardest part. That's
especially true of MS patients, Hitchcock said. They go through
life knowing they could wake up paralyzed tomorrow, so emotional
support is as important as good medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people know you after awhile,'' Hitchcock said. ``They can
see if something's bothering you today. You trust them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cared about their patients at Franciscan in a way that I
have never seen. And I'm ex-military, so I've been to a lot of
hospitals in my life. Other hospitals just won't be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the staff will follow the physicians _ Dr. David Johnson
is directing rehab at Wayne Hospital, Dr. David Seymour at
Middletown Regional Hospital, Dr. Richard Beers at Kettering, where
a new inpatient rehab center will open this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Valley Hospital has the area's only inpatient rehab center
until then. ``They're doing it just fine,'' said Mitchell, who will
practice in the Kettering, Centerville and Englewood offices in
addition to Middletown and Wayne. Miami Valley also had programs
already that were similar to Franciscan's for hand and spinal cord
injuries and for teaching disabled people to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Muscular Dystrophy Association expects to find a home for
Franciscan's MD clinic next month. The amputee clinic has moved to
Middletown. The clinic for custom-designing wheelchairs and
Franciscan's driving program are in flux, part of the assistive
technology program that is looking for a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no money in assistive technology services,''
Cashdollar said, ``so you have to package it with something that
can make more money.'' With that in mind, Mitchell was encouraged
to hear of interest from Miami Valley as well as Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Franciscan had about 12 inpatients and 150 outpatients for rehab
at any given time in the last year, including 15 in the technology
program, according to hospital figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sit in awe of the expertise in that unit,'' said Dr.
Mark Clasen, a Franciscan tenant as chairman of family medicine in
Wright State University's School of Medicine. ``They worked with
people with such extreme disabilities and got them doing things
where they could get on with their life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;  Bodie does her publicity writing and newsletter
editing one letter at a time. She points the gizmo on her forehead
at a keyboard on her computer screen, selects a letter with a flick
of her wrist and moves on to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are productive and intelligent beings,'' said Bodie, who
does advocacy work for the disabled from her nursing home in
Springfield. ``We just need to be given a chance to show what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology changes so quickly and makes so many advances,''
Bodie said. ``I can't just go to Best Buy or look in a catalog. I
need someone who's an expert to help me pick things out and train
me on using them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeman, the rehab engineer, will still help people through
ORSC, she said, ``but there's a whole set of clients that won't be
seen because they don't have job potential. Those folks who simply
want to increase their quality of life, they're the ones who will
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of someone who's a quadriplegic in a wheelchair and can
hardly move or speak but could possibly access a computer. What a
huge world the Internet can open up to them! I don't recall ever
turning anyone away at Franciscan. There was always something we
could do, no matter how impaired someone was.''
</P>
<P>
   The applications for rehab technology have grown exponentially
in the first decade after the Cold War, Mitchell said. ``With the
breaking out of peace, they wanted to take technology for killing
people and find out how to use it to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology is useless, he said, unless people compare the
medical problems with engineering discoveries. For example,
engineers had no idea that doctors worried about protecting
brain-damaged patients who might blithely drive a wheelchair onto a
busy street, and doctors had no idea there was technology that
could detect impending collisions and stop the wheelchair. Their
conversations led to a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be that kind of creativity in looking at
things,'' Mitchell said. He helped form the Consortium for Applied
Rehabilitation Technology about 10 years ago so creative people
from various disciplines could brainstorm together. ``But we were
missing the business sense,'' he said, and now Dayton is losing
another corridor that linked technology and rehab medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could use a couple of leaders now who see the bigger
picture,'' Cashdollar said, ``some leaders like Charles Kettering
and John Patterson.''

&HT;     IN TURNABOUT, CALIF. POLICE ARE TOLD TO OBEY THE MIRANDA RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a dramatic about-face, police across the
state are being warned to obey the U.S. Supreme Court's famous
Miranda rule and stop interrogating citizens who invoke their
rights to remain silent or have legal help.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers in California for years were trained to ignore
suspects' Miranda rights and keep grilling them, a tactic called
``questioning outside Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   Although judges eventually criticized the procedure as ``very
troubling,'' ``police misconduct'' and ``slippery and illegal,''
the state Department of Justice continued to tell officers it was
OK.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 26 the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the Miranda
decision in a Virginia case and let stand a California case that
said officers could be personally liable for deliberately trampling
Miranda rights. Since then, the state Justice Department has
reversed itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line now must be: Do not intentionally violate
Miranda,'' it says. ``This is because an intentional violation will
virtually guarantee a civil rights suit against you and your
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Area prosecutors also are cautioning police that deliberate
violations may land them on the wrong side of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when the bailiff announces, `Will the defendants please
rise,' don't look to the suspect that was arrested to stand up,''
said July 13 memo from the San Mateo County district attorney's
office. ``The bailiff is talking to you.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan, a long-time
supporter of Miranda, told police in a July 17 memo: ``Failure to
adhere to this rule may result in the personal civil liability of
the officers involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors say the high court's ruling still lets them use
evidence that police obtained from interrogations in which they
violated Miranda rights, as long as they did not coerce the
suspect. And defense lawyers were not convinced police would honor
Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old habits die hard,'' said Kenneth M. Quigley, a San
Francisco defense lawyer. ``If there's a true change in this
particular area by the Police Department, I'll eat my socks.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of articles in June, The San Francisco Examiner
documented widespread police violations of Miranda that, along with
other improper interrogation tactics, caused costly court hearings,
hindered criminal investigations, helped accused criminals go free,
or produced allegedly false confessions that threatened innocent
people with jail.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people are interrogated each day in California,
typically in isolation and under intense police pressure. While out
of public view, interrogations can profoundly shape the course of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda ruling examined what the
court called the ``inherently compelling'' nature of custodial
interrogation, and became its best-known decision on criminal
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   To counterbalance psychological pressure against suspects and to
protect the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, the
court required police to give the equivalent of what has become
known as the Miranda warning: You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to the presence of an attorney. If you cannot
afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Anything you say
can and will be used against you.
</P>
<P>
   To enforce the rule, the court said that if police violated it,
``no evidence obtained as a result of the confession can be used.''
In later years, the high court narrowed that exclusionary measure.
The court still punished police violations of Miranda by barring
prosecutors from introducing the subsequent confession in court to
prove the suspect's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said police could use the confession _ if it was
not the result of coercion _ to find other evidence and witnesses.
Prosecutors could also use the statement to challenge the
credibility of defendants who took the witness stand and
contradicted their confessions.
</P>
<P>
   The court said in 1975 that it was only ``a speculative
possibility'' that police would breach Miranda to gain such
advantages. But in training sessions certified by California's
Commission on Peace Officer Standards &AMP; Training, thousands of
officers were told that, as long as they did not threaten or coerce
suspects - they could choose when to honor a suspect's Miranda
rights.

POLITICS OF MUSEUM TOURS REVEALS COMPLEX WORLD OF MONEY, INFLUENCE
AND LUCK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ANDREW MARTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the parlance of master impresario Ed
Sullivan, the acclaimed Russian exhibition ``Stroganoff: The Palace
and Collections of a Russian Noble Family'' is a ``really big
show.'' Its more than 230 precious objects give it scope. Its
stunning tableaux, from Botticelli to Van Dyck, lend it artistic
grandeur. That its riches are being shown together for the first
time outside the palaces of old imperial Russia imparts historical
heft.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the lines of spectators for this stellar collection
will snake around the golden quartet of America's museums: the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery of Art
in Washington, D.C., the Art Institute of Chicago and the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, think again. Of course, the exhibit has drawn impressive
crowds, except that they haven't been in New York, Washington,
Chicago or LA. Instead, they've been at the Portland Art Museum in
Oregon and, currently, at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth.
From Fort Worth, the show heads back to Russia to close its run at
the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Stroganoff'' has been shown in two smaller museums,
leap-frogging the country's premier cultural showcases, suggests a
complex riddle. Why exactly does one museum host an exhibit and
another miss out? Asking why an exhibition ends up where it does
reveals a Gordian knot of little-understood, occasionally
conflicting factors, including relationships between museum
directors, the quality of a museum's permanent collection,
preferences by living artists, and, naturally, money. Invisibly,
these elements team up to determine whether an exhibit appears at a
museum near you.
</P>
<P>
   One important and undeniable factor is, not surprisingly, money.
A prized exhibit can cost a museum from $250,000 to as high as $2
million to $3 million. But while the costs are prohibitive for many
museums to stage major exhibitions, the payoff can be huge for
those that do. One way to measure the dollars-and-cents motivation
for landing a touring show is its financial impact on the
surrounding community. The American Association of Museums reports
that in 1996 when the Portland Art Museum staged its exhibit ``The
Imperial Tombs of China,'' Oregon's economy received a boost of
$92.3 million. That same year, a Cezanne exhibition originating at
the Philadelphia Museum of Art was estimated to inject $86.5
million into greater Philadelphia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Swift and efficient access to a large pool of money is often
needed to secure a museum's inclusion in a prestigious national
tour. When the world-renowned ``Impressionist Masterpieces From the
Barnes Collection: Cezanne to Matisse'' exhibition hit the road in
1994, the fee charged to each host museum added up to between $2
million and $4 million _ too pricey for almost every national
museum except the National Gallery of Art, The Philadelphia Museum
of Art, and the Kimbell, which was able to tap into large financial
resources much faster than other, larger museums.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly common solution to these cost requirements is a
shrewd alignment with culture-minded corporate sponsors, which
allows regional and smaller museums to compete with the country's
biggest and most prestigious. The Boeing Co. has shouldered many of
the local expenses for numerous Seattle Art Museum exhibits. And
next spring, The Saint Louis Art Museum will be the only American
venue hosting ``Vincent Van Gogh and the Painters of the Petit
Boulevard,'' thanks largely to a $1 million corporate-support
package from the Kemper Foundation, Commerce Bank and the Baer
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When museums in New York or Los Angeles know we are able to
command $1 million in sponsorship, that is big news indicating that
cost isn't going to be an issue for us,'' says Brent Benjamin,
director of the St. Louis museum.
</P>
<P>
   Not that money is always the determining factor. Never
underestimate the simple matter of geography when it comes to
influencing where an exhibit is shown. Exhibitions of consequence
tend to visit three museums, usually one located on each coast,
with one in the country's middle.
</P>
<P>
   When a region is omitted from a national tour, it is likely to
be the Midwest, the South or Southwest. Currently, the National
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., is working with the Louvre in
Paris to stage a retrospective of Jean Antoine Houdon, the late
18th-century French sculptor. The 80-piece exhibition will make
only two key-geographic stops: the National Gallery and the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the limited venues are purely practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that it was only responsible, in light of the rigors
of shipping and packing the works and the lenders' sacrifices, that
three venues would be enough,'' says Dodge Thompson, chief of
exhibitions at the National Gallery, who also indicates that if a
museum tour involves a relatively obscure artist and must limit
itself to a bare-bones number of stops, it will likely concentrate
on the large population areas of the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   But for shows with a chest-beating populist appeal, the quest
for geographic diversity carries exhibits to a wide variety of
venues. When the current tour of the Norman Rockwell collection was
initially planned, for example, both the Norman Rockwell Museum at
Stockbridge (in Massachusetts), and the High Museum of Art in
Atlanta decided that such venues as Chicago, Washington, Phoenix,
San Diego and New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum should be
part of its itinerary.

<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain's unfortunate return bout with melanoma should serve
as a wake-up call for the millions of Americans _ especially young
Americans _ who still worship the sun, skimp on sunscreen and bare
their skin to UV radiation to just within the limits of decency.
</P>
<P>
   It should also remind everyone of the importance of
self-vigilance. Since no one knows your skin and its many markings
better than you, you have primary responsibility for checking often
for any changes that could herald skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer, with the
capacity to spread and ultimately kill. It can recur years after
treatment of a first melanoma, and, as seems to have happened to
McCain, new melanomas can develop at any time after an original
melanoma is seemingly cured.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the United States, the incidence of melanoma is rising at
an exponential rate: 4 percent a year for 20 years, accompanied by
an increase of nearly 2 percent a year in melanoma deaths. One
person in 74 can now expect to develop melanoma at some point, up
from one in 1,500 in 1935 and one in 250 two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year, doctors are expected to diagnosis invasive malignant
melanoma in 47,700 people and melanoma still in an early
noninvasive stage in up to 40,000 people. Melanoma will kill an
estimated 7,700 people in this country this year, many of them in
the prime of life.
</P>
<P>
   You see, melanoma is a cancer that afflicts the young and old. A
quarter of new cases now occur in people younger than 40, and half
of all cases occur in people younger than 54.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the leading cancer in women in their late 20s and
second only to breast cancer among women in their early 30s. In
terms of years of life lost to cancer, melanoma ranks second only
to adult leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Have I scared you into action? I hope so. Let's start with what
we know about preventing this disease. Melanomas can sometimes
occur on parts of the body like the soles of the feet and palms of
the hands, that are not routinely exposed to the sun. But 95
percent of cases occur on sun-exposed parts of the body, especially
the head and neck, upper back and, particularly in women, the legs.
Back in the days of long skirts, women rarely, if ever, got
melanoma on their legs.
</P>
<P>
   Certain circumstances can render a person especially susceptible
to melanoma. These include having suffered three or more blistering
sunburns before age 20, repeated exposure to UV light in a tanning
salon, having worked three or more summers as a teen-ager at an
outdoor job, having many moles that change in appearance, prior
treatment with psoralen and UV light for psoriasis and a history of
melanoma in a parent or sibling.
</P>
<P>
   Fair-skinned people, especially those with blond or red hair,
blue or green eyes, lots of freckles on the upper back and an
inability to tan, are also at much greater than average risk of
developing melanoma (as well as superficial skin cancers).
</P>
<P>
   People who have had several precancers of the skin (actinic
keratoses) are also at greater than average risk. Having three or
more of the above factors raises a person's risk of developing
melanoma 30-fold.
</P>
<P>
   Bursts of sun exposure seem to be more of a problem than
continuous sun. People with outdoor jobs are less likely to develop
melanoma than indoor workers who experience intense sun exposure on
their days off.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard a report that sunscreens do not protect
against melanoma. That is not entirely true. In Australia and
Hawaii, where three-quarters or more of the people now regularly
use sunscreen, the melanoma rate has begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   But until two years ago, most sunscreens contained agents that
reduced the risk of sunburn from ultraviolet-B rays, which allowed
people to stay in the sun and remain exposed to skin-damaging
ultraviolet-A rays far longer than they otherwise might have.
</P>
<P>
   The SPF (sun protection factor) rating of sunscreens refers only
to a product's ability protect against sunburn, and most people
apply too little sunscreen too infrequently to glean anything like
the level of protection stated on the package. Toss out the old
products and replace them with a new sunscreen that offers both
UV-A and UV-B protection; these contain either Parsol 1789 or
micronized zinc or titanium oxide.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, sunscreen is considered a secondary measure to be relied
upon when sun exposure cannot be avoided, for example, while
swimming or playing tennis. Primary protection against sun damage
comes from staying out of the sun, especially at midday and wearing
protective clothing for prolonged exposure.
</P>
<P>
   I have invested in three shirts that have sun-blocking
properties even when wet. They are not cheap _ about $60 or $70
each _ but I consider them an insurance policy. I wear them while
hiking, kayaking and snorkeling. Also available are sun-protective
hats, pants and skirts.
</P>
<P>
   When melanoma is detected and treated in its early stages, the
cure rate approaches 100 percent (although this is no guarantee
that new melanomas won't develop later on). In more advanced
stages, the fatality rate exceeds 70 percent. Regular full-body
examinations for signs of trouble are important for everyone, since
most melanomas occur in people not considered at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Self-examination for suspicious skin lesions starts with
stripping to the buff. Then stand in a well-lighted room in front
of a full-length mirror, using a hand mirror to facilitate views of
your sides, underarms, back and buttocks. Don't forget to check
your scalp, toes and soles of your feet. If you lack a long mirror
or for other reasons cannot do a complete exam on your own, ask for
help from a spouse, significant other or good friend.
</P>
<P>
   What are you looking for? First, any lesion _ pigmented or not _
that seems to have changed in size or shape since your last
self-exam. Hallmarks of an early, curable melanoma follow an
``ABCD'' guideline: A for an asymmetrical appearance, B for an
irregular border, C for color variations of black and light and
dark brown (or even pink, red, white or blue) and D for a diameter
greater than a quarter of an inch. Some experts now add an E for
enlargement, that is, a mole that is growing in height or width.
Look, too, for any change in the surface or texture of a mole and
for changes in sensation, like itching, tenderness or pain.
</P>
<P>
   Self-exams for possible skin cancer should be done monthly, and
at the very least, every three months. If you see your doctor once
a year, have the doctor perform a full-body check as well. Report
any suspicious lesion you find to your physician, preferably to a
dermatologist who specializes in skin cancer. And if your doctor
refers you to a specialist for a more detailed exam or biopsy, act
promptly; delaying treatment can result in a more serious and less
curable cancer, if that is what you have.
</P>
<P>
   You may also consult an excellent book on melanoma and other
skin cancers, ``Saving Your Skin'' by Dr. Barney Kenet and Patricia
Lawler, published in 1994.

 FORT WORTH, Texas: its itinerary. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We are in a rural section of Massachusetts, lacking real
racial and ethnic diversity,'' says Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief
curator of the Rockwell museum. ``One of our goals was to see
future audience development for Rockwell's art, so we were looking
at museums with all kinds of different audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   But geographic proximity can either hinder or help the
likelihood of an exhibit's landing in a certain museum. When Fort
Worth's Amon Carter Museum shops many of its exhibitions around, it
doesn't often look toward the New Orleans Museum of Art, simply
because it is, in relative terms, in Fort Worth's back yard.
However, the Seattle Art Museum would not be averse to circulating
a focused exhibition to a trio of regional museums in Tulsa, Kansas
City and Fort Worth. ``Frankly, sending the show to several museums
so close to each other is a good way to help recoup exhibit
expenses,'' says Gail Joice, senior deputy director of the Seattle
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as decisive as geography in determining which museum is
chosen is an exhibit's theme. The current exhibit at Kansas City's
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, ``The Architecture of Reassurance,''
presents the art behind the Walt Disney theme-park designs. The
350-object exhibit is very timely for Kansas City, which is
celebrating its 150th anniversary, and looking to honor Disney, who
had his first studio in that city.
</P>
<P>
   And when ``Star Wars: The Magic of Myth'' was organized by the
Smithsonian, it seemed only natural that the exhibit stop next
spring in Houston, the home of Mission Control. ``Some art museums
would have been afraid of something like this, thinking it was too
popular, but I saw it as a fabulous application of fine art and
creativity,'' says Peter Marzio, director of the Museum of Fine
Arts, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Along with financial clout and prime geographic real estate, the
quality of works in an institution's permanent collection often
gives it the inside track to being selected as an exhibit site.
Museums with sprawling and high-quality permanent collections have
a leg up on museums with smaller holdings, not only because they
can use more of their art as the core for their own touring shows,
but also because they have greater ability to loan major works to
other museums that are organizing shows.
</P>
<P>
   When several Venetian museums in 1990 organized a Titian
retrospective, for example, the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C., earned a spot on the global tour thanks to the 12
Titians in its permanent collection. And there was only one reason
why the relatively obscure Albright-Knox Art Gallery of Buffalo was
a key participant in the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth's landmark
Arshile Gorky exhibit of 1996. The Buffalo museum happened to hold
one of Gorky's most significant works, and when it contributed the
1944 abstract-expressionist painting to the tour, it was
immediately added to the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   But, for a smaller museum, what the Buffalo museum did ``is
tricky, because when a museum temporarily parts with one of its
most famous and popular works, one has to be very careful about
disappointing loyal visitors,'' says Timothy Potts, director of the
Kimbell. ``Scheduling a tour of two venues means the work of art is
away from home for at least six months, which quickly makes the
tour a sacrifice many lending museums are not willing to make.''
</P>
<P>
   But to a certain degree, every museum lives by this quid-pro-quo
credo. If it rejects the chance to participate in a touring exhibit
through lending one of its works, it is running a risk. The
punishment for rebuffing another museum's request for a work might
be a kind of ostracism that puts the institution out of the running
for upcoming events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implicit in a museum lending out art to a touring show is that
down the line, it will want to have an important piece from the
same borrowing museum when it puts its own future tour together,''
says Stephen Phillips, associate curator of the Phillips Collection
in Washington, D.C. ``Again, this scenario means that museums with
the stronger collections will always hold more playing cards down
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other important considerations. There are,
for example, a selection of museums seen as glowing venues for
touring shows, museums that carry a reputation for mounting
aesthetically pleasing shows with fastidious scholarship.
``Remember that certain artists and owners of great art will
absolutely refuse to show in certain museums because they feel the
buildings are poorly designed,'' says Michael Auping, chief curator
of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Frick Collection has a solid reputation for staging
high-quality shows of works on paper and other drawings. The San
Diego Museum of Art can thank its historic facility for helping it
edge out the city's Museum of Contemporary Art in snaring the
touring Rockwell exhibit. And the Kimbell, thanks to the
architectural splendor of its Louis Kahn-designed home and its
polished curatorial standards, will join the Met in New York as
hosts for one of next year's most anticipated exhibits, ``Treasures
From a Lost Civilization: Ancient Chinese Art From Sichuan,''
organized by the Seattle Art Museum.

 FORT WORTH, Texas: Seattle Art Museum. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which museums have a reputation for best handling of such
fragile exhibitions as ``Lost Civilization'' also helps determine
where a show will land. A recent show of delicate crayon drawings
by Antoine Watteau was limited to just New York's Frick Collection
and the National Gallery of Canada. And when the American
Federation of Arts orchestrated the touring exhibition of German
artist Wolfgang Laib, whose work is made almost entirely of wax and
bee pollen, only museums with near-perfect humidity, lighting, air
conditioning and other environmental controls, could take the show.
</P>
<P>
   With artwork fragility clearly a prime concern, many private
lenders of personally treasured masterpieces aren't shy about
specifying just how long their holdings can circulate on a museum
tour. When the Phillips Collection helped set up a recent exhibit
honoring the work of French painter Honore Daumier, it was
co-organized by the National Gallery of Canada and made only one
U.S. stop _ at the Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other museums would have loved to have had that exhibition,
but it would have been too much to ask a private collector to live
without a major work of art in his or her living room for a year,''
says Phillips, the Phillips Collection curator.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts, contacts, contacts. The behind-the-scenes friendships
between curators and directors also can help steer an exhibit
toward a particular museum. Often, during the twice-annual meetings
of the Association of Art Museum Directors, museum directors will
stage their version of a ``smoke-filled room'' meeting, where
exhibition ideas can germinate into a future tour.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was through a series of meetings between Fort Worth's
Michael Auping and Steven Nash, chief curator at the Fine Arts
Museums of San Francisco, that the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth
could line up the upcoming Wayne Thiebaud show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he told us about it, I remember not flinching for a
moment, saying to him we wanted to be involved and to let us know
when the next slot on the tour would be,'' recalls Auping.
</P>
<P>
   The personal touch similarly helped the Kimbell secure the
Stroganoff exhibition. In early 1999, the Portland Art Museum was
in the advanced stages of curating and organizing ``Stroganoff.''
It was Portland's director, John Buchanan, who had sown the seeds
for the collection's appearance in Oregon. Buchanan devoted four
years to cultivating numerous ties with various curators at the
Hermitage museum, a primary contributor to the final exhibit, and,
most importantly, with Baroness Helene de Ludinghausen, the last
surviving member of the Stroganoff family.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Potts, the Kimbell's director, had already established a
strong rapport with several curators at the Portland museum and
intimated that the museums could collaborate on several shows.
Potts eventually received a set of images and documentation from
the Portland museum that outlined the Stroganoff collection. A
presentation to the Kimbell staff by several Portland curators
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What `Stroganoff' touched in me was that very important recent
development in art history, which is the whole appreciation for the
history of collecting and its impact on, in this case, Russian
style and taste,'' says Potts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the Kimbell was already one of the obvious venues for
this exhibition,'' adds the Portland museum's Buchanan, ``because
it was not only one of the country's highest-caliber museums, but
also because I loved the parity of showing a grand family's private
collection in a museum that had its origins in a private
individual's collection.''
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that when the Norman Rockwell exhibit opens at the
Guggenheim in November 2001, few of those attending the show will
ever realize that, as with most major exhibitions, there were
dozens of micro machinations that transpired over three or four
years to deliver it. Few will remember that three years ago, the
National Museum of American Art published an important monograph on
Rockwell, and few will realize that Robert Rosenblum, curator of
20th-century art at the Guggenheim, reviewed that monograph.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, few will remember that Rosenblum would take that
opportunity to stun the snobbish art world by announcing that he, a
famous proponent of abstract expressionism, was a closet fan of
Rockwell's. Fewer still would know that a flurry of notes was
exchanged between Rosenblum and the Rockwell museum's director
expressing Rosenblum's interest in staging a show at the
Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, he'll get his wish.

SIDE EFFECTS OF A DRUG IN WOMEN SPUR ALERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By DENISE GRADY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing ``rare but serious risks'' from Lotronex, a drug
prescribed for women with irritable bowel syndrome, the Food and
Drug Administration has ordered that a warning pamphlet be attached
to each bottle of pills to alert consumers to early signs of
dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The order on Thursday, the first time that such a pamphlet has
been required for any drug, came about because serious side effects
have been reported in 15 patients since Lotronex was approved in
February. It is used to treat women with chronic diarrhea resulting
from the bowel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   No one died from the side effects, but 10 of 15 patients with
side effects were hospitalized for bowel problems thought to be
caused by the drug. Three needed surgery, including a 56-year-old
woman whose entire colon had to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drug agency released a statement saying that the
benefits of the drug outweighed the risks, a consumer group said
Lotronex should be taken off the market because irritable bowel
syndrome was not life-threatening, whereas the drug's potential
side effects could be. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public
Citizen's Health Research Group, said the group would ask the FDA
to have Lotronex withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Two side effects led to the hospitalizations: Complications from
severe constipation and a condition called ischemic colitis, in
which blood flow to parts of the gut was cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlets are the first to be issued under a regulation that
went into effect last year, allowing the drug agency to order the
creation of ``medication guides'' for certain drugs with
potentially significant risks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Victor Raczkowski, a deputy director in the agency office
that evaluates gastroinestinal drugs, said, ``The medication guide
is a new tool that we have at FDA to communicate in lay language
and educate consumers about the potential risks associated with
drugs and steps they might use to avoid possible serious injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The guides come at a time when the agency has faced harsh
criticism from groups like Public Citizen for having approved drugs
that later had to be withdrawn because of adverse effects. Nine
drugs have been taken off the market since 1997, including two this
year _ Rezulin for diabetes and Propulsid for gastroesophageal
reflux.
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlet warns patients not to start taking Lotronex if they
suffer from constipation, to call their doctors if constipation
occurs when they take the drug, and to stop taking it and call the
doctor if they develop new or worsening abdominal pain or blood in
their bowel movements. Patients are also advised to stop taking the
drug if, after four weeks, it has not helped them. ``At that point,
you'd not be deriving benefit but you would be exposed to some of
the risks,'' Raczkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also ordering labeling changes for the drug and
sending new information to doctors, warning them for the first time
not to prescribe Lotronex for patients with Crohn's disease or
ulcerative or ischemic colitis.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's manufacturer, Glaxo Wellcome Inc., is cooperating
with the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the warnings and directions on the label, once a
drug is approved doctors are free to prescribe it for anyone,
including patients who probably should not take it. At least one of
the 15 patients with severe side effects was male, even though the
drug is not supposed to be prescribed for men because studies show
it does not help them, Raczkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of the population has irritable bowel syndrome,
also referred to as spastic or irritable colon. The condition is
more common in women than in men, and its cause is not known.
Patients suffer from chronic or recurring abdominal pain, diarrhea
or constipation, or both. Severe diarrhea can occur with little or
no warning, and can keep patients homebound and unable to work.
Some even need diapers.
</P>
<P>
   At an FDA meeting in June about the drug, several women who had
taken it testified that it was the first medication that had ever
enabled them to lead more normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lotronex was approved to treat only the diarrheal form of the
syndrome, and only in women. Researchers do not know why the sexes
respond differently to the drug. It acts on nerves in the
gastrointestinal tract to relieve pain and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   But Lotronex does not help all women with the diarrheal type of
disease. In clinical trials, the drug had clear benefit in only 2
out of 10 patients. Four of 10 had no benefit at all, and the
remaining four had improvements that might or might not have been
due to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Although that might sound like a modest benefit, Raczkowski said
he thought that degree of success was ``not very much out of line''
with the results for other drugs approved for a variety of
illnesses. He added that Lotronex was the first drug to be shown
effective specifically for the bowel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Since the drug was approved in February, more than 200,000
prescriptions have been written.

 &HT;    1.5 MILLION HIGH SCHOOL KIDS A YEAR ARE HAZED
 &HT;    520&AMP;add. With HAZING-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 1.5 million high school students are
hazed each year while joining a team, club or group, researchers
from Alfred University reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found distressing was the prevalence _ 48 percent of
all students who join any group in high school are subjected to
hazing'' at some point during their four years, Nadine C. Hoover,
the principal investigator, said at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   About nine out of 10 high school students join groups. While
only 14 percent said they considered themselves as having been
hazed, 48 percent described activities that met the research team's
definition of ``any humiliating or dangerous activity expected of
you to join a group, regardless of your willingness to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said, ``We found that every high school student who joins
any group _ from gangs to church groups, from the football team to
the band _ is at risk of being hazed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the researchers' conclusions were based primarily on
1,541 responses to a survey mailed in April to 18,600 high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, weighted for demographic and geographic factors,
produced statistically reliable results, but it was not large
enough to calculate regional or state-level findings. Follow-up
studies will ``confirm or refute, and further refine these
findings,'' Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that when students joined high school
groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 43 percent of the joiners were involved in the lowest
level of hazing _ humiliation. The must common forms were being
yelled or cursed at, isolated from other people, or being forced to
act as a personal servant to older members, or to undress or tell
dirty stories or jokes.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 24 percent of the joiners were pressured to engage in
substance abuse. That included drinking alcohol, smoking tobacco or
using illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 27 percent mentioned behavior the researchers described
as dangerous. The most common were making prank phone calls or
harassing others, destroying or vandalizing property, or being
ordered to steal, cheat, commit a crime, beat up others or pick a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of being hazed were highest for new members in a
fraternity or sorority, peer group or gang, a sports team or a
cheerleading squad. But in sheer numbers, most of those who were
hazed belonged to a sports team, peer group or gang, a music, art
or theater group, or a church group.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred University commissioned the report as a follow-up to its
national survey on hazing in colleges, which was conducted last
year after a fatal hazing incident on its campus in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the new survey, concern about hazing in high schools
was growing fast enough to convince the American School Board
Journal to include an anti-hazing cover article, ``Brutal Rituals,
Dangerous Rites,'' in its August issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Bushweller, who wrote the article, said, ``What we learned
was that if adults don't pay attention to initiation rites, they
can turn into a kind of 'Lord of the Flies' scenario, where kids
use really bizarre and humiliating and dangerous tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add, which can stand as a sidebar,
follows)
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie Murtie of Essex, Vt., was a 14-year-old who still
collected Beanie Babies and sighed over ``I Love Lucy'' reruns when
her initiation onto the school gymnastics team turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of older girls from the team coerced her and other
rookies into dropping to their knees in a parking lot and
conducting a simulated sexual act in a parking lot with a boy
holding a banana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 14 and I didn't feel like I had the power to stand up
and say this shouldn't be going on,'' said Murtie, who was
interviewed by phone Monday while her mother monitored the call.
</P>
<P>
   Like most hazing victims, she told no one. She stayed on the
team, continued to go to school and tried to forget what had gone
on.
</P>
<P>
   But she had trouble sleeping through the night, talking to
friends, or forcing herself to leave the house for a vacation, a
shopping trip or a visit to her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, after another girl's parent learned of the
incident and reported it, Murtie's parents helped arrange for her
to receive counseling, and she was able to talk about what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Murtie later went public and was prominent in the lobbying
effort that resulted in Vermont's first anti-hazing law, which went
into effect in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reason for the law is that I didn't want what happened to me
to happen to anyone else,'' said Murtie, now 16, who was recently
elected captain of her gymnastics team. Even so, said Murtie, ``I
haven't really talked to other kids about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Linda Murtie, said that some adults ``are like my
husband and me; we never heard of hazing, and are horrified.'' But
others have told her, ``Sure, we've heard of it, but it's no big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big deal,'' said Norman Pollard, director of
counseling at Alfred University, who has counseled hundreds of
teens. ``Kids, lots of them, are getting hurt both physically and
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the high school students who had been hazed and responded
to the university's survey, 27 percent mentioned only negative
feelings, including anger, embarrassment, confusion and guilt.
Another 27 percent mentioned only positive feelings, including
``being part of the group,'' proud, strong or trusted. Another 32
percent said they had both positive and negative feelings, and 13
percent said their main feeling was a desire for revenge.

   PERCEPTIONS: When Your Milkshake Gets Pumped Up
</P>
<P>
   If you want to eat less, add a little air.
</P>
<P>
   A study from Pennsylvania State University published in The
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition examined what happened to
the appetites of men given milkshakes whipped up to varying degrees
of frothiness. The researchers found that those given glasses
filled twice as full ate 12 percent less a half hour later. The
shakes were identical in ingredients and weight _ though not in
taste, according to the participants, who preferred their shakes
stirred, not pumped up.

   CHILDHOOD: Day Care, for Keeping Asthma at Bay
</P>
<P>
   The endless sniffles and ear infections that go along with day
care may have some benefit: children with high rates of exposure to
other children in infancy are less likely to develop asthma later
on, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, published August 24 in The New England Journal of
Medicine, researchers from the University of Arizona College of
Medicine in Tucson looked at the medical records of 1,035 children
who had been monitored since birth as part of a broader long-term
study.
</P>
<P>
   They found that children who were enrolled in day care or who
had older siblings had episodes of wheezing more often as toddlers
than did eldest or only children who were cared for at home,
according to their parents' recollection at age 6.
</P>
<P>
   But yearly surveys of children between 6 and 13 found that fewer
of the exposed children had received asthma diagnoses. And, among
all the children who did develop asthma, those children exposed to
others were reported as having fewer attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is on the increase worldwide, but particularly in more
affluent countries, and many researchers have speculated that the
cleanliness of the modern world has led to less robust immune
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``One theory suggests that infections play an important role in
the maturation of the immune system, causing the immune system to
become less allergic,'' said Dr. Anne Wright, the lead author.
``This study supports the view that infections, or exposure to
other children, protect against the development of asthma and
allergies.''
</P>
<P>
   UPDATE: Promise and Problems of Supplements
</P>
<P>
   A review of clinical trials over the last decade has found
mounting evidence that some herbal medicines can be effective in
treating mild psychiatric symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers who conducted the review cautioned consumers
to be aware that many herbal products did not contain what their
labels stated and urged them to tell their doctors before taking
the substances, particularly if they were taking other medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the September issue of Psychiatric
Services, a journal of the American Psychiatric Association, found
that five of nine well-controlled trials of St. John's wort
suggested that it had some effect on depression (that is, more than
a placebo), and four showed that it was equal to low doses of
conventional antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   DIAGNOSIS: Staying Vigilant for Signs of Autism
</P>
<P>
   All young children should be screened for signs of autism at all
routine visits to the pediatrician, the American Academy of
Neurology recommended last week in a new set of practice
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, published on the academy's Web site,
www.aan.com, cited studies showing that although about a quarter of
the children in the average pediatric practice have some sort of
developmental problem, pediatricians performed developmental
screenings at less than a third of all checkups.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely recognized treatment for autism, behavioral
therapy, has been shown to be more effective the earlier it begins,
the academy said. But ``the diagnosis of autism is often not made
until two or three years after symptoms are noticed, primarily
because of concerns about labeling or misdiagnosing the child,''
the guidelines stated. ``Identifying childen with autism and
initiating intensive, early intervention in the preschool years
results in improved outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy suggested that doctors be attuned to these
milestones in particular: babbling and gesturing by 12 months, use
of single words by 16 months and two-word spontaneous phrases by 24
months, or the loss of any language or social skills at any age.
</P>
<P>
   Children who fail to meet those milestones should have their
hearing checked and be given more specific screening tests for
autism.
</P>
<P>
   AGING: A Healthful Gain When Toto Calls
</P>
<P>
   Doctors whose elderly patients are asking to be discharged early
from the hospital should consider whether a pet has been left at
home, a letter this month in The Annals of Internal Medicine
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have recently come to appreciate that the separation of
hospitalized patients from their pet dogs can make both parties ill
and can therefore be called the `pet separation syndrome,''' wrote
Dr. John Burnham of Tuscaloosa, Ala. He cited several cases,
including one in which a woman's depression and arrhythmia
``improved dramatically when her dog, Toto, was brought, hidden in
a basket, to visit her in her hospital room.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that in Britain, dogs could be taken to visit long-term
patients, he concluded that for some ``man's best friend could be
the best medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   NOSTRUMS: Breathing Easier? Not With Nose Clip
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of athletes are using nasal dilators _ nose
attachments that hold the nasal passages open _ in the belief that
the dilators allow more oxygen into the body and enhance
performance.
</P>
<P>
   A researcher at Rice University in Houston, Joseph O'Kroy,
decided to test that theory. He had 15 subjects perform the same
exercise test three times: once wearing a nose clip, once wearing a
breathing mask that actively pumped air to the nose and once with
the same mask's nose circuit turned off. He found no difference in
oxygen uptake, work rate or perception of fatigue, according to a
study published in this month's issue of Medicine &AMP; Science in
Sports &AMP; Exercise.

AS CLINTON AND MANDELA LOOK ON, BURUNDI PEACE ACCORD FALLS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ President Clinton had hoped to witness the
signing of a major peace deal and cease-fire among the warring
factions in Burundi, but negotiations to end the country's
seven-year civil war became bogged down Monday when some Tutsi
minority parties refused to sign a deal with the Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
   Former South African President Nelson Mandela, who is brokering
the peace talks, delivered a blistering attack on the Tutsi parties
for backing out of an agreement and turning their backs on ``the
slaughter of innocent people inside Burundi.'' Mandela had invited
Clinton and leaders from about a dozen African nations to this
resort town for the signing by Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated
government.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that a major agreement would not be reached
by Monday's deadline, Clinton instead used the occasion to plead
for peace among the warring Tutsis and Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do it, what is the price?'' the president asked.
``If you don't do it, what is the chance that the progress you have
made will unravel? If you come back in five to 10 years will the
issues change? The gulf between you will not narrow, but the gulf
between Burundi and the rest of the world will grow greater if you
let this moment slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton winds up a four-day trip to Africa early Tuesday morning
after a meeting in Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
Clinton, eager for lasting foreign policy achievements in the final
months of his presidency, is struggling to build support among
Arabs for a breakthrough deal between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord for Burundi that Mandela has been working
toward during the past two years envisions an eventual return of
power by the Hutu majority _ who make up nearly 85 percent of the
population _ but with protections for the Tutsi. Monday's
agreement, signed by some but not all of the parties, fell
considerably short of even an end to hostilities, laying out most
rules of engagement for continued talks.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela criticized the Burundi president, Pierre Buyoya, in
particular, saying he has denied that he is holding political
prisoners, even though, Mandela said, such inmates are being
``treated worse than animals'' in Burundi jails.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the talks are the sheer number of parties involved
_ 19 in all. They include 10 Tutsi political parties, seven Hutu
parties, the Tutsi-dominated army and Buyoya's government. Two key
Hutu rebel groups are boycotting the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can force peace,'' Clinton told the Burundians before
him. ``You must choose it.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in Burundi, which has claimed 200,000 lives and
forced more than a million people from their homes, dates to 1993,
when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the first president from the
Hutu majority, Melchior Ndadaye. But ethnic violence between Tutsis
and Hutus has flared since Burundi broke from Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   On the first trip by a U.S. president to Tanzania, Clinton told
a welcoming party at the airport that ``we still share your
sorrow'' over the 1998 terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar
es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the terrorists went after Tanzania, Kenya and the
United States precisely because we are dedicated to tolerance,
understanding and cooperation across frontiers and lines of
division,'' the president said. ``They took a lot of our loved
ones, but they failed utterly to deter us from advancing our common
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people gathered along the highway waving
green tree branches and flags at Clinton's passing motorcade, which
sped past banana and coffee fields and wandering herds of goats and
sheep on its way to the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed an agreement with President Benjamin W. Mkapa of
Tanzania that will give airlines in each country access to airports
in the other, an ``open skies agreement'' that officials hope will
increase passenger travel and commerce between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks, Clinton said Tanzania should be thankful it
has avoided many of the crises that have focused the world's
attention on other parts of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you have avoided headlines about repression, famine
and war, and instead focused on the steady progress of democracy
and development, being generous to your neighbors, and being a
cause of peace and cooperation across the region, too many people
in our country do not know enough about your country,'' Clinton
said.

&HT;     TO MUCH YOUNG TALENT MAY HURT 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Forty-one days, five exhibition games, scores of
practices, and what have we learned about these 49ers?
</P>
<P>
   1. This team will be better than 0-16.
</P>
<P>
   2. Not much better.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' 1-4 exhibition record proved this: They will play
just well enough not to win on most Sundays. They'll compete gamely
in most instances. Their young players will excite and tantalize,
but bone-headed rookie mistakes will cause the team to unravel in
the crucial moments of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It could be worse. Remember, this team is still in a controlled
burn phase brought on by the out-of-control growth of spending.
Salary cap rules are forcing the 49ers to smoke out older, highly
paid veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-man roster will now include all 11 drafted rookies and
maybe four or five of the undrafted variety. Once one of the oldest
teams in the league, the 49ers' average age this season will hover
around 25.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven players (Ray Brown, Jerry Rice, Derrick Deese, Jeff
Garcia, Rick Mirer, Ken Norton and Matt Willig) are older than 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to find out if these puppies can bite,'' Norton
said of his young teammates. Indications are the youngsters can
bite enough to leave a mark. Coach Steve Mariucci said at the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce kickoff luncheon that fans would look
back at this season's draft class 20 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   While that might be overstating it, this draft class is
intriguing. First-round cornerback Ahmed Plummer is playing like a
polished 10-year pro. First-round linebacker Julian Peterson oozes
with talent, and will play often once his shoulder heals and he
learns the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Third-round inside linebacker Jeff Ubrich could push for playing
time by year's end if he recovers from nagging ailments.
Seventh-round quarterback Tim Rattay is a find. Safety John Keith
is a special teams whiz with a starter's potential. Cornerback
Jason Webster will see plenty of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Even the club's last player chosen, tight end Brian Jennings,
will contribute. He fulfills the obscure but vital role of snapper
on punts and kicks.
</P>
<P>
   The team also cashed in on a two-for-one sale this year with
rookies. Injuries obliterated last season's draft class _ defensive
tackle Reggie McGrew, cornerback Anthony Parker, guard Tyrone
Hopson and wide receiver Tai Streets hardly played at all.
</P>
<P>
   This season, McGrew and Parker will see plenty of time on
defense. Streets bristles with talent and could be a future star.
Hopson is recovering from gall bladder surgery, but could be fine
in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Pierson Prioleau, one of the few who escaped last year's
rash of injuries, is now the starting free safety. And Terry
Jackson, a fifth-rounder from last year, will be the first running
back off the bench this season at fullback and halfback.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chike Okeafor also figures to get plenty of
playing time. Of the 19 players drafted in the last two years, only
one didn't make the team, three will probably start and another 11
will play significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The predominance of young players does thrust Mariucci into an
unsolvable paradox. By the time the 49ers mature, the team will hit
the wall. Colleges play an 11-game schedule with no exhibition
season. After this summer's exhibition games, a rookie's body is
already telling him the season is half over.
</P>
<P>
   When November dawns, first- and second-year players will be
spent. But, frankly, another mediocre season is needed. At 4-12 or
5-11, the 49ers would once again position themselves well for
April's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The use of high-priced free agents to spackle holes in a roster
can send a team into salary-cap hell. No team knows better than the
49ers. So the draft is the only way to rebuild.

   A. The Joan of Arc tower is the sole remnant of a medieval
castle where Joan was imprisoned in 1430 during her trial. It and
the other important sites related to her in Rouen, on the Seine, 70
miles northwest of Paris, are around the Place du Vieux-Marche, the
old town center.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Joan was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, and
traces from the fire are still visible on the ground, as are marks
from the tribunes set up for her judges. About 20 years ago, a
65-foot Cross of Rehabilitation was installed to commemorate this
spot, on the northern edge of the plaza. A small gallery of
drawings and signs tracing the history of Joan and of the Place du
Vieux-Marche stands beside the Jeanne d'Arc church, built in 1978
with Renaissance stained-glass windows saved from St. Vincent
Church, destroyed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The castle tower is open to visitors. It has a small Joan of Arc
exhibit, with objects from the period and from the original castle.
Admission to the tower is about $1.35, at the rate of 7.3 francs to
the dollar, and free for those under 18. The tower is open from 10
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and from 2 to 6 p.m., Wednesday through Saturday
and Sunday from 2 to 6:30 p.m. Information: (33-2) 35.98.55.10.
</P>
<P>
   The Musee Jeanne d'Arc, 33 Place du Vieux-Marche, houses waxwork
scenes from Joan's life, from her childhood in Domremy to her
death. It also displays several models of the 15th-century Place du
Vieux-Marche and historical objects.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is open from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 1:30 to 7 p.m.
mid-April through mid-September, and 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6:30
p.m. the rest of the year. Admission is about $3.50, $1.75 for
those under 18 and students. Information: (33-2) 35.88.02.70 or
www.jeanne-darc.com.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist office in Rouen, perhaps the best source of
information on how to organize a small walking tour of the town, is
at 22 Place de la Cathedrale, and is open daily. A free brochure in
French and English, ``In the Footsteps of Joan of Arc,'' is
available to guide visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The office also has a roster of accredited bilingual guides for
group tours of Joan of Arc sites and of the winding cobbled streets
of Rouen's medieval quarter. You can reserve guided tours, about
$90, through the tourist office, (33-2) 32.08.32.40, or go to
www.mairie-rouen.fr/gb/tourism/index.html, for more information.

   Getting to Newfoundland
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to visit my grandfather's birthplace, near Bonne Bay
on the western (French) coast of Newfoundland. Is it better to fly
into St. John's and drive across the island, or take a ferry? Is
there public transportation? _ Susan Stockwell Yates,
Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Newfoundland is not the easiest place to reach, and you'll
have to weigh time and cost in deciding how to get there. The best
source of information is the province's tourism information line,
(800) 563-6353.
</P>
<P>
   There are no nonstop flights from New York to Newfoundland; you
must go through Toronto or Halifax to St. John's, the provincial
capital. According to Travelocity.com, the lowest published fare
recently has been $637 round trip on Canadian Airlines, (800)
426-7000, or Air Canada, (888) 247-2262.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Atlantic, (800) 341-7941, runs four or five ferries daily
from North Sydney, Nova Scotia, to Port-aux-Basques, in southwest
Newfoundland, about 180 miles from Bonne Bay. A high-speed
catamaran leaves at 10:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., making the trip in
under three hours. Another ferry, taking about twice as long,
leaves at various times depending on the day. Both ferries cost
about $13.50, at 67 cents to the Canadian dollar, plus $42 a car.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a 15-hour ferry to Argentia, on the southeast
coast, about 65 miles from St. John's, should you want to visit the
capital and drive the 350 or so miles across the island. This ferry
leaves North Sydney on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   According to the tourist office, the only mass transit on
Newfoundland is the DRL bus line, (709) 738-8088. It charges $25
for the three-and-a-half-hour trip from Port-aux-Basques to Deer
Lake, near Bonne Bay, and $50 from St. John's to Deer Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Hostels in Macedonia
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am interested in biking and hiking in western Macedonia,
especially around Lake Ohrid. Do you know of any youth hostels or
similarly inexpensive accommodations? _ Nick Simmons, Madison,
Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   A. While Macedonia is a frontier for American travelers, the
area around Lake Ohrid has been a popular vacation destination for
years. Lakes Prespa and Dojran also are developing as summer
resorts, and the mountains around Mavrovo attract winter sports
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign tourism in this former Yugoslav republic is still in its
infancy, though, so there isn't a lot of travel information
available. The Macedonian Youth Hostel Association is an associate
member of Hosteling International (www.iyhf.org), but reaching the
office in Skopje, the capital, where there is a 26-room hostel, is
a bit like playing roulette. The address is Prolet 25, 1000 Skopje;
phone (389-91) 239-947, fax (389-91) 235-029.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of information is the Croatian Youth Hostel
Association, Savska cesta 5-1, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia; (385-41)
482-9294, fax (385-41) 482-9296. According to the Croatian
association's president, Goran Richembergh, Macedonia is generally
safe for travelers and English not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   The Mladost Hostel, (389-96)21-626, is on the road to Struga,
two miles from Ohrid. It is open all year and charges about $3.50
for a bed and breakfast. The hostel is next to the Magnus Hotel,
(389-96) 21-671, which has 38 rooms, a restaurant and its own
beach. The Magnus charges about $24 a person, and reservations can
be made through the hostel association.
</P>
<P>
   A rare source of information about Macedonia in the United
States is Ohrid Travel, 264 Parker Ave., Clifton, N.J. 07011, (973)
340-3210, fax (973) 340-9124. The owner, Vera Svrgovska, said
hotels in the Lake Ohrid area are bargains but fill up quickly in
the summer. She pointed to the recently renovated 131-room Palace
Hotel, (389-96) 260-440, fax (389-96) 35460. It is right on the
lake in Ohrid and has two restaurants. Rooms, priced in German
marks, cost $24 to $33 a person, with breakfast, at 2 marks to the
dollar.

&HT;     TABLE TENNIS CHAMP TAKES A LONG ROAD TO OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Khoa Nguyen was only 9 when the warning came.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of my dad's told him we had to leave Vietnam, now,''
Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   This was just before the North Vietnamese took over South
Vietnam in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us was pretty unexpected,'' Nguyen said,
``but my dad was an air traffic controller for the U.S. government,
so he probably would have been put into a concentration camp if we
had stayed. So we just packed up. It was really hard because two of
my sisters were not living with us. We didn't want to leave them
behind, but we had to.''
</P>
<P>
   It was several years before the family _ Nguyen's parents and
his three brothers and three sisters _ was reunited in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived in a small town in Arkansas first,'' Nguyen said,
``then two years later we drove all the way to California and
settled in Stockton, before moving to San Jose in 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a needed diversion amid all the turbulence, Nguyen's
dad, who had played some table tennis in Vietnam, began teaching
the game to Khoa and his brothers, Khai, Roger and Khoi.
</P>
<P>
   Khoa was something of a natural.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 15, he was a member of the U.S. junior national
team, and at 21 he won a gold medal at the 1987 Pan American Games
and competed at the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in 1988, his long Olympic odyssey began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't too close to making the U.S. team that year,'' he
said, ``but I was the first alternate in both 1992 and 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might have been worse than finishing far out of the
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was especially tough not to make it in 1996,'' Nguyen said.
``I took a lot of time off from work to train and play, and I was
really focused.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was coming off a brilliant year in 1995. After spending
considerable time training in Sweden against top world players, he
won the national doubles title, was runner-up in singles and was
named U.S. Table Tennis Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   But at the '96 Olympic trials, Nguyen lost to Todd Sweeris, a
player who had never beaten him, for the third U.S. team spot in
Atlanta. And after that disappointment, Nguyen decided he'd had
enough of table tennis.
</P>
<P>
   He had graduated from San Jose State University with a computer
science degree in 1991, and decided to concentrate on his career as
a senior software engineer and his family.
</P>
<P>
   But the lure of sport was always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stopped in '96, I was at my peak,'' he said. ``I was
playing really well. So in late 1998, I decided I wanted to start
training for the Sydney Olympics. I was lucky that my company
manager was a gymnastics coach and judge. He understood and
supported me. That was the key. From then on, I started training
really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the return wasn't smooth at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult decision to start playing again
because it meant I would have less time to spend with my family.''
(He and his wife Pauline have two daughters, Khamille, 3, and
Khassidy, 1.)
</P>
<P>
   He also found that a number of his former competitors were
surprised that he was back, and some of them weren't too happy
about it. And some of his touch, which included perhaps the best
forehand attack of any American player, didn't come back
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' he said. ``The first tournament, I lost
to players I had never lost to before.''
</P>
<P>
   Things gradually turned around, however, and Nguyen, who'll turn
34 in October, was undefeated in the first of this year's Olympic
trials. He didn't play as well at the second trials, the North
American singles qualifying tournament, but he partnered with Cheng
Yinghua of Montgomery Village, Md., to win the doubles there and
finally earn a trip to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' Nguyen said. ``I never could have
imagined this would happen now. But I know I appreciate it more at
this stage of my life than I would have earlier. Pauline and I had
our honeymoon in Sydney in 1993, so it's going to be really nice to
get back.''

HASTERT OFFERS KEY CONCESSIONS ON RAISING MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated.) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert on Monday offered key
concessions to Democrats on a plan to raise the federal minimum
wage, moving to end months of stalemate on a popular bill that
Republicans feared would damage them at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate earlier this year approved an increase in
the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour, but since then the
proposal has stalled causing some Republicans to fear they are
handing Democrats a potent campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   With only five weeks left on the congressional calendar after
lawmakers return from summer recess next week, Hastert sought in a
letter Monday to take that threat off the table. He agreed to
Democrats' demands to spread the $1 increase over two years, not
three years as Republicans had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed dropping pension provisions and a repeal of the
estate tax attached to the bill that Democrats criticized as a
giveaway to wealthy Americans. The measure would still contain $76
billion in tax breaks over 10 years, mainly to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that a vast majority of congressional
Democrats and Republicans would like to see a balanced approach
before we adjourn,'' said Hastert, who said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi shared his views.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address on July 29, just before the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Clinton appealed to
Republicans to help end the procedural impasse that has blocked
passage of the first minimum wage increase since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republican leaders really want to make their compassion
count, they ought to join me in getting back to business and
raising the minimum wage,'' Clinton said. ``I hope the majority
will join the Democrats to seize this moment, to stop the delays,
to work with me to help our working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats applauded Hastert's offer, but seemed
tempted to squeeze even more political mileage out his obvious
political predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal that the speaker made was in the right
direction,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
House Democrat. ``It raises the question of whether 50 cents a year
is enough or whether we want to do 50 cents a year over three
years.''

 &HT;    A prescription for campaign gains
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With polls suggesting that voters view Al Gore as the candidate
most likely to boost the nation's health care system, his campaign
moved this week to put the issue front and center. Gore began a
weeklong focus on health care Monday by telling older voters his
plan for prescription drug coverage will help them while George W.
Bush offers only political ads. Gore campaigned at a small pharmacy
in Tallahassee, Fla., to underscore his drug proposals. He knelt
and spoke with Myrtle Jennings, 82, who said she has to choose
among her prescriptions because she can't afford the more than $200
in a month in drug expenses. The Democratic National Committee is
backing Gore with a new ad on prescription drugs to begin running
today in nine states.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION AS CAMPAIGN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Along with economic and health care issues, Joe Lieberman keeps
bringing up God. ``We are not only citizens of this blessed
country; we are children of the same awesome God,'' he said at an
interfaith breakfast with about 150 Chicago religious leaders. On
Sunday, touching on the constitutional separation of church and
state, Lieberman told members of a black church in Detroit that he
hopes his candidacy as an Orthodox Jew will reinstate ``a place for
faith in America's public life.'' But Lieberman also gave a nod to
nonbelievers. He said people of faith must ``reassure them that we
share with them the core values of America, that our faith is not
inconsistent with their freedom, and our mission is not one of
intolerance, but one of love.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TROUBLED THE MILITARY?
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney acknowledged in a series of television interviews
that George W. Bush may not have been entirely correct when he
charged in his convention speech that some military units are not
currently prepared to fight a war. Cheney conceded that Bush had
used out-of-date data when he said that two of the Army's 10
divisions are not prepared for battle. But the vice presidential
candidate and former defense secretary said Democrats have overseen
a military deterioraton in the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   BIG BUSINESS IN PEACEKEEPING
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton Co., the giant oilfield services company run by Dick
Cheney until he joined the Republican presidential ticket, reaped
$2.2 billion in Pentagon contracts to feed, house and support U.S.
troops on Clinton-era peacekeeping missions that George W. Bush
said have helped run down the military. U.S. military deployments
in Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia and elsewhere are the kinds of missions
Bush has pledged to reduce if elected. Halliburton's Brown &AMP; Root
Services construction subsidiary has received the lion's share of
the Pentagon's troop support business in the years since the
Persian Gulf War, which Cheney helped direct as secretary of
defense under Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY'S EARLY RETIREMENT
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney said he's examining different scenarios and ``will
take any steps I have to'' to avoid a possible conflict of interest
involving Halliburton Co. stock options worth millions of dollars.
After five years as CEO at the Dallas-based oilfield services
company, Cheney is walking away with about $33.7 million in stock
and stock rights. The early retirement package includes options to
buy 1.16 million Halliburton shares (currently around $54 a share),
more than 233,000 of which can't be exercised until 2001 and 2002,
after the new administration comes into power. The Democrats are
seeking to make hay of the retirement package, saying the oil
industry is investing in what they derisively label the ``Big Oil''
ticket of Cheney and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S THE POPULAR VOTE . . .
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore continues to cling to a small lead over George W. Bush,
a new Newsweek poll shows. Registered voters favor Gore 46 percent
to 42 percent over Bush in a four-way match-up that includes the
Green Party's Ralph Nader and the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan. The
results are similar in a two-way match-up, with 49 percent favoring
Gore and 45 percent favoring Bush. Both surveys had a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, making Gore's lead just
barely statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND THERE'S THE ELECTORAL VOTE
</P>
<P>
   National polls show the presidential race neck and neck, but
according to a state-by-state breakdown by National Journal's
Hotline, George W. Bush is leading by a huge margin where it really
counts: in the Electoral College. Surveying poll results from 31
states, Hotline found Bush leading in 23 states with 246 electoral
votes _ just 24 fewer than the 270 needed to win in November. By
comparison, Al Gore was leading in just eight states, with 170
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN-AMERICAN PAC MAKES PICK
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, an Asian-American political action committee
has endorsed a presidential nominee. and vowed to deliver 80
percent of Asian-American votes to Al Gore. The action by the 80-20
Initiative in Los Angeles followed two days of spirited
discussions, debates and caucusing over which presidential nominee
would best serve the interests of the nation's 11 million people of
Asian ancestry. Chang-lin Tien, former chancellor of the University
of California-Berkeley and chairman of the endorsement committee,
was quick to note that neither political party has done a lot ``to
advance issues'' important to Asian-Americans. But on balance, he
said, Gore and the Democrats have done more.
</P>
<P>
   BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO SUE _
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who as Texas governor successfully pushed for
tort law legislation limiting lawsuits, filed a case of his own
against a rental car agency over a minor accident involving one of
his daughters. Bush, according to the New York Daily News, sued
Enterprise Rent-A-Car in April 1999 for the Sept. 8, 1998,
accident. No one was hurt, and police weren't called. The lawsuit
said his 1995 Jeep Cherokee was hit while one of Bush's twin
daughters, Jenna, was driving. The lawsuit alleged that Enterprise
shared blame because it had rented a car to a driver with a
suspended license. The case was settled within a few months for
$2,000-$2,500, Breen said.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN TO CARRY PARTY BANNER IN S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who finished second in South Carolina's 1996
Republican presidential primary, will be on the ballot this
November. But this time Buchanan will be the Reform Party's
candidate, after edging quantum physicist John Hagelin at the
party's state convention over the weekend. Meeting behind locked
doors in West Columbia, delegates voted 12-10 to put Buchanan's
name on the state's November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   DIVERGENT VIEWS ON DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' positions on debates seems to be as divergent as
their competing plans for tax cuts. Al Gore wants to participate in
as many as possible; George W. Bush is willing to have a few, but
he wants to control the format as much as possible. And in the
process, says the New York Times, Bush is challenging the
organization the parties set up in 1984 to hold presidential
debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates set the first one
at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, but the
Bush camp considers Boston to be hostile turf. Bush also wants a
more relaxed format _ more like a Larry King show than
Lincoln-Douglas.

 &HT;    Type 2 diabetes among children becoming `epidemic'
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Type 2 diabetes has historically been a grown-up disease _
something that doesn't strike until a person is well into adulthood
and is often a result of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   But the disease, formerly known as ``adult onset diabetes,'' is
now cropping up in children at ``epidemic proportions,'' according
to the American Diabetes Association _ pointing up the rise in
childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Children traditionally are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes,
caused by a defect in the immune system that blocks the body's
ability to produce insulin, requiring patients to have insulin
shots. Type 2 diabetes is the result of the body's gradual
resistance to insulin, often due to family history and chronically
bad health habits _ such as a high-fat diet and inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Now experts believe children are falling victim to the same bad
health habits striking more people _ especially younger adults. A
study released last week by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention showed diabetes increased 33 percent nationally and 37
percent in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   And although that study did not track people younger than 18,
other research shows the number of children diagnosed with type 2
diabetes has tripled in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   And in some states _ especially ones with a high Hispanic and
Native American population _ physicians are reporting that they are
diagnosing a type 2 childhood case of diabetes for every
traditional type 1 case, according to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real problem,'' said Dr. Darwin Brown, an Atlanta
specialist in diabetes and endocrinology. ``And it's not one that's
going to go away.'' Brown has at least four teens in his practice
with type 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that in many cases, parents can help protect
their children from the chronic disease through prevention.
Although genetics plays a significant role in type 2 diabetes in
children _ with 45 to 80 percent of patients having at least one
parent with diabetes _ being overweight is a hallmark of pediatric
type 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer a cosmetic issue,'' said Dr. Frank Vinicor,
director of the CDC's division of diabetes. ``It's an issue of
health. We can't stress that to parents enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that more than 4.5 million kids _ or 11 percent
of youngsters ages 6 to 17 _ are now clinically obese, according to
the latest government studies. To combat that, experts say parents
must get more involved in their children's lives, cutting down on
the junk food and increasing activity. For example:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  University of Pennsylvania researchers found kids spend an
average of 4.5 hours a day staring at a video screen. Experts say
pull the cord, or at least limit computer and television time, so
kids can do what parents have been telling them since the beginning
of time: Go outside and play.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Studies have found that kids in active households, where
parents and children play together, have less problems with obesity
in childhood and adulthood. Play a pick-up game of basketball
instead of picking up that bowl of potato chips, or play baseball
instead of watching the Braves on television.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clean out the junk food. Dump the candy and chips and cheese
doodles. Stock up with fresh carrot sticks, dips, raisin boxes
(every small raisin box is considered a serving of fruit) and
yogurt. Keep them where the kids can reach them. Ask _ and give _
children what healthful foods they like.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure your children's lifestyle is meeting minimum federal
guidelines: five servings of fruits and vegetables and 30 minutes
of exercise a day.
</P>
<P>
   And how do you know if your child is diabetic? Vinicor says
parents should see a doctor if their child seems to have a general
lack of energy, a never-ending thirst and/or experiences a gradual
slide in school performance, which could be due to blurred vision,
a side effect of the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Richards of Anderson, Calif., goes for his physical every
year, and his doctor jots down his height and weight. The doctor
does not react to the fact that each year Richards is shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he never looks back over Richards' file to compare, or if
he does notice the change, he does not think twice about it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, although losing height is a symptom of osteoporosis,
a disease of weakening bones, most doctors do not associate the
disease with men.
</P>
<P>
   Richards had also been complaining of back pain since he was in
his 40s, but he dismissed it as a part of getting old, and his
doctors simply dismissed it, even though men with osteoporosis are
susceptible to microfractures of the spine, and therefore back
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Richards also broke his left arm in three places when he was 46,
but the accident stemmed from an accident, so again nobody
suspected a more insidious bone problem.
</P>
<P>
   So Richards thinks it was just luck that his HMO switched him to
a female doctor who was more aware of women's disorders.
</P>
<P>
   When he went for his physical examination at age 52, the new
doctor reviewed his charts and ordered a bone mineral density test.
The test revealed that he had severe osteoporosis, meaning that his
bones had become so porous that they were 10 times as likely to
break as those of other men of his age.
</P>
<P>
   Now 57, and almost four inches shorter than his peak height of 5
feet 11 inches tall, Richards has to avoid activities that involve
a risk of falling or injury, and he can no longer partake in the
ranching activities he has done all his life.
</P>
<P>
   When his daughter went in for a physical recently and told her
doctor that her father had osteoporosis, the doctor tried to
correct her, saying, ``you mean your mother has osteoporosis.''
</P>
<P>
   When a disease is more common in one sex, it is not unusual for
the less-affected sex to get overlooked. It happened with heart
disease. Because men get it at a younger age than women, it was
deemed a man's disease, and for years women were neither included
in the clinical studies nor educated about their risks.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened with osteoporosis, which is considered a disease
of postmenopausal women, or more familiarly, a little old ladies'
disease. Of the 10 million people in this country with osteoporosis
and the 18 million with low bone mass, 80 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the burden of osteoporosis and fractures is
greater in women, and what has happened is that has overshadowed a
smaller but very significant problem in men,'' said Dr. Eric
Orwoll, professor of medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
   The lifetime risk for a man's having a fracture of the hip, the
spine or the forearm, the most troubling consequence of
osteoporosis, is 13 percent or about 1 in 8. That is also the same
risk for prostate cancer and about the same as a woman's risk of
getting breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis can be a debilitating and fatal disease. Fractures
of the spine lead to stooped posture, loss of height, chronic pain
and can cause compression of the lungs and stomach. One-third of
men who suffer hip fractures will die within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the disease does manifest itself later in life in men
than women, it is not much later. Fractures start to increase
around age 60 in women; in men, they increase between 65 and 70,
said Dr. L. Joseph Melton, an epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of awareness among physicians and men has led to delays
in diagnosis and treatment. Osteoporosis, known as the ``silent
disease,'' often has no symptoms until the bones are so compromised
that a minor trauma causes a fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no early warning signs, awareness of the risk
factors and the use of bone density tests are critical to catching
it early and preventing further bone loss.
</P>
<P>
   As awareness of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women has grown,
it has become more common for them to get routine bone density
tests, though many experts say it is not common enough.
</P>
<P>
   Men, though, are rarely given bone density tests, unless they
have severe symptoms like spine or hip fractures. Even when an
older man breaks a lesser bone or loses height due to bone loss,
two red flags in postmenopausal women, many physicians still do not
consider that he may have osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more likely to be thought of as due to a trauma or bad
luck, even when the trauma that caused the break is relatively
minor,'' Orwoll said.
</P>
<P>
   Often men are sent home without receiving bone density tests and
without hearing any prevention strategies, even though they may be
at risk for further bone loss and fractures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment of osteoporosis in men has also lagged behind that for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the last few years, there haven't been data that
actually demonstrate the usefulness of therapies for prevention or
treatment of osteoporosis in men,'' Orwoll said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors treat men with therapies that have been proven effective
in women, but not yet in men. The two drugs that doctors typically
prescribe, alendronate (brand name, Fosamax) and risedronate
(Actonel), have been approved only for postmenopausal women or in a
subgroup of men with osteoporosis induced by steroids, which have a
direct effect on bones and which reduce bone formation and
testosterone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are legally allowed to prescribe the treatment to men in
what is called off-label use, but studies are needed to test the
safety, effectiveness and dosing of these drugs in men.
</P>
<P>
   Research, though, is beginning to emerge, as is a clearer
understanding of how bone growth and bone loss differ between men
and women. During adolescence, boys grow longer and thicker bones
than girls, making their skeletons more robust and less prone to
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women reach their peak bone mass in their late 20s. All
the while, bone is continually replenishing itself as old bone is
broken down or resorbed and new bone tissue is formed. In the 30s,
bone resorption begins to outpace bone formation, causing a gradual
loss of bone density.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen and testosterone are believed to block bone resorption,
so as women reach menopause and their estrogen level drops,
resorption speeds up, leading to rapid bone loss for the next five
to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   This period is largely responsible for the higher rates of
osteoporosis in women.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 65 or 70, the rate of bone loss is roughly equal
in both sexes because of several age-related factors including
declining levels of sex hormones, among them testosterone; a change
in the ability to absorb and use calcium; and a more sedentary
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   In about 60 percent to 65 percent of men (and about half of
women) with osteoporosis, the disease is linked to other causes.
The three leading causes in men are alcoholism; hypogonadism, in
which they produce low levels of testosterone; and the long-term
use of glucocorticoids, which are steroids taken for asthma,
arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long list of conditions and medications that can
adversely affect bone, and these are the situations in which you
would want to get a bone density test and take action earlier in
life,'' said Orwoll, who will conduct a study of osteoporosis in
men at universities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Men who may be at greatest risk for osteoporosis are those who
do not reach optimal bone mass during childhood and adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   By the time men reach age 25, bone density can vary as much as
30 percent. Orwoll said that ``later in life we think that makes a
big difference in fracture risk.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Experts are shifting their focus on osteoporosis to skew it more
toward prevention.
</P>
<P>
   A recent consensus conference on osteoporosis at the National
Institutes of Health has elevated the importance of building peak
bone mass to the level of preventing bone loss.
</P>
<P>
   Peak bone density is largely determined by genetics, but daily
habits and practices do influence how close a man is able to get to
achieving his peak.
</P>
<P>
   Among normally nourished children and adolescents, getting
enough calcium and vitamin D can make a 5 percent difference in the
density of their bones. But only an estimated 25 percent of boys
(and 10 percent of girls) ages 9 to 17 get the recommended intake
of 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for boys is that bone health is not part of their
thinking, nor their parents', and often not their pediatricians',''
said Dr. Anne Klibanski, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School and chairwoman of the institutes' consensus conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``For girls, calcium intake is associated with high amounts of
dairy intake and fat and that becomes an impediment for having
enough calcium in the diet,'' she added. Other factors that hamper
bone building are smoking and drinking alcohol excessively (more
than two drinks a day).
</P>
<P>
   Getting enough calcium later in life can also help to prevent
bone loss. In adults over 50, only 60 percent of men (and 50
percent of women) meet the recommended intake of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are closer to the goal line than women, but still not that
close,'' said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, chief of the calcium and bone
laboratory at the Department of Agriculture's Nutrition Center on
Aging at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend increasing dietary sources of calcium and
vitamin D, and if that does not provide enough, adults should take
calcium supplements, Dawson-Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Weight-bearing exercises _ including walking, running and
strength-training _ appear to be as important as calcium in
reaching peak bone mass and maintaining bone density.

 &HT;    How political opposites reconcile differences
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows that politics make strange bedfellows, but as the
cover story in George ($2.95) points out, some bedfellows make
strange politics. Reporter Michele Willens takes a look at how
married couples such as Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber, James
Carville and Mary Matalin, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver
handle their political differences. Mostly, says Shriver, she and
her Republican husband never talk about politics.
</P>
<P>
   Also of note, Lydia Chavez addresses the problem of popular
culture and violence and why the candidates are not speaking out on
the topic. Since Tipper Gore began her crusade against explicit
song lyrics 15 years ago, hate rappers such as Eminem have emerged
to dominate the airwaves. So why are Al Gore and George W. Bush
avoiding the issue? No one wants to risk losing votes and campaign
money from Hollywood, Chavez says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than cookies: It's hard to imagine Martha Stewart crying
about anything, but the style maven confesses to shedding tears
daily in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in O, the Oprah Magazine
($2.95). ``Every day there is something more important to cry about
than business,'' Stewart says. ``I can handle my business, but I
can't handle famine in Ethiopia.'' She apparently is still having
trouble handling her divorce. Stewart seems a little miffed when
Winfrey asks her about her relationship with ex-husband Andrew
Stewart. ``I don't even care about that anymore,'' she says. ``I'm
sorry that I haven't spoken to him _ or he hasn't spoken to me _
for all these years.'' Oprah's magazine, by the way, appears to be
a big success despite problems with the editorial staff. This
month's ad-packed 320-page issue is heftier than some phone books.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Uncomplicating your life: Real Simple ($2.95) was the target
of much criticism when it debuted earlier this year, primarily
because it focused on upscale lifestyles with ads for $250
sweaters. Well, the magazine's advertisers still cater to the
well-to-do, but the articles have gotten more informative. The
September issue (with a cover photo of a porch swing at Greyfield
Inn on Cumberland Island) features articles on hiring a caregiver,
organizing your closets, finding the right indoor grill and the
benefits of debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Looking ahead: Both Time ($3.50) and Newsweek ($3.50) offer
fall previews of the best in movies, books, art, music, theater and
television. Likely hits include CBS' ``Bette'' with Bette Midler,
the film version of ``Charlie's Angels'' and the yet-to-be-titled
CD from the Backstreet Boys. In the literary field, Newsweek
recommends ``The Blind Assassin'' by Margaret Atwood and ``On
Writing'' by Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Booked: Speaking of things literary, Book ($4.95) features a
cover story on Anne Rice on the eve of the release of ``Merrick,''
her new witchcraft/vampire novel, a profile of ``Remains of the
Day'' author Kazuo Ishiguro, an interview with science fiction
pioneer Ursula K. Le Guin and a roundup of the best books written
about all the U.S. presidents. And, yes, there is a biography of
Millard Fillmore.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New on the stands: Men's Health has launched a new magazine,
MH-18 ($2.99), aimed at guys in the 13-18 age range. Written in a
hipper style than its older brother, MH-18 offers a variety of
lifestyle articles to complement its pieces on health and exercise.
For example, the premier issue features pieces on dirtboarding,
dating, successful teens and the latest in backpacks, video games
and high-tech gadgets. The magazine is scheduled to go bimonthly
next year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Long before ``Survivor's'' Richard Hatch emerged
as the man we loved to hate, tennis pro John McEnroe filled that
role. Now older and mellower, McEnroe tells The New Yorker ($3)
some of his outbursts on the court were simply theatrical. McEnroe
is complimentary of Venus and Serena Williams but can't resist
declaring that ``any good male college player'' could beat
them..... Discover ($4.99) reports that science and technology will
be a major factor in the success of Olympic athletes in Sydney. For
instance, Olympic boxer David Jackson is training on a computerized
punching bag that analyzes each jab or hook, and the U.S. archery
team is using arrows with a slippery carbon-graphite coating that
reduces drag.... Everything you want to know about fall fashion
trends for men can be found in the 450-page September issue of GQ
($3.50). Articles include how to dress according to your age and
the latest in the collections from Paris and Milan. Nonfashion
features include an interview with Kid Rock _ who talks about
Britney Spears, Madonna and his days of dealing crack _ and a first
look at Ford's new Thunderbird.... In an unscientific but
interesting poll, People ($2.99) asked 1,000 women about their
bodies and how their self-esteem is influenced by Hollywood stars.
Eighty percent said images of women in entertainment and
advertising made them feel insecure about their looks. So who do
women want to look like? First choice was Cindy Crawford (21
percent), followed by Halle Berry (18 percent) and Jennifer Lopez
(15 percent).

 &HT;    Spas can help lead to better health, but real challenge comes
after leaving
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brenda Levinson came back from the spa a new woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really healthy,'' says the 28-year-old Alpharetta
teacher, recalling the afterglow from a four-day getaway to Canyon
Ranch in the Berkshires, in Lenox, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, who braved the upscale retreat's rigorous fitness and
nutrition programs with her mother, Fran Wolkstein, was in such
fine fettle she had a hard time settling back in to the sins of
daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days after, we went out to dinner with my father,'' she
says. ``It was this big Italian meal. My mother and I just looked
at each other and looked at the food. We couldn't eat half of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many spa guests end their stays in a similar state of detoxed
euphoria. And more people than ever are feeling the rush, using a
spa experience as a way to jump-start a resolve for healthier
living. The number of total spa visits, including day spas and
extended-stay resorts, rose 16 percent from 1998 to 1999 to an
average of 33,000 visits per spa annually, according to a survey
conducted last year by the Kentucky-based International Spa
Association. Of those visitors, 35 percent were men _ a substantial
increase over previous years.
</P>
<P>
   But the fit feeling that follows you home may be fleeting.
Whether the focus is on fitness, diet, stress-reduction or a
combination of the three, sustaining the momentum of the spa's
programs requires planning and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Those are also the necessary skills for any healthy lifestyle
change, but a spa visit offers a starting advantage.
</P>
<P>
   `` It removes temptation _ you're not sitting next to a
refrigerator full of goodies,'' says Walter Inge, 67, a freelance
medical writer from northwest Atlanta who spent a week this summer
at the Tennessee Fitness Spa, near Waynesboro, Tenn. ``Also, it
helps that you're with a group of people who are working toward the
same goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is to keep the regimen going outside that
insulated atmosphere. For dieters at least, the odds are long _
researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimate that 80 percent to 95 percent of people who diet will
eventually gain back whatever weight they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Gilburth, director of the Center for New Beginnings, a
facility in Dahlonega that hosts wellness groups, cautions that the
transition from a health retreat to the noisy, smoggy workaday
world can be ``a shock. You keep asking `Which world is real?'''
</P>
<P>
   You should prepare yourself for an onslaught of distractions
from work, family and friends. ``Expect everything and everybody,
including yourself, to try and get in the way of practicing what
you've learned'' Gilburth says. ``It's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Udell, lifestyle director at the Pritikin Longevity
Center &AMP; Spa in Aventura, Fla., has heard all the excuses for
falling off the fitness wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always, `I'm taking care of my
mother/father/child/uncle/neighbor.' Or `I'm in charge of the
church suppers,' or `I travel too much for my job.' But you need to
make time for you. I call it being healthfully selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   That may include distancing from friends who are mired in bad
habits. ``If you hang out with people who smoke and drink and say,
`Fried calamari for everybody!,' you are fighting an uphill
battle,'' Udell says.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Wickersham is trying hard to live the lessons she learned
from a trip to the Green Valley Spa in St. George, Utah, in
February. A freelance marketing specialist for the wellness
industry and a vegetarian for 10 years, Wickersham, 52, of
Buckhead, has always prided herself on her healthy habits. But the
spa's nutrition program _ heavy on the whole grains and fresh
fruits and vegetables _ made her take a second look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I wasn't being good,'' she says. ``I was eating too
many refined foods, too much pasta, too much high-fat salad
dressing _ little things that taste good but that you should do
without.''
</P>
<P>
   Those indulgences caused her to gain 15 pounds over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from the spa, Wickersham has changed her ways.
``I used to eat pasta two or three times a week, now I try to stick
to once every two weeks,'' she says. ``And I try to use vegetable
juice salad dressings that are less than 20 calories a serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she became a vegan, cutting animal products entirely
out of her diet. She also walks up to four miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   The diligence has paid off _ Wickersham has lost five pounds
since February. But she admits it can be a struggle. ``I continue
to work at it. If you go to an Italian restaurant, what do you eat?
But I think I'm doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mira Bergen's post-spa lifestyle may include a career change. A
commercial real estate agent for 17 years, Bergen traveled to the
Pura Vida spa in Costa Rica earlier this month ``to de-stress and
detox. I realized I hadn't been on a vacation since 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   There, the 53-year-old Buckhead resident found stress relief by
taking classes in Bikram yoga, a practice in which yoga movements
are performed in a room heated to more than 100 degrees. ``It's
wonderful,'' Bergen says. ``It cleanses all the toxins from your
body.''
</P>
<P>
   She's continuing the practice at the Bikram Yoga school on
Cheshire Bridge Road, and taking a hard look at her high-stress
occupation. ``I've realized I'm a caregiver, and that I'd like to
incorporate more of that into my life.'' A certified reflexologist,
Bergen plans to augment her real estate practice with work at
alternative treatment centers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important key to staying on track, experts say,
is cutting yourself some slack. ``If you have a relapse _ I call it
an `oops' _ you forgive yourself and continue on,'' Udell advises.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Hampton, fitness director for the Tennessee Fitness Spa,
agrees. ``Maybe you've had a bad day at work and you come home and
eat the whole chocolate cake. Let it go. Yesterday's gone and
tomorrow brings a new start. This is not something you're going to
do for the next six months. This is for the rest of your life.''

OPEN POLAR WATER PROMPTS NEW LOOK AT PAST DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif, Colo., Md., Canada)   (Science Times)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent eyewitness reports of open water from melting ice at the
North Pole have prompted climatologists and other scientists to
make a closer study of satellite imagery and other observations of
northern sea ice, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   They have found substantial evidence that on average Arctic
temperatures in the winter have risen 11 degrees over the past 30
years, and in the late 20th century were the warmest in four
centuries. Data also show that the ice pack over the entire Arctic
Ocean has in recent decades been shrinking in area and thickness.
</P>
<P>
   But climatologists said they were still not sure if diminishing
polar ice reflected some short-term natural cycle or was a wake-up
call of possibly drastic climatic consequences of an industrial
civilization's release of heat-trapping gases.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in Arctic climate and satellite observations agreed
that the existence of patches of open water at the North Pole was
not as surprising as suggested in a news article on Aug. 12 in The
New York Times, which was based on the descriptions and
interpretations of two scientists who had just visited there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a pretty coherent picture of change going on
now in the Arctic,'' said Dr. Mark Serreze, a climatologist at the
National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. ``But there's
nothing to be necessarily alarmed about. There's been open water at
the pole before. We have no clear evidence at this point that this
is related to global climate change.''
</P>
<P>
   The ice covering most of the Arctic Ocean, several researchers
said, is broken by long, wide cracks and gaping holes in many
places, sometimes even at the pole, and especially in the summer.
During a typical summer, 90 percent of the high Arctic region is
covered with ice, with the remaining 10 percent open water. This
has probably been true for centuries, they said, the result of
motions in the ice sheet caused by winds and the force of ocean
currents, as well as warming temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Serreze said that an examination of satellite images from July
15 showed what looked like a large body of ice-free water about 10
miles long and 3 miles wide near the pole. On Friday, the snow and
ice data center made available two images taken by a NASA satellite
named Terra on July 26, about the time visitors on the Russian
icebreaker Yamal were in the polar region. Although the pole was
obscured by clouds, the images revealed how fractured the ice was
near the pole and the many large patches of open water over much of
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of having no ice at the pole is not so stunning,''
said Dr. Claire L. Parkinson, a climatologist at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ``But the report said the ship
encountered an unusual amount of open water all the way up. That is
reason for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson said that her examination of satellite data since the
1970s revealed that the Arctic ice cover had been retreating on an
average of one-quarter of a percent a year. But there are
fluctuations up and down; the retreat was striking in the 1980s,
then rebounded somewhat in the '90s. ``So we are very reluctant,''
she said, ``to make projections into the future'' based on only two
or three decades of observations.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in February, Parkinson said that ``if trends toward
shortened sea ice seasons and lesser sea ice coverage continue,
this could entail major consequences to the polar and perhaps
global climate, and to the lifestyles and survivability of selected
Arctic plant and animal species.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James J. McCarthy, a Harvard oceanographer who was one of
the sources of The Times article, said he would not argue with
critics who said that open water at the pole was not unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was really unusual was that over a period of two weeks we
never had a day of what would be considered normal ice,'' McCarthy
said. ``When we reached the pole and found open water, that simply
punctuated what we were seeing everywhere. These were conditions
that did not seem representative of a transient phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, director of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology,
is the co-leader of a group preparing reports for the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which the United Nations
is sponsoring for the study of the possible consequence of a warmer
climate. Dr. Malcolm C. McKenna, a paleontologist at the American
Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, also was a passenger on the
Yamal and joined McCarthy in describing their surprise at finding
thin ice and intermittent open seas.
</P>
<P>
   Even while cautioning against reading too much into such
anecdotal evidence, Parkinson said, ``It did get into the public
consciousness that, hey, there are changes going on that might be
really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the descriptions by McCarthy and McKenna focused
new attention on the collection and analysis of more data about
polar ice conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War, for instance, has brought to light
important sonar measurements of Arctic ice collected by U.S. Navy
submarines. They are being analyzed by Dr. Drew Rothrock at the
Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of Washington in
Seattle. By comparing measurements of ice thickness between 1958
and 1976 with data from 1993 and 1997, he determined that the
thickness had decreased from 10.2 feet in the early period to 5.9
feet in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case of thicker ice appearing in one region
simultaneously with thinner ice appearing in another, induced
perhaps by a change in surface winds or other transient
conditions,'' Rothrock said, noting that the decrease was
widespread in the central Arctic Ocean, and most pronounced in the
eastern Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., are analyzing images from the Canadian Radarsat spacecraft,
which has made the most detailed satellite observations of the
expanse of the Arctic Ocean. Passing over at an altitude of about
400 miles, the spacecraft bounces mapping radar signals off the
polar region to produce a complete image every three days. This
permits researchers to track the short-term dynamics of the sea
ice, watching cracks open up and grow wider, sometimes more than
1,200 miles long, and seeing thin ice eventually covering some of
the openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ice is thinning due to warming, we'll expect to see
more of these long cracks over the Arctic Ocean,'' said Dr. Ronald
Kwok, a senior research scientist at the Pasadena laboratory. But
Radarsat has been returning data for only four years, not long
enough for researchers to recognize any meaningful patterns in
Arctic climate.
</P>
<P>
   While cautioning against jumping to dire conclusions based on
the sighting of open polar water, Serreze of the snow and ice data
center at the University of Colorado is the principal author of a
review article on Arctic environmental change over decades and
centuries. Many of the changes, he said in the article published in
the Dutch journal Climate Change, appeared to be partly a result of
human activity.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting that parts of Alaska and northern Eurasia had
warmed by nearly 11 degrees in winter months the past 30 years,
Serreze observed, ``We have climate evidence from the past four
centuries gleaned from ice cores, lake cores and tree rings that
don't show nearly as dramatic warming, putting the modern record
into context.''
</P>
<P>
   But Serreze said that an examination of recent research
``validates climate-model results that predict the Arctic will be
among the first regions on Earth to respond to a global warming
trend.'' The issue in the reaction to the report of open water at
the North Pole is whether it is time to start reading a trend into
the disappearing and thinning ice encountered by an icebreaker in
the summer of 2000.

   Western Wildfires Disrupt Vacations
</P>
<P>
   The wildfires that have swept through parts of a dozen Western
states this summer, destroying homes, businesses and millions of
acres of recreational land, have also disrupted or ruined vacations
and crippled businesses dependent on the tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an absolute disaster for campers, hikers, rafters
and other outdoorsmen over a big portion of the West,'' said
Dorothy Maitland, the owner of Travel by Maitland, a tour operator
in Kalispell, Mont. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A major entrance to Yellowstone National Park was closed for
several days in mid-August, Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming
was shrouded in smoke, and fear of wildfires kept visitors away
from Glacier National Park in Montana. Mesa Verde National Park in
Colorado, a trove of ancient cliff dwellings and ancient Anasazi
artifacts, was closed twice for a total of almost three weeks
before reopening Aug. 14.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although small businesses near recreational areas have suffered
and individuals have had to change camping and hiking plans, tour
operators in the affected states had surprisingly few
cancellations. They juggled schedules; when the south entrance to
Yellowstone was closed, some went in via the west, said Keither
Griffall, chief executive of Western Leisure in Salt Lake City.
``It took another three hours or so, but by staying in close touch
with the Forest Service we were not badly affected.'' And as long
as visitors do not think they are in danger, he said, many of them
enjoy what he described as ``a little spice'' during their tours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Mesa Verde was closed, Tauck Tours of Westport, Conn.,
rescheduled tours to Aztec Ruins National Monument in New Mexico.
``We had a lot of people calling to inquire,'' said Phil Otterson,
a vice president, ``but we had very few cancellations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maitland, a former president of the National Tour Association,
said that there was a falloff in early August, but that tours
picked up when her company stuck to most itineraries and
rescheduled others. ``But it was definitely a challenge,'' she
said. &QL;

   Boston Symphony Hall Turns 100 With a Splash
</P>
<P>
   A concert and an open house with free performances are two of
the events scheduled next month to celebrate the 100th birthday of
Symphony Hall in Boston, home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the concert, on Oct. 14, Seiji Ozawa, music director of the
orchestra since 1973, will share the podium with Keith Lockhart,
conductor of the Boston Pops, which also performs in the hall, and
the composer John Williams, Lockhart's predecessor. Soloists that
night will include the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the violinist Gil
Shaham, with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus and the Chieftains, the
traditional Irish band.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the open house the next day, from noon to 10 p.m.,
will be the Boston Symphony, the Boston Pops, the Boston Pops
Gospel Choir, the Greater Boston Youth Orchestra, the Handel and
Haydn Society Chorus, as well as jazz groups from the Berkeley
School of Music, the New England Conservatory, the Longy School of
Music and the Boston Conservatory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting this month and running through July, the orchestra will
offer free tours of the hall on Tuesday morning and Wednesday
afternoon and on the first Saturday of the month, except December. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the fall and spring, an exhibition in the corridors
will focus on the making of the hall and its role in 20th century
music. The hall was designed by Charles F. McKim of McKim, Mead &AMP;
White and opened on Oct. 15, 1900. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of tickets, costing $90 to $500, are available
for the Oct. 14 concert. Another event in the hall, a benefit ball
on Oct. 12, will include a Champagne reception, dinner and dancing
to the Peter Duchin Orchestra, for $2,000 a person.  &QL;

   Designers Tackle a Colonial House
</P>
<P>
   Mount Hope Farm, a Colonial house in Bristol, R.I., has been
chosen as the site for the Newport Showhouse Guild's Showhouse
2000. It will be open to the public from Saturday through Oct. 9.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Built by Isaac Royal in 1745 and added to in 1840 and 1890, the
four-bedroom, two-story Colonial house is on the National Register
of Historic Places. William Bradford, the Rhode Island governor and
later a United States senator, bought the property in 1783 and
played host to George Washington there. In 1917, R.F. Haffenreffer
took over, and the house remained in the Haffenreffer family until
1999 when the Mount Hope Trust acquired it. The estate, on the
banks of Mount Hope Bay, comprises 127 tree-filled acres; it also
has a barn, a playhouse, a 10-room guest cottage and a pool house.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eight landscape designers and gardeners and 26 interior
designers _ many from Rhode Island and some from as far away as
England _ have signed on for the transformation. Among the
highlights will be the kitchen and breakfast room designed by Joan
Peters of Osterville Inc. in Osterville, Mass., and the library by
Ron Alose, a Newport interior designer. Albert Lynch and William
Hullsman of William Hullsman Designs in Beverly, Mass., will
recreate the pool house with a snappy 1940s cocktail flavor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The house will be open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. On
Wednesdays, designers will be present from noon to 8 p.m. Tickets
are $20. A luncheon followed by a lecture and slide presentation by
Chris Casson Madden, a writer about design and a television
personality, is scheduled for Sept. 16. Lecture and lunch, $50,
lecture only, $35. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A special Bristol Day Ticket, which includes admission to the
house as well as to the nearby Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and
Arboretum and to Linden Place, an 1810 Federal mansion, is also
available. Bristol Day tickets are $30. &QL;

   Holocaust Exhibit at London Museum
</P>
<P>
   A permanent exhibit devoted to the Holocaust has opened in a new
five-floor wing of London's Imperial War Museum.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main focus of the exhibit, which takes up 13,000 square feet
of space on two floors, is the persecution of European Jews,
beginning with the turbulent post-World War I period when radical
movements were flourishing on both left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Persecution of other groups, such as Gypsies, Poles, Soviet
prisoners of war, people with disabilities, homosexuals and
prisoners of conscience, is also addressed in the exhibits, which
include photographs, documents, newspapers, posters, archival film
and interviews with Holocaust survivors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sections are entitled Jewish life before the Nazis; Euthanasia;
News Reaches Britain; Invasion of the Soviet Union; Jewish Armed
Resistance; Inside the Camps; Rescue and Survival; Destroying the
Evidence; and War Crimes Trials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the exhibits are a deportation railroad car acquired from
Belgian Railways and a funeral cart used in the Warsaw ghetto. Also
on view are personal mementoes, letters, diaries, family
photographs and concentration camp uniforms. There is also a model
of Auschwitz 40 feet long.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imperial War Museum, Lambeth Road, London SE1 6HZ; (44-891)
600-140 (recorded information), (44-207) 416-5320; www.iwm.org.uk.
The museum is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, exhibit from 10:15
a.m. to 5 p.m. Not recommended for children under 14. Admission
$8.35; free for children under 16 and seniors. Advance booking is

&HT;     OLYMPICS: WOMAN HAVE COME A LONG WAY, BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To great fanfare, the Olympics are letting in
more women than ever. They are also letting too many of them off
easily.
</P>
<P>
   In road cycling, that second X chromosome is good for a
119-kilometer discount.
</P>
<P>
   Women swimmers stop at 800 meters freestyle. The men do 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain bikers cover 40 to 50 kilometers if they are male, only
30 to 40 if they are female.
</P>
<P>
   What are the Olympic pooh-bahs so afraid of? The specter of
fainting spells and smelling salts should have evaporated by now.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was quite a panic during the first marathon for
women, in 1984, when a Swiss runner entered the Los Angeles
Coliseum looking like a zombie, wobbling, listing to one side, her
eyes glazed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gabriele Andersen-Scheiss was evidence that women lack
the fortitude to race 26 miles, gold medalist Joan Benoit was a
stunning rebuttal. She won the U.S. Olympic trials 17 days after
undergoing knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a male rower has passed out in a pairs race, and a
female gymnast has vaulted onto a damaged ankle. Kerri Strug's wild
leap became one of the great video highlights from Atlanta _ and a
thorough repudiation of Barron Pierre de Coubertin's justification
for keeping women out of the original modern Games in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indecent,'' he said, ``that the spectators of these
Games should be exposed to the risk of seeing the body of a woman
smashed before their very eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere 104 years later, listen to Mark Schubert, coach of the
U.S. men's swim team: ``It's degrading to the women that they don't
do the 1,500 at the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Schubert, the mentor to backstroke superstar Lenny Krayzelburg,
has coached some of the best distance swimmers in U.S. history,
including Janet Evans. The best-known American swimmer since Mark
Spitz, Evans probably never swam her best event on the grand
Olympic stage.
</P>
<P>
   She was a pure distance swimmer, and her windmill stroke looked
utterly tireless over 1,500 meters. She could swim the event at
world championships, at national championships, but not at the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But coaches like Schubert never push for a 1,500 without
clarifying that they want to keep the 800, and extend it to men,
too. Now, male swimmers jump from the 400 to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Don Talbot, head of the Australian swimming program, visited the
U.S. Swimming Trials and talked to several American coaches about
advocating for an 800 and 1,500 for both sexes. He knows how hard
it is to get new events added, and he worries that the
International Olympic Committee will only expand in the direction
of the sexier, more-ready-for-prime-time sprints. Already, three
new 50-meter races, in the breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly,
are in line to become events at the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the disparity between men's and women's distances has
nothing to do with sexism anymore. Maybe it's just about the bias
against taxing the television viewer's attention span.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1896 definition of indecency was watching a woman crash
on a track, the 2000 version is imagining the semi-mythical soccer
mom _ the prime target for Olympic broadcasts _ hitting her remote
control.
</P>
<P>
   But that can't be the explanation for the difference in the
race-walk, which could last five city blocks and still not end up
on TV in its entirety. The women will race 20K in Sydney, up from
10K in Atlanta. The men have a 20K and a 50K, which, like
fraternity hazings and prostate trouble, doesn't seem to be the
source of much female envy.
</P>
<P>
   But equality is equality. And the absence of a women's 50K is a
direct descendant of Barron Pierre's silly remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Debbi Lawrence has qualified for three Olympics in race-walking.
When the distance doubled for 2000, she had doubts about her
ability to adapt. She never considered herself, as a woman, low on
stamina. She had simply conditioned herself to be a 10K racer
because that's what would get her into the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence is a case of supply following demand. Until 1988, she
had only dabbled in race-walking when an injury prevented her from
running. Then the IOC announced that in 1992 women would be allowed
to compete in the discipline, which had been held for men since
1908. Lawrence became a full-time race-walker.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many 50K walkers among women right now. The
Olympics still ask for more from men.
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, the Olympic Games should pile on the yardage,
the mileage. The women can take it. They always could.

   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rebecca Goldstein's characters are descendants of Ingmar
Bergman's chilly intellectuals and Nathaniel Hawthorne's
coldhearted curmudgeons. They want to subordinate the heart to the
head, the spirit to the word; they dream of perfectly controlled
worlds where messy emotions are subjugated to the ordering dictates
of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Childs, the narrator of Ms. Goldstein's lumpy new novel,
``Properties of Light,'' is no exception. Like Eva in ``The
Late-Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind'' and Hedda in ``The Dark
Sister,'' Justin lives inside his head, and he has equipped himself
with forbidding intellectual armor. Even as a child he was an
absolutist, reciting the law of the excluded middle. (``Every
statement is either true or false, and no statement is both!'')
Now, as a physicist at a well-known university, he devotes his days
and nights to trying to decipher the hidden rules of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's affair with a beautiful young woman named Dana _ who
just happens to be the daughter of an eminent physicist named
Mallach, revered by Justin for his unorthodox theories _ tests his
rationalist view of the world and gives Ms. Goldstein a chance to
explore her perennial themes about the dichotomies between mind and
body, intellect and passion, logos and eros.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Goldstein's achievement in this volume that she has
managed that very difficult task of making palpable the sort of
cerebral ardor possessed by scientists and thinkers working at the
very height of their powers. She communicates the almost erotic
power that ideas can impart, ``the bliss'' experienced by Justin
and his colleagues when they make a breakthrough in their work,
lifting ``a bit of the heavy veil the material world wears across
her face'' to catch ``a feature of a feature never quite so
glimpsed before.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing this, however, she spends an enormous amount of time
trying to convey to the reader the intricacies of Justin's work in
quantum mechanics, a feat she never manages to pull off. There are
pages and pages of ponderous and _ to the lay reader, at least _
perplexing discussions of matters like ``wave function,'' something
that is ``Lorentz invariant'' and ``backwards causation.'' Worse,
the novel's characters are given to saying things like:
``Nonlocality is merely the expression of quantum entanglement.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who once taught philosophy at Barnard College, is
interested in using Justin and Mallach's theories about ``a
realistic model of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics'' to explore
the relationship between reality and theory, and the role that
randomness and chance may play in the cosmos, concepts that also
serve as metaphors for her characters' personal dilemmas.
Unfortunately her descriptions of their work feel so contrived, not
to mention impenetrable, that the reader's attention soon begins to
wander.
</P>
<P>
   Her depictions of her characters' emotional lives can be equally
heavy-handed. Justin comes across as a parody of the arrogant,
unfeeling scientist. He's the sort of fellow who seasons his
childhood reminiscences with Latinisms and who cannot comprehend
the notion that there are sensations ``that lay deeper down than
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   He grows irritated with Dana for adoring her dead mother,
because he regards her mother as a clownish drunk with silly New
Age beliefs. And he's so possessive of Dana that he resents her for
having an inner life inaccessible to him: ``It was a torment to
need so desperately to know the contents of her mind, the hidden
variables behind her words and silences and laughter, the varieties
of intent behind her murmured mmm's.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana herself emerges as a sort of variation on Rappaccini's
daughter, depicted in the Hawthorne story of that name. She has
devoted her life to her brilliant, eccentric father, and her
devotion alters the course of her life. She is a strange, dreamy
girl, described as being ``mind-proud'' the way ``other women are
house- or husband-proud.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her father, Mallach, he is portrayed as a sort of alter
ego to Justin _ another enormously gifted but fatally self-absorbed
physicist with a similar proclivity to anger. Years ago, we're
told, Mallach formulated a groundbreaking theory that was ignored
by the academic establishment, and that experience, coupled with
his wife's betrayal, has driven him to the brink of madness.
</P>
<P>
   He has more or less put aside the practice of physics until
Justin appears on the scene and proposes that they _ along with
Dana _ collaborate on finding a way to reconcile quantum mechanics
and relativity, ``the two monumental theories of 20th-century
physics.'' It is a hubristic proposal that reawakens not only
Mallach's long-buried scientific gifts but also his fury at being
marginalized and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's impossible not to admire Goldstein's efforts to
write a Gothic suspense story that's also a novel of ideas, her
characters remain too two-dimensional and her storytelling too
ponderous for the reader to ever become fully engaged. There are
some brilliant glimpses of scientists' passion for their work and
some well-observed depictions of life in the hothouse world of
academe, but in the end, sadly, they're not enough for either a
thriller or a philosophic novel.

 &HT;    Practical man turned off by appliance salesman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The practical man went to war last week.
</P>
<P>
   At an appliance store.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, he knows. That's what he gets for breaking his First
Commandment _ thou shalt not shop. But he did it for you.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he also needed a fridge. But that's not why he was there.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when the practical man needs an appliance, he doesn't
go shopping. He visits his favorite used-appliance joint and tells
the owner to load the truck with as much appliance as $150 will
buy. This brilliant stroke not only saves time and money. The units
never fail to last a few years, and once or twice, the colors have
even matched the kitchen countertop.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the practical man was out to save the world.
Before he made his purchase, he'd price new refrigerators,
calculate how much he saved buying used, and spread the gospel in
his column. But when he opened the door of the new-appliance store,
he stepped into the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's it going!? My name's Paul. How can I help you today?''
</P>
<P>
   A raw recruit on the consumer battleground, the practical man
was stunned by the barrage but kept his head. He knew better than
to look the enemy in the eye, so he stealthily scoped out the scene
with a sideways glance.
</P>
<P>
   Paul _ pudgy, bald, middle-aged _ had broken away from a platoon
of salesmen bivouacking at the customer service desk. He was
charging right for the practical man with ... was that an
outstretched hand or _ sweet Jesus! _ a bayonet? To slow him down,
the practical man slung some lead of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just looking,'' he shot back, then bolted behind a massive
Magic Chef range. But portly Paul was Private Persistence. Smelling
blood, he boinked his scorched skull around the exhaust hood, then
blindly sprayed the area with a hail of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, look around. What you see isn't all we have. We can
order anything you want. If you have any questions, just give me a
holler. Name's Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, the practical man made it to the microwaves with
his pocketbook unpunctured, and then an eerie hush fell on the
killing field. Warily, the practical man crept out of a foxhole
he'd found among the Frigidaires and peered past the A/C units to
the customer service camp. Paul was waddling back to his comrades,
beating a hasty retreat.
</P>
<P>
   This was the practical man's chance! He glanced left, glanced
right, poked his nose in a couple of iceboxes. Prices. Prices!
Where were the prices? Were they classified information? Would he
have to go through Paul?
</P>
<P>
   Then _ disaster. He closed the door of the third fridge and _
booby trap! _ Paul popped out from behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What exactly are you looking for? Is it for a new house or a
remodeling job? Have you seen our new stainless-steel models?''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! Flushed, flummoxed and fearing for his wallet, the
practical man dashed for the dishwashers, sought safety amid the
stackable washers and dryers _ but there was nowhere to hide. Paul
pursued, blistering the practical man with buckshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a dimensional dilemma I can help you solve? We have a
new `ultra-thin' line ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Treed at last, the practical man had no choice. He whipped out
his big gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, Paul. Let's do business. I want prices. I want
prices, sizes, brands and features. And I want a list lining them
all up so I can pick the best deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ooof! The shot hit Paul like a panzer blast to the solar plexus.
He wobbled, wheeled round, began to wander aimlessly back toward
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a lot of work,'' he muttered. Shellshock-
</P>
<P>
   ed, he shook his head and began mechanically heaving huge
three-ring binders from beneath a desk. ``The catalogs are all over
the place, and of course in this business, there's no such thing as
uniform pricing. Can't I interest you in our sale models?''
</P>
<P>
   Paul was pulverized, but the practical man took pity. He aborted
the mission before Paul could work up a sweat. After all, a price
comparison was by now pointless _ he wouldn't trade at this joint
if the fridges were free.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I have a question that bothers me a great
deal. It requires a not-especially-practical answer but one that is
truthful and not just funny-funny.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, I read the obituaries. It's not as you perhaps think
_ to see if my name is there. It's to see if friends or
acquaintances have died. Lately, I notice that most who have died
are my age!
</P>
<P>
   Now the problem. I cannot picture myself dead. OK, I'm 79 years
old. Nevertheless, mentally I feel 19, and physically somewhat
older. But dead? No way!
</P>
<P>
   PM, what is it like to be dead? Remember, I don't want a funny
answer. I want only the truth!
</P>
<P>
   I'm waiting for your answer. And hurry ...
</P>
<P>
   _ L.L. Trescott, Lake Clarke Shores
</P>
<P>
   Gee thanks, L.L. Nothing makes a humor column crackle like a
discussion of death. But all right; since you were worried enough
to write, here goes.
</P>
<P>
   You want the truth about death? Easy. Remember how it was before
you were born? It's like that _ only you're bigger.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that was a joke, but what do you expect the practical man to
say? He doesn't know what it's like to be dead, and he doesn't
wonder about it, either.
</P>
<P>
   A practical man doesn't waste time on insoluble problems, and
neither should you. Sure, you can make all sorts of guesses, plug
them into the death equation and come up with an answer, but your
answer is going to be garbage because it's not based on facts.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, for example, we postulate an omnipotent, judgmental
creator of a human-centered universe. Do the math, and voila:
Heaven and hell. Or, instead, let's toss a disinterested God and
randomness into the mix. Oops! Now we're all on a treadmill to
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Or wait _ let's go with a hippie love god (hey, it could happen)
who means well but gets a little fuzzy on the details. L.L., we're
going to become one with that spirit in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   This is an amusing game _ for about five minutes. And then you
realize you're wasting precious time puzzling _ to no purpose,
considering plenty of real, soluble problems on this side of the
great divide. Like what can you do right now about that leaky
faucet? Or what can you do tomorrow to make the day worth living?
Or what can you do this month to make life better for your kids and
grandkids?
</P>
<P>
   Concentrate on life. You'll have plenty of time to solve death's
dilemmas after you're gone.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: Come out of the closet. Am I the only one
who realizes this column is written by either a woman or a gay man?
Men don't use words and phrases such as ``yummy'' or ``wee ones''
(alliteration notwithstanding). Nor are your ideas ``practical,''
or even ``manly'' (whatever that means). This must be quite a joke
around the newsroom, but I think it has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, via e-mail
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the practical man just came out of the
closet _ his girlfriend's closet, and he wasn't in there to swap
tops.
</P>
<P>
   Bah! How many times does the practical man have to answer this
insipid inquiry? And what difference does it make, anyway? But just
for the record: The practical man is male, 39, divorced, four kids,
has lived in Palm Beach County 25 years, worked for The Post since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   That's all you get. Begone!
</P>
<P>
   But wait, before you go _ slowly, gently drop ``yummy'' and
``wee ones'' onto the floor and kick them back over to the
practical man. There's no way he's going to let women and gays walk
off with all the good words.

SKY SHOW PRESERVES A TRIBE'S ASTRONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ANNE E. RUDERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Skidi Pawnee of the Nebraska Plains of the early 19th
century, the nighttime sky served as clock, calendar, compass and
weather channel, all in one.
</P>
<P>
   But for members of the modern tribe, the stories and traditions
of the Skidi's unique relationship to the sky have nearly been
lost.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a new emphasis on the astronomy of other cultures,
Chicago's Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum has revived Skidi
Pawnee astronomy in a sky show that is unusual among cultural
shows. To create the show, ``Spirits From the Sky, Thunder on the
Land,'' the Adler astronomers took their research beyond books and
records and onto the Pawnee reservation where they sought out
members of the Skidi Pawnee tribe to work with them in creating the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Skidi Pawnee tradition, the grandparents would instruct
the grandchildren, which is what we mimic in the show,'' said
Phyllis Pitluga, the program director. ``They passed on their
observations of the real sky and real events in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the Pawnee Nation numbers 2,500, compared with 10,000 in
the early 19th century, and its people live on a reservation near
Oklahoma City, instead of a Nebraska plain. The Skidi, or ``Wolf,''
Band is one of four that make up the Pawnee Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitluga said that Skidi astronomy was the most accurate and also
the most carefully recorded by anthropologists at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skidi Pawnee observed changes in the sky and folded them
into their creation story,'' Pitluga said. In the Skidi creation
story, the union of Mars and Venus created the first woman and the
overlapping of the sun and the moon created the first man.
</P>
<P>
   These stories and many others in a system where ``Dippers'' are
``Stretchers'' and ``Orion's Belt'' is ``Three Deer'' are seldom
remembered by the new generations of Skidi.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two decades Skidi stories have been most carefully
preserved by a researcher for the Smithsonian Institution, Von Del
Chamberlain, who discovered anthropology notebooks and tribal
artifacts at the institution. ``I came across a chart of the sky
and it's just such a beautiful and unusual thing, having stars on a
piece of leather. I don't know of anything like it in the world,''
said Chamberlain, who wrote a book on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chamberlain's and Pitluga's leadership, a team of
astronomers and Skidi elders met regularly and at length over the
last two years, sharing Skidi ceremonies where elders teased out
childhood memories, laughing and arguing over shared and forgotten
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made sure that the Pawnee stuff they were doing was true and
that the stuff they were doing was OK with our people,'' said Pat
Leading Fox, a Skidi chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirits From the Sky'' cost $1 million to produce, twice as
much as a usual sky show because of the extensive research
involved. It was financed in part by a grant from the National
Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Adler is also providing for the construction of a portable
planetarium on the Pawnee reservation. Leading Fox said it will
provide a useful teaching tool, since fewer and fewer Skidi know
the old stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our elders are trying to teach the ones who are interested,''
Leading Fox said. ``We've lost so much that now we're trying to
hold on to what we have.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    September and Sonoma _ the two go together.
 &HT;    Sonoma County, Calif. though known for its wines, is an
agricultural paradise, with a benign climate year-round. However,
it is especially bountiful in September when apples, corn, figs,
plums, raspberries, strawberries and tomatoes as well as wine
grapes, reach their peak. Along with farm products, roadside stands
overflow with lavender, bonsai, honey, flowers, mustard, herbs,
cheese and bread.
 &HT;    Since surveys confirm that many mature travelers spend their
leisure hours gardening when they aren't traveling, the best part
of visiting Sonoma for some may be going from farm to farm
throughout the county, admiring the ripe produce. And many Sonoma
farmers also sell a tempting array of items made from their
products: apple butter or cider, jams, olive oil, relishes, breads
and fruit-filled pastries.
 &HT;    Sonoma County, 45 miles north of San Francisco, stretches from
the Pacific Ocean on its western edge through inland redwood
forests to the Mayacamas Mountains in the east.
 &HT;    Here, you will find the romance of small-town California_ and
plenty of history. Sonoma was the site of California's northernmost
mission, San Francisco Solano de Sonoma, begun in 1823 when
California was under Mexican rule. (The present church was built in
1840.) And the central plaza in the town of Sonoma is where the
short-lived Bear Flag Revolt against Mexico took place in 1846,
with the insurgents declaring California a republic until U.S.
troops rode in and took over.
 &HT;    History of another sort is here for literary aficionados who can
visit Jack London State Park in Sonoma's Valley of the Moon. A
trail meanders through a forest of oaks and firs to the ruins of
the author-adventurer's lavish four-story mansion, which burned
down one hot August night in 1913, a few weeks before he and his
wife planned to move in. The stone walls, fireplaces and window
openings remain.
 &HT;    In Santa Rosa, the county seat, tourists can visit the home and
gardens of horticulturist Luther Burbank, who lived here for more
than a half-century. Here, he developed more than 800 plant
varieties, including the potato that helped defuse the Irish potato
famine. He called Sonoma, ``the chosen spot of all this earth as
far as nature is concerned.'' The Burbank home is at the corner of
Sonoma and Santa Rosa avenues (707-524-5445).
 &HT;    After leaving the city and traveling along the winding roads of
Sonoma's Farm Trails map (call 800-207-9464 or see
www.farmtrails.org.), mature travelers may find themselves
persuaded to stop at roadside stands to buy tomatoes and apples
that glisten like jewels.
 &HT;    There are also dozens of established stops along the trail, such
as Kozlowski Farms (www.kozlowskifarms.com or 707-887-1587) in
Forestville, a three-generation business now in its 50th year. This
is a good place to pick up an apple pie or any of the other 99
items made there in small batches.
 &HT;    Sonoma's special events are tied closely to food; many center
around farmers markets such as the one in Santa Rosa on Thursday
nights where you can wander from stand to stand sampling the food
and feasting your eyes on the work of county artists and artisans.
 &HT;    Other markets are held in Healdsburg on Tuesdays, Petaluma on
Saturdays, Sebastopol on Sundays and Sonoma on Fridays. Many of
these towns also offer markets on other days, depending on the time
of year. In the fall and winter, you can pick your own pumpkins and
cut your own Christmas trees.
 &HT;    Other food events include the Pumpkin Festival (October) in
Healdsburg, Butter and Egg days in Petaluma (April), the
Gravenstein Apple Fair in Sebastopol (August) and wine tastings and
auctions in many of the romantically named growing regions in the
area.
 &HT;    For those with an interest in cooking, Sonoma County offers a
variety of classes and demonstrations such as those at Ramekins
(707-933-0450 or www.ramekins.com) in the town of Sonoma where the
culinary director, Bob Nemerovski, urges students to ``come
hungry'' since eating is part of experience. The three-hour
demonstrations cost from $35-$65, while hands-on classes in
anything from a Chinese Dim Sum party to Chocolate Showstoppers run
from $50-$80. The Depot Hotel (707-938-2980 or www.depothotel.com),
also in Sonoma, has classes, too.
 &HT;    Sonoma's visiting foodies are not finished after touring a few
farms, festivals and farmers markets. An exciting mix of
restaurants serve Sonoma products with style. Conversation over
breakfast might include an item-by-item review of what each person
ate the night before, and as they rehash yesterday's meals, they
will not fail to compare the wines _ possibly from the county's
more than 190 wineries _ with which they washed down their food.
 &HT;    For more information, contact the Sonoma County Tourism Program
at (800) 576-6662, or visit www.sonomacounty.com on the Web.

 BY TERESE LOEB KREUZER 
 &HT;    (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I first saw Bobby Olivacce one hot December night, walking down
a narrow street in Savan. He had a long dark beard, Rastafarian
dreadlocks, and the gaunt, intense face of an Old Testament
prophet. He was holding a large bunch of wheatgrass.
 &HT;    I was driving through this 200-year-old section of Charlotte
Amalie with my friend, Jacquel Dawson, who pulled over in front of
the high stoop of the Red Ball Grocery Store and introduced us. She
told Bobby I had come to the U.S. Virgin Islands to learn about how
herbs were used to cure and prevent disease, and specifically to
learn about what the old-timers call ``bush medicine,'' _ the use
of herbs that could be plucked from the forest and transformed into
teas, poultices, healing baths and restorative tinctures.
 &HT;    Bobby peered through the open window of Jacquel's battered,
rust-colored Toyota and told me that herbs were his way of life.
 &HT;    ``All Rastafarians are herbalists,'' he said. ``Some know more
than others,'' he added, modestly omitting to mention what Jacquel
later told me, that in the 16 years since he had come to St. Thomas
from his native Dominica, he had become known far and wide as a
healer. Some people consulted him when they were sick, while others
just needed some advice about how to use an herb in their backyard.
Bobby was a sort of roving herb shop, sometimes ministering to as
many as 100 people a day.
 &HT;    There are still many people in the U.S. Virgin Islands who would
rather go to an herbal healer like Bobby than to a medical doctor,
and there are some who go to an herbalist when ``modern'' remedies
have failed.
 &HT;    A rooster crossed the road and two men lounged on a stoop
drinking beer as Bobby said, ``If someone with a cold comes to me
for help, I remind them that the cold has a cause, and the cause is
bad eats and drinks, shallow breathing, laziness and wickedness.''
 &HT;    '' Wickedness?'' I asked.
 &HT;    Bobby smiled slightly. ``Wickedness is a way of life that is
selfish and that affects others adversely.''
 &HT;    As Jacquel and I said good-bye, Bobby invited me to look him up
and ``reason'' with him next time I was in town. I said I would.
 &HT;    Where Bobby comes from _ Dominica _ is still a wild place of
rain forests, farms and small villages. The same can't be said of
the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have been territories of the United
States since 1917. They have a patina of American culture _ cars,
television sets, large resort hotels, housing projects, a love
affair with all that money can buy.
 &HT;    Of the four U.S. Virgins (St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, and
tiny Water Island), St. Thomas in particular has been built up. The
once-quiet streets of Charlotte Amalie, the capital, are often
thronged with tourists who debark from enormous cruise ships by the
thousands. As they scurry to spend their money in the duty-free
shops, the chances are that few suspect that there's another side
to this island. I wouldn't have known, either, if Jacquel hadn't
shown me.
 &HT;    Just a block beyond the end of Main Street's (Droningen Gade's)
shopping strip is the old Market Square. There's been a market here
since the 17th century. In sugar plantation days, this was one of
the places where African slaves were sold when they first came off
the ships.
 &HT;    The Africans brought with them their knowledge of medicinal
herbs and how to contact ancestral spirits. They adapted their
practices to the new world, blending what they knew with what they
learned from the Amerindians.
 &HT;    On Saturdays, beginning at 3 a.m., farmers arrive at the market.
They sell fish, meat, fresh produce and herbs _ black wattle, worry
wine, several kinds of sage, cattle tongue, Spanish needle, bay
leaf, lemongrass and japana _ to name a few.
 &HT;    Some of these herbs will be used in cooking, while others will
be bought strictly for medicinal purposes. Many are herbs that used
to grow profusely in the bush or in people's yards. But life on
these islands began to change around 50 years ago _ at first,
gradually, then drastically. People moved to the states to get jobs
or go to college and never came back. At the same time, there was
an influx of people from other islands _ the Dominican Republic,
Dominica, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, Antigua. Housing was built
to accommodate them. The bush was cut down or cut back. Some plants
that were once common became hard to find or virtually extinct. The
lore that had passed within families from generation to generation
about how to recognize plants and how to use them medicinally was
no longer as widespread as it once was.
 &HT;    This is not to say that the use of bush or an affection for it
disappeared. But it became diluted. Today, for instance, a store
called The Fruit Bowl in the Wheatley Shopping Center in Charlotte
Amalie sells an herb labeled ``Tea Bush.'' It's lemongrass,
certainly one form of tea bush, but only one of scores of herbs
that have traditionally been used to make medicinal tea on these
islands.
 &HT;    One afternoon, Jacquel took me back to Savan to meet Mavis de
Jongh who was born on St. Thomas in 1920. She has a pretty, white
house surrounded by tamarind and flamboyant trees on the edge of
town. Leaning on her cane and looking up at the steep hill dotted
with houses above her dwelling, she says that she remembers when
there was nothing there but trees.
 &HT;    She also remembers that when she was little, bush was used for
all occasions. ``If you had a cold, you were given black wattle. We
took lemongrass for fever, anise for stomach ache, pigeon pea for
abscess in the mouth, Spanish needle to cleanse internally. Bush
teas were used originally to prevent problems and to sustain
health. My grandmother knew what to use.''
 &HT;    Today, Mrs. de Jongh goes to medical doctors, but she still has
bush growing in her yard _ and she knows how to use it if she needs
it.
 &HT;    Mrs. de Jongh's recollections of her childhood are not unusual.
Many people attest to the wisdom of their mothers and grandmothers
who knew what to do for most run-of-the-mill complaints. In more
serious circumstances, they might consult a weedwoman. She was a
respected member of the community with a specialized knowledge of
herbs. She would gather them and sell them in the marketplace,
dispensing not only the herbal remedy, but instructions on how to
use it. She might also serve as a midwife, prescribing herbs to
prepare a woman for birth and administering a bush bath to help her
recover afterward.
 &HT;    The best-known weedwoman in the U.S. Virgin Islands at the
moment is Veronica Gordon, 52, of St. Croix. Her family has lived
on St. Croix for seven generations.
 &HT;    When she was 4 years old, she contracted polio. In the
aftermath, her father, Patrick N. Gordon, a respected herbalist,
``picked a feg of aloe cloves'' which he whipped up with egg
whites. Then he took her down to the sea, dipped her in, anointed
her with the mixture he had prepared, and rubbed her legs.
 &HT;    ``Oh, God, I was sore,'' she remembers. ``But it worked. My legs
were fine. I could climb trees a year later. This was my
introduction to bush medicine.''
 &HT;    Veronica learned about bush medicine from her father, who had
learned from his mother. ``In my family, the knowledge goes from
gender to gender,'' she says. ``It has to be first-born male to the
first-born female.''
 &HT;    Now, as her father did before her, she sees private clients. She
also occasionally gives demonstrations and lectures at the St.
George Village Botanical Garden on St. Croix.
 &HT;    The 16-acre botanical garden, which is set among the ruins of an
old sugar plantation, has more than 1,000 species of trees, vines
and shrubs, including an herb garden devoted just to the plants
that were used historically on the island by the weedwomen _ and
often, still are.
 &HT;    Another St. Croix resident, botanist Olasee Davis, has been
working diligently for years to preserve this knowledge and
transmit it to a younger generation. He writes an ecology column
for a local newspaper and was a major contributor to a book called
``Traditional Medicinal Plants of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St.
John.''
 &HT;    Olasee, an extension specialist with the University of the
Virgin Islands, leads hikes to the wild regions of St. Croix.
Though most visitors never see them, they're not far from the
shopping centers, the Hess Oil refinery and the highway that links
the two major towns _ Christiansted and Frederiksted _ of this
82-square-mile island.
 &HT;    One morning, as he precedes a group of teen-agers from a local
junior high school down the arid, wind-swept beach of Jacks Bay on
the eastern end of St. Croix, he stops every few yards to talk
about another plant.
 &HT;    ``This is inkberry,'' he says, pointing to a shrub with purple
stems and dark green leaves. ``Our grandparents used to crush the
berries for ink.'' He also tells the students that the leaves can
be used to treat thrush, boils and burns.
 &HT;    He shows them how sea grape leaves can be used to make a cup or
a plate and how the stiff twigs of the maran bush can serve as a
toothbrush or a yard broom. He tells them that the leaves of a
common evergreen tree called the starvation apple can be made into
a poultice to treat arthritis, burns, sprains and swelling. He
pauses in front of the familiar, bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers
of the ginger thomas bush (the U.S.V.I.'s national flower) and
mentions that the leaves can be made into a tonic to treat high
blood pressure and diabetes.
 &HT;    Olasee estimates that he hikes with more than 8,000 students a
year, but he also takes off-island visitors on his
``eco-educational tours'' of St. Croix's bays, rain forest, salt
ponds and wetlands.
 &HT;    After meeting Olasee, Veronica and Bobby, I drove around St.
Croix with new awareness. I noticed the women selling homemade
maubi by the side of the road. Bittersweet Maubi, a local beverage
made from bark, is refreshing in this hot climate, and is also said
to ameliorate diabetes, liver problems and diarrhea.
 &HT;    I stopped in Armstrong's ice cream shop on Route 70 and observed
that the flavors included soursop, which comes from a tree whose
leaves are made into a sleep-inducing tea.
 &HT;    I went into the Pueblo supermarket where I bought sorrel (said
to be helpful for kidney and bladder ailments), senna (a mild
laxative) and eucalyptus leaves (to make a tea that relieves colds
and fevers).
 &HT;    And I thought about something that Olasee had told the children.
``In nature, everything has a function,'' he had said. ``There are
no weeds.''

 From The New York Times 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hidden in a grove of pines on a finger of land overlooking Lake
George in the foothills of the Adirondacks is a shrine to a
remarkable woman. Her lovely musical name was Marcella Sembrich,
and though virtually forgotten today, this Polish-born soprano was
once one of the glories of the operatic stage.
</P>
<P>
   During a career that spanned half a century, she sang all the
big roles, performed with the greats of her day and won nothing but
raves. Critics and fans adored her. At the 1909 gala at the Met
that marked her retirement from opera performances shortly before
she turned 51, ``an audience of monstrous size packed the house to
suffocation,'' a critic for The New York Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
   Gustav Mahler led the orchestra in the march from ``Figaro''
that evening as Sembrich was escorted to a throne and showered with
gifts and rose petals. The event was Page 1 news in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine in question is a doll-sized studio of pink stucco
where Sembrich embarked on a second career as a voice teacher. She
made her summer home in the tiny village of Bolton Landing in 1922,
opened the studio in 1924 and taught there until shortly before her
death in 1935. Two years later, the studio was converted into a
small house museum, and although Sembrich and her acolytes are long
gone, this trove of operatic memorabilia offers a haunting picture
of an extraordinary era.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Bolton Landing appears to be your typical lakeside
tourist center, pleasantly sleepy in comparison with Lake George
village, its slightly raucous neighbor to the south. But the
Sembrich Museum recalls the hamlet's heyday at the turn of the
century. Along with Lake George village, it was a summer haven for
New York's moneyed class, a place where gilded age Knickerbockers
built imposing mansions on pine-scented lakefront, thereby savoring
both incomparable views and the lush comforts of home.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the fine buildings that once lined the lake are gone,
replaced by far less glamorous newcomers. Typical of the upstarts
is the Melody Manor Resort, which sits on property once occupied by
the grandly named Marie Antoinette Villa. Its past occupants
included the millionaire Harry K. Thaw, forever remembered as the
husband of Evelyn Nesbit _ the ``Girl in the Red Velvet Swing'' _
and the man who fatally shot her lover, the architect Stanford
White. All that's left of the place is a stone gatehouse, its
original function long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Of the few historic structures still standing, the bulk are in
private hands and off limits to visitors. For the most part, the
self-directed driving and walking tours suggested by the Town of
Bolton Bicentennial Committee (the town celebrated its 200th
birthday last year) take a visitor past sprawling lawns and
insistently modern structures. With only an occasional granite wall
or rusting wrought-iron gate to suggest what stood long ago, it's a
frustrating but tantalizing, and unexpectedly moving, journey.
</P>
<P>
   From books, photographs and the occasional survivor that has
escaped the wrecking ball, it's possible to piece together a vivid
picture of what life must have been like in what was one of the
most desirable enclaves in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   The best guide to the area is ``The Great and the Gracious on
Millionaires' Row: Lake George in Its Glory'' by Kathryn E. O'Brien
(North Country Books, 1978), a delightfully anecdotal study of the
families who summered along the 10-mile strip between Bolton
Landing and Lake George Village.
</P>
<P>
   As I learned from reading this lavishly illustrated book and by
doing a little discreet trespassing on my own, one of the surviving
splendid buildings is the William K. Bixby mansion on Mohican
Point, just south of the center of town. A spanking white
Colonial-style structure, it was built at the turn of the century
and is still a summer home to descendants of the original family.
</P>
<P>
   The family made its money in railroads, and money was no object
when it came to outfitting its lakefront quarters. Period documents
reveal that a veritable fleet of different types of boats once
departed from its dock and a corps of gardeners tended its
plantings. With its pillars, gables and forest of chimneys, the
Bixby mansion still stands tall, visible from both the road and the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The Bixby family may be best known because Harold Bixby, a son
of William K., provided both the main financial backing and, in a
tip of his hat to his old hometown, the name for Charles
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. Even more interesting, at least to
local school children who get to make shivery visits to the site,
is the stuff about the ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the first Bixby set foot on the property, an Indian
maiden was said to have been burned at the stake near one of the
mansion's locust trees. As the flames shot up, an apparition
swooped down to rescue her, and the blood-red markings on a stone
that sits beneath that same locust is regarded as proof of this
event.
</P>
<P>
   The Sagamore resort lacks a ghost, but has its own stories to
tell. It opened on Green Island, just north of the village center,
in 1883, a great wedding cake ringed with porches. Like virtually
all the lakefront hostelries, it commanded a spectacular view, and
its decorative accents _ massive beams, terra-cotta fireplaces,
gleaming dark woodwork _ did a good deal to conjure up 16th-century
England.
</P>
<P>
   But bad luck seemed part of its fate. In 1893, the Sagamore was
destroyed by fire, and though a year later an even more lavish
hotel rose on the site, the year 1914 brought a second fire, as
devastating as the first. By 1930 a third hotel had been built, the
huge white palace that sits on the island today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Sagamore's checkered history, a sense of its
original grandeur lingers. One afternoon I spent a few hours
wandering through its spacious, high-ceilinged public rooms and
wide, quiet corridors, pretending to be a refugee from an Edith
Wharton novel. It wasn't hard. The crystal chandeliers, the
slow-moving ceiling fans, the plump sofas and wicker chairs, the
potted plants and swags of drapery made me feel as if I were back
in another time. The gentle color scheme of rose and tea and
celadon had a lulling effect.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite stroll took me along a flower-fringed pathway that
led from the back of the hotel down a sloping greensward, at the
foot of which a protected beach has been set up for children. It's
possible to sit off to one side and watch Lake George's signature
steamboats chug across the water as they have since the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Sembrich Museum, Bolton Landing's other notable survivor, is
outwardly less imposing than the Sagamore but even more evocative
of the past, for crammed into this modest cottage is a veritable
history of opera during its golden age. And understandably, for
Sembrich's career spanned some of the richest years of opera.
</P>
<P>
   The singer, whose story is told in an affectionate book called
``A Recollection of Marcella Sembrich'' by H. Goddard Owen (Coneco
Litho Graphics, 1995), was born in 1858 in a hamlet near Lemberg.
She studied piano and violin as a little girl and enjoyed a stellar
early career singing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1877, she married her piano teacher, a man 13 years her
senior with whom she remained through his entire life. (Miss
Sembrich, who had no children, took her mother's name as her
professional name). In 1883, she came to New York and made her
American debut in ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' on the second night of
the Met's first season.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of Sembrich _ a seemingly endless number of them can
be seen in the museum that bears her name _ reveal that she was
adorable, with a mass of dark curls, huge, soulful eyes, and a
winsome smile that kept her looking girlish well beyond her youth.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, she was also a world-class charmer. Henry
Krehbiel, music critic for The New York Tribune, made special
mention of her ``pretty witcheries, graceful coquetries'' and
``captivating ingenuousness.'' But it was the heavenly quality of
her voice and her ability to capture the intellectual and emotional
nuances of the music that lay at the heart of her gift. It was said
that Franz Liszt once instructed the young Sembrich: ``Sing, sing
for the world, for you have the voice of an angel.'' Her dear
friend Brahms added: ``Sembrich has a mind, a heart and a soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone who is not an opera aficionado, the collection
of memorabilia crammed into her museum offers a fascinating window
into a personality and an era. Though modest in size, the place
opens with a bang, with a sumptuous display of Sembrich's costumes
in the little foyer. (As was typical of divas of the day, Sembrich
provided her own wardrobe and routinely traveled with 20 or 30
trunks.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the outfits on view is the gray cloak she wore as Mimi in
``La Boheme,'' a delicious-looking cherry velvet bolero jacket, her
Queen of the Night tiara with moon and stars set against dark blue
velvet from ``The Magic Flute,'' an assortment of fetching bonnets,
fans dripping with feathers and sequins and a great deal of ermine,
lace and embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   The main room, with its beamed ceiling, heavy dark furniture,
Steinway grand piano and Oriental carpets, looks much as it did
when Sembrich instructed her pupils in proper breathing and
intonation.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every inch is crammed with mementos, for there were
few stars of the turn-of-the-century operatic world whose lives did
not touch Sembrich's. There is no end of tributes. From
Rachmaninoff, ``I weave daisies into the crown of Marcella
Sembrich.'' From Edmond Rostand: ``To the nightingale, to the
thrush, to all who excel in song.'' From the conductor Bruno
Walter, ``In thankful remembrance of the most glorious impressions
of my young manhood.'' From Puccini: ``You are the Mimi.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a profusion of scores, letters, telegraphs,
portraits, autographed scores and photographs and programs _ from
Brahms, Liszt, Verdi, Mahler, Toscanini, both Strausses _ the list
is long. And there is a marble bust of the young Beethoven, tribute
wreaths of oak and laurel leaves exquisitely wrought in silver, a
replica of Chopin's death mask, an ostrich fan with a
diamond-studded monogram from the Rothschild family, a loving cup
from Caruso, with whom she performed in ``Rigoletto'' at his Met
debut in 1903, and a miniature model of the Met stage.
</P>
<P>
   A few oddities reveal that she had a life off the operatic
stage, among them a letter from Mark Twain inviting her to his
``doe'' luncheon. (She declined.)
</P>
<P>
   In the sunroom, a bay window offers yet another sweeping view of
the lake, along with a glimpse of the path that winds deeper into
the pines along which Sembrich must have taken many a restorative
walk. In summer, concerts are held in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over this little kingdom is a gentle, soft-spoken man
named Richard Wargo, the resident curator and composer in
residence. As I was strolling through the rooms, alone on a warm
Sunday morning, he played a recording of Sembrich singing the waltz
from ``The Merry Widow.'' With his flick of a switch _ CD, not
Victrola, for Sembrich has been remastered for the modern age _ the
room was flooded with scratchy but deeply suggestive sound. Any
visitor would have paused to savor this eerie, wonderful moment.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Bolton Landing
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   Bolton Landing is 200 miles north of New York City, a four-hour

local camp counselors, who congregate there for late-night suppers.
The wraparound porch, which affords a good view of the main street,
is especially pleasant on summer evenings. A dinner for two that

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By CORINNE LaBALME  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Amid its human-scale skyline, century-old cafes, pedestrian
streets and lush gardens, Copenhagen still finds room for
contradictions. That's to be expected from a city that nurtured
both Hans Christian Andersen and Soren Kierkegaard.
 &HT;    In a city under constant renewal, two dazzling avant-garde
projects have been completed over the last 12 months: the dramatic
Black Diamond addition to the Royal Library and the shimmering
Danish Design Center. And a 10-mile bridge-and-tunnel connection to
Malmo, Sweden, the Oresund Fixed Link, was inaugurated on July 1.
It ties southern Sweden to the Continent for the first time.
 &HT;    Founded in the 12th century, Copenhagen was nearly destroyed on
several occasions, most notably by a fire in 1795 and the 1807
British bombardments during the Napoleonic wars. Thus, most of the
city's neoclassical architecture dates from the early 19th century,
when Danish arts and letters flourished.
 &HT;    From now through Sept. 10, the city celebrates the achievements
of the years 1800 to 1850 with the biennial Golden Days in
Copenhagen Festival. In conjunction with the festival, the
Copenhagen City Museum (Bymuseum) just unveiled its renovated
Kierkegaard Room, lengthening an already crowded museum roster.
 &HT;    Because many museums and castles have limited hours,
time-conscious visitors often have lunch at the convenient museum
snack bars. Nevertheless, getting to know this city means at least
one break for smoerrebroed _ the open-face Danish sandwiches
generally topped with fresh shrimp, herring or egg _ in a
waterfront cafe in the recently gentrified Nyhavn quarter.
 &HT;    Another essential taste of Copenhagen is found at the enchanting
Tivoli amusement park, open through Sept. 24, with outdoor concerts
and carnival rides.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EVENTS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Golden Days Festival unites 60 cultural institutions in
Copenhagen. Highlights include exhibitions and performances in
historic sites, notably the restaging of Bournonville's romantic
ballet ``Kermesse in Bruges'' at the Royal Theater Aug. 31 and
Sept. 4, 5 and 8. Tickets are $8 to $55, at 8 kroner to the dollar.
Programs are available at www.goldendays.dk/english.
 &HT;    Golden Days maps, in English, found at the tourist information
center near Tivoli at 1 Bernstorffsgade, pinpoint architectural
details like the sober pediments of the Christianborg Palace Chapel
(1826) and the Egyptian ornamentation on the Krystalgade Synagogue
(1833).
 &HT;    The City Museum (Copenhagen Bymuseum), 59 Vesterbrogade, (45) 33
21 07 72, recently inaugurated its expanded Soren Kierkegaard room,
with his books and furnishings, including his desk. Open Wednesday
to Monday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; after Oct. 1 from 1 to 4 p.m.
Admission: $2.50; children free.
 &HT;    ``Symbolism in Danish and European Painting'' opens the fall
season at the Statens Museum for Kunst (Danish National Gallery),
48-50 Solvgade, (45) 33 74 84 94 or www.smk.dk, on Sept. 29,
continuing through Jan. 14. With 80 paintings from 1870 to 1910,
this exhibition includes works by Edvard Munch and the Danish
masters Ejnar Nielsen, Vilhelm Hammershoi and Joakim Skovgaard,
whose ``Christ in the Realm of Death'' has just been restored by
the museum. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Wednesday
(free) until 8 p.m. Admission: $5, $7.50 with the exhibit.
 &HT;    From now to Oct. 17, the Royal Theater, Det Kongelige Teater,
Kongens Nytorv, (45) 33 69 69 69, www.kgl-teater.dk, offers an
intriguing double dance bill with a contemporary ballet
choreographed by the former Paul Taylor star Lila York presented in
tandem with the classic ``Giselle,'' performed by the Royal Danish
Ballet. Tickets: $6.25 to $43.75.
 &HT;    The Danish diva Anne Margrethe Dahl stars in the Royal Theater's
opulent production of Verdi's ``Traviata'' through Sept. 16.
Tickets: $9.50 to $65.60.
 &HT;    The Danish Design Center, 27 H. C. Andersens Blvd., (45) 33 69
33 69, a showcase for the best of Danish and international design
that opened in January, honors the 75th anniversary of the Danish
electronics company Bang &AMP; Olufsen through Sept. 17, with
photographs, early advertising posters and pioneering designs _
including the Bauhaus-inspired Hyperbo 5RG combination radio-record
player from 1934 and a sleek molded Bakelite radio from 1939 _
displayed alongside contemporary designs. Open Monday through
Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekends and holidays 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.;
$3.75.
 &HT;    Royal Copenhagen's headquarters on the Stroget, 6 Amagertorv,
(45) 33 13 71 81, the pedestrian shopping avenue in the center of
town, is also popular. The porcelain firm honors the 225th
anniversary of its signature Blue Fluted pattern with a new line of
historic re-editions, and presents a retrospective exhibition
through Sept. 2. Open Monday to Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday
to 7 p.m., Saturday to 5 p.m., Sunday through September noon to 5
p.m. Free.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SIGHTSEEING
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Despite busloads of camera-toting admirers, the Little Mermaid
appears justifiably disconsolate at being seated in the harbor
across from an oil storage silo on the north edge of town. Nearby,
the relatively unknown Danish Resistance Museum in Churchill Park,
(45) 33 13 77 14, details daily life in Denmark from 1940 to 1945.
Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5
p.m; after Sept. 16 Tuesday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and
Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Free.
 &HT;    The Hirshsprung Collection, 20 Stockholmsgade, (45) 35 42 03 36,
reopened in March after a year's renovation. The collection of
19th-century Danish painting and sculpture that belonged to the
tobacco baron Heinrich Hirshsprung is housed in a
neoclassical-style mansion filled with furniture from the homes and
studios of the artists. Open Thursday to Monday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
and Wednesday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $3; children free.
 &HT;    Fans of the Vikings can begin their Nordic quest at the National
Museum, 10 Ny Vestergade, (45) 33 13 44 11, where runestones,
jewelry, weapons and mummified remains from Viking graves are
displayed with clear English explanations. The delicate Sun Chariot
sculpture is one of the museum's major Bronze Age artifacts. Open
Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $5; children free.
 &HT;    Tivoli, 3 Vesterbrogade, (45) 33 15 10 01, has enchanted
visitors since 1843 with its lavish flower gardens, fanciful
pavilions, rides and numerous restaurants. Two Chinese-inspired
attractions for children _ Dragon Boats and the Panda's Tower _
opened this year. The Valhalla Funhouse and the Viking Ships ride
are much scarier. Open Sunday to Thursday 11 a.m. to midnight,
Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Closes Sept. 24 and reopens
Nov. 17 to Dec. 23. Tickets: $5, children $2.50.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WHERE TO STAY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The conveniently situated 51-room Hotel Danmark, 89 Vester
Voldgade, (45) 33 11 48 06, fax (45) 33 14 36 30, between Tivoli
and the National Museum, offers a friendly welcome and uncluttered,
traditional decor with bold colors. The typically tiny, spotless
bathrooms have built-in hair dryers. The private garage ($9.40 a
day) is a bonus. Doubles: $137.
 &HT;    Near the Amalienborg Palace, the 366-room Copenhagen Admiral
Hotel, 24-28 Toldbodgade, (45) 33 74 14 14, fax (45) 33 74 14 16,
is housed in an 18th-century granary with atmospheric
barrel-vaulted hallways. Harborside rooms offer views of cruise
ships and sailboats. And although rooms derive great charm from
200-year-old rough-hewn pine beams, the landmark wooden
infrastructure means no air-conditioning. Amenities include a
nightclub and sauna. Doubles: $128 to $164.
 &HT;    Budget: A cheerful children's playroom and an enclosed outdoor
patio adjoin the dining room at Ibsen's Hotel, 23 Vendersgade, (45)
33 13 19 13, fax (45) 33 13 19 16, in a residential district near
the lush Botanical Gardens. Most of the 118 rooms display clean,
no-frills Scandinavian design, although top-of-the-line suites have
more ambitious decor and kitchenettes. The generous buffet
breakfast is included in the room price. Doubles: $131 to $156.
 &HT;    Luxury: The gracious Hotel d'Angleterre, 34 Kongens Nytorv, (45)
33 12 00 95, fax (45) 33 12 11 18, was built in 1755 in the Grand
Hotel tradition. Its 124 rooms are decorated in a variety of
styles; some with sumptuous canopy beds with French provincial
textiles. The hotel has two restaurants, Internet access from rooms
and an indoor pool and spa. Doubles: $287 to $449.
 &HT;    While far smaller in its dimensions, the 84-room Nyhavn 71, 71
Nyhavn, (45) 33 43 62 00, fax (45) 33 43 62 01, exudes considerable
antique charm. Its pint-size rooms, with exposed beams and colorful
textiles, are squeezed into an 1804 warehouse on a scenic stretch
of waterfront with views of the old naval base. Work is under way
on a 44-room annex. Doubles: $187 to $224.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WHERE TO EAT
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The sleek, minimalist dining room in the Royal Library's new
Black Diamond wing, 1 Soren Kierkegaards Plads, (45) 33 47 49 49,
which opened in September, offers some of the city's most
sophisticated cuisine. The menu includes grilled catfish paired
with succulent Norwegian lobster and superb smoked Baltic salmon
with dill and scrambled eggs. Waterfront views are sensational at
sunset, so ask for a window table. A three-course dinner for two
with a modest bottle of wine is $113.
 &HT;    In an upscale neighborhood of power brokers and power shoppers,
Cafe Zeze, 20 Ny Ostergade, (45) 33 14 23 90, serves eclectic
European fare, like lamb filets topped with shiitake mushrooms and
an exotic vegetarian pasta laced with coconut cream and hot chili
pepper. While the lunch crowd is mostly suit-and-tie, this
streamlined bistro attracts a younger, cooler clientele after dark.
Dinner and Tuborg for two: $45.
 &HT;    Tourism has tamed the once disreputable Nyhavn waterfront, and
open-air restaurants have ousted tattoo parlors and brothels. At
Nyhavns Faergekro, 5 Nyhavn, (45) 33 15 15 88, the all-you-can-eat
lunch buffet with 10 varieties of Scandinavian herring for $11 is
one of the best seafood bargains in Copenhagen. The famous fish
cakes with remoulade sauce or smoked lamb sandwiches, both $5.60,
also make a fine light lunch. At dinner, there is a fixed-price
two-course menu for $19.
 &HT;    High ceilings and leaded-glass windows lend a lofty look to
Cafeen I Nikolaj, 12 Nikolaj Plads, (45) 33 11 63 13, which serves
down-to-earth Danish fare in a deconsecrated church site. The
creamed seafood chowder is superb, and the classic lunch
combinations of herring, smoked eel, shrimp or salmon tartare never
disappoint. Two for lunch will spend $35. It is open for dinner
from spring to Sept. 2 with an expanded menu that includes steak
tenderloin or lemon sole. Dinner for two with wine: $75.
 &HT;    The Stroget takes its festive ambience from street mimes and
musicians. At Cafe Europa, 1 Amagertorv, (45) 33 12 04 28, the
outdoor tables are tantalizingly close to the Royal Copenhagen and
Georg Jensen showrooms. An oversized Danish sandwich topped with
marinated artichoke, sun-dried tomato, roasted eggplant and fresh
basil costs $8. A glass of wine or beer is $3.50. (No
reservations.)

(visit www.bbb.org) and membership in the National Tour Association
(see www.ntaonline.com). Both organizations maintain up-to-date
information and make it easy for you to check out a company.
</P>
<P>
   Another method would be to call the U.S. tourist office for the
country you plan to visit. They can be very helpful in establishing
a tour operator's reputation. Travel agents can also prove
indispensable in finding out if a tour operator has a good track
record.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the company you choose, before you give them a
deposit, ask for a written itinerary that lists all details,
especially what is included and what is not. Also, familiarize
yourself with their refund policy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In passing, I heard someone mention a new play encompassing
the events of the Trojan War but I can't remember where or when it
is playing.
</P>
<P>
   A. You must be referring to ``Tantalus'' _ a 10-hour 30-minute
chronicle of the Trojan war by John Barton, which is making its
world premiere in Denver in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This two-day event is the result of a collaboration between the
Tony-Award winning Denver Center Theater Company and the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   From October 20 through December 3, The Westin Tabor Center,
Denver, is offering a ``Tantalus'' package every weekend, priced at
$905 per couple. This includes two reserved tickets to the
Saturday-Sunday production at The Stage Theater at The Denver
Performing Arts Complex, a three-night stay at The Westin Tabor
Center, Denver, meals served between acts on both days, daily
breakfast at the hotel's restaurant and transportation between the
hotel and theater complex.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, The Westin offers packages in conjunction with the
``Best of Broadway'' series at the Denver Performing Arts Complex.
Show dates and package prices vary.
</P>
<P>
   For package information and reservations, call the The Westin
Tabor Center at (303) 572-9100.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there an easy way for me to get information about Southern
Africa?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, the Regional Tourism Organization of Southern Africa
will send you its official directory, ``The Essence of Africa,''
free of charge. The RETOSA directory contains more than 200 pages
on everything a visitor needs to know about travel in the countries
of Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Included are the 10 best reasons to visit each of these
countries as well as places of interest, activities, climate, entry
requirements, transportation, currency and answers to frequently
asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of ``The Essence of Africa,'' call (212) 286-9300 or
e-mail vhaynesbca(AT)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have recently become interested in the sport of clay
shooting and wish to combine this with my next vacation. How can I
go about this?
</P>
<P>
   A. For marksmen (and women) of all skill levels, The Cloister at
Sea Island, located off the coast of Georgia, is hosting its
first-ever Sporting Clays Championship. The competition will take
place from Nov. 3-5 at the resort's Sea Island Shooting School on
Rainbow Island just south of the Cloister.
</P>
<P>
   The school offers three types of clay target shooting,
customized instruction and superior equipment to help novice and
advanced shooters perfect their skills.
</P>
<P>
   A three-night Sea Island Sporting Clays Championship package at
The Cloister includes luxurious accommodations, three meals daily,
two days of shooting (100 clays per day) on the resort's Sporting
Clays Course, and a reception and awards dinner at the end of the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The package is priced at $130 per person per night double
occupancy or $180 for single occupancy. There is also a $180 per
person registration fee for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Cloister at Sea Island, just an hour from Savannah, is
consistently ranked as one of the world's top resorts, with miles
of private beaches, golf courses, superior dining, tennis and a
seaside spa. For more information call (800) 732-4752; Web site:

   Some hotels will answer just about any room service request.
When a guest of the Eden Roc Resort &AMP; Spa (4525 Collins Ave., Miami
Beach, FL 33140; 800-327-8337; www.edenrocresort.com) was boating
offshore last year, he asked for a pizza from hotel room service.
The hotel obliged and arranged to have a helicopter sent out to the
yacht to deliver the pizza. The tab was $100 for the pizza _ a
Supreme with everything on it. The delivery charge was $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   Good room service can jump-start someone's morning mood, erase
the headaches of a difficult trip and elevate a hotel stay to a
memorable experience. But many hotels are taking room service way
beyond delivering a good club sandwich in less than 20 minutes.
Here's a look at what some properties are doing to keep their
guests happy.
</P>
<P>
   A cheese Danish and coffee may be a satisfactory start for many
travelers but not for every guest at The Phoenician (6000 E.
Camelback Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85251; 800-888-8234;
www.thephoenician.com). That hotel's ``Champagne Breakfast for
Two'' includes smoked Atlantic salmon, caviar and scrambled eggs on
a toasted brioche with sauteed oyster mushrooms and chives. It
comes with seasonal berries with lemon creme fraiche, breakfast
pastries, coffee and a half-bottle of Tattinger champagne. The cost
is $95.
</P>
<P>
   At Four Seasons Hotel Chicago (120 E. Delaware Place, Chicago,
IL 60611; 800-819-5053; www.fourseasons.com/chicagofs), toasters
are delivered to the room with breakfast so guests can toast their
own bread, bagels or English muffins exactly the way they like
them.
</P>
<P>
   And at Turnberry Isle Resort &AMP; Club (19999 West Country Club
Dr., Aventura, FL 33180; 800-327-7028; www.turnberryisle.com), room
service didn't blink when a couple requested that their early
morning breakfast be delivered to the 18th hole of the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of hotels are offering in-room dining
options that rival their public dining facilities. In upstate New
York, for example, the Mirbeau Inn &AMP; Spa (851 W. Genesee St.,
Skaneateles, NY 13152; 877.MIRBEAU; www.mirbeau.com) serves their
Mirbeau Estate Cuisine as either a three- or five-course dinner
exactly as they would in the dining room. The servers use Frette
linen tablecloths and set up a candlelight dinner using fine china,
silver and crystal. Guests are served course by course.
</P>
<P>
   A room with a view can be wonderful, especially if it's in
scenic Vancouver. Almost three-quarters of the 489 rooms at The
Waterfront (900 Canada Place Way, Vancouver, BC V6C 3L5, Canada;
800-441-1414; www.thewaterfronthotel.com) offer views of the harbor
and North Shore mountains. The hotel enhances the view by offering
binoculars through the room-service menu. The price is about $21.
</P>
<P>
   Bath menus are popping up all over. For example, at the
Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua (One Ritz-Carlton Drive, Kapalua, Maui,
Hawaii 96761; 800-262-8440; www.fourseasons.com) on Maui, guests
can opt for a butler-drawn bath, which is available during the
evening for a charge of $50 per bath. It must be ordered at least
30 minutes in advance and it includes music, towel warmers and
chocolate truffles. The hotel says that many guests choose this as
a way to relieve jetlag.
</P>
<P>
   Among the baths to choose from are the Ka Au'au Pili Aloha (The
Romance Bath), a romantic bath by candlelight that includes milk
whey powder, lavender bath oil, rose petals and a half-bottle of
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Pets are pampered at The Ritz-Carlton Chicago (160 E. Pearson
St., Chicago, IL 60611; 800-621-6906; www.fourseasons.com) with the
``Gour-r-r-met'' room service menu. For dogs, the choices include
``Our Lovable' Chopped Filet Mignon'' for $12 and ``Tail Waggin'
Good' Grilled Breast of Chicken'' for $6. Cats can partake of
``Chicken Liver Pate'' for $5, filet of salmon ``Chopped Charlie''
for $8 and get a ``Side Order of Anchovies'' for $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   Many hotel chains are also trying to improve the ``service''
aspect of room service at all of their properties. About a year
ago, Wyndham Hotels &AMP; Resorts (1950 Stemmons Freeway, Suite 6001,
Dallas, TX 75207; 800-Wyndham; www.wyndham.com) instituted a
five-minute call that's made prior to room-service delivery.
There's also a follow-up call to make sure that nothing else is
needed. And that service level is audited by each hotel.
</P>
<P>
   As an increasing number of travelers opt to take food along on
airplanes, more hotels are making it easier for them to do so. For
example, the Hay-Adams Hotel (800 16th St. NW, Washington, D.C.
20006; (202-638-6600; www.hayadams.com), which overlooks the White
House, has gourmet lunch boxes made to order. The choice includes a
roasted vegetable sandwich, a curried chicken salad sandwich or a
tuna with wasabi sandwich with the guest's choice of bread. All
sandwiches are served with fresh seasonal fruit, homemade potato
chips, freshly baked cookies and Evian water. The cost is $25 per
lunch box.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for a good's night sleep, The Benjamin (125 East 50th
St., New York, NY 10022; 888-4BENJAMIN; www.the benjamin.com) has
an 11-pillow room service menu. There are gel-filled and
hypo-allergenic pillows, water-filled and buckwheat varieties and
even a magnetic therapy pillow, in addition to the hotel's down
pillow, standard in every room. There is no extra charge for using
any of the pillows.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By CORINNE LaBALME  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Amid its human-scale skyline, century-old cafes, pedestrian
streets and lush gardens, Copenhagen still finds room for
contradictions. That's to be expected from a city that nurtured
both Hans Christian Andersen and Soren Kierkegaard.
 &HT;    In a city under constant renewal, two dazzling avant-garde
projects have been completed over the last 12 months: the dramatic
Black Diamond addition to the Royal Library and the shimmering
Danish Design Center. And a 10-mile bridge-and-tunnel connection to
Malmo, Sweden, the Oresund Fixed Link, was inaugurated on July 1.
It ties southern Sweden to the Continent for the first time.
 &HT;    Founded in the 12th century, Copenhagen was nearly destroyed on
several occasions, most notably by a fire in 1795 and the 1807
British bombardments during the Napoleonic wars. Thus, most of the
city's neoclassical architecture dates from the early 19th century,
when Danish arts and letters flourished.
 &HT;    From now through Sept. 10, the city celebrates the achievements
of the years 1800 to 1850 with the biennial Golden Days in
Copenhagen Festival. In conjunction with the festival, the
Copenhagen City Museum (Bymuseum) just unveiled its renovated
Kierkegaard Room, lengthening an already crowded museum roster.
 &HT;    Because many museums and castles have limited hours,
time-conscious visitors often have lunch at the convenient museum
snack bars. Nevertheless, getting to know this city means at least
one break for smoerrebroed _ the open-face Danish sandwiches
generally topped with fresh shrimp, herring or egg _ in a
waterfront cafe in the recently gentrified Nyhavn quarter.
 &HT;    Another essential taste of Copenhagen is found at the enchanting
Tivoli amusement park, open through Sept. 24, with outdoor concerts
and carnival rides.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EVENTS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Golden Days Festival unites 60 cultural institutions in
Copenhagen. Highlights include exhibitions and performances in
historic sites, notably the restaging of Bournonville's romantic
ballet ``Kermesse in Bruges'' at the Royal Theater Aug. 31 and
Sept. 4, 5 and 8. Tickets are $8 to $55, at 8 kroner to the dollar.
Programs are available at www.goldendays.dk/english.
 &HT;    Golden Days maps, in English, found at the tourist information
center near Tivoli at 1 Bernstorffsgade, pinpoint architectural
details like the sober pediments of the Christianborg Palace Chapel
(1826) and the Egyptian ornamentation on the Krystalgade Synagogue
(1833).
 &HT;    The City Museum (Copenhagen Bymuseum), 59 Vesterbrogade, (45) 33
21 07 72, recently inaugurated its expanded Soren Kierkegaard room,
with his books and furnishings, including his desk. Open Wednesday
to Monday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; after Oct. 1 from 1 to 4 p.m.
Admission: $2.50; children free.
 &HT;    ``Symbolism in Danish and European Painting'' opens the fall
season at the Statens Museum for Kunst (Danish National Gallery),
48-50 Solvgade, (45) 33 74 84 94 or www.smk.dk, on Sept. 29,
continuing through Jan. 14. With 80 paintings from 1870 to 1910,
this exhibition includes works by Edvard Munch and the Danish
masters Ejnar Nielsen, Vilhelm Hammershoi and Joakim Skovgaard,
whose ``Christ in the Realm of Death'' has just been restored by
the museum. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Wednesday
(free) until 8 p.m. Admission: $5, $7.50 with the exhibit.
 &HT;    From now to Oct. 17, the Royal Theater, Det Kongelige Teater,
Kongens Nytorv, (45) 33 69 69 69, www.kgl-teater.dk, offers an
intriguing double dance bill with a contemporary ballet
choreographed by the former Paul Taylor star Lila York presented in
tandem with the classic ``Giselle,'' performed by the Royal Danish
Ballet. Tickets: $6.25 to $43.75.
 &HT;    The Danish diva Anne Margrethe Dahl stars in the Royal Theater's
opulent production of Verdi's ``Traviata'' through Sept. 16.
Tickets: $9.50 to $65.60.
 &HT;    The Danish Design Center, 27 H. C. Andersens Blvd., (45) 33 69
33 69, a showcase for the best of Danish and international design
that opened in January, honors the 75th anniversary of the Danish
electronics company Bang &AMP; Olufsen through Sept. 17, with
photographs, early advertising posters and pioneering designs _
including the Bauhaus-inspired Hyperbo 5RG combination radio-record
player from 1934 and a sleek molded Bakelite radio from 1939 _
displayed alongside contemporary designs. Open Monday through
Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekends and holidays 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.;
$3.75.
 &HT;    Royal Copenhagen's headquarters on the Stroget, 6 Amagertorv,
(45) 33 13 71 81, the pedestrian shopping avenue in the center of
town, is also popular. The porcelain firm honors the 225th
anniversary of its signature Blue Fluted pattern with a new line of
historic re-editions, and presents a retrospective exhibition
through Sept. 2. Open Monday to Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday
to 7 p.m., Saturday to 5 p.m., Sunday through September noon to 5
p.m. Free.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SIGHTSEEING
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Despite busloads of camera-toting admirers, the Little Mermaid
appears justifiably disconsolate at being seated in the harbor
across from an oil storage silo on the north edge of town. Nearby,
the relatively unknown Danish Resistance Museum in Churchill Park,
(45) 33 13 77 14, details daily life in Denmark from 1940 to 1945.
Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5
p.m; after Sept. 16 Tuesday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and
Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Free.
 &HT;    The Hirshsprung Collection, 20 Stockholmsgade, (45) 35 42 03 36,
reopened in March after a year's renovation. The collection of
19th-century Danish painting and sculpture that belonged to the
tobacco baron Heinrich Hirshsprung is housed in a
neoclassical-style mansion filled with furniture from the homes and
studios of the artists. Open Thursday to Monday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
and Wednesday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $3; children free.
 &HT;    Fans of the Vikings can begin their Nordic quest at the National
Museum, 10 Ny Vestergade, (45) 33 13 44 11, where runestones,
jewelry, weapons and mummified remains from Viking graves are
displayed with clear English explanations. The delicate Sun Chariot
sculpture is one of the museum's major Bronze Age artifacts. Open
Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $5; children free.
 &HT;    Tivoli, 3 Vesterbrogade, (45) 33 15 10 01, has enchanted
visitors since 1843 with its lavish flower gardens, fanciful
pavilions, rides and numerous restaurants. Two Chinese-inspired
attractions for children _ Dragon Boats and the Panda's Tower _
opened this year. The Valhalla Funhouse and the Viking Ships ride
are much scarier. Open Sunday to Thursday 11 a.m. to midnight,
Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Closes Sept. 24 and reopens
Nov. 17 to Dec. 23. Tickets: $5, children $2.50.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WHERE TO STAY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The conveniently situated 51-room Hotel Danmark, 89 Vester
Voldgade, (45) 33 11 48 06, fax (45) 33 14 36 30, between Tivoli
and the National Museum, offers a friendly welcome and uncluttered,
traditional decor with bold colors. The typically tiny, spotless
bathrooms have built-in hair dryers. The private garage ($9.40 a
day) is a bonus. Doubles: $137.
 &HT;    Near the Amalienborg Palace, the 366-room Copenhagen Admiral
Hotel, 24-28 Toldbodgade, (45) 33 74 14 14, fax (45) 33 74 14 16,
is housed in an 18th-century granary with atmospheric
barrel-vaulted hallways. Harborside rooms offer views of cruise
ships and sailboats. And although rooms derive great charm from
200-year-old rough-hewn pine beams, the landmark wooden
infrastructure means no air-conditioning. Amenities include a
nightclub and sauna. Doubles: $128 to $164.
 &HT;    Budget: A cheerful children's playroom and an enclosed outdoor
patio adjoin the dining room at Ibsen's Hotel, 23 Vendersgade, (45)
33 13 19 13, fax (45) 33 13 19 16, in a residential district near
the lush Botanical Gardens. Most of the 118 rooms display clean,
no-frills Scandinavian design, although top-of-the-line suites have
more ambitious decor and kitchenettes. The generous buffet
breakfast is included in the room price. Doubles: $131 to $156.
 &HT;    Luxury: The gracious Hotel d'Angleterre, 34 Kongens Nytorv, (45)
33 12 00 95, fax (45) 33 12 11 18, was built in 1755 in the Grand
Hotel tradition. Its 124 rooms are decorated in a variety of
styles; some with sumptuous canopy beds with French provincial
textiles. The hotel has two restaurants, Internet access from rooms
and an indoor pool and spa. Doubles: $287 to $449.
 &HT;    While far smaller in its dimensions, the 84-room Nyhavn 71, 71
Nyhavn, (45) 33 43 62 00, fax (45) 33 43 62 01, exudes considerable
antique charm. Its pint-size rooms, with exposed beams and colorful
textiles, are squeezed into an 1804 warehouse on a scenic stretch
of waterfront with views of the old naval base. Work is under way
on a 44-room annex. Doubles: $187 to $224.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WHERE TO EAT
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The sleek, minimalist dining room in the Royal Library's new
Black Diamond wing, 1 Soren Kierkegaards Plads, (45) 33 47 49 49,
which opened in September, offers some of the city's most
sophisticated cuisine. The menu includes grilled catfish paired
with succulent Norwegian lobster and superb smoked Baltic salmon
with dill and scrambled eggs. Waterfront views are sensational at
sunset, so ask for a window table. A three-course dinner for two
with a modest bottle of wine is $113.
 &HT;    In an upscale neighborhood of power brokers and power shoppers,
Cafe Zeze, 20 Ny Ostergade, (45) 33 14 23 90, serves eclectic
European fare, like lamb filets topped with shiitake mushrooms and
an exotic vegetarian pasta laced with coconut cream and hot chili
pepper. While the lunch crowd is mostly suit-and-tie, this
streamlined bistro attracts a younger, cooler clientele after dark.
Dinner and Tuborg for two: $45.
 &HT;    Tourism has tamed the once disreputable Nyhavn waterfront, and
open-air restaurants have ousted tattoo parlors and brothels. At
Nyhavns Faergekro, 5 Nyhavn, (45) 33 15 15 88, the all-you-can-eat
lunch buffet with 10 varieties of Scandinavian herring for $11 is
one of the best seafood bargains in Copenhagen. The famous fish
cakes with remoulade sauce or smoked lamb sandwiches, both $5.60,
also make a fine light lunch. At dinner, there is a fixed-price
two-course menu for $19.
 &HT;    High ceilings and leaded-glass windows lend a lofty look to
Cafeen I Nikolaj, 12 Nikolaj Plads, (45) 33 11 63 13, which serves
down-to-earth Danish fare in a deconsecrated church site. The
creamed seafood chowder is superb, and the classic lunch
combinations of herring, smoked eel, shrimp or salmon tartare never
disappoint. Two for lunch will spend $35. It is open for dinner
from spring to Sept. 2 with an expanded menu that includes steak
tenderloin or lemon sole. Dinner for two with wine: $75.
 &HT;    The Stroget takes its festive ambience from street mimes and
musicians. At Cafe Europa, 1 Amagertorv, (45) 33 12 04 28, the
outdoor tables are tantalizingly close to the Royal Copenhagen and
Georg Jensen showrooms. An oversized Danish sandwich topped with
marinated artichoke, sun-dried tomato, roasted eggplant and fresh
basil costs $8. A glass of wine or beer is $3.50. (No
reservations.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. It looks like another summer has come and gone and I still
haven't learned how to Rollerblade. Help!
</P>
<P>
   A. Here's an idea to get you rolling. If you book an ocean-view
room between September 15 and November 15 at Hotel Casa Del Mar in
Santa Monica, Calif., you'll get complimentary breakfast and a free
hour of inline skating lessons from a professional instructor _ or,
if you prefer, you can choose an hour of fitness work with a
personal trainer. The offer is priced at $399, single or double
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction takes place on the beach in front of this elegant
1920s hotel, which reopened a year ago after a $60 million
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The 129-room Hotel Casa Del Mar, once the grandest of Santa
Monica hotels, has re-emerged as one of the most luxurious on the
West Coast. Near the historic Santa Monica Pier with its antique
carousel and close to excellent dining and shopping, most rooms
have panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean from Palos Verdes to
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's refurbished guest rooms are decorated with bamboo
and wicker furniture and have marble bathrooms. The hotel offers
gourmet dining and a lively bar.
</P>
<P>
   For information or reservations, call (310) 581-5533; website:
www.hotelcasadelmar.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A friend of mine just got ripped off by an unethical tour
company. How can I keep this from happening to me?
</P>
<P>
   A. Two good signs of reliability are the Better Business Bureau
(visit www.bbb.org) and membership in the National Tour Association
(see www.ntaonline.com). Both organizations maintain up-to-date
information and make it easy for you to check out a company.
</P>
<P>
   Another method would be to call the U.S. tourist office for the
country you plan to visit. They can be very helpful in establishing
a tour operator's reputation. Travel agents can also prove
indispensable in finding out if a tour operator has a good track
record.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the company you choose, before you give them a
deposit, ask for a written itinerary that lists all details,
especially what is included and what is not. Also, familiarize
yourself with their refund policy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In passing, I heard someone mention a new play encompassing
the events of the Trojan War but I can't remember where or when it
is playing.
</P>
<P>
   A. You must be referring to ``Tantalus'' _ a 10-hour 30-minute
chronicle of the Trojan war by John Barton, which is making its
world premiere in Denver in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This two-day event is the result of a collaboration between the
Tony-Award winning Denver Center Theater Company and the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   From October 20 through December 3, The Westin Tabor Center,
Denver, is offering a ``Tantalus'' package every weekend, priced at
$905 per couple. This includes two reserved tickets to the
Saturday-Sunday production at The Stage Theater at The Denver
Performing Arts Complex, a three-night stay at The Westin Tabor
Center, Denver, meals served between acts on both days, daily
breakfast at the hotel's restaurant and transportation between the
hotel and theater complex.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, The Westin offers packages in conjunction with the
``Best of Broadway'' series at the Denver Performing Arts Complex.
Show dates and package prices vary.
</P>
<P>
   For package information and reservations, call the The Westin
Tabor Center at (303) 572-9100.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there an easy way for me to get information about Southern
Africa?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, the Regional Tourism Organization of Southern Africa
will send you its official directory, ``The Essence of Africa,''
free of charge. The RETOSA directory contains more than 200 pages
on everything a visitor needs to know about travel in the countries
of Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Included are the 10 best reasons to visit each of these
countries as well as places of interest, activities, climate, entry
requirements, transportation, currency and answers to frequently
asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of ``The Essence of Africa,'' call (212) 286-9300 or
e-mail vhaynesbca(AT)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have recently become interested in the sport of clay
shooting and wish to combine this with my next vacation. How can I
go about this?
</P>
<P>
   A. For marksmen (and women) of all skill levels, The Cloister at
Sea Island, located off the coast of Georgia, is hosting its
first-ever Sporting Clays Championship. The competition will take
place from Nov. 3-5 at the resort's Sea Island Shooting School on
Rainbow Island just south of the Cloister.
</P>
<P>
   The school offers three types of clay target shooting,
customized instruction and superior equipment to help novice and
advanced shooters perfect their skills.
</P>
<P>
   A three-night Sea Island Sporting Clays Championship package at
The Cloister includes luxurious accommodations, three meals daily,
two days of shooting (100 clays per day) on the resort's Sporting
Clays Course, and a reception and awards dinner at the end of the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The package is priced at $130 per person per night double
occupancy or $180 for single occupancy. There is also a $180 per
person registration fee for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Cloister at Sea Island, just an hour from Savannah, is
consistently ranked as one of the world's top resorts, with miles
of private beaches, golf courses, superior dining, tennis and a
seaside spa. For more information call (800) 732-4752; Web site:

 By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM 
 c.2000 Constance Rosenblum 
 From The New York Times 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hidden in a grove of pines on a finger of land overlooking Lake
George in the foothills of the Adirondacks is a shrine to a
remarkable woman. Her lovely musical name was Marcella Sembrich,
and though virtually forgotten today, this Polish-born soprano was
once one of the glories of the operatic stage.
</P>
<P>
   During a career that spanned half a century, she sang all the
big roles, performed with the greats of her day and won nothing but
raves. Critics and fans adored her. At the 1909 gala at the Met
that marked her retirement from opera performances shortly before
she turned 51, ``an audience of monstrous size packed the house to
suffocation,'' a critic for The New York Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
   Gustav Mahler led the orchestra in the march from ``Figaro''
that evening as Sembrich was escorted to a throne and showered with
gifts and rose petals. The event was Page 1 news in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine in question is a doll-sized studio of pink stucco
where Sembrich embarked on a second career as a voice teacher. She
made her summer home in the tiny village of Bolton Landing in 1922,
opened the studio in 1924 and taught there until shortly before her
death in 1935. Two years later, the studio was converted into a
small house museum, and although Sembrich and her acolytes are long
gone, this trove of operatic memorabilia offers a haunting picture
of an extraordinary era.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Bolton Landing appears to be your typical lakeside
tourist center, pleasantly sleepy in comparison with Lake George
village, its slightly raucous neighbor to the south. But the
Sembrich Museum recalls the hamlet's heyday at the turn of the
century. Along with Lake George village, it was a summer haven for
New York's moneyed class, a place where gilded age Knickerbockers
built imposing mansions on pine-scented lakefront, thereby savoring
both incomparable views and the lush comforts of home.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the fine buildings that once lined the lake are gone,
replaced by far less glamorous newcomers. Typical of the upstarts
is the Melody Manor Resort, which sits on property once occupied by
the grandly named Marie Antoinette Villa. Its past occupants
included the millionaire Harry K. Thaw, forever remembered as the
husband of Evelyn Nesbit _ the ``Girl in the Red Velvet Swing'' _
and the man who fatally shot her lover, the architect Stanford
White. All that's left of the place is a stone gatehouse, its
original function long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Of the few historic structures still standing, the bulk are in
private hands and off limits to visitors. For the most part, the
self-directed driving and walking tours suggested by the Town of
Bolton Bicentennial Committee (the town celebrated its 200th
birthday last year) take a visitor past sprawling lawns and
insistently modern structures. With only an occasional granite wall
or rusting wrought-iron gate to suggest what stood long ago, it's a
frustrating but tantalizing, and unexpectedly moving, journey.
</P>
<P>
   From books, photographs and the occasional survivor that has
escaped the wrecking ball, it's possible to piece together a vivid
picture of what life must have been like in what was one of the
most desirable enclaves in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   The best guide to the area is ``The Great and the Gracious on
Millionaires' Row: Lake George in Its Glory'' by Kathryn E. O'Brien
(North Country Books, 1978), a delightfully anecdotal study of the
families who summered along the 10-mile strip between Bolton
Landing and Lake George Village.
</P>
<P>
   As I learned from reading this lavishly illustrated book and by
doing a little discreet trespassing on my own, one of the surviving
splendid buildings is the William K. Bixby mansion on Mohican
Point, just south of the center of town. A spanking white
Colonial-style structure, it was built at the turn of the century
and is still a summer home to descendants of the original family.
</P>
<P>
   The family made its money in railroads, and money was no object
when it came to outfitting its lakefront quarters. Period documents
reveal that a veritable fleet of different types of boats once
departed from its dock and a corps of gardeners tended its
plantings. With its pillars, gables and forest of chimneys, the
Bixby mansion still stands tall, visible from both the road and the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The Bixby family may be best known because Harold Bixby, a son
of William K., provided both the main financial backing and, in a
tip of his hat to his old hometown, the name for Charles
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. Even more interesting, at least to
local school children who get to make shivery visits to the site,
is the stuff about the ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the first Bixby set foot on the property, an Indian
maiden was said to have been burned at the stake near one of the
mansion's locust trees. As the flames shot up, an apparition
swooped down to rescue her, and the blood-red markings on a stone
that sits beneath that same locust is regarded as proof of this
event.
</P>
<P>
   The Sagamore resort lacks a ghost, but has its own stories to
tell. It opened on Green Island, just north of the village center,
in 1883, a great wedding cake ringed with porches. Like virtually
all the lakefront hostelries, it commanded a spectacular view, and
its decorative accents _ massive beams, terra-cotta fireplaces,
gleaming dark woodwork _ did a good deal to conjure up 16th-century
England.
</P>
<P>
   But bad luck seemed part of its fate. In 1893, the Sagamore was
destroyed by fire, and though a year later an even more lavish
hotel rose on the site, the year 1914 brought a second fire, as
devastating as the first. By 1930 a third hotel had been built, the
huge white palace that sits on the island today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Sagamore's checkered history, a sense of its
original grandeur lingers. One afternoon I spent a few hours
wandering through its spacious, high-ceilinged public rooms and
wide, quiet corridors, pretending to be a refugee from an Edith
Wharton novel. It wasn't hard. The crystal chandeliers, the
slow-moving ceiling fans, the plump sofas and wicker chairs, the
potted plants and swags of drapery made me feel as if I were back
in another time. The gentle color scheme of rose and tea and
celadon had a lulling effect.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite stroll took me along a flower-fringed pathway that
led from the back of the hotel down a sloping greensward, at the
foot of which a protected beach has been set up for children. It's
possible to sit off to one side and watch Lake George's signature
steamboats chug across the water as they have since the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Sembrich Museum, Bolton Landing's other notable survivor, is
outwardly less imposing than the Sagamore but even more evocative
of the past, for crammed into this modest cottage is a veritable
history of opera during its golden age. And understandably, for
Sembrich's career spanned some of the richest years of opera.
</P>
<P>
   The singer, whose story is told in an affectionate book called
``A Recollection of Marcella Sembrich'' by H. Goddard Owen (Coneco
Litho Graphics, 1995), was born in 1858 in a hamlet near Lemberg.
She studied piano and violin as a little girl and enjoyed a stellar
early career singing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1877, she married her piano teacher, a man 13 years her
senior with whom she remained through his entire life. (Miss
Sembrich, who had no children, took her mother's name as her
professional name). In 1883, she came to New York and made her
American debut in ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' on the second night of
the Met's first season.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of Sembrich _ a seemingly endless number of them can
be seen in the museum that bears her name _ reveal that she was
adorable, with a mass of dark curls, huge, soulful eyes, and a
winsome smile that kept her looking girlish well beyond her youth.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, she was also a world-class charmer. Henry
Krehbiel, music critic for The New York Tribune, made special
mention of her ``pretty witcheries, graceful coquetries'' and
``captivating ingenuousness.'' But it was the heavenly quality of
her voice and her ability to capture the intellectual and emotional
nuances of the music that lay at the heart of her gift. It was said
that Franz Liszt once instructed the young Sembrich: ``Sing, sing
for the world, for you have the voice of an angel.'' Her dear
friend Brahms added: ``Sembrich has a mind, a heart and a soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone who is not an opera aficionado, the collection
of memorabilia crammed into her museum offers a fascinating window
into a personality and an era. Though modest in size, the place
opens with a bang, with a sumptuous display of Sembrich's costumes
in the little foyer. (As was typical of divas of the day, Sembrich
provided her own wardrobe and routinely traveled with 20 or 30
trunks.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the outfits on view is the gray cloak she wore as Mimi in
``La Boheme,'' a delicious-looking cherry velvet bolero jacket, her
Queen of the Night tiara with moon and stars set against dark blue
velvet from ``The Magic Flute,'' an assortment of fetching bonnets,
fans dripping with feathers and sequins and a great deal of ermine,
lace and embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   The main room, with its beamed ceiling, heavy dark furniture,
Steinway grand piano and Oriental carpets, looks much as it did
when Sembrich instructed her pupils in proper breathing and
intonation.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every inch is crammed with mementos, for there were
few stars of the turn-of-the-century operatic world whose lives did
not touch Sembrich's. There is no end of tributes. From
Rachmaninoff, ``I weave daisies into the crown of Marcella
Sembrich.'' From Edmond Rostand: ``To the nightingale, to the
thrush, to all who excel in song.'' From the conductor Bruno
Walter, ``In thankful remembrance of the most glorious impressions
of my young manhood.'' From Puccini: ``You are the Mimi.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a profusion of scores, letters, telegraphs,
portraits, autographed scores and photographs and programs _ from
Brahms, Liszt, Verdi, Mahler, Toscanini, both Strausses _ the list
is long. And there is a marble bust of the young Beethoven, tribute
wreaths of oak and laurel leaves exquisitely wrought in silver, a
replica of Chopin's death mask, an ostrich fan with a
diamond-studded monogram from the Rothschild family, a loving cup
from Caruso, with whom she performed in ``Rigoletto'' at his Met
debut in 1903, and a miniature model of the Met stage.
</P>
<P>
   A few oddities reveal that she had a life off the operatic
stage, among them a letter from Mark Twain inviting her to his
``doe'' luncheon. (She declined.)
</P>
<P>
   In the sunroom, a bay window offers yet another sweeping view of
the lake, along with a glimpse of the path that winds deeper into
the pines along which Sembrich must have taken many a restorative
walk. In summer, concerts are held in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over this little kingdom is a gentle, soft-spoken man
named Richard Wargo, the resident curator and composer in
residence. As I was strolling through the rooms, alone on a warm
Sunday morning, he played a recording of Sembrich singing the waltz
from ``The Merry Widow.'' With his flick of a switch _ CD, not
Victrola, for Sembrich has been remastered for the modern age _ the
room was flooded with scratchy but deeply suggestive sound. Any
visitor would have paused to savor this eerie, wonderful moment.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Bolton Landing
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   Bolton Landing is 200 miles north of New York City, a four-hour
drive on the New York State Thruway and Interstate 87. Take Exit 22
off I-87 and head north on Route 9N (Lakeshore Drive).
</P>
<P>
   ACCOMMODATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The Sagamore, on Lake George at Bolton Landing, (800) 358-3585,

<P>
   Bolton Landing's main street is lined with a number of friendly,
informal restaurants, many featuring local seafood. Typical is
Frederick's, 4970 Lakeshore Drive, (518) 644-3484, a favorite among
local camp counselors, who congregate there for late-night suppers.
The wraparound porch, which affords a good view of the main street,
is especially pleasant on summer evenings. A dinner for two that
included grilled salmon, linguine marinara, a huge platter of
nachos, a couple of pina coladas and dessert came to $60, including
tip.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    September and Sonoma _ the two go together.
 &HT;    Sonoma County, Calif. though known for its wines, is an
agricultural paradise, with a benign climate year-round. However,
it is especially bountiful in September when apples, corn, figs,
plums, raspberries, strawberries and tomatoes as well as wine
grapes, reach their peak. Along with farm products, roadside stands
overflow with lavender, bonsai, honey, flowers, mustard, herbs,
cheese and bread.
 &HT;    Since surveys confirm that many mature travelers spend their
leisure hours gardening when they aren't traveling, the best part
of visiting Sonoma for some may be going from farm to farm
throughout the county, admiring the ripe produce. And many Sonoma
farmers also sell a tempting array of items made from their
products: apple butter or cider, jams, olive oil, relishes, breads
and fruit-filled pastries.
 &HT;    Sonoma County, 45 miles north of San Francisco, stretches from
the Pacific Ocean on its western edge through inland redwood
forests to the Mayacamas Mountains in the east.
 &HT;    Here, you will find the romance of small-town California_ and
plenty of history. Sonoma was the site of California's northernmost
mission, San Francisco Solano de Sonoma, begun in 1823 when
California was under Mexican rule. (The present church was built in
1840.) And the central plaza in the town of Sonoma is where the
short-lived Bear Flag Revolt against Mexico took place in 1846,
with the insurgents declaring California a republic until U.S.
troops rode in and took over.
 &HT;    History of another sort is here for literary aficionados who can
visit Jack London State Park in Sonoma's Valley of the Moon. A
trail meanders through a forest of oaks and firs to the ruins of
the author-adventurer's lavish four-story mansion, which burned
down one hot August night in 1913, a few weeks before he and his
wife planned to move in. The stone walls, fireplaces and window
openings remain.
 &HT;    In Santa Rosa, the county seat, tourists can visit the home and
gardens of horticulturist Luther Burbank, who lived here for more
than a half-century. Here, he developed more than 800 plant
varieties, including the potato that helped defuse the Irish potato
famine. He called Sonoma, ``the chosen spot of all this earth as
far as nature is concerned.'' The Burbank home is at the corner of
Sonoma and Santa Rosa avenues (707-524-5445).
 &HT;    After leaving the city and traveling along the winding roads of
Sonoma's Farm Trails map (call 800-207-9464 or see
www.farmtrails.org.), mature travelers may find themselves
persuaded to stop at roadside stands to buy tomatoes and apples
that glisten like jewels.
 &HT;    There are also dozens of established stops along the trail, such
as Kozlowski Farms (www.kozlowskifarms.com or 707-887-1587) in
Forestville, a three-generation business now in its 50th year. This
is a good place to pick up an apple pie or any of the other 99
items made there in small batches.
 &HT;    Sonoma's special events are tied closely to food; many center
around farmers markets such as the one in Santa Rosa on Thursday
nights where you can wander from stand to stand sampling the food
and feasting your eyes on the work of county artists and artisans.
 &HT;    Other markets are held in Healdsburg on Tuesdays, Petaluma on
Saturdays, Sebastopol on Sundays and Sonoma on Fridays. Many of
these towns also offer markets on other days, depending on the time
of year. In the fall and winter, you can pick your own pumpkins and
cut your own Christmas trees.
 &HT;    Other food events include the Pumpkin Festival (October) in
Healdsburg, Butter and Egg days in Petaluma (April), the
Gravenstein Apple Fair in Sebastopol (August) and wine tastings and
auctions in many of the romantically named growing regions in the
area.
 &HT;    For those with an interest in cooking, Sonoma County offers a
variety of classes and demonstrations such as those at Ramekins
(707-933-0450 or www.ramekins.com) in the town of Sonoma where the
culinary director, Bob Nemerovski, urges students to ``come
hungry'' since eating is part of experience. The three-hour
demonstrations cost from $35-$65, while hands-on classes in
anything from a Chinese Dim Sum party to Chocolate Showstoppers run
from $50-$80. The Depot Hotel (707-938-2980 or www.depothotel.com),
also in Sonoma, has classes, too.
 &HT;    Sonoma's visiting foodies are not finished after touring a few
farms, festivals and farmers markets. An exciting mix of
restaurants serve Sonoma products with style. Conversation over
breakfast might include an item-by-item review of what each person
ate the night before, and as they rehash yesterday's meals, they
will not fail to compare the wines _ possibly from the county's
more than 190 wineries _ with which they washed down their food.
 &HT;    For more information, contact the Sonoma County Tourism Program
at (800) 576-6662, or visit www.sonomacounty.com on the Web.

 BY TERESE LOEB KREUZER 
 &HT;    (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I first saw Bobby Olivacce one hot December night, walking down
a narrow street in Savan. He had a long dark beard, Rastafarian
dreadlocks, and the gaunt, intense face of an Old Testament
prophet. He was holding a large bunch of wheatgrass.
 &HT;    I was driving through this 200-year-old section of Charlotte
Amalie with my friend, Jacquel Dawson, who pulled over in front of
the high stoop of the Red Ball Grocery Store and introduced us. She
told Bobby I had come to the U.S. Virgin Islands to learn about how
herbs were used to cure and prevent disease, and specifically to
learn about what the old-timers call ``bush medicine,'' _ the use
of herbs that could be plucked from the forest and transformed into
teas, poultices, healing baths and restorative tinctures.
 &HT;    Bobby peered through the open window of Jacquel's battered,
rust-colored Toyota and told me that herbs were his way of life.
 &HT;    ``All Rastafarians are herbalists,'' he said. ``Some know more
than others,'' he added, modestly omitting to mention what Jacquel
later told me, that in the 16 years since he had come to St. Thomas
from his native Dominica, he had become known far and wide as a
healer. Some people consulted him when they were sick, while others
just needed some advice about how to use an herb in their backyard.
Bobby was a sort of roving herb shop, sometimes ministering to as
many as 100 people a day.
 &HT;    There are still many people in the U.S. Virgin Islands who would
rather go to an herbal healer like Bobby than to a medical doctor,
and there are some who go to an herbalist when ``modern'' remedies
have failed.
 &HT;    A rooster crossed the road and two men lounged on a stoop
drinking beer as Bobby said, ``If someone with a cold comes to me
for help, I remind them that the cold has a cause, and the cause is
bad eats and drinks, shallow breathing, laziness and wickedness.''
 &HT;    '' Wickedness?'' I asked.
 &HT;    Bobby smiled slightly. ``Wickedness is a way of life that is
selfish and that affects others adversely.''
 &HT;    As Jacquel and I said good-bye, Bobby invited me to look him up
and ``reason'' with him next time I was in town. I said I would.
 &HT;    Where Bobby comes from _ Dominica _ is still a wild place of
rain forests, farms and small villages. The same can't be said of
the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have been territories of the United
States since 1917. They have a patina of American culture _ cars,
television sets, large resort hotels, housing projects, a love
affair with all that money can buy.
 &HT;    Of the four U.S. Virgins (St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, and
tiny Water Island), St. Thomas in particular has been built up. The
once-quiet streets of Charlotte Amalie, the capital, are often
thronged with tourists who debark from enormous cruise ships by the
thousands. As they scurry to spend their money in the duty-free
shops, the chances are that few suspect that there's another side
to this island. I wouldn't have known, either, if Jacquel hadn't
shown me.
 &HT;    Just a block beyond the end of Main Street's (Droningen Gade's)
shopping strip is the old Market Square. There's been a market here
since the 17th century. In sugar plantation days, this was one of
the places where African slaves were sold when they first came off
the ships.
 &HT;    The Africans brought with them their knowledge of medicinal
herbs and how to contact ancestral spirits. They adapted their
practices to the new world, blending what they knew with what they
learned from the Amerindians.
 &HT;    On Saturdays, beginning at 3 a.m., farmers arrive at the market.
They sell fish, meat, fresh produce and herbs _ black wattle, worry
wine, several kinds of sage, cattle tongue, Spanish needle, bay
leaf, lemongrass and japana _ to name a few.
 &HT;    Some of these herbs will be used in cooking, while others will
be bought strictly for medicinal purposes. Many are herbs that used
to grow profusely in the bush or in people's yards. But life on
these islands began to change around 50 years ago _ at first,
gradually, then drastically. People moved to the states to get jobs
or go to college and never came back. At the same time, there was
an influx of people from other islands _ the Dominican Republic,
Dominica, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, Antigua. Housing was built
to accommodate them. The bush was cut down or cut back. Some plants
that were once common became hard to find or virtually extinct. The
lore that had passed within families from generation to generation
about how to recognize plants and how to use them medicinally was
no longer as widespread as it once was.
 &HT;    This is not to say that the use of bush or an affection for it
disappeared. But it became diluted. Today, for instance, a store
called The Fruit Bowl in the Wheatley Shopping Center in Charlotte
Amalie sells an herb labeled ``Tea Bush.'' It's lemongrass,
certainly one form of tea bush, but only one of scores of herbs
that have traditionally been used to make medicinal tea on these
islands.
 &HT;    One afternoon, Jacquel took me back to Savan to meet Mavis de
Jongh who was born on St. Thomas in 1920. She has a pretty, white
house surrounded by tamarind and flamboyant trees on the edge of
town. Leaning on her cane and looking up at the steep hill dotted
with houses above her dwelling, she says that she remembers when
there was nothing there but trees.
 &HT;    She also remembers that when she was little, bush was used for
all occasions. ``If you had a cold, you were given black wattle. We
took lemongrass for fever, anise for stomach ache, pigeon pea for
abscess in the mouth, Spanish needle to cleanse internally. Bush
teas were used originally to prevent problems and to sustain
health. My grandmother knew what to use.''
 &HT;    Today, Mrs. de Jongh goes to medical doctors, but she still has
bush growing in her yard _ and she knows how to use it if she needs
it.
 &HT;    Mrs. de Jongh's recollections of her childhood are not unusual.
Many people attest to the wisdom of their mothers and grandmothers
who knew what to do for most run-of-the-mill complaints. In more
serious circumstances, they might consult a weedwoman. She was a
respected member of the community with a specialized knowledge of
herbs. She would gather them and sell them in the marketplace,
dispensing not only the herbal remedy, but instructions on how to
use it. She might also serve as a midwife, prescribing herbs to
prepare a woman for birth and administering a bush bath to help her
recover afterward.
 &HT;    The best-known weedwoman in the U.S. Virgin Islands at the
moment is Veronica Gordon, 52, of St. Croix. Her family has lived
on St. Croix for seven generations.
 &HT;    When she was 4 years old, she contracted polio. In the
aftermath, her father, Patrick N. Gordon, a respected herbalist,
``picked a feg of aloe cloves'' which he whipped up with egg
whites. Then he took her down to the sea, dipped her in, anointed
her with the mixture he had prepared, and rubbed her legs.
 &HT;    ``Oh, God, I was sore,'' she remembers. ``But it worked. My legs
were fine. I could climb trees a year later. This was my
introduction to bush medicine.''
 &HT;    Veronica learned about bush medicine from her father, who had
learned from his mother. ``In my family, the knowledge goes from
gender to gender,'' she says. ``It has to be first-born male to the
first-born female.''
 &HT;    Now, as her father did before her, she sees private clients. She
also occasionally gives demonstrations and lectures at the St.
George Village Botanical Garden on St. Croix.
 &HT;    The 16-acre botanical garden, which is set among the ruins of an
old sugar plantation, has more than 1,000 species of trees, vines
and shrubs, including an herb garden devoted just to the plants
that were used historically on the island by the weedwomen _ and
often, still are.
 &HT;    Another St. Croix resident, botanist Olasee Davis, has been
working diligently for years to preserve this knowledge and
transmit it to a younger generation. He writes an ecology column
for a local newspaper and was a major contributor to a book called
``Traditional Medicinal Plants of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St.
John.''
 &HT;    Olasee, an extension specialist with the University of the
Virgin Islands, leads hikes to the wild regions of St. Croix.
Though most visitors never see them, they're not far from the
shopping centers, the Hess Oil refinery and the highway that links
the two major towns _ Christiansted and Frederiksted _ of this
82-square-mile island.
 &HT;    One morning, as he precedes a group of teen-agers from a local
junior high school down the arid, wind-swept beach of Jacks Bay on
the eastern end of St. Croix, he stops every few yards to talk
about another plant.
 &HT;    ``This is inkberry,'' he says, pointing to a shrub with purple
stems and dark green leaves. ``Our grandparents used to crush the
berries for ink.'' He also tells the students that the leaves can
be used to treat thrush, boils and burns.
 &HT;    He shows them how sea grape leaves can be used to make a cup or
a plate and how the stiff twigs of the maran bush can serve as a
toothbrush or a yard broom. He tells them that the leaves of a
common evergreen tree called the starvation apple can be made into
a poultice to treat arthritis, burns, sprains and swelling. He
pauses in front of the familiar, bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers
of the ginger thomas bush (the U.S.V.I.'s national flower) and
mentions that the leaves can be made into a tonic to treat high
blood pressure and diabetes.
 &HT;    Olasee estimates that he hikes with more than 8,000 students a
year, but he also takes off-island visitors on his
``eco-educational tours'' of St. Croix's bays, rain forest, salt
ponds and wetlands.
 &HT;    After meeting Olasee, Veronica and Bobby, I drove around St.
Croix with new awareness. I noticed the women selling homemade
maubi by the side of the road. Bittersweet Maubi, a local beverage
made from bark, is refreshing in this hot climate, and is also said
to ameliorate diabetes, liver problems and diarrhea.
 &HT;    I stopped in Armstrong's ice cream shop on Route 70 and observed
that the flavors included soursop, which comes from a tree whose
leaves are made into a sleep-inducing tea.
 &HT;    I went into the Pueblo supermarket where I bought sorrel (said
to be helpful for kidney and bladder ailments), senna (a mild
laxative) and eucalyptus leaves (to make a tea that relieves colds
and fevers).
 &HT;    And I thought about something that Olasee had told the children.
``In nature, everything has a function,'' he had said. ``There are
no weeds.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Monday, readings soared past 100 degrees once again from Kansas
to northern Texas. The hot high-pressure system that has suppressed
cloud cover and prompted the excessive heat will hold steady
Tuesday. As a result, record high temperatures will likely be
broken in a few places. Farther north, a cool front intercepting
the hot air will initiate isolated afternoon thunderstorms from
Nebraska to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Converging streams of humid air will set the stage for numerous
showers and storms in the Southwest. Rapid runoff of water from the
storms will result in localized flash flooding.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of dry air will accompany high pressure in New England
while farther south, onshore winds will bring clouds and spotty
showers to the Middle Atlantic states. Elsewhere, the Great Lakes
will be warm with some thundershowers in central sections.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RIPE FOR RAIN
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, torrential rain fell in parts of the Southwest
and Northeast. The excessive rain flooded homes in Arizona and
carried away cars in northern New Jersey. Late summer and early
autumn is a time when the atmosphere is ripe for rain. By the end
of August, the temperature and evaporation rates from the waterways
bordering the nation are peaking, assuring high concentrations of
water vapor in the air. Furthermore, the still potent late summer
sun provides the energy required to initiate updrafts of humid air,
which are the precursors of tall cumulus clouds and torrential
rain.

 &HT;     RICH v. NOT-RICH  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush responded to Al Gore's scrappy
acceptance speech vowing to fight for ``working families'' by
accusing Gore of waging ``class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrors. Take that, Gore. Bush really nailed you for a terrible
sin, defending the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't this what politics is all about _ a struggle for
primacy among competing social and economic interests? What exactly
is Bush's squawk, except that Gore is giving him a scare he didn't
expect?
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have tailored their appeals to specific
income levels whether they admit it publicly or not. Using a
pejorative term such as ``class warfare,'' designed to conjure up
divisive, threatening images, is a dishonest tactic meant to
override legitimate political differences over who gets what share
of the economic pie.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Gore's surprisingly effective acceptance speech at
the Democratic National Convention, his Republican rival, Bush,
complained that Gore's pitch to working waitresses and
middle-income folks was ``the rhetoric of the past. That's class
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   This theme is already being recycled by GOP surrogates. A
rejected Bush vice presidential hopeful, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,
scoffed in a Sunday television interview that warnings about Bush's
massive tax cut plan were nothing but ``class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and many tax experts point out that the whopping Bush
plan heavily benefits the rich, providing 37 percent of its charms
for the wealthiest 1 percent of the nation. That leaves mere crumbs
for the rest of us and drains the federal surplus so that not much
will be left to pay down the debt and bolster Medicare and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich says: ``You don't punish people when they are
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if that isn't waging warfare at the expense of others on
behalf of the already financially well-rewarded upper crust, what
is it? Since even a federal budget with a surplus has finite
limits, the inevitable consequence of the Bush-Kasich approach is
punishing people when they are NOT successful or not VERY
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me, but can't the rich stand up for themselves? The rest
of us need somebody to stand up for us, and there's nothing wrong
with Gore trying to do that. Fairness, after all, is a principle
worth fighting for, and it doesn't hurt politically if it benefits
a majority who can determine an election.
</P>
<P>
   Class warfare, in one guise or another, is always with us. It
will exist so long as some executives get $35 million retirement
benefits from their companies and other employees barely scrape by
with the $5.15 minimum hourly wage.
</P>
<P>
   But by resurrecting that polarizing cry, it is Bush, not Gore,
who is indulging in the rhetoric of the past, repeating the themes
of President George Bush's political generation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican class preferences happen to be just as marked as
Democratic ones, merely more upscale and elitist. Guess which
financial level is most helped or least hurt by Bush's top-heavy
tax cuts, opposition to raising the minimum wage, support for
ending taxes on estates over $1 million, plan to subsidize private
schools with vouchers, willingness to toss Social Security benefits
into Wall Street wallets and resistance to specific prescription
drug benefits?
</P>
<P>
   Gore has targeted a different economic group. He is focusing on
benefits for ordinary non-rich families _ child care credits for
working mothers, public school assistance, low-income savings
accounts and continued economic growth through paying down the
federal debt while shoring up Medicare and Social Security, the
lifelines for millions of middle class seniors.
</P>
<P>
   During the lavish social era of Ronald Reagan, Republicans
justified their preferential treatment of what they called ``the
most productive among us'' by painting the non-rich as jealous
losers who wanted to ``redistribute'' wealth. The crime of the
middle class was described as accepting handouts in the form of
college aid, Medicare and other benefits from government
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   This fakery worked fairly well so long as Reagan papered over
his policies with a friendly smile and Democratic control of
Congress kept the middle class reasonably protected. But it won't
work again. Real issues are involved here, and Gore's decision to
be specific about them will eventually mean that Bush has to drop
the tired old slogans and deal with them as well.

BELICHICK STAMP ON PATRIOTS INCREASINGLY APPARENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Throughout preseason _ and especially the
past two days _ Bill Belichick, the Patriots' de facto director of
player personnel, has been set into action. Only a few
administrative superstars are able to wear many hats and wear them
all well. Sometimes one doesn't fit quite right. Just ask Rick
Pitino, the Celtics' president and head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year or two, Belichick, like Pitino, will be under
a microscope. His coaching and personnel decisions will be analyzed
and dissected. Most Patriots fans, and certainly owner Bob Kraft,
wanted a return to one boss after the head coach/personnel director
system didn't work out in the Pete Carroll/Bobby Grier era.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Belichick, like Pitino, will have a grace period, just
as Carroll and Grier did. There's no sense overanalyzing the
decision to drop Sean Morey and keep Dane Looker, or debating
whether dumping Ben Coates and picking up Eric Bjornson was wise.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots haven't played a game under Belichick yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in looking over the past few months, some interesting things
have become apparent about Belichick and his capable young
assistant, Scott Pioli.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Belichick hasn't been afraid to sign them, draft them,
then cut them. He drafted 10 players, and four of them _ tight end
Dave Stachelski, linebacker Casey Tisdale, defensive tackle Jeff
Marriott, and running back Patrick Pass _ are gone.
</P>
<P>
   If any draft pick can be second-guessed, it might be Stachelski,
who was chosen in the fifth round as a possible heir apparent to
Coates. While some teams knew there were problems surrounding
Stachelski's mindset, the Patriots evidently ignored them and
drafted him anyway. Stachelski also was cut by New Orleans, which
picked him up after he left New England.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's first pick, Adrian Klemm, drafted in the second
round out of Hawaii, was injured early in rookie orientation camp
and hasn't practiced since. On Sunday, he was placed on the
physically unable to perform list, meaning he'll miss at least six
weeks, but Belichick thinks he will play before the year is over.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick isn't shy about having free agent rookies on the
roster; there are seven of them. One is Josh Rawlings, a
6-foot-3-inch, 306-pound offensive lineman who had been in Kansas
City's camp. The Patriots watched him for a quarter, and he made
the team. Adam Davis, a rookie from Oklahoma State, will be a
backup guard, and Lonie Paxton of Sacramento State was kept as a
long snapper.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the free-agent process, the Patriots cut long
snapper/backup tight end Mike Bartrum, who not only did his job
well but could have protected the Patriots at a shallow position.
But the Patriots had Lance Scott in mind, and now Scott is on
injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The roster choices were bold. Four quarterbacks? That's unusual.
Two tight ends? Most teams carry three, maybe four. Two halfbacks?
Some teams carry five. Five linebackers? Some carry eight.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick signed defensive Jon Harris, a former No. 1 draft
pick, but cut him after one minicamp. Belichick decided he didn't
fit his scheme. Raymont Harris was the No. 1 back for most of camp,
but after five exhibition games, he is loking for work.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting his losses is not a difficult task for Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   He dumped Vincent Brisby, feeling Tony Simmons had surpassed him
and Brisby had slowed. He then signed 32-year-old Chris Calloway,
dumped Sean Morey, and retained a pair of rookie free agents,
Shockmain Davis and Dane Looker, trading a sixth-round pick to the
St. Louis Rams for Looker.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick dumped Coates, Bruce Armstrong (who came back at a
reduced price), and Zefross Moss, and didn't re-sign Steve Israel,
Shawn Jefferson, Terry Allen, Chris Sullivan, and Marty Moore.
Antonio Langham replaced Israel, who is out for the season in New
Orleans with a broken leg; Sullivan has been replaced by journeyman
Bobby Hamilton, who rarely saw the field with the Jets last year;
and fourth-round pick Greg Robinson-Randall has replaced Moss, who
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Belichick kept players who fit into his system and
weeded out the ones who don't. After initial resistance, he moved
Tebucky Jones from cornerback to free safety and seems to have
found the physical player at that position who fits his system. If
he is accused of cutting Carroll's guys, he can always point to
Jones. On the other hand, he did cut Carroll's starter at free
safety, Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick brought back familiar cornerbacks in Langham and Otis
Smith, a familiar linebacker in Rob Holmberg. He signed veteran
linebacker Chad Cascadden, then realized Cascadden was all done and
announced he had retired.
</P>
<P>
   He signed Scott, who at the time was recovering from an injury.
Scott missed all of training camp, then played sparingly the past
two weeks. Now he's gone for the season with a foot injury suffered
in the Carolina game, and it appears that Scott's agent, Tony
Agnone, is about to begin work on an injury settlement with the
Patriots that would release Scott from his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick allocated five players to NFL Europe _ Morey, Marc
Megna, Noel Scarlett, Garrett Johnson, and Ed Ellis _ and cut them
all.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Belichick has quickly put his stamp on the team.
Salary cap money has been scarce, so he's had to do it as
economically as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In two or three years, will Belichick's teams get farther than
Carroll's did? Will they be better than 8-8, the low point of the
Carroll regime?
</P>
<P>
   Poor drafts in two of the last three years have set the Patriots
back, but Belichick did not inherit a disaster. He inherited a .500
team that was in the Super Bowl four years ago. The Patriots never
hit rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Will Belichick create a team that must take a step back before
it can go forward? Pitino certainly stared that very scenario in
the eye when he took over for M.L. Carr. Now, the focus is on what
Belichick does with his opportunity as player personnel director.

up speed as it navigated a slippery slope. Jeff Quinney's putt was
on line, but James Driscoll never once looked at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching him to see what he was doing,'' said Driscoll,
``because usually you can tell just by watching the guy if he
thinks he's made it or not. And his eyes were getting a little
bigger when it was getting near the hole. I was like, `Oh, man,
this is going in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dead center, from 30-35 feet. A birdie on the par-3 third hole
at Baltusrol Golf Club Monday morning that put an end to the 100th
US Amateur championship. In his bid to become the first
Massachusetts-born winner of this tournament since 1956, Driscoll,
of Brookline, Mass., was halted in a stunning calmness that was in
contrast to the wild drama that he had produced late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose, you lose,'' said Driscoll, 22, when asked if getting
beaten by a birdie _ and not losing via a bogey _ was any
consolation. ``But at the same time, it's a much better way to end
it like that. It's more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   It was minutes after the sudden defeat, and Driscoll was trying
to sort out his feelings. So much had happened since early Sunday
evening that he had a dozen different emotions tugging at him. He
had authored a stirring comeback, winning the final three holes
Sunday to erase a three-hole deficit and force a playoff with
Quinney, 21, and he wanted nothing more than to finish the match
that night. But Mother Nature rudely interrupted. Lightning forcing
a suspension in play after two playoff holes had been halved in
pars. So back he and Quinney trudged for a 9 a.m. resumption at
their 39th hole, the par-3 third.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll had gone to bed Sunday night with visions of the 5-iron
he would swing first thing in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' he said. ``A full 5-iron for me is 205. That's
exactly what it was to the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven times (five pars, one birdie, one bogey) during the
match-play portion of match play Driscoll had played this downhill
hole, so he knew the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That green is pretty forgiving if you're on the right side,''
he said. ``It's going to come down a little bit, even as wet as it
was. I was going middle of the green, trying to draw it.''
</P>
<P>
   The air was heavy, thick with humidity, so Driscoll told himself
to swing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave anything in the bag in the swing,'' he said.
But he pushed the shot slightly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``On another day, that same shot would have kicked down, ridden
the slope and been close,'' said Scott Fischer, a Baltusrol caddie
who was working for Driscoll for the 10th straight day, dating back
to practice rounds before this weeklong event had started.
``Unfortunately, it was wet and didn't come left.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it stayed in the rough, a yard off the green, 50-55
feet from the pin. Advantage Quinney, the Arizona State senior who
had led this 36-hole finale from the opening hole until Driscoll
staged his three-hole theatrics to pull even.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's about a half-club ahead of me usually,'' said Quinney,
who chose 4-iron and knew that his opponent had gone a little long
and right, in the rough. Just put it on the green, he said to
himself, with a smooth swing.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll knew Quinney wouldn't have an easy putt but quickly
turned his attention to his own chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pretty good lie,'' said Driscoll. ``It wasn't sitting down,
but it was a lot faster than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   It ran some 12 feet past the hole, coming to rest inches off the
green, and Driscoll just stared and stared at the line he faced to
save par. The matter, for the moment, was out of his hands. It
never returned to him, for Quinney's putt _ just the fourth stroke
in the resumption of play _ tracked the bottom of the cup all the
way. It was the first birdie Quinney had made in 22 holes, dating
back to the 17th hole of the morning 18 Sunday, and standing to the
side of the green, a father was overcome with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed a lay-in with 10 seconds to go in the high school
basketball championship (of Oregon), and that haunts me to this
day,'' said Bob Quinney, Jeff's father. ``I worried about Jeff
being remembered for losing a three-shot lead with three holes to
play. Now, he's erased that and that makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing nearby, Driscoll accepted congratulations from his
father Richard, his mother Rosemary, five brothers, a sister, and
countless cousins and friends, some of whom had left the Boston
area at 3 a.m. to get there in time for the resumption of the
playoff. The support, he said, was overwhelming, but quickly the
questions turned to his future plans. Originally, Driscoll had
talked of turning pro in time for next month's New England Open,
then going to PGA Tour Qualifying School.
</P>
<P>
   Now? He isn't so sure. With his runner-up finish at the US
Amateur, Driscoll earns a spot in the Masters field next April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have to wait and play in the Masters,'' he said.
``Who doesn't do that? I mean, I think I'd be stupid not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Driscoll stood just outside the large crowd that
gathered at the third green. Quinney was being presented the
winning trophy, and it was noted that Driscoll joined illustrious
company: None other than Bobby Jones had finished as US Amateur
runner-up at Baltusrol in 1926. Though his son had not become the
first Massachusetts winner since another Charles River golfer 54
years ago _ Ted Bishop _ Richard Driscoll couldn't stop smiling and
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be disappointed,'' he said. ``We had such a great
week. Just the thrill of it.''

<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ Science often rests on chance discoveries. So it
is that an American archaeologist studying the origins of Venice
has stumbled on clues suggesting that a multibillion-dollar plan to
build floodgates to save the city from rising waters is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful,'' Dr. Albert J. Ammerman warned as he pulled a
tarp from an archaeological dig, freeing swarms of mud wasps.
</P>
<P>
   The pit, 10 feet deep and more than 30 feet wide, had been dug
next to an ancient basilica. The hole was below sea level, with a
pump keeping it from filling with water. At its bottom lay one of
the oldest known pieces of evidence of human habitation in the
Venetian archipelago _ a stone walkway dated to around the second
century.
</P>
<P>
   This and kindred discoveries show that, over the ages, people
living here have had to haul in countless tons of dirt, silt, wood
and stone to fortify their swampy isles and keep them from
disappearing into the sea. They suggest that the floodgates plan _
one of the biggest public works projects of all time _ will be an
inadequate solution rife with problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see this to understand how the ground builds up,''
said Ammerman, a Colgate University archaeologist who has studied
the origins of Venice for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   That the city of Venice rests on millions of wooden stilts
pounded into marshy ground is well known. But the age and
surprising abundance of other supporting materials is only now
coming to light, with large implications for public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The lost world of artifacts and structures is letting Ammerman
and his colleagues in Italy and the United States estimate both
past and future rates of subsidence. The news is bad for a city
whose famous piazzas already flood with alarming regularity.
</P>
<P>
   For complex reasons, scientists say, Venice is sinking faster
than ever and in the coming century the encroaching waters of the
Adriatic Sea could devastate this celebrated city of art and
architectural gems. The situation will only get worse if global
warming causes sea levels to rise.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they say, surging waters will overwhelm the main way
Italy is planning to fight the danger _ 79 mobile floodgates meant
to cut off the Venetian lagoon and its islands from the highest of
the high tides. The plan, drawn up decades ago and debated since
then, is on the verge of approval by the Italian government. It is
estimated to cost $2 billion to $4 billion, and has won backing
from Italian companies eager for lucrative contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Ammerman, 58, a walking encyclopedia about things Venetian, has
decided to air his findings widely in hopes of thwarting the
project and spurring research on alternative ways of saving Venice,
a cultural icon that 10 million people visit each year. It is also
his home.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile floodgates ``will have ceased to offer any
protection'' from extreme tides soon after they are built, he wrote
last week in the journal Science. Saving the city will take fresh
thinking, he added, perhaps through an international competition
for new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a test case for the future,'' said Charles E. McClennen,
a Colgate geologist who aids Ammerman's inquiries here and who
collaborated on the Science article. ``We got into this research by
accident. But now we see its general importance for cities in many
coastal regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammerman's work is financed by Colgate, the Delmas Foundation,
the Kress Foundation and the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   That Venetians live a few precarious inches above sea level is
evident to any visitor to this city of interconnected islands.
</P>
<P>
   Its canals teem not only with gondolas and motorboats but fish
large and small, as well as algae and seaweed. On hot summer days,
the canals at low tide tend to give off a pungent odor said to be
based partly on decomposing sea life and partly on the outflows of
ancient plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the tides here go up and down about three feet. Tides
that are more extreme, known as ``acqua alta,'' or high water, tend
to occur between October and April and periodically inundate
Venice, most alarmingly in 1966 when flooding caused wide damage
and economic losses. The tidal surges are driven by heavy rains,
winter weather patterns and southerly winds that blow Adriatic
waters northward.
</P>
<P>
   On many old buildings, the red bricks of the ground floors are
coated by a patina of white _ corrosive sea salt soaked up by the
absorbent bricks, which weakens them and causes them to crumble.
Low wooden doors are often stained or rotted away at the bottom
because of past flooding, and commercial shop doors in fashionable
districts often have metal guides that allow the quick installation
of waterproof gates. Raised walkways are set up in heavily traveled
areas during winter floods. Some tour books recommend high boots.
</P>
<P>
   It was sheer accident that Ammerman came to delve into the
origins of Venice, and that his work opened a new window on the
dimensions of the flooding menace.
</P>
<P>
   An environmental archaeologist trained at the University of
London, he worked in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s studying sites
around Parma, Calabria and Rome, including the Forum. A specialty
of his was extracting core samples and dating materials to better
understand the original context of ancient objects and monuments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Ammerman was living in Venice, happy to have a break
from Rome's gritty bustle, when Dr. Maurizia de Min, a senior
archaeologist at Venice's Superintendency of Monuments, asked him
for help. She was helping restore a church, San Lorenzo, and wanted
him to probe beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit stuff three feet down, five feet below mean modern sea
level,'' he recalled. ``We hit archaeological things. We moved
lower. It was always the same _ layers of living and building
materials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the turning point,'' Ammerman said. ``We started to
realize that there was a whole world down there that no one had
ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians had long known that Venice rose to power in the ninth
century, its swampy isolation a bulwark against invaders, its
location on the Adriatic a boon for trade. But the scientists
managed to discover its lost infancy, going back in time more than
500 years further.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1990s, working closely with de Min and the
Superintendency of Monuments, Ammerman investigated six sites in
Venice and its lagoon. Each proved a revelation about past
habitation and building practices, the evidence always surprisingly
deep and speaking volumes about subsidence rates over the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The most extensive dig was on the isle of Torcello, next to the
ancient basilica.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit there, Ammerman stepped carefully into the
deep pit where the scientists had uncovered the low stone walkway
dated to the second century. Higher up, and thus younger, he
pointed out a stone hearth, dated to the sixth century, and a road
surface made of aligned stones, dated to about the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   A major breakthrough in his work was understanding that the
depth of such artifacts could yield a way to gauge old sea levels,
and thus the rate of ground subsidence over the centuries. For
instance, Ammerman found that the second-century walkway, probably
of Roman origin, had been erected near the edge of the island about
18 inches above what was then the sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Back at his apartment in Venice, he displayed a long, clear
plastic tube filled with a deep core sample recently taken from
below the walkway area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells you these sediments are typical of a marsh
island,'' he said, pointing to streaks of brown and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of such samples and depth calculations have revealed the
arc of accelerating subsidence since the Venetian lagoon formed
6,000 years ago. Ammerman calculates that, per century, human
artifacts sank at a rate of about three inches, then five, then 10,
with the fastest decline in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the speedup are complex, he said. Factors include
local industry's pumping of water from beneath the Venice region
(which has been stopped), the oxidation of peat that forms as part
of the substrate, the compaction of spongy sediments under the
growing weight of buildings, and slow changes in plate tectonics
and the region's geology.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, Ammerman, McClennen, de Min and Dr. Rupert Housley
of the University of Glasgow published an overview of their speedup
findings in Antiquity, a top archaeology journal.
</P>
<P>
   It was this research that led Ammerman to conclude that Italy's
main solution to the flooding problem would not work because it was
based on flawed estimates of the subsidence rate.
</P>
<P>
   The floodgates, he reasoned, would have to close 94 to 150 times
each year during high tides, destroying the lagoon's delicate
ecological balance, cutting it off from the sea and its cleansing
flows.
</P>
<P>
   The floodgates would be built in lines at the entrances to the
Venetian lagoon. Lying flat in housings built into the seabed, they
would in theory have no effect on shipping or regular tides. When
storm surges were forecast, compressed air would be pumped into
their hollow inner cavities, forcing out water and causing the
hinged gates to tilt upward and rise to the surface to block
incoming swells.
</P>
<P>
   Since the worst tides come mostly in winter, Ammerman and
McClennen wrote last week in Science, gate closure ``will end up
taking place repeatedly, day after day and week after week.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the plan are unmoved, saying Ammerman is
exaggerating the difficulties. Anyway, they say, if the water rises
faster than expected, as Ammerman says it will, the barriers are
all the more crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gates become even more urgent if the worst scenarios are
right,'' said Dr. Rafael L. Bras, an environmental engineer at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who led an international
assessment of the floodgate plan.
</P>
<P>
   But in all likelihood, he said, the gates would have to close
far less often than Ammerman foresees and would do little or no
ecological harm.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Bras said he was saddened to see
Ammerman's paper in Science. ``I think his article will just
continue the debate and, in the meantime, nothing is done and the
city is in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consorzio Venezia Nuova, the bloc of Italian companies eager
to build the floodgates, denounced the Colgate researchers as
``clearly less concerned with the validity of scientific data than
they are with attempting to persuade the Italian government to
withdraw the concession granted to Italian construction
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   John Keahey, a journalist working on a book about saving Venice,
said Ammerman's arguments were ``having a big impact'' on Italian
politicians. ``They could use this as an excuse to delay a
decision,'' Keahey said. ``The government is in a struggle to
survive, they would probably rather use the money to give the
citizens a tax break.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammerman said the Consorzio would rather attack him than face
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants a silver bullet,'' he said. ``But that doesn't
exist,'' at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Something may emerge in an international competition, he said.
But in the meantime, Venice needs to continue what it has already
started: raising canals and sidewalks, elevating power supplies and
telephone lines and moving people out of the first floors of
residences.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should do what people have always done here since the
beginning, which is to build up the ground,'' Ammerman added.
``This buys you time to work up a better solution that doesn't
create equally bad problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A rise in key spots of just a few inches, he said, could buy
Venice a half century of breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have lots of time,'' Ammerman said.

ALIEN EARTHWORMS' OFFSPRING THRIVE, AND ALTER SOIL, IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Hawaii)  (The Science Times) 
 By SAM HOOPER SAMUELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anglers take note: The night crawler at the end of your hook is
an invader. According to recent research by an earthworm ecologist,
you could dig up approximately the upper half of the North American
continent and almost never find an earthworm of true North American
descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, anything you can buy in a bait store in most of the
country is European,'' said the ecologist, Dr. Sam James, a
professor of life sciences at Maharishi University of Management in
Fairfield, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have a term for many species that wander into
nonnative territory and prosper: weeds. The area in question, which
includes Canada, New England, some mid-Atlantic states, and much of
the upper Midwest, is entirely populated by weed earthworms. The
rest of the continent contains a mixture of weeds and native
earthworm species.
</P>
<P>
   The dividing line begins on the east coast in New Jersey, at
about 40 degrees latitude, then snakes its way westward, dipping a
few degrees south in the Midwest, then rising to just below 50
degrees latitude as it makes its way to the Pacific in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look along that line,'' said James. ``That's where the last
glaciation stopped, the furthest advance of the ice in the last
glacial period, which was 15,000 to 20,000 years ago. To the north
of it, you generally don't find native earthworm species. To the
south, you can find them.''
</P>
<P>
   During that last period of glaciation, when areas that are now
temperate were covered with vast sheets of ice, earthworms were
among many of the creatures that were wiped out, he explained. For
some distance below that line, permafrost set in and pushed the
earthworms even farther south. In the 150 to 200 centuries that
followed, they simply have not made their way back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthworms have been very slowly diffusing over the north,''
James said. ``They aren't like an organism that can look over the
rise of the next hill. They can't disperse like trees. They are
way, way behind.''
</P>
<P>
   James found support for his earthworm findings, which have not
been published, in a Dutch study that measured the speed at which
earthworm populations enlarge their territory. The Dutch
researchers placed earthworm colonies in a field that was free of
worms. After one year, the colonies had radiated outward by about
10 meters _ 32 feet _ in each direction. The worms were a European
variety, and especially good colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take 10 meters per year as a high-speed earthworm
infiltration, and multiply that by 20,000 years, it's not very
much,'' James said. ``It's 200 kilometers, or about 120 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   That means it has taken the native earthworms of North America
more than the entire duration of human history to expand their
territory by the length of a small state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are earthworms north of the line, and James has
identified them as European and Asian immigrants. These were
brought inadvertently by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the horticultural trade,'' said James. ``People moved
trees, probably in the colonial period, by bringing tubs of trees
with them. Plants were moved in their soil: apples, rosebushes, any
woody plant. Lilacs were probably brought over in pots.''
</P>
<P>
   And along with the soil came earthworms.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists have long known that invader species of
earthworms exist in North America, James is the first to find that
native worms were absent north of the line of glaciation.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Debinski, an associate professor of animal ecology at Iowa
State University who specializes in biodiversity studies of
vertebrates and invertebrates, said: ``This is news because there
are so few people who study invertebrates that are not pest
species. There are a lot of taxonomic groups that are not studied
because they are not perceived as being of value to humans. So I'm
not surprised that we didn't know this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Worms are such poor travelers that their presence or absence in
an area can be used to tell geological history. ``They're
indicators of plate tectonic movement,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, worms can be used as markers to track the
excruciatingly slow drift of land masses. Geologists know, for
example, that the island of Puerto Rico was once in the Pacific and
passed between North and South America en route to its present
location in the Caribbean. James is confident that the island
touched what is now Colombia along its way, because of the
similarity of Puerto Rican earthworms to Colombian earthworms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group of earthworms on Puerto Rico must have arrived on
ancient Puerto Rico by ancient Puerto Rico coming into contact with
ancient Colombia,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme of things, what difference does it make
whether alien worms are on American soil? A lot, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the invasion is still in progress. There are
still some areas that have no earthworms. And there, the gradual
penetration of alien worms is having a profound effect on the soil
structure.
</P>
<P>
   In a wooded area with worms, the ground is covered by a thin
layer of the previous year's fallen leaves. Below that is a
potting-soil-like mixture left behind by worms that have eaten
those leaves and passed finely broken-down organic matter. But in
worm-free zones, like those in Michigan or Minnesota, that layer of
leaf litter is much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a good four inches thick, and it gets
progressively older as you get deeper,'' James said. ``If you walk
out to where the earthworms haven't penetrated and you kick aside
leaves, you just find more leaves. Then you can't kick them because
of fungi and tree roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can cut out almost a block of tree litter. And there are
various organisms that live in this mat of leaves that are probably
very important for decomposing them.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the worms move in, they devour that leaf litter and
alter the landscape below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   While that may sound like a minor environmental event,
ecologists are always wary when human intervention, such as the
inadvertent transfer of earthworms, changes the balance of nature.
In Hawaii, for example, an earthworm invasion is having a
devastating effect. ``Hawaii has been historically earthworm free,
because of its isolation,'' said James.
</P>
<P>
   But Hawaii has drawn human settlers from all parts of the globe.
With people came plants, and with plants, worms. ``It has now got a
vast diversity of introduced tropical and European earthworms,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This might not have made a major difference, except that Hawaii
is also populated by another species introduced by humans: pigs,
which now run wild.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs preceded the worms. They made an easy living in the
Hawaiian woods, finding enough food on the ground that they did
little rooting below the surface. Once the worms arrived, though,
the pigs developed a taste for them and are now tearing up the
remaining natural forest in search of worms.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Iowa has placed James in an especially good position
to observe the North American invasion, since the line of
glaciation passes through the state.
</P>
<P>
   But in his travels, he has mapped worm distribution throughout
the islands of the Caribbean, found European earthworms at 2,000
meters elevation in Costa Rica, and spotted a South American
species in the Los Angeles basin.
</P>
<P>
   His next project: an earthworm survey of the Philippines, to be
paid for by a National Science Foundation grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an earthworm invasion going on in the scenic rice
terraces in the mountains of the Philippines,'' James said.
``They're making Swiss cheese of their mountains.''

   Wrinkles rock.
</P>
<P>
   These days, not only does wisdom come with age, so do sex appeal
and confidence. The media and pop culture _ hand in hand, like king
and queen _ have ruled that aging ain't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   And with millions of baby boomers chiming in, images of older
adults on television, in movies and in advertisements promise to
blend getting older with getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``While historically the definition of the old has been made by
the young, this media-savvy generation will not feed their own
identities to the aristocracy of youth,'' said Robert Thompson,
professor of television, radio and film at Syracuse University.
``The image of a baby boomer driving in the fast lane with his left
turn signal on will be portrayed in the future by Stallone and
Schwarzenegger _ and it will be a cool thing to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger _ Rocky
and the Terminator of film fame _ are both in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Every minute, seven Americans turn 50, according to American
Demographics magazine, which estimates that rate will continue
until 2014. Of the baby boom generation, that tidal wave of people
born during postwar prosperity from 1946 to 1964, the oldest
children are 54 this year and the youngest turn 36.
</P>
<P>
   Neville Strumpf, professor of gerontologic nursing at the
University of Pennsylvania, said medical advances and changing
attitudes among older adults about fitness are pushing the old-age
threshold forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a group of people who are going to reshape their world by
virtue of who they are and what they understand themselves to be,''
said Strumpf, 53. ``Old age doesn't look the way it did when my
grandparents were around.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in the movies, on television and anywhere else image
is cultivated, what's sexy and cool hasn't been exclusively the
domain of the young.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson, at age 51, shook down the bad guys as a
leather clad, smooth-talkin' reincarnation of the suave-and-funky
1970s detective Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood, at 70, kissed the sky with three other graying
bad boys _ Tommy Lee Jones, 53, Donald Sutherland, 66, and James
Garner, 72 _ in ``Space Cowboys.'' And in another
old-guys-kick-butt film released in late August, Burt Reynolds, 64,
and Richard Dreyfuss, 52, dust off their guns for one more mobster
scheme in ``The Crew.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, Regis Philbin, 66 and sleek with his shimmery
jackets and matching ties, is hotter than ever, dramatically
prodding contestants on NBC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
and 76-year-old Bob Barker is still spinning the money wheel with
style on CBS' ``Price is Right'' after 28 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In CBS' outrageously popular summer series ``Survivor,'' retired
Navy SEAL Rudy Boesch outlasted many of his younger tribal rivals
to make it to the final four at age 72. On the TNT cable network in
August, Faye Dunaway, 59, played a stylish and outspoken senator's
wife in ``Running Mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Music has long cherished its classic rockers. Carlos Santana,
53, resumes touring in September to promote his ``Supernatural''
album, a blend of Latin rhythm, rock and hip-hop that grabbed nine
Grammys last year. Another Grammy winner, leggy Tina Turner, is
shaking her groove thing on tour in tight capri pants and dresses
cut above the knee at age 61.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of beauty, women in their 40s and beyond have
maintained their sex symbol status. The long and elegant Iman, 45,
who oversees IMAN Cosmetics for women of all shades of brown,
recently announced the Aug. 15 birth of her daughter with husband
and rock legend, David Bowie, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Husky-voiced Lauren Hutton, 55, exercises barefoot along the
beach in commercials targeted at menopausal women considering drug
therapy. And Barbara Eden, 66, looks like she probably could still
fit into her racy, hot-pink ``I Dream of Jeannie'' costume, as she
hawks baked-goods for Entenmann's on television.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau predicts that the population of people age 65
and older will more than double from 34.6 million in 1999 to 82.0
million in 2050. That's a hefty market.
</P>
<P>
   Given the statistics, the potential for changing reflections of
age is astounding, said Bill Burkart, president and chief executive
officer of the San Francisco-area Age Wave IMPACT, which advises
companies on how to advertise to the 50-and-older audience.
</P>
<P>
   He said baby boomers comprise ``the smartest generation in the
history of the world, the best-educated, the wealthiest.'' And if
they want to see hotter,stronger versions of themselves in the
popular media, they'll get them, because they won't deal with
companies that don't understand what they want, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They essentially have transformed everything they've
touched,'' from divorce to credit cards, Burkart said. ``What
you're going to see in the next 10 years is a total redefinition, a
total transformation of what it's going to be like to be old.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Strumpf, the nursing professor, said celebrity images of the
older generations are refreshing. But, she said, those pictures can
gloss over the fact that other segments of the population _
especially adults in low-income communities _ don't have the same
access to health care information and services to keep themselves
looking young and do not enjoy the same positive images in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a cavalcade of sexy seniors in pop culture doesn't prove
that the public is upgrading its regard for older adults, said
Sheldon Steinhauser, sociology professor at the Metropolitan State
College of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a great amount of ageism in this society,''
said the 70-year-old, who runs a consulting firm that helps
companies recruit and hold on to older workers. ``We may talk about
it differently. We may not use some of the nastier terms. At the
same time, that doesn't mean the attitudes have disintegrated.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   To Steinhauser, however, media depictions of aging seem
promising. He said the media and pop culture, bolstered by demands
from older people for accurate portrayals and fair treatment, can
help sway attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, John Glenn, the former astronaut and senator
from Ohio who returned to space in 1998 at age 77. The press was
all over it.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinhauser said ordinary folks accomplish the extraordinary
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we should begin to realize,'' Steinhauser said, ``it's
not just selected exceptions and it's not just the selected
celebrities who are out there doing substantial things.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, for instance, an 83-year-old woman survived for three
days in her car after being run off a highway overpass above a
Florida swamp. Doctors say she kept herself alive by drinking
rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   And more bold expressions of aging are likely on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer going to be defined as little old ladies and
doddering old men,'' said Thompson, the Syracuse professor. ``We
hold the cultural cards and we're dealing them accordingly.''

NASA PAYS TRIBUTE TO AEROSPACE ENGINEER ROBERT GILRUTH 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Associates of Robert Gilruth, the late aerospace engineer whose
skill, leadership and inspiration helped America reach the moon
more than 30 years ago, gathered at NASA's Johnson Space Center on
Monday to pay tribute.
</P>
<P>
   The 86-year-old spaceflight pioneer died on Aug. 17 in
Charlottesville, Va., after a lengthy illness.
</P>
<P>
   The native Minnesotan's work influenced the design of the
country's earliest supersonic aircraft as well its spacecraft, from
the tiny Mercury capsule to the space shuttle transport. He served
as Johnson's first director, a post he filled in Houston for nearly
a decade until his departure in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Gilruth enabled this nation's human spaceflight program,
enabled us to get humans into orbit, but he did much more,''
Johnson Space Center director George W.S. Abbey, told more than 400
who assembled at the Clear Lake research facility for a memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He enabled us to get men to the moon successfully, and bring
them back to Earth safely. He left us a legacy,'' said Abby. ``When
humans get out of Earth orbit again, go back to the moon and take
the first steps on the planet Mars, Bob Gilruth will be there with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then chief of aeronautic research for the National Advisory
Committee on Aeronautics, Gilruth was chosen in 1958 to lead the
space task group, a team of 35 experts assembled in Virginia by the
newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
launch an American into space. By 1961, the group had relocated in
Houston as the nucleus of what was known as NASA's Manned
Spacecraft Center. The campus-like complex later was renamed for
former president Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   With the relocation came new orders for NASA from then-President
Kennedy. The embryonic space agency was to stage a come-from-behind
victory by reaching the moon with astronauts ahead of the country's
Cold War rival, the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired in 1972, Gilruth had directed NASA's
first 25 human spaceflights, including all of the Mercury and
Gemini missions, and four of the six Apollo moon landings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilruth was a unique individual who had a knack for solving
problems and at the same time developing young engineers to meet
the challenges of the future,'' said Chris Kraft, a close associate
of Gilruth's who became Johnson's second director. ``We were
blessed by his collegial approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilruth was intimately involved with every basic decision as
we made our way into space,'' Kraft recalled. ``He had the
fortitude to take the risks required to accomplish the task.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth's widow, Jo, said her husband was as thrilled as he was
humbled by the challenge of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would have worked for nothing if they would have
just given him room and board. He always thought he was the
luckiest man to do what he really loved and with people he
respected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's tribute closed with a tree planting ceremony. A live
oak, planted in tribute to Gilruth, became the newest addition to a
maturing grove of 29 trees, each a remembrance to a pioneer in the
era of human spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth's tree stands across from Alan Shepard's. The first
American in space, Shepard died in July 1998.

   MINIMUM-WAGE (Washington) _ Speaker Dennis Hastert on Monday
offered key concessions to Democrats on a plan to raise the federal
minimum wage, moving to end months of stalemate on a popular bill
that Republicans fear might damage them at the polls. The House and
Senate earlier this year approved an increase in the minimum wage
by $1, to $6.15 an hour, but since then the proposal has stalled
causing some Republicans to fear they are handing Democrats a
potent campaign issue. By Eric Schmitt.

   SCOUTS-GAYS (Undated) _ In the wake of the Supreme Court
decision on gays in Scouting, schools and charities across the
country are considering whether they want to stay involved with the
program. Some are contemplating backing off from their level of
contribution and whether they want to make their facilities
available to the organization. The San Diego Police Department, as
well as the United Way in San Francisco and Santa Fe, have pulled
out as sponsors. By Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ATTICA-SETTLEMENT (Rochester, N.Y.) _ Declaring that the
inmates who were beaten and tortured during the 1971 Attica prison
uprising were ``humiliated,'' ``dehumanized'' and treated ``like
garbage,'' a federal judge on Monday approved a landmark settlement
that will compensate more than 500 families a total of $8 million
for the inmates' physical and emotional abuse. The settlement
weaves both meticulous financial details and heartwrenching
anecdotes from the inmates in fleshing out a deal reached in
January between New York state and lawyers representing 1,281
former inmates over the storming of the western New York prison by
state troopers. In all, 43 people died and more than 80 were
wounded during the uprising and siege. By David W. Chen.

   PERU-U.S.-BERENSON (Undated) _ Peru's military court on Monday

jailed in 1996 for involvement with leftist rebels, saying she
would be given a new trial in a civilian court. (Summary from

   SCI-BLOOD-PRESSURE (Undated) _ The calcium channel blocker drugs
that are commonly prescribed to lower high blood pressure are less
effective than other drugs and their use is leading to nearly
85,000 unnecessary heart attacks and cases of heart failure each
year worldwide, according to a new study being reported today.
Calcium channel blockers are not harmful. Because they are less
effective users do not gain the benefits they would by using other
types of anti-hypertensive drugs. By Lawrence K. Altman.

<P>
   Can empty space be stirred like pancake batter? According to
Einstein's theory of relativity, the gravity of a spinning object
should tug slightly on the surrounding space and slowly drag it
around in circles. Any matter would be pulled along, even though
ordinary gravity can only attract matter, not push it sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Observational astronomers have remained skeptical of that
supremely bizarre prediction, since they have never found clear,
direct proof that the phenomenon exists. But with the discovery of
a strange new signal by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, a NASA
satellite designed to measure X-ray sources in deep space, a few
more astronomers may be ready to get on board.
</P>
<P>
   Michiel van der Klis of the University of Amsterdam and two
colleagues will report in the Sept. 1 issue of Astrophysical
Journal Letters that the satellite has detected previously unknown,
oscillating X-ray signals from three superdense chunks of matter
called neutron stars. The powerful gravity of those weird objects
is just what theorists say is required to produce the effect, and
the ringing signals may be generated by space being spun in a
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Klis said that the observations were ``not a definitive
proof'' of the phenomenon, but were just what astronomers expected
if it was happening around the stars. ``Because there is a large
amount of matter spinning around there, general relativity predicts
that space-time will be dragged around a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The neutron stars, which are essentially the cinders that remain
after a star explodes, are probably each in a close orbit around an
ordinary star whose outer, gaseous layers are being torn away by
the powerful gravity of their companions.
</P>
<P>
   As the gas spirals violently into the neutron star and becomes
hot enough to emit X-rays, it begins to rock and shake with some of
the rhythms of the star system, like a cup of coffee resting on the
hood of an idling car _ the faster the engine idles, the faster the
coffee jiggles. Astrophysicists expect one of those jiggles to be
the rate at which the strong gravity of the spinning neutron star
stirs the emptiness of space, and as the gas is pulled along it may
be emitting X-rays at the frequency observed by the satellite.
</P>
<P>
   How can empty space be stirred? In Einstein's general theory of
relativity, gravity and space are not separate concepts, but work
hand in glove. Gravity twists and warps space, and it can also pull
it along as if it were a real substance rather than emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   To see how odd the effect is, imagine riding a merry-go-round in
space. Ordinarily, a rider would feel centrifugal force only when
the distant stars appeared to be spinning around. Both the
centrifugal force and the apparently spinning stars would be
indications that the merry-go-round is, in fact, turning on its
axis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the influence of a massive rotating object, like a neutron
star, Einstein's theory says that space itself would begin
swirling, though not as fast as the star _ gravity is an imperfect
stirring spoon. So if a merry-go-round is turning at the same rate
as space, the centrifugal force would vanish, even though the stars
would still seem to be spinning around. Matter outside a neutron
star can be swept up in this swirling space like sticks in a
whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those notions have not yet been tested
observationally where gravity is very strong and they lead to the
most bizarre consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Probing them where the geometry is highly twisted and malleable,
said Frederick K. Lamb, a physicist at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, ``is one of the major problems of modern
physics and astrophysics, and it's a regime in which we have had
very little or no information.''
</P>
<P>
   The spinning of emptiness, called ``frame dragging,'' is surely
one of the most bizarre of all those consequences of relativity.
Scientists are still debating whether that explanation for the new
buzz from the neutron stars is the correct one. But Mario Vietri,
an astrophysicist at the University of Rome's campus III, said that
X-ray emissions from those extreme environments were ``the one way
that we know to test general relativity in the strong-field
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Begelman, an astrophysicist at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, said that the X-ray emissions carried even more
information about the gas and its behavior if scientists could only
interpret it. ``I would say that Rossi has provided an amazingly
rich data set that far outstrips our ability to understand it
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The star systems in question are among the most exotic and
violent in the galaxy, said van der Klis, who did his work with
Peter G. Jonker of the University of Amsterdam and Mariano Mendez
of Amsterdam and the National University of La Plata in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The systems probably come about when one star much heavier than
the sun and one lighter than the sun are born side-by-side or drift
near each other. The two stars are fated to have much different
lives, since heavy stars use up their nuclear fuel rapidly and can
explode as supernovas after just millions of years _ an eye blink
in cosmic terms _ while lighter stars burn steadily for billions of
years.
</P>
<P>
   When the heavy star explodes, it leaves behind a neutron star, a
superdense cinder of collapsed matter with the density of an atomic
nucleus. Just 10 to 15 miles across, it still weighs more than the
sun. (Extremely massive stars can create objects called black holes
that collapse even further.) Eventually, this dark star and its
rather ordinary companion can settle into an orbit so tight that
both would fit inside a sphere the size of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   At those close distances, the powerful gravity of the
fast-living neutron star begins to rip gaseous material from the
outer layers of its companion. The material does not fall straight
onto the neutron star's surface, but instead spirals downward, like
a satellite whose orbit gradually decays. The material probably
gathers into a flattened disk, called an accretion disk, before
plunging at speeds as high as half the speed of light onto the
neutron star's murky surface.
</P>
<P>
   Because of friction among the gases in the accretion disk and
the violence of the collision at the surface, van der Klis said,
``the end result of the whole process is that an enormous amount of
X-rays is emitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Called low-mass X-ray binaries, about 100 such systems are known
in the galaxy, he said. Because the binaries are dim, distant and
small in size, astronomers regard their copious emission of X-rays
as more than a curiosity. Without the emission, the dark cinder
``is a dead star,'' van der Klis said. The emission ``is the basic
reason that we are able to see this star at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The small, parsimonious companion is generally not bright enough
to be of much help. So for decades, astronomers have launched X-ray
satellites to study these sources and other high-energy displays in
the heavens. Since X-rays do not penetrate very deeply into the
atmosphere, astronomers must study them from space.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NASA launched the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in late 1995 with
a highly sensitive detector that is able to pick up high-frequency
variations, often faster than a thousand times a second, in the
output of X-ray sources in space. Astronomers wanted such a
detector partly because they hoped to see not just a steady X-ray
glow, but also a direct signature of the dynamic, whirling motion
of the gases around the neutron star.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite cannot see anything but a flickering point of
X-ray emission. But from the rate of those flickers _ their
frequency _ astronomers can piece together what is happening around
the star.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the frequency with which a clump of X-ray-emitting
gas disappears behind the star and emerges again tells astronomers
how fast it is moving in its orbit. The faster the speed, the
smaller the orbit. Since neutron stars have little atmosphere, and
gas can orbit very close to its surface, that frequency says
something about the size of the star. The relevant frequencies can
be higher than a thousand times a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to measure things that are happening near the
surface of the neutron star, then you're going to have to resolve
that kind of time scale,'' said Jean Swank, an astronomer at the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center who is Rossi's project scientist.
The satellite's detectors are up to the job, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The information is particularly precious, since the exact size
of neutron stars for a given mass is a major point of contention
among theorists who try to understand how nuclear matter behaves
under tremendous pressures, a relation described mathematically by
a relation called the equation of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``How big a star is for a given density depends basically on the
equation of state _ how compressible the matter is,'' said Tod
Strohmayer, an astronomer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
The orbital frequency, he said, ``gives information about the mass
and radius of the star.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the only telltale frequency that astronomers had
a chance see in the Rossi satellite data. Like the wavering ``beat
frequency'' that is heard when two tuning forks with different
tones are struck at the same time, the rotation frequency of the
neutron star could modulate the first signal through a complex
physical process at the star, creating more tones for Rossi.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the possible frame-dragging effect. If a
spinning neutron star's equator is not in the same plane as the
accretion disk, this dragging might cause the disk to wobble with
yet another frequency that the satellite could detect.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Rossi was launched in late 1995, teams
led by Strohmayer and van der Klis detected two definite
frequencies from neutron star binaries. They were identified with
the orbiting gas and the spinning star, although theorists have
later come up with alternative explanations.
</P>
<P>
   That debate continues, although Strohmayer said the data had
already yielded information about the possible sizes and densities
of the stars. The Sept. 1 paper by van der Klis and colleagues
announces the discovery of a new oscillation in three X-ray
binaries. Some theorists, including Vietri of Rome, believe the new
data are evidence of frame dragging.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Lamb and his colleague Draza Markovic of the
University of Illinois, believe that the frame-dragging wobble
would be canceled out by other, more mundane effects in the system,
indicating that the new oscillation must be caused by something
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think it's not settled yet,'' Swank said. ``It
seems to me likely that that kind of thing might occur there,'' she
said, referring to frame dragging. But Swank said the issue
probably would not be settled until other features of the
oscillations were known, such as how they changed as the star's
output brightened and dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The debate could also be influenced eventually by a long-planned
NASA mission called Gravity Probe B, which is expected to look for
the tiny amount of frame dragging produced by Earth's relatively
paltry gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   Begelman of Colorado cautioned that some entirely different
effect could yet be behind the new discovery around neutron stars,
such as wave motions that relativity theory predicts should also
exist in the accretion disk. Future X-ray missions with names like
Constellation X and Maxim, will probably have something to say
about resolving those mysteries. Meanwhile, the Rossi satellite
goes on making headlines.

A SCHOLAR WHO BROUGHT ASIAN ART TO THE WEST RETIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  By   HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty years ago, Asian art led a marginal life at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1970 the only Chinese works on
view were in a room of early Buddhist sculpture and some cases of
ceramics. As late as 1990 Indian art meant an assortment of objects
crammed into dimly lighted vitrines on the Great Hall balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. The museum now has more than 50 permanent
galleries devoted to the largest and most comprehensive collection
of Asian art under one roof. These days the Met is fond of calling
itself a ``museum of Asian art within a museum,'' and it is
justified in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   What went right? Several things. The international market in
Asian art opened up. (Trade relations with China were renewed in
1972, and tons _ literally _ of Southeast Asian material found its
way to the West in the wake of the Vietnam War.) In addition a
number of fine American private collections were ripe for
institutional picking. And the Met went into a global expansion
mode.
</P>
<P>
   The catalytic agent, though, was the arrival at the museum in
1971 of Wen C. Fong, a highly esteemed art historian at Princeton
University, as special consultant for Far Eastern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades he wooed collectors, engineered
acquisitions, beefed up the curatorial staff, campaigned for
gallery space and transformed an institution that had come to
collecting Asian material very late in the game into a major
international contender.
</P>
<P>
   On his watch some superb collections came into the museum, and
permanent Asian galleries gradually materialized, many carved out
of space once reserved for blockbuster shows. The Astor Court
garden and the Douglas Dillon galleries for Chinese painting and
calligraphy opened in 1981. Next came Japanese galleries in 1987,
South and Southeast Asian galleries in 1994, new Chinese painting
and decorative arts galleries in 1997 and finally a Korean gallery
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Fong, 69, announced his retirement from the museum,
where he has long been consultive chairman of the Asian art
department. His position has been taken by another Met veteran,
James C.Y. Watt, 63, a curator at the museum for 15 years. Both men
were born in China and both are respected scholars with similar
worries about directions the field is taking.
</P>
<P>
   Fong was born in Shanghai in 1930 and was given a traditional
at-home education. ``I was taught by an old scholar, which meant
that I studied old things,'' he said in an interview. ``But there
was family pressure on me to take up engineering, so I escaped to
this country to study art.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing graduate work in Chinese art at Princeton, he
taught there almost without break until his retirement from the
faculty last year. He established the first American doctoral
program in Chinese art history there in 1964; many leading curators
and teachers now at work across the country are his former
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Hoving was the museum's director at the time,'' Fong
explained, ``but the man behind the Asian initiative was Douglas
Dillon, the president of the board of trustees. He wanted to buy
gobs and gobs of art.''
</P>
<P>
   And buy the museum did, beginning with 500 Japanese objects that
it took five years to pay for. In 1973 the Met acquired a group of
Chinese paintings from the collector C.C. Wang, beginning a long
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting opportunities are still plentiful,'' Fong said,
``but the market is so treacherous now in terms of forgeries.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong's path wasn't always smooth. He said that when in 1971 he
proposed mounting an exhibition of calligraphy, the art form
revered above all others by the Chinese, one museum official wanted
to put the show in the ceramics cases on the Great Hall balcony.
``It's just like postage stamps, isn't it?'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the museum will present the largest Chinese
calligraphy survey ever mounted in the United States. Titled ``The
Embodied Image: Chinese Calligraphy From the John B. Elliott
Collection,'' it will open on Sept. 15 and fill all 13 of the
Chinese painting galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The energy Fong brought to his work was Herculean, as his
successor is the first to acknowledge. Watt was easing into
semiretirement when the Met asked him to take over the department.
``Recently, I've had the great leisure of being able to read for
two hours every morning,'' he said. ``Now I'll have to forgo that
again for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Fong's demeanor is outgoing and voluble, Watt's is low-key
and reticent, qualities reflected in his views of the immediate
direction Asian art at the Met will take. ``We need to quiet down a
bit,'' Watt said. ``We've been rushing headlong since I've been
here, 15 years, with new galleries. Now that we've filled up every
possible space we've been allotted, it's time to stand back and
take stock.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But at least one ambitious Chinese exhibition _ ``Early Chinese
Empire: The First Millennium, Han Through Tang'' _ is very much in
the works. Scheduled for 2003, it will be primarily an
archaeological show, though unlike those recently at the Guggenheim
Museum in Manhattan and the National Gallery in Washington, this
one will be ``a focused exhibition of a certain period rather than
just a random display of masterpieces,'' Watt said.
</P>
<P>
   Even within that definition, the time frame is vast, from the
collapse of the Han dynasty in A.D. 220 and into the Tang, which
began in 618. This was a complex transitional period that produced
what Watt called ``a totally new culture for China.'' The plan is
for all or most of the material to be loans from China itself.
``I'm hoping we'll have some of the best Buddhist sculptures and,
if it can be done, wall paintings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watt grew up in Hong Kong and, like Fong, had a classical
education at home with a scholar-teacher before going to Oxford. He
then returned to Hong Kong, where he studied at the Chinese
University and worked at the City Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a concentration of great scholars in the city in the
1950s and 60s,'' he said, ``the last of a generation with an
approach going all the way back to the Song dynasty.'' His own
family background included a lineage of scholars, ``rather an
obscure one.'' The last of them to come into public prominence was
a Ming-period writer who became a monk to escape persecution for
resisting Manchu rule during China's last dynasty, the Qing.
</P>
<P>
   Under Manchu rule, which ended in 1912, Watt's family retreated
from public life. ``They were forbidden to do anything,'' he said.
``But they had their libraries.'' They also had access to private
art collections, which they were able both to enjoy and study
intensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to handle an object is so important,'' Watt said.
``That's why some people feel not all art should be behind glass.
But students today don't have that primary experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an experience that he was given by his first
scholar-teacher in Hong Kong, with whom he practiced calligraphy,
seal carving and music, disciplines, long associated with a true
education, that can only be taught one-to-one.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments that formed the basis of his approach to
scholarship are no longer taught in China, and their spirit will
be, he said, increasingly difficult to convey to young art
historians of the future. ``But somehow,'' Watt added, ``they must
become familiar with the tradition of passing on tradition.''

 &HT;    Magazine lists don't match up
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ATLANTA - If various magazine lists of
<TEXT>
``biggest'' companies don't match, why should their lists of the
``fastest growing'' companies match? They don't.
<P>
   Three Georgia-based companies are on the latest Fortune (Sept.
11) list of 100 fastest growing companies: Profit Recovery Group
International (59), AHL Services (71) and Nova (98).
</P>
<P>
   But four Georgia companies are on the 100 fastest growing list
compiled by Individual Investor (September): Manhattan Associates
(7), Antec (24), Matria Healthcare (54) and Internet Security
Systems (79).
</P>
<P>
   Fortune ranked companies with at least $50 million in market
value by revenue growth. Individual Investor ranked the earnings
growth of companies with a market cap of $100 million or above.
Only nine companies made both lists: Concord Camera, Cree, Forest
Laboratories, Network Appliance, QLogic. RF Micro Devices, SDL,
Siebel Systems and Triquint Semiconductor.

<P>
   Business bashing pays
</P>
<P>
   Business bashing is selling well for Democratic presidential
nominee Al Gore, according to recent polls showing him ahead of
Republican George Bush, Business Week (Sept. 4) reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's neo-populist model taps into a growing public backlash
against the concentration of corporate power, yet he does so
without attacking business in general,'' the magazine says. The
message is understood especially well in ``old economy'' states
from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin.

   Placing your bets on management messiahs can be hazardous to
your wealth, says Barron's (Aug. 28). A company's stock may bounce

usually it doesn't stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The share prices of Conseco, Hilton Hotels, Exide, Eastman
Kodak, Kmart, AT&AMP;T, Sunbeam, Rite Aid and Xerox are all lower than
the peaks reached after the arrival of their supposed saviors.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuer's prowess may lie in financial engineering instead
of business building, Barron's says. And some companies are in
trouble because they're in fundamentally bad businesses.

 &HT;    Southern executive to confer with German officials
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Southern Co. chief executive A. W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg
will fly to Berlin on Wednesday to confer with German officials
about the company's stymied bid to take over two German power
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg will make the company's case for expanding its holdings
in Berliner Kraft und Licht, the Berlin electric utility known as
Bewag, and purchasing control of Vereinigte Energiewerke, the
eastern Germany power generator, known as Veag.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Harlan, director of European operations for Southern
Energy Inc., a Southern Co. subsidiary, met Monday with Berlin
Mayor Eberhard Diepgen.
</P>
<P>
   Southern purchased a 26 percent stake of Bewag from the Berlin
government three years ago for $830 million. The company wants to
add the 49 percent stake now being sold by E.ON, the German energy
conglomerate, and bid for both Veag and an east German coal
company, Laubag.
</P>
<P>
   E.ON is being forced by antitrust regulators to sell 49 percent
stakes in both Bewag and Veag.
</P>
<P>
   Veag lost $900 million last year, but Southern believes it can
make it profitable by merging its operations with Bewag. Veag
provides electricity and power distribution for the surrounding
area of 15 million people that was once communist East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   E.ON, however, has announced plans to sell its Bewag stake to
Hamburgische Electricitaets-Werke, the utility known as HEW that
serves Hamburg. HEW is majority-owned by Sweden's state-owned
utility Vattenfall.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Dahlberg's schedule Thursday were not released.

FILMMAKER COMES TO TERMS WITH WAYWARD FATHER IN `RAMBLIN' JACK' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ramblin' Jack Elliott, the major link between
the late Woody Guthrie and modern folk music, is learning to love
the documentary his daughter, Aiyana Elliott, made about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great tribute to a life badly lived,'' he says. The
line, delivered over lunch at a very un-Ramblin'-Jack-style San
Francisco bistro, sounds like a catchphrase straight from the PR
department. Not so, Elliott says with a bright smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said it before. That's a scoop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack'' won a special jury prize for
artistic achievement at this year's Sundance Film Festival. It's
Aiyana Elliott's first feature-length project, having grown out of
a half-hour short she made as a film student at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   The movie works equally well on two levels. It's a warm portrait
of a Brooklyn boy (born Elliott Adnopoz) who chased the myth of the
American Wild West as if it were a prize calf wandering toward a
steep bluff. It is also the culmination of Aiyana Elliott's
lifelong frustration with her wayward dad, who was always ramblin'
like that prize calf.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Kris Kristofferson suggests with a hearty chuckle
that his friend's nickname comes not from his love of the open road
but from his prodigious gift of gab.
</P>
<P>
   Aiyana Elliott says that gift isn't entirely a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has a habit of being very intimate with an audience,
with strangers, in a way that's hard for him to be with people
close to him,'' she says, wedged into a banquette with him over
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Father and daughter share the same soft blue eyes. By turns, she
dotes on him, gently steering him back onto the conversational
track, and pooh-poohs him, wrinkling her lips when he grumbles
about how uncomfortable he was shooting the movie's confrontational
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, whose Grammy-winning 1995 comeback album ``South
Coast'' was supposedly recorded for gas money back to his home
north of San Francisco, has been belatedly recognized for his
considerable contributions to American folk music. He received the
National Medal of Arts in 1998, the same year he released an album
of duets with admirers including Emmylou Harris, Bob Weir, Tom
Waits and Arlo Guthrie, Woody's son.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott served his apprenticeship with the elder Guthrie in the
early 1950s, when the great folksinger was slowly succumbing to
Huntington's chorea. The two men would care for Guthrie's children,
squeezing in jam sessions when they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd practice guitar every morning,'' Elliott says. ``We
entertained the kids mostly by taking them for car rides. Then
Woody would get dizzy and take a nap for two or three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after first meeting Guthrie, Elliott was the momentary
toast of Greenwich Village. Bob Dylan's first official gig, at
Gerde's Folk City, billed him as the ``Son of Jack Elliott.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott's live act never translated into a successful
recording career, and by the 1970s he was remembered mostly by
die-hard acoustic-music fans. His peripatetic ways led to several
marriages _ Aiyana is his only child, the daughter of his fourth
wife, Martha Elliott _ and an infamous unreliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a joiner,'' Elliott says with a shrug. ``Some
of my first heroes were the Lone Cowboy and the Lone Sailor _ Will
James and Joshua Slocumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying on where Guthrie left off gave his life a structure
others might not see, Elliott says. ``People talk about my lack of
organization, but there must have been some sort of organization in
the cosmos to let this thing keep living.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiyana says it was the loss of several lives that pushed her to
make ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The year I finished school, a lot of Jack's contemporaries
started to drop. It was a terrible (time). Allen Ginsberg, William
Burroughs, Jerry Garcia, Townes Van Zandt, John Denver _ all gone.
And I thought, I probably should make this movie soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiyana, who once answered a sixth-grade aptitude test by saying
that all she wanted to do was watch movies, says she didn't get
that from her father.
</P>
<P>
   That's true, he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy movies when I see them,'' Ramblin' Jack says, ``but I
never went much. I still have not seen `Gone With the Wind.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first movie he ever saw, way back in Brooklyn? ``The
Westerner,'' with Gary Cooper.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Dodging falling globs of molten cable, firemen finally
put out a searing blaze Monday that turned the television tower
that is Europe's tallest structure, Russia's pride and Moscow's
communications hub into a 1,772-foot kitchen match.
</P>
<P>
   As the television screens of an estimated 20 million Russians
flickered with snow, firefighters battled for nearly 26 hours
before smothering the fire in the Ostankino tower. As they fought,
they were forced to retreat steadily as flames licked downward
through makeshift asbestos barriers and across firebreaks where
flammable wiring had been torn away.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, officials announced that the bodies of a
firefighter and an elevator operator had been found in one elevator
that had fallen nearly 1,000 feet into a basement sometime during
the fire. A third body was believed pinned in the debris of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Before the firemen declared victory about 6 p.m. Monday, the
fire had engulfed all of the pre-stressed concrete section of the
tower above the 225-foot level, as well as much of a 410-foot metal
antenna planted at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete part appeared in no danger of collapse, engineers
said, although they refused to say the same of the heat-seared
antenna, which is spiked with so many metal bristles that it
resembles a gigantic hairbrush.
</P>
<P>
   The fire apparently began about 3:20 p.m. Sunday on that
antenna, in a mass of wiring at about 1,500 feet, and burned its
way earthward for most of the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The battle against it was fatally hamstrung by the fact that the
only safe way to fight the blaze _ as firefighters belatedly
discovered _ was to carry extinguishers by hand up more than 1,000
feet of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of the fire apparently were trapped sometime Sunday
after power to an elevator failed as they were ferrying
fire-fighting supplies upward.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had probably died of suffocation or heat
even before the fire melted cables and caused the elevator to
plunge into the basement, more than 21 feet below ground.
</P>
<P>
   They were the only human casualties in the harrowing emergency.
Seven other firefighters were rescued from an elevator that plunged
several hundred feet Sunday evening, only to be stopped by
emergency brakes about 950 feet above ground.
</P>
<P>
   But to Russian leaders and the public alike, the disaster
delivered yet another blow to the nation's diminishing standing as
a technological power of the first rank.
</P>
<P>
   As with the explosion and sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk
two weeks ago, rescuers were shown to lack the equipment and the
know-how to deal with the emergency, even when it reached the level
of an ordinary high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Kursk, the Ostankino tower has long been regarded
as a triumph of Russian know-how _ which is to say Soviet know-how,
in the days when the Kremlin was bent on impressing friends and
enemies with its ability to think in gargantuan terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Ostankino tower was the world's tallest free-standing
structure when it was built in 1967 to mark the 50th anniversary of
the Soviet revolution. One writer then compared it to a giant
syringe for ideological injections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when communist plotters tried to seize Ostankino in a
failed coup against President Boris N. Yeltsin, it came to
symbolize the importance of the free exchange of information in a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, President Vladimir Putin suggested it was a metaphor for
Russia's current status as a pitiful, helpless giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This latest accident shows the shape of our vital
installations and the overall state of our country,'' he said. ``We
should not forget the large-scale problems or current economic
issues here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Romanchik, a 36-year-old banker who lives with his wife
and daughter in the tower's reedy shadow, said he took the fire to
heart. ``My wife was born here in 1965, and I moved here in '72,''
he said Monday. ``This tower can be viewed as one of the symbols of
Moscow. I'm proud to say I live here, and if it ceases to exist, it
will be a great loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to fall down,'' he continued. ``But they can't
leave it like this.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fire briefly knocked out television across the entire
country, its effects were mostly confined to Moscow, where the
overwhelming majority of viewers rely on over-the-air broadcasts
instead of more expensive cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire line of television channels, from
state-controlled RTR and ORT to the independent NTV network to
Russia's version of MTV, were knocked off the air, as was one
frequency of the popular news radio station Echo Moskvy and a host
of specialized radio and paging services.
</P>
<P>
   About all that remained was the Russian movie channel NTV Plus,
a satellite channel. It quickly converted its broadcasts to
accommodate NTV and RTR newscasts, as well as some others. But the
reception even then remained quirky.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one Monday seemed sure of the 51,400-ton tower's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The tower's designer, Nikolai Nikitin, shared a birthday with
France's Gustave Eiffel, whose tower was a bit over half as tall.
Nikitin frequently said his work would withstand the elements for
at least 300 years. But he apparently was thinking of wind and
rain, not fire.
</P>
<P>
   While the concrete rings that constitute the tower's frame
seemed structurally intact Monday, 80 of its 149 high-tension steel
cables _ strings that hold the tower upright _ had melted or warped
in the heat. The cables hold the tower upright much as some
children's toys can be jerked upright by pulling tight an elastic
cord, and they make it both taut and flexible in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers said the structure was built to withstand the damage
it endured, but government officials also said it would cost
hundreds of millions of dollars to repair it _ money this
cash-strapped nation can ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   Eduard Sagalayev, the president of Russia's National Association
of Television and Radio Broadcasters, slipped into a eulogy Monday
when talking about the fire, telling Echo Moskvy that the tower
``was a unique structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not speak in the past tense,'' an interviewer said.
``It gives you a funny feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sagalayev replied: ``Unfortunately, one has to speak in the
past tense. If it does not collapse, I doubt that it will be able
to perform its functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was criticized for a lackadaisical response to the
Kursk disaster, wasted no time Monday, ordering engineers to
restore television and other communications to Moscow within a
week. By day's end, brainstormers were proposing to mount
transmitters everywhere from beneath helium balloons to atop the
roofs of Moscow's hilltop state university.
</P>
<P>
   The fire could have been much worse. It surprised the city on a
brilliant Sunday afternoon, when throngs of sightseers had come to
the Ostankino tower for the elevator ride to its 1,105-foot-high
observation platform and a meal in the nearby Seventh Heaven
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began above them, in a section of the antenna used by a
paging service, and tourists and workers were safely evacuated
before it spread.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the fire sputtered out Monday afternoon, hundreds of
onlookers and nearly as many journalists gathered several hundred
yards from the tower _ as close as police would allow _ to take
pictures, gawk and speculate about whether the spire looked as if
it were leaning. (It was not; workers for the city's geological
agency monitored the tilt, and said it was within normal limits.)
</P>
<P>
   Most people here seemed to suffer the loss of entertainment
good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch MTV practically all the time,'' 12-year-old Ivan
Lionov said as he stood along a cordoned-off street in north Moscow
that provided a good view of the tower. ``But we'll live. Of course
it's bad. But soon we'll be in school.''
</P>
<P>
   And an elderly woman selling sunflower and pistachio seeds to
the throngs of gawkers on the street had a contrarian view some
Westerners might appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bury my TV,'' she said. ``There's nothing to watch;
just bad things and naked people.''

FIRM DEVELOPS TRANSPLANT-QUALITY SWINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at BioTransplant Inc. say they have created a breed
of miniature swine that doesn't infect human cells with potentially
harmful viruses, removing a major obstacle for using pig organs for
human transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlestown, Mass. biotechnology company began breeding the
pigs years ago in hopes of developing a safe source of organs for
the hundreds of thousands of patients who every year find
themselves waiting for hearts, livers, and kidneys _ and for the
thousands of them who die waiting.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by other scientists, the discovery could ease fears
about infection in xenotransplantion, or cross-species
transplantation. But scientists warn that such transplants are
still years away from reality. And other issues, primarily the
body's immune attack on foreign invaders, must be overcome before
pig organs could be succesfully transplanted in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (advance) addresses one of the potential concerns that
exist around xenotransplantation, particularly its safety,'' said
Elliot Lebowitz, the company's president and CEO. ``It's an advance
that will allow us to move forward more confidently.''
</P>
<P>
   The news Monday drove up the company's stock price 8 percent, on
a day when biotech stocks overall fell 8 percent. The stock closed
at $12 a share.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists have been studying pigs for use in human
transplants because pigs are biologically similar to humans and
carry far fewer deadly diseases than primates.
</P>
<P>
   BioTransplant began creating a highly inbred species of
miniature swine eight years ago to create a pool of potential
organs that were as genetically similar _ and therefore predictable
_ as possible without cloning the animals. The pigs, which weigh
about 250 pounds and have organs similar in size to humans, were
screened for more than two dozen viruses and infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 British researchers found that a harmless pig virus,
porcine endogenous retrovirus, could infect human cells and become
dangerous. At the time, BioTransplant had already begun studying
the virus. Its early research suggested that a certain line of its
pigs did not transmit the virus to human cells. Last year, the
company hired Clive Patience, a member of the British team, to test
those findings.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after presenting the results of that research at the
international congress of the Transplantation Society in Rome,
Patience said he fully expected to disprove the company's initial
findings.
</P>
<P>
   He was so confident that he told coworkers he would eat his hat
if the company's findings turned out to be true. He mixed cells
from nine of the highly inbred pigs with a type of human kidney
cell that is most easily infected by the pig virus, but the virus
did not transmit to the human cells. At one point, he said, he was
utterly frustrated that he couldn't get the pigs' cells to transmit
the virus to human cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it as a bit of a personal insult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Patience is eating his words, if not his hat. He said he
doesn't know exactly why the virus in these particular pigs doesn't
infect human cells. The company is continuing its research to find
out. Perhaps, Patience said, generations of inbreeding have
weakened the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the problem that people thought was insurmountable,'' he
said. ``But the results indicate that these pigs are about as safe
as you can get. It's a big step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But xenotransplantation has many critics and most likely will
continue to have critics, even as scientists surmount the many
remaining obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Hubbard, professor emeritus at Harvard University and a
board member of the Council for Responsible Genetics, argues that
how a virus reacts with human cells in a lab experiment could be
different from how it reacts in the living body. If the virus did
become active, she said, it could spread into the community and
become a public health threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that it would get out of hand before someone
catches it,'' Hubbard said. ``I would say that xenotransplantations
are always going to be dangerous. I think there are other avenues
to explore rather than go that route.''

HOPKINS 24/7: CAMERAS FOLLOW DOCTORS AT WORK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: Wednesday in 4th graf is Aug. 30) 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
(UNDATED) _ ``Hopkins 24/7'' is ``Trauma Center'' with some depth,
``Rescue 911'' without the overwrought schmaltz, ``ER'' without
actors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filmed by ABC, which was provided extraordinary access inside
Baltimore's exceptional Johns Hopkins medical facility, ``Hopkins
24/7'' is a documentary series unlike many that have come down the
TV pike. It's six hours, all of them content-justified, all of them
focusing on some of the most important quality-of-life issues
America faces today.
</P>
<P>
   The series brilliantly mixes (begin ital) cinema verite(end
ital) (camera as witness) with storytelling of the most fascinating
kind.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, ``Hopkins 24/7'' (debuting at 9 p.m.
Wednesday) makes some genuine news and has some lasting impact. For
example:
</P>
<P>
   It tells stories _ medical and personal _ from the patients' and
the doctors' viewpoints. We're familiar with the patients' sides of
the story, but seeing the doctors' sides _ especially the young and
struggling interns' sides _ is eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time a hospital has granted television access
inside a ``morbidity and mortality conference,'' where doctors
discuss their deadly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few times cameras have been allowed inside a
hospital psychiatric group session. The one observed for this
series, dealing with anorexic girls, is almost frightening to
watch, so emaciated are the victims and so horrifying the stories.
</P>
<P>
   It makes use of a new, hand-sized Sony camera, offering the
exceptional pictures of much larger and cumbersome TV cameras. The
cameras are so small as to be virtually unobtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 25 spent three months shadowing doctors and patients,
and their efforts pay off handsomely here. It is enough time, as it
turns out, to really get to know some of these people _ and ABC
does an exceptional job in making their stories relatable to us.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater accomplishment: The series successfully tells
complete stories. We get beginnings, middles and ends (sometimes
open ends), just like any other drama series.
</P>
<P>
   And it's wrapped in truth. We freefall into the stories
unraveling before us thinking: ``That could be me,'' ``That sounds
just like what happened to my co-worker,'' or ``I've heard my
friend, Dr. Steve, tell that story.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's on tap:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Episode 1 &LR;  introduces us to Dr. Edward Cornwell, chief of
trauma surgery, whose mission to save the young black men of East
Baltimore street wars regularly meets with frustruation. This is
the episode that contains the morbidity and mortality conference.
</P>
<P>
   We also meet a young girl with a massive uterine tumor, and
witness the frustration of her parents and her doctor as they
wrestle with HMO folderol. We also get to see a sea turtle secreted
inside the hospital for some diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Episode 2 &LR;  presents the emotional story of a family who must
decide whether their 4-year-old should have half her brain removed.
We also witness, firsthand, the cruel grind of 100-hour shifts,
which are standard for interns.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; Episode 3 &LR; , a brave 17-year-old faces the enormous risks
involved with lung transplants, and a hard-working, idealistic
doctor becomes emotionally upended when she's exposed to
HIV-infected blood. We also see nervous medical students as they
confront cadavers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Episode 4 &LR;  reveals the anger of the pediatric emergency staff
when a battered child is brought in unconscious. We also meet two
interesting doctors _ a leading surgeon who also happens to be a
little person, and an oncologist with long hair, an on- and
off-again goatee and a strikingly eccentric bedside manner.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the tissues handy for  &UR; Episode 5 &LR; , a deeply emotional look
inside the bleak world of the anorexic. This is contrasted with the
world of the hard-of-hearing, and one of the series' great moments:
a child's first reaction to a microchip implanted in the ear.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; Episode 6 &LR; , the bottom of the world seems to fall out.
Patients die, affecting family but also having a surprisingly deep
impact on the doctors. In fact, the cameras are there when one
resident says she has had all she can handle and resigns her job.
</P>
<P>
   Each part of the series is as good as the previous. The series
never disappoints in the way it teaches and informs. And is it
sacrilege to say that it also entertains? ``Hopkins 24/7'' is an
important documentary series in the way it provides a more complete
sense of the patient-doctor dynamic.
</P>

INTEL SAYS 1.13G CHIP HAS DEFECTS, HALTS SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barely a month after its fastest Pentium III processor hit the
market, Intel Corp. is halting sales, due to defects in the chips.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is a significant embarrassment to the world's
largest maker of microprocessors, which had boasted that the 1.13
gigahertz Pentium III was the world's fastest PC processor _ faster
than any competing chip from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, Intel announced its production halt
on the same day that AMD began offering its answer to the superfast
Pentium III, a new 1.1 gigahertz Athlon chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a Monday,'' was the rueful comment from Intel
spokesman Michael Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's move is a vindication for some technology analysts who
had published harsh reviews of the chip on their Internet sites.
Tom's Hardware Guide, which specializes in detailed technical
analyses, wrote about the new Pentium III in July, calling it ``the
most unreliable and instable CPU (processor) Intel has ever
released.''
</P>

   Intel took the criticism seriously. Its technicians worked to
reproduce the problems reported by the reviewers. Last weekend,
Sullivan said, they succeeded. They found that the Pentium would
malfunction when running a common hardware testing program, or when
used to run compiler software under the Linux operating system.
(Compilers turn handwritten computer code into the digital language
that computers can understand.) Running a compiler puts great
stress on a processor. But it's a common task for hard-core
computer users, and so a chip must be able to do it properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not meeting our quality standards,'' Sullivan said, ``and
so we're stopping shipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's quick response stands in sharp contrast to its past
policies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 a math professor at a small Virginia college
demonstrated that Pentiums made mistakes when performing certain
division problems. For weeks Intel executives shrugged off the
problem, saying it was unlikely to affect many consumers. But
public outrage forced the company to back down. Fixing the bug cost
Intel $475 million. It also made Intel adopt a policy of moving
quickly to fix defective products.
</P>
<P>
   This policy was on display earlier this year, when Intel took
$253 million in charges to replace defective computer motherboards
that relied on a flawed Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest chip problem, while it may tarnish Intel's image,
won't have much effect on its income. Nathan Brookwood, a chip
industry analyst with Insight 64 in Saratoga, Calif., noted that at
about $1,000 apiece, few consumers would have purchased the 1.13
gigahertz Pentiums, anyway. ``I doubt that the number of chips they
shipped numbers even in the tens of thousands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dell Computer Corp. was scheduled to ship its first
system using the defective chip Friday. Instead, the company
removed the $3,800 system from its Internet site Monday morning.
Would-be buyers will be offered a slightly slower 1 gigahertz
Pentium system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AMD can now claim bragging rights in the processor
speed wars. Monday the company announced that 10 computer makers _
including IBM Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., and Hewlett-Packard Co.
_ have begun taking orders for PCs using AMD's new 1.1 gigahertz
Athlon. With the 1.13 gigahertz Intel retired from the field,
Athlon is number one, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock's rose 94 cents, to $73.88 a share, on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. Advanced Micro shares fell 25 cents to $34.25 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ Russia and its navy are justifiably facing
criticism for the handling of the Kursk submarine disaster. But
simply focusing on the problems in Russia misses a central point:
the inherent costs and risks of all nuclear submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Navy uncovered faulty welding in
its newest Seawolf vessel, meaning that this already far
over-budget submarine must now be returned to the manufacturer for
repairs. It is also requesting more funds for other new submarines.
Yet at the same time, news surfaced about the Navy's plans to
mothball one of its two rescue submarines for budget reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Since nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons first went to sea in
the 1950s, submarine accidents have killed more than 700 sailors
from the United States and the Soviet Union (and now, Russia)
alone. The United States lost two nuclear submarines and their
crews in the 1960s. It has also been involved in as many as a dozen
nuclear submarine collisions with Soviet and Russian vessels. As
recently as March 1998, two American nuclear submarines collided in
an exercise off the coast of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's record is far worse. Besides the Kursk, Russia has lost
four submarines with either nuclear weapons or reactors aboard (in
1968, 1970, 1986 and 1989). Fires, collisions with military and
civilian vessels and dangerous reactor incidents both at sea and
during refueling operations at dock have caused numerous
preventable deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brazil is moving forward with plans to develop its first
nuclear attack submarine. India is cooperating with Russia in
developing a submarine reactor, while Pakistan is sending feelers
to France about expanding its purchases of conventional
Agosta-class submarines, which could be fitted with nuclear
weapons. China, with Russian help, is seeking to expand its small
nuclear fleet.
</P>
<P>
   These nations continue to believe that nuclear submarines offer
security and prestige. Yet, as the Russian case indicates,
developing nuclear submarines involves significant long-term costs.
These include expenses for managing spent fuel, eliminating liquid
radioactive waste and disposing of used reactor compartments.
Russia has already caused serious damage to the environment near
many of its navy ports and will eventually spend several billion
dollars on the clean-up, decommissioning and dismantling of its
nuclear fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the serious environmental and safety threats posed
by nuclear submarines, there is currently no international effort
to ban their spread. The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty includes
no clause prohibiting the sale of either nuclear submarines or the
highly enriched uranium fuel they run on.
</P>
<P>
   An important first step toward preventing a future catastrophe
at sea would be for the current nuclear submarine-producing states
to agree to a ban on their sale or transfer, along with similar
bans regarding propulsion technology. Such self-restraint would
raise the cost of building nuclear submarines and act as a
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   A second step would be for the nuclear navies of the world to
discuss a ``rules of the road'' agreement to facilitate the
exchange of information in the case of future accidents. Such an
accord would help prevent submarine collisions from leading to
inadvertent war and accidents from causing avoidable deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A final step would be to include the enriched uranium fuel used
in submarines in negotiations toward a global treaty to ban the
production of fissile materials. Existing proposals make no mention
of the submarine fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk incident should spur changes in Russia's nuclear navy.
But this will not alleviate the international dangers caused by
submarine collisions, accidents and transfers of technology. New
global initiatives are needed to improve the safety of the seas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ America's violent crime rate has fallen by about
a third since 1993, but it could fall further if we took better
control of the millions of criminals who are on probation rather
than in prison or jail.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of evidence is showing that the ``broken
windows'' strategy used effectively by police departments _ taking
petty crimes seriously as a way to establish a low tolerance for
lawbreaking at every level _ can be adapted to the treatment of
people on probation. If those who break the conditions of
probation, even with what seem like minor lapses, are held
accountable for it, the public will be safer.
</P>
<P>
   Although jails and prisons hold nearly two million people, there
are many more on probation _ and not just for misdemeanors marring
otherwise clean records. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports
that in 1999 more than 3.7 million adults were under supervision of
probation officers nationwide. Nearly two million of them had been
convicted of one or more felony crimes, but sentenced to probation
for those crimes, rather than to prison. In many states, about half
the people on probation have histories of criminal violence.
</P>
<P>
   Probation is supposed to help rehabilitate the offender and
protect the public. But about 40 percent of all felony probationers
are rearrested for fresh felonies within three years of being
placed under community supervision. Others walk away: in 1990, with
a probation population a third smaller than what we have now,
probation agencies had lost track of a quarter-million
``absconders'' _ people still under sentence but not reporting in.
Because record keeping has become so spotty, no one knows how many
absconders there are today. Few attempts are made to locate these
fugitives or to bring them to court.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all probationers violate the terms of their sentences,
but only a fifth go to jail as a result. In 1998, some 255,000
probationers were incarcerated for new felony crimes committed
while under supervision, and another 615,000 violated one or more
terms of their sentences but received no punishment. And though
courts routinely make drug treatment a condition of probation
(since an estimated 80 percent of probationers have serious
substance abuse problems), fewer than 40 percent of all
probationers nationwide actually participate in any type of drug
treatment during their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   We spend only about $200 a year per probationer, and we get what
we pay for. Strapped for time and overburdened by their caseloads,
probation officers too often resort to ``fortress probation,''
shuffling paperwork and rarely leaving their offices or having
face-to-face contact with the offenders they supposedly supervise.
One recent study found that in 1998 fewer than one in 20 people who
worked for probation agencies ever actually spent time supervising
felony probationers on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A lax attitude toward enforcement pervades the system, and
probationers have come to expect two or more ``free ones'' when it
comes to drugs in urine samples, electronic monitoring violations,
or failure to comply with a wide variety of conditions. The
Manhattan Institute recently released a report by the Reinventing
Probation Council, a group of probation officials from across the
country, which argues that the response to violations should be
graduated sanctions, like curfews or house arrest, more intensive
supervision or monitoring, mandatory drug treatment, a brief period
of confinement in jail, or placement in a close-watch residential
facility. As the report stresses, first-hand knowledge of an
offender's family and neighborhood are critical elements of
effective supervision. Probation supervision must cease to be a
9-to-5 occupation. It must be delivered at nights, on weekends and
on holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Such reforms will not be easy. Adult probation caseloads have
soared to more than 500 per officer in many cities. Some 60 percent
of Los Angeles probationers, for example, are tracked solely by
computer. Many probation agencies, adult and juvenile, lack even
basic data like addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Where strict probation has been tried, however, the results are
encouraging. After Williamson County, Texas, probation officers
decided to crack down on absconders, they arrested over 1,000
probation violators and collected over $65,000 in unpaid penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, where probation officers formed partnerships with
police and clergy to reduce juvenile violence, more probationers
than ever got face-to-face visits, drug treatment, family
counseling and help finding jobs. During the first year of the
effort, the number of people arrested for violating probation
quadrupled. Shortly afterward, the city went for more than two
years without a single gun-related juvenile homicide.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, officials discovered that a quarter of the
murders in the city's most violent police district were committed
by felons on probation. Police, prosecutors, clergy and outreach
workers pooled information about young probationers in this
district identified as being at extreme risk of killing or being
killed. The police carefully monitored the group, and community
leaders offered counseling. A year later, while youth violence
remained high elsewhere in the city, the homicide rate had
plummeted in the district, and none of the targeted young people
had lost their lives or taken those of others.
</P>
<P>
   After the public learned that a suspect in the murders of five
people at a Wendy's restaurant in Flushing, Queens, last May had
previously been convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to
probation, there were calls to abolish probation. But that would be
a profoundly unwise and unworkable response, tantamount to doubling
the prison population overnight. We would do better to give
probation departments across the country the administrative tools
and financial support they need to do their public-safety jobs
right.

 By GREGG EASTERBROOK    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ That North Pole ice has turned liquid may be the
least of our problems. New studies have found that all Northern
Hemisphere sea ice is melting at a rate of about 15 percent per
decade and that the oceans as a whole are warming. Moreover,
researchers have just identified a rare manufacturing byproduct,
SF5 CF3, that represents the most potent greenhouse gas ever
detected. The signs of global warming keep accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so depressing; we must be doomed. Except that in the
flood of distressing developments comes a breakthrough. A study led
by James Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies in New York, suggests that our basic understanding of
greenhouse gases should be overturned _ and that reforms could be
more practical and affordable than widely assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, scientists studying global warming focused
nearly all their attention on the deleterious effects of carbon
dioxide, which is known to trap atmospheric heat. Every year, cars,
trucks and power plants release billions of tons of carbon dioxide
by burning fossil fuels. And continued buildup is inevitable, until
some combination of advanced nuclear energy and clean renewable
fuels eventually solves the problem. But for the next few decades
at least, continued buildup is inevitable. Even the ratification of
the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which would commit industrialized nations
to cut greenhouse gas emissions, could not stop carbon dioxide
buildup. If the treaty's rules went into effect (no major country
has ratified it), rising carbon emissions from the developing world
would outweigh any reductions in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hansen's team to suggest that focusing on carbon dioxide
is a fundamental error. Carbon is a concern, the study says, but
other factors may be equally significant. Black soot from
industrial smoke, for example, may turn out to be a leading warming
force. (Basically it makes the atmosphere soak up more of the sun's
heat, since black absorbs sunlight.) Compounds like SF5 CF3 may be
doing more damage than expected. And most of all, methane, which
has far more heat-trapping power than carbon dioxide, may be a much
greater greenhouse malefactor than today's scientific models
assume.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the beauty of Hansen's insight. While fossil fuels are
an essential, much of the world's methane emissions have no
economic utility; they are the unintended byproduct of natural-gas
exploration, poor landfill management and gas-pipeline leaks. These
sources could be eliminated with little sacrifice to our lifestyle
or economic growth. Likewise, rare chemicals like SF5 CF3 could be
controlled without harm to industry.
</P>
<P>
   Black soot emissions have already nearly disappeared from
Western industry without any economic harm. Today such soot comes
mainly from the developing world, where choking smoke rises from
unregulated industry and from unelectrified homes that use fires
for cooking and heating.
</P>
<P>
   While regulating smokestack emissions and expanding access to
electricity in developing nations would be an expensive
undertaking, it would also be a huge boon. Public health as well as
the environment would benefit. The World Health Organization says
that more children in the developing world die each year from
respiratory diseases caused by smoke and soot inhalation than all
those who die each year in the United States and the European Union
from all causes at all ages.
</P>
<P>
   This breakthrough study comes from a guru of the environmental
movement; in 1981, Hansen authored one of the first papers linking
rising levels of carbon dioxide to rising global temperatures. Yet
much of the environmental movement has greeted the new study with
skepticism; many environmentalists worry that any lessening of
fears regarding fossil fuels will hurt efforts to reduce global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than grousing about the Hansen study, however,
environmentalists should be extolling it as the greatest news in
years. First, it revives hope for the Kyoto agreement _ which, at
the insistence of State Department negotiators and Vice President
Al Gore, contains a little-noticed clause saying that reductions in
other greenhouse gas can be substituted for cuts in carbon dioxide.
A Kyoto treaty that is fixated on reducing fossil fuel use may
never be ratified, but one that goes after methane and SF5 CF3
seems eminently practical, politically.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Hansen's study means that even if the Kyoto agreement is
never ratified, affordable, realistic steps against global warming
could start right away, without economic harm. A warming world need
no longer be our destiny.

RESEARCHER SAYS TRIALS SHOW GENETIC HEART CURE WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ One of six gene therapy experiments shut down by the
government at St. Elizabeth's Hospital has yielded dramatic
improvement in a small group of patients with advanced heart
disease, the trials' embattled director is reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Dr. Jeffrey Isner and the hospital await federal
permission to resume the research, a report on 13 patients treated
before the shutdown provides ``very solid evidence'' that gene
therapy can work, said Isner.
</P>
<P>
   Most gene therapy experiments, in which genes are inserted into
the body to correct inherited diseases or treat cancer, have failed
to show much effect. This report of success comes as a ``breath of
fresh air'' at a time when gene therapy has been under intense
attack, wrote two doctors in an editorial accompanying the article
in the current edition of the journal Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment carried out in 1998-99, Isner and his
colleagues inserted genes that trigger the production of growth
hormones into the heart muscle of patients who had a history of
heart attacks and bypass surgery and continued to have chest pain.
Previous animal work had suggested that the growth factor would
spur new blood vessels to revive damaged heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The Circulation report said that 9 of the 13 patients showed
evidence that inactive or ``hibernating'' heart muscle returned to
normal function, and in the overall group episodes of angina (chest
pain) went down sharply.
</P>
<P>
   One of the patients, a manager at a Kansas aircraft plant, said
Isner's treatment brought him major relief from what he had been
told was inoperable blockage in a heart artery that caused angina
pain with almost any exertion.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, Philip Fletcher, 50, said, ``I was raking
leaves, and that ordinarily would have brought on angina fairly
rapidly, but I raked a big pile and noticed I didn't have any
pain.'' Fletcher said he continues to feel better than before the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's very encouraging,'' said Isner in an interview.
But he agreed with critics who have said it will be difficult to
prove the therapy's effects until it's tested in a trial alongside
an untreated control group of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration last spring halted all six gene
therapy trials that Isner was conducting, citing a long list of
alleged violations of patient protection rules.
</P>
<P>
   Among the accusations were that a patient with cancer who should
have been excluded from the trials on medical grounds was admitted;
that the researchers didn't monitor the subjects' health closely
enough; and that they they neglected to file required reports on
two patient deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In listing 21 separate violations, the FDA also said that Isner
showed ``a serious lack of knowledge of your responsibilities as a
principal investigator.''
</P>
<P>
   Isner and the hospital have responded to the FDA, saying that
most of the allegations were untrue and that other lapses have been
corrected. Isner said Monday he has had ``several encouraging
interactions'' with the FDA, but has not been told when he might be
allowed to resume the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Isner has also been accused of having a conflict of interest
because he holds an equity position in a company, Vascular
Genetics, that is sponsoring some of the trials. (The company did
not sponsor the trial in the report.) The president of the American
Society of Gene Therapy has asked Isner to comply with the
society's guidelines prohibiting such conflicts. Monday, Isner said
he was still considering the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several scientific teams are also trying to treat heart disease
by inserting genes or proteins to stimulate the growth of small
blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis. Isner's results
appear to be the most encouraging to date, he said. Since the trial
being reported, researchers have made the therapy less invasive:
the gene that promotes production of growth factor, called VEGF, is
administered using a catheter snaked through a vein rather than
being injected via a chest incision made under general anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial accompanying Isner's report, written by Drs. Cam
Patterson and Marschall S. Runge, noted that the St. Elizabeth's
team took a cautious approach, avoiding using a virus to carry the
genes into the patients' hearts. A reaction to such a virus caused
the death of Jesse Gelsinger, a teenaged patient with liver
disease, at the University of Pennsylvania last year, touching off
a wave of criticism of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Isner's group used a simple vehicle _ a ring of DNA _
that succeeded in getting the genes into the heart muscle cells
without causing a defensive reaction by the body.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, of the University of Texas Medical Branch in
Galveston, and Runge, of the University of North Carolina, said the
work was encouraging, but probably won't become a routine tool in
heart disease any time soon.

<P>
   APHRODISIAS, Turkey _ On a lunch break from excavations, Bert
Smith delivered the news of discovery. The marble head of a man had
been found under crumbling steps of an ancient house. The style was
right, and the fit. This must be the missing piece to a headless
statue of a local governor from the fifth century A.D. that had
been recovered years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's recapitation took place the next afternoon in the
little museum here at Aphrodisias, one of the more important and
monumentally impressive archaeological sites of the Greek and Roman
periods in what is now western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. R.R.R. Smith, known to all as Bert, a classical
archaeologist at Oxford University in England and co-director of
the current dig, lifted the head above the life-size marble body.
With a few turns this way and that, the neck slipped neatly onto
the rest of the statue.
</P>
<P>
   The governor named Oikoumenios was whole again.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small but satisfying triumph for archaeologists working
the Aphrodisias site, a field of dreams for the study of art and
architecture of antiquity. Spreading over a broad plain is an
extravagance of well-preserved stone remains of a prosperous
provincial city: from a huge theater on high ground to the squares
and building walls of the civic center and beyond to the standing
and fallen columns of the Temple of Aphrodite and then the stadium
that once seated 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   But new discoveries in the fine arts are not as common here as
they used to be. Not only have archaeologists thoroughly mined the
most obvious sources, but their excavations have entered a new
phase, a response in part to criticism that classical archaeology
has focused too much on collecting museum pieces at the expense of
exploring the societies that created them.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis in recent digging seasons, organized by the
Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, has shifted to
learning something of what the rest of Aphrodisias was like, beyond
the noble architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here and elsewhere in Turkey, we are making great strides in
understanding ancient cities from an urban point of view, as social
entities,'' Dr. Christopher Ratte of New York University, the other
co-director of the project, said while walking the pavement stones
of old Aphrodisias. ``We are trying to see them less as collections
of monuments and more as complex urban wholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward this end, the project has completed an extensive survey,
using subsurface-detection technology, of the open, unexcavated
fields within the city's encompassing defensive wall. Electric
currents were passed through the ground, at depths of a few feet.
By measuring changes in the resistance to the current, scientists
recorded variations in subsurface densities, evidence of buried
building foundations and street pavements.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has thus far revealed a grid pattern of streets and
houses in all directions from the center out to the city wall.
</P>
<P>
   Test trenches have confirmed the findings. Aphrodisias in its
heyday was a planned city, uniform blocks running north and south
and east and west.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the current issue of The American Journal of
Archaeology, Smith and Ratte reported that excavations guided by
the survey had yielded additional evidence suggesting that ``both
the city center and the residential areas of Aphrodisias remained
occupied and relatively prosperous through the sixth and into the
seventh century, before suffering a sudden and dramatic change of
fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the trenches being explored this summer yielded marble
slabs of a street, drain pipes and the stone side of a house near
the stadium. Other excavations have uncovered a coin hoard showing
that many of the houses were built before the early fifth century
A.D. Elsewhere, coins, pottery and metal objects of rooms date the
latest occupation of the buildings to the early seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to dig more of the houses of ordinary people that
have shown up in the survey, while continuing to catalog and
analyze the sculpture that has accumulated since systematic
excavations began here in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The excavations were directed for two decades by Dr. Kenan T.
Erim, a Turkish-born archaeologist at N.Y.U. whose main interest
was sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   From what has been learned so far, Aphrodisias was built on the
site of a rural sanctuary where the goddess Aphrodite, daughter of
Zeus, was worshiped.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone coming here expecting to find voluptuary art, recipes for
love potions or evidence of ancient orgies will be disappointed. A
commanding statue of Aphrodite here shows a robust, fully robed
goddess bearing little resemblance to the Aphrodite or Venus of the
Greek and Roman traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At lectures, I'm invariably asked about Aphrodite,'' Ratte
said. ``Did they practice ritual prostitution here? Not likely.
This Aphrodite was not your sex goddess of Greek religion. She was
a very local deity, stemming from the goddess Cybele of Asia Minor,
who became associated with Aphrodite but never lost her local
character.''
</P>
<P>
   The native gods of this region were usually conceived of as
feminine, Ratte noted, although they were not all fertility
goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   This Aphrodite appeared to be a warrior goddess and protector of
the place. ``It may be sexism to be viewing them always as
goddesses of fertility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a city, Aphrodisias had the good fortune to lie in the
fertile Meander River Valley, off the beaten track of invading
armies _ the ruins are 100 miles southeast of the Aegean port of
Izmir, ancient Smyrna. It came into its own in the time of Emperor
Augustus in the late first century B.C. ``I have selected this one
city from all of Asia to be my own,'' Augustus declared in offering
the city patronage and special protection.
</P>
<P>
   So the people of Aphrodisias, living near a quarry, celebrated
themselves and the good times of Roman rule with a profusion of
fine marble statues to gods, heroes, emperors and philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   This proved to be a gift to archaeologists, especially because
the city is all but ignored in surviving texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a statue culture, for which statues are a currency of
life and politics,'' Smith explained. ``If you are a great
benefactor to the city, you will be honored with a public statue.
This was typical after Alexander the Great. Greek democratic
culture before frowned on this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more generous benefactors in the city's building boom
seems to have been a man whose name and likeness appears on statues
and a frieze found near the fortification wall. He was Ziolus, who
was born here, became a slave in Rome and returned rich after being
freed by Augustus. He was credited with financing the 7,000-seat
theater and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are moving in other research directions, the
archaeologists defended their studies of the elite artifacts as
sources of valuable insights into a culture: what people did with
their surplus wealth, how the leading citizens conceived of
themselves and how the aristocracy sought to perpetuate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really best preserved at Aphrodisias is the kind of
material evidence for the high civic culture,'' Ratte said. ``We
don't learn much about ancient diet or living arrangements from it,
or anything about the common people. But that does not mean
beautiful objects and monumental buildings are just art history,
and not of anthropological interest.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the stadium, an oval of gray stone the length of
two American football fields, was built in the first century A.D.
with a seating capacity far greater than the population of the city
and its environs, probably about 10,000. Too big and impractical?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you could build it when you didn't need it, THAT
was the point,'' Ratte said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A prominent edifice in the civic center is the Sebasteion, a
kind of hall-of-fame to Roman emperors and other worthies, also
built in the first century A.D. From the layout of the ruins and
the many statues found there, Harry Mark, a Dallas architect
trained in archaeological research, has prepared detailed drawings
of what the colonnaded courtyard and temple looked like.
</P>
<P>
   In a storage depot, Smith pointed out the marble reliefs with
scenes from Greek mythology and depictions of Roman emperors in
heroic, godlike poses that once graced the Sebasteion. Here the
Aphrodisians are presumably revealed trying to come to terms with
those who held power not only over themselves but virtually the
whole world as it was known to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they represented them as gods,'' Ratte said, ``not just to
flatter the Romans but to make sense of the Romans to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in who was honored with statues seemed to mark a
significant transition in the city's government. After about A.D.
200, the tradition of memorializing the local aristocracy largely
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Governors appointed by Rome or, later, Constantinople became the
more usual subjects of statues. The city, archaeologists surmise,
had become less self-reliant and more dependent on imperial
administration and favor.
</P>
<P>
   In the late fourth or early fifth centuries, statues of two
governors, including Oikoumenios, were erected on inscribed bases
in a place of honor between the public square and the council
house.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that the headless statue of Oikoumenios was found in
1965. A team of workers under Michelle Berenfeld, a doctoral
student in archaeology at N.Y.U., came upon the head 40 feet away,
where it had long ago been dumped with dirt and other stones as
construction fill at the house of a prominent official.
</P>
<P>
   The Temple of Aphrodite itself underwent a transformation around
A.D. 500, reflecting a major change in the city's religion. As
archaeologists and architects have determined, some of the columns
on the east and west sides were dismantled and re-erected along the
north-south sides in such a way as to turn the temple into a much
larger church. The Christians of Byzantium were making an
ideological statement in stone.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists and other scholars cannot account for the city's
sharp decline. In the early seventh century, most of the
Aphrodisians moved out into the countryside. By the 13th century,
the place was completely abandoned, prey to pillagers, many of its
proudly carved stones burned into lime.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear, after 40 years of excavations, what moved the
Aphrodisians to such exuberant expressions in stone. They were not
powerful, or especially rich. Perhaps others in the region were
like them, who built in the spirit of Greece and thrived under
Rome, but time was not as kind to the ruins of their cities.
</P>
<P>
   The British writer Freya Stark came away from a visit to
unexcavated Aphrodisias in the 1950s with the impression that its
people had lived ``in undistinguished mediocrity and wealth,
enjoying their world and untroubled by its opinions, except for a
reasonable municipal pride in their city and its credit abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ionia: A Quest,'' Stark praised this attitude, in contrast
to what she called the inferiority complexes bred by the modern age
of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Aphrodisians, she wrote, must have ``had an inner security
through all the centuries of their submissions, because of that
genial interest in things for their own sake, which remained.''
</P>
<P>
   One evening, after another day of digging among the stones under
a blazing sun, the archaeologists and architects of the project,
their students and some visitors also seemed to take a genial
interest in things for their own sake. The dinner had been simple,
as usual. But spirits were enlivened by port and fine Stilton
cheese, a gift of Trevor Proudfoot, a stone conservator who had
arrived from England.
</P>
<P>
   Talk turned to the Aphrodisians. Were they an exceptional
culture? Not really. ``They were no more peace loving than
others,'' Ratte said. ``It's just that they came into prominence at
a time of great stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that the city's ruins were extraordinary, so
well-preserved and accessible, and that they might someday produce
insights into what made the Aphrodisians recognize stability as a
condition worth celebrating. For now, though, the archaeologists
lifted their glasses. It was satisfying to have the governor's head
replaced, a museum and storehouse full of sculpture and the new
survey showing the way to future exploration of Aphrodisias.

   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Desde hace por lo menos tres decadas,
todos los gobiernos mexicanos se cerraron con algun desastre.
</P>
<P>
   El de Gustavo Diaz Ordaz quedo mancillado para siempre por la
matanza de estudiantes en Tlatelolco, el 2 de octubre de 1968.
</P>
<P>
   El de Luis Echeverria Alvarez, por el despilfarro enloquecido de
los dineros publicos y por el golpe de censura que desalojo del
diario Excelsior a dos de las mayores figuras intelectuales del
pais: el periodista Julio Scherer y el escritor Octavio Paz.
</P>
<P>
   En 1982, Jose Lopez Portillo se marcho tras un terremoto
financiero que dejo el pais en estado de quiebra: la deuda externa
habia pasado en seis anos de 26 mil a 80 mil millones de dolares, y
el peso mexicano cayo de 22 a 150 por dolar.
</P>
<P>
   En julio de 1988, Miguel de la Madrid aprobo el fraude electoral
que concedio la presidencia a Carlos Salinas de Gortari: la noche
de los comicios, la derrota del candidato oficial era tan evidente
que se invento un desperfecto tecnico en el escrutinio para
manipular el resultado.
</P>
<P>
   Parecia que a Mexico no podia irle peor, pero le fue, en los
doce anos que siguieron. Salinas construyo una imagen _ falsa _ de
presidente modelo, hasta que el pais se le cayo encima. Once meses
antes de marcharse, el 1 de enero de 1994, nueve mil guerrilleros
zapatistas tomaron tres ciudades en el estado de Chiapas. Poco
despues, en marzo, caeria asesinado Luis Donaldo Colosio, candidato
a la sucesion. En setiembre habria otro crimen, el del secretario
general del partido de gobierno, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, y
esta vez se sabria casi con certeza que el asesino era el propio
hermano del presidente.
</P>
<P>
   Todos pensaron que la fatalidad iba a encarnizarse tambien con
la figura elegida de apuro para gobernar a Mexico durante el
sexenio siguiente. El descolorido Ernesto Zedillo heredo una
presidencia autoritaria, casi monarquica, un partido esclerosado y
renuente a ceder espacios de poder, y una corrupcion tan enquistada
ya en la vida publica que los mexicanos la creian consustancial a
las desdichas del pais.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico le debe ahora a Zedillo haber demolido todos esos
obstaculos con discrecion extrema. Cuando el se haya retirado de su
lugar de mando, el 1 de diciembre, el pais sera por completo
diferente. No se ha disuelto la corrupcion, pero la democracia ha
dejado de ser imperfecta, como lo fue durante casi toda la historia
mexicana.

   Al regresar a Mexico en 1976, despues de una ausencia de 10
anos, Octavio Paz escribio que cualquier transformacion que se
intentara en su pais exigia, ``como condicion previa, la reforma
democratica del regimen.'' Veinte anos despues, Zedillo hizo
pedazos la esclerosada osamenta del partido de gobierno, el PRI, e
inicio un profundo y sincero proceso de modernizacion politica. En
el PRI lo detestan, pero Mexico se lo agradece.
</P>
<P>
   Es ya dificil que, faltandole tres meses para irse, lo alcance
la fatalidad que persiguio a sus predecesores. Zedillo pago el
precio de la mala suerte al principio de su mandato, cuando toda la
armazon economica de Salinas se le derrumbo en las manos, y Mexico
fue salvado de la bancarrota por el salvavidas que le arrojo el
gobierno de Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Los reflectores se han concentrado ahora en Vicente Fox, el
candidato de oposicion elegido inesperadamente para sucederlo. Con
Fox, las esperanzas de Mexico han subido a las nubes.
</P>
<P>
   Yo no comparti ese entusiasmo, y creo que lo escribi en esta
columna. Desconfie de su estilo populista, de sus desaprensivas
contradicciones y de las promesas que iba regando a su paso, en
todas las cuales me parecio advertir cierta irresponsable tendencia
a la exageracion. Dude que el ex-gobernador de Guanajuato y
ex-presidente de la filial de Coca Cola, de cerrada formacion
conservadora, pudiera ejecutar la revolucion estructural que
predicaban sus partidarios de izquierda. El opaco Zedillo habia
sido capaz de hacer milagros, pero Fox parecia estar lleno de ruido
y escaso de nueces.
</P>
<P>
   Sorpresas te da la vida fue el titulo de un libro en el que
Jorge G. Castaneda, uno de los mas cercanos asesores de Fox, narro
las turbulencias de 1994. Las sorpresas, en verdad, son el pan
cotidiano de Mexico. A los pocos dias de ganar la eleccion, Fox dio
una serie de pasos que reflejan la madera de un estadista en serio.
</P>
<P>
   Visito a los candidatos derrotados y les pidio disculpas por las
frases de menoscabo que les habia dedicado durante la feroz
campana. Declaro que abriria la petroquimica a los capitales
privados. Aseguro que mantendria la empresa nacional de petroleos,
Pemex, en la esfera del Estado, pero evitando que siguiera siendo
el coto de caza donde se concedian favores a los politicos.
</P>
<P>
   A principios de agosto, emprendio un viaje a los paises del
Mercosur con una propuesta que, cuanto mas utopica parece, mas
atractiva se revela: la unidad de America Latina para enfrentar la
hegemonia economica de los Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   Parecia que, por tradicion y por formacion, Fox iba a inclinar
la balanza hacia el norte. Sucedio al reves: abrazo los proyectos
forjados por uno de los mas audaces pensadores de Mexico, Daniel
Cosio Villegas, quien proponia convertir ``la fatalidad geografica
de los paises latinoamericanos'' en una ventaja: ``Factores
historicos mas fuertes que las ideas y los sentimientos de los
hombres,'' escribio Cosio en 1948, ``trabajan a favor de la
unidad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox fue a explorar un territorio poco frecuentado por los
empresarios mexicanos _ Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brasil _ pero no
nuevo para el. En una entrevista que le hizo el escritor argentino
Martin Caparros poco antes de la eleccion, declaro que sus
convicciones neoliberales habian ido derivando con firmeza hacia la
social democracia despues de sus encuentros con el Grupo
Latinoamericano que armo Castaneda y del cual son miembros Raul
Alfonsin, Ricardo Lagos y Chacho Alvarez, entre otros. Conocia los
problemas del sur, por lo tanto, casi de primera mano.
</P>
<P>
   En visperas de otra jira de Fox, esta vez a los Estados Unidos,
supuse que iban a repetirse las contradicciones en las que el
presidente electo incurrio tantas veces durante su campana. No fue
asi.
</P>
<P>
   Fox no solo exigio que haya fronteras abiertas para los
trabajadores mexicanos _ que van y vienen todos los dias, por
millares, de un lado a otro del Rio Grande. Sino que tambien quiere
construir, en sociedad con los Estados Unidos, un mercado
gigantesco que enlace a los paises del Tratado de Libre Comercio
(NAFTA) con algunos socios potenciales del Mercosur: Brasil, Chile
y la Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junto con Mexico,'' dijo Fox, ``esos paises forman las cuatro
maquinas que haran de America Latina uno de los grandes poderes del
siglo XXI.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea ilusoria o no, la diplomacia de Fox es ahora una de las mas
agresivas y con mayor imaginacion de America Latina. En muchos de
esos arriesgados movimientos de ajedrez puede adivinarse el consejo
de un intelectual notable y de vasta experiencia internacional:
Jorge G. Castaneda.
</P>
<P>
   Pero el mayor merito es del propio Fox, que cambio su arrogancia
de candidato por la humildad de un vencedor que sabe hacia donde
sopla la realidad.

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush announces that Jesus is his favorite political
philosopher. Al Gore seeks moral guidance by invoking the pop
refrain ``WWJD? - What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   But as religious references infuse this year's presidential
campaign, another question arises: ``What would Jefferson do?''
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans in 2000, the answer would be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In his time, the author of the Declaration of Independence was
branded an atheist in some traditional religious circles. Like many
of the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson embraced a basic belief
in God - deism - but was also a man of science, intrigued by the
philosophies of the Age of Enlightenment, a European intellectual
movement that contended all of life, including religion, could be
understood through the process of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men who forged the new American nation embraced God
but distrusted organized religion, disdainful of abuses by the
powerful clergy who ruled the Church of England and held sway over
the English government itself. In one of his letters, Jefferson
charged that yoking church and state turned human beings into
``dupes and drudges.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to avoid such mischief, the framers of the U.S.
Constitution codified their concerns in the First Amendment:
``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson would interpret this as a mandate for the separation
of church and government. The article also would be construed not
only as freedom of religion but also freedom from religion.
</P>
<P>
   Americans today who hope to paint a picture of the founding
fathers as a pious bunch risk rewriting history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is really overstated,'' says John Corrigan,
professor of American studies and religious studies at Arizona
State University. ``They (the founding fathers) were not
particularly religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Brook Simpson, ASU professor of history and humanity, calls them
men of reason and enlightenment who saw God's will as expressed in
the laws of nature and whose mixed bag of ideas cannot be
appropriated to fit a particular agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on today is that they treat the founders as a sort
of cafeteria, where they get to pick and choose,'' Simpson says.
</P>
<P>
   The beliefs held by these 18th-century men were often at odds
with prevailing thought in a time when church and faith held
central roles in society.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, Jefferson was a conventional Christian, an
Anglican - the Church of England in the New World. He served as a
vestryman in his parish. He believed that religion holds society
together and goes hand in hand with morality. In the Declaration of
Independence, he refers variously to the creator, nature's God and
divine providence.
</P>
<P>
   But while Jefferson embraced the teachings of Jesus as a good
moral foundation, he doubted Jesus' divinity. He even rewrote the
New Testament, cutting and pasting passages to remove references to
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson ``preferred a world of science and rationality,''
Simpson says.
</P>
<P>
   So passionate was Jefferson about religious freedom that his
tombstone lists as his three greatest accomplishments the writing
of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, authoring the
Declaration of Independence and founding the University of
Virginia, a purposely secular institution in contrast with his own
Anglican-run alma mater, the College of William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The epitaph he requested omits his role as president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's friend and philosophical confederate, James Madison,
also professed a general belief in God and wrote in Memorial and
Remonstrance that an individual's duty to his ``universal
sovereign'' came before his civic responsibilities. But he shared
Jefferson's wariness of what was then termed ``priestcraft,'' or
clerical hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, an Anglican, had been educated at the College of New
Jersey, now Princeton University. Though the school had been
founded by the Presbyterian Church, he chose it for its aversion to
ministerial rule.
</P>
<P>
   As principal author of the U.S. Constitution, Madison was as
adamant as Jefferson about the Establishment clause. Like
Jefferson, he advocated ``a perfect separation between
ecclesiastical and civil matters.''
</P>
<P>
   During his presidency, Madison rejected requests to make
official religious proclamations or to declare religious holidays.
Citizens of the new United States, he insisted, would have to
accept the absence of a state religion - disestablishment.
</P>
<P>
   When creating the American government, its framers not only
believed fervently in disestablishment but also neatly avoided
choosing one religion from among the many faiths espoused in the
colonies, including Episcopalian (Anglican), Congregational (church
of the Pilgrims), Dutch Reformed, Presbyterian, Quaker, Methodist
and Calvinism.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland had been founded as a Roman Catholic colony but fell to
pressures from England to establish Anglican parishes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the American Revolution, Corrigan says there were
between 2,300 and 2,500 Jews living in America - with little
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complex figures in colonial religious life was
the venerable Benjamin Franklin. As a young man, Franklin had
undergone a conversion to Presbyterianism, but ``it didn't take,''
Corrigan says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for such a champion of democracy, Franklin was
something of an elitist when it came to religion, says Richard
Wenz, ASU professor emeritus of American religious studies. In a
letter to his daughter, Franklin encouraged her to attend church
services and to heed the message of the sermon. But for himself, he
believed he had evolved beyond the need for catechism.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jefferson, Franklin was more intrigued by science than
spirituality. Religion was an intellectual pursuit, useful for
moral grounding. A wise man graduated from the need for further
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he professed a belief in God and, just a month before his
death, answered a friend's request to state his Christian
principles, saying, ``I believe in one God, creator of the
universe. That he governs the world by his providence. That he
ought to be worshiped. That the most acceptable service we can
render to him, is doing good to his other children. That the soul
of man is immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   Immortality was a basic tenet of deism, along with a belief in
God and a love of freedom. America's second president, John Adams,
was solidly deist. For more than 60 years, he embraced the liberal
Unitarian church.
</P>
<P>
   Like his colleagues, Adams denounced the priestcraft and
believed the principles of Jesus had deteriorated into superstition
and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington wore his faith as humbly as he did his
political leadership, unfettered by doctrine. Though an Anglican
vestryman like Jefferson, he insisted that ``my tenets are few and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   To Washington, God was the ``grand architect'' of the universe,
``great ruler of events,'' ``higher cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The faith he expressed in conversation was generic.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, one of the richest and most provocative treatises
on early American religious thought was penned by master wordsmith
Thomas Paine, whose 1776 pamphlet Common Sense helped to incite
passions favorable to the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1794, Paine published Age of Reason. Son of a Quaker, Paine
said, ``I believe in one God and no more, and I hope for happiness
beyond this life.{hellip}I believe that religious duties consist in
doing justice, loving mercy and endeavoring to make our fellow
creatures happy.''John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence in
Congress, displayed in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, pictures
the founding fathers, who were intrigued with science and reason
and were not particularly religious.not needed

RIGHTS SUFFER AMID US-BACKED DRUG WAR IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA _ When they set off into the jungle that morning, they
were just children on a grade school field trip.
</P>
<P>
   Then they walked into an army ambush. Six of them died in a hail
of machine gun fire, and instantly they became tragic symbols in
the debate over protecting human rights as Colombia turns up the
heat in its US-supported campaign against drug growers and
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 students from a tiny rural school in Antioquia state were
heading to a nearby hacienda with their teacher and two mothers.
They had been walking for less than a half-hour when eight of them
pushed ahead into a thicket of shrubs and trees, and the shooting
started.
</P>
<P>
   The bullets were fired by Colombian soldiers who had been hiding
behind the bushes. In the early morning light and shadows, they had
mistaken the children for leftist guerrillas they had been pursuing
through the forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government and military leaders immediately called
the August 15 shooting ``human error'' and suspended the soldiers
pending an investigation, but the killings sharply escalated the
growing public outrage here over the Colombian military's checkered
human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this climate of controversy that President Bill Clinton
make a brief visit Wednesday to this violence-scarred country to
personally promote a $1.3 billion US aid package to help fight this
country's exploding illegal drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, has already taken a stand in the debate.
Against the wishes of human rights activists in the United States
and Colombia, he signed a waiver last week that allows the aid
money to be delivered despite Colombia's failure to meet six
conditions in the aid package designed to protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in a press conference in Washington, human rights
officials again criticized both Clinton and Colombian President
Andres Pastrana. The two men will meet Wednesday in the coastal
city of Cartagena _ the first visit by a US president to the
country in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Accidental or not, the shooting of the children in Antioquia has
shown how difficult it is to shield civilians from the three-decade
war that has ravaged this South American country and cost an
estimated 300,000 casualties. The violence escalated dramatically
in the last decade as leftist guerrillas and right-wing
paramilitary groups became more involved in Colombia's cocaine and
heroin trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday another 20 people were killed in two separate massacres
blamed on paramilitaries, government officials and news reports
said. Ten were killed execution-style in Cienaga, while another ten
men were taken from a pool hall and shot point-blank, allegedly for
being sympathizers with leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil war is not a spectator sport,'' said one Bogota
political analyst who requested anonymity for fear of retribution
from one of the many armed groups in the country's civil war.
``Ordinary people are in as much danger as the troops themselves,
which is why it should be government's obligation to protect our
human rights, and so far it has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the soldiers' remorse over the children's deaths, public
anger was so great that it overshadowed what should have been a
high point for the Colombia's military: the heroic rescue of six
hostages, including Guillermo Cortes, a well-known Colombian
journalist, from a rebel hideout in Cudinamarca state three days
earlier. More than 100 paratroopers carried out the nighttime
operation, surprising rebel troops of the leftist FARC and freeing
the hostages without suffering a single casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be the first to lament a tragic accident, but to say we
are a constant violator of human rights is not fair or true,''
Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said in an interview Monday.
``I think the Colombian people know that when it comes to human
rights they'd rather trust the military much more than either the
guerrillas or paramilitary groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials hope that the US aid package, which was
proposed by the Clinton administration and approved by Congress
this summer, will boost their drug eradication efforts and give
them new leverage in negotiating a peaceful end to the conflict.
Colombia's drug production, which accounts for about 90 percent of
the illegal narcotics sold in the United States, has doubled in the
past five years as insurgent groups have entered the drug trade to
finance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, at the midpoint of an administration that has seen
both increased violence and a severe economic crisis, is also
counting on the aid to bolster his sagging popularity and to
support his broad social agenda, known as Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But the aid package has received mostly mixed reviews from
Colombians. Some fear the money will lead to more war and endanger
or displace thousands. Others worry that the heavy military
emphasis of the plan _ which includes 18 Blackhawk and 42 Huey
helicopters and increased US military training _ will draw too much
American involvement in a war that can't be won.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also fear that more hardware and more fighting will
produce more human rights abuses by all sides: leftist guerrillas,
right-wing paramilitary groups linked to the government, and the
military itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are human rights abuses on all sides,'' said
Mauricio Escobar, a 25-year-old college student in Bogota, who
joined tens of thousands of residents in a protest march Sunday.
``These dialogues for peace that we've seen have been like lukewarm
water, sometimes hot and sometimes cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said the aid package will help strengthen the military's
human rights training and internal judicial system, including the
creation of a US-style judge advocate general's office to prosecute
soldiers and officers accused of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has defended the waiver by saying that Pastrana has
recently taken steps to meet the human rights conditions. Other US
officials said withholding the aid money would have also affect
funding for human rights programs.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the positive steps cited by Clinton, the Colombian
president issued a directive August 17 requiring military personnel
accused of human rights abuses to stand trial before civil courts,
rather than a more lenient military court.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights advocates say the Pastrana directive does not
go far enough to ensure that soldiers accused of abuses will be

   ``The real question is one of implementation and the fact that
we've seen a number of presidential decrees regarding human rights
reforms, none of which have been implemented,'' said Winifred Tate,
a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, one of
the groups that has criticized Clinton's support for the Colombian
military. ``We hope the US will use its influence to change this
situation, but we're distressed by the lack of progress to date by
the Pastrana administration.''

<P>
   The world's most decadent luxuries usually are found in very
specific places.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the finest champagne? Go to France.
</P>
<P>
   The richest chocolate? Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The softest cashmere? Elgin, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The tastiest sausage? Elgin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest running backs? Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There sits the University of Southern California, which through
the years has produced the creme de la creme of college football's
pre-eminent ball carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, (Charles) White and
Marcus Allen,'' said ESPN analyst Beano Cook, whose career in
college football spans five decades. ``You've heard the famous
line, `Student body right, student body left?' That came from USC's
running attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatness can be measured in statistics and rewarded with
trophies (Garrett, Simpson, White and Allen all exceeded 1,400
yards rushing, and each won a Heisman Trophy at USC), but name
association provides true legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   So, when a college establishes a tradition of great players at a
position, it becomes synonymous with that position.
</P>
<P>
   Take Penn State, which became known as Linebacker U for
producing players such as Jack Ham, Shane Conlan, Matt Millen,
David Robinson and Andre Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened is Penn State had a bunch of linebackers
that did well in pro football,'' Cook said. ``On Monday nights,
(Howard) Cosell would always mention it and say, `Where is he
from?' And then Don Meredith would say, `Where else, Penn State?'
That helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like running backs at USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Or defensive backs at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy running backs Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams
starred at Texas, but the Longhorns are best known for backs on the
defensive side.
</P>
<P>
   NFL defensive backs to come through Texas include Tom Landry,
Stanley Richard, William Graham, Bobby Johnson, Derrick Hatchett,
Ricky Churchman, Chris Carter, Taje Allen, Mossy Cade, Vance
Bedford, Glen Blackwood, Van Malone and Lance Gunn.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't even top the Longhorns' list.
</P>
<P>
   That's headed by Johnnie Johnson, Jerry Gray, Bill Bradley and
Raymond Clayborn, who all enjoyed distinguished NFL careers, and
Bryant Westbrook, who still is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a stretch in the mid-80s when I was active where
they put on the (television) screen the number of defensive backs
on active squads in the NFL from Texas,'' Johnson said. ``They
needed two screens to put all the guys on the screen. There was an
old saying: If you wanted to prepare for the NFL as a defensive
back, go to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said there are three factors in building a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Great athletes. (Such as Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   A system that attracts athletes. (Man-to-man coverage).
</P>
<P>
   Coaches who are good teachers. (Johnson's position coach was
Alan Lowry.)
</P>
<P>
   The coaches change (Lowry is now coaching in the NFL), but the
contributing factors remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition has to be developed and produced,'' Johnson said.
``It just doesn't appear. Someone had to establish that
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thinks Texas' reputation for turning out defensive backs
started with Clayborn, who was the New England Patriots'
first-round draft choice in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   More accurately, it might be traced back to Bradley, who was a
third-round choice of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1969 and
eventually made the Pro Bowl from 1972-74.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said the source of Texas' reputation isn't as
important as the need for the current defensive backs to realize
there is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players coming in to play in the secondary need to know they
have a tradition to uphold,'' Johnson said. ``We won't expect
anything less. We expect you to take the torch and run with it. I
took it to a new level, and I expect you to take it to a higher
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were struggling in the secondary it hurt us like you
wouldn't believe. We take so much pride in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The current defensive backs seem to understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told what expectations we have to live up to when I
first got here,'' Longhorns junior Quentin Jammer said. ``You're
not supposed to be a good defensive back at Texas. You're supposed
to be a great defensive back.''
</P>
<P>
   Producing great players is not enough. The production must be at
least fairly consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not known as a quarterback school. It should not be.
</P>
<P>
   The late Bobby Layne was an All-America quarterback in 1947. The
next Longhorns' All-America quarterback was Marty Akins in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what's 28 years?
</P>
<P>
   But turning out great players doesn't always guarantee building
a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as part of Woody Hayes' enduring legacy, casual
observers might still think of Ohio State's offense as three yards
and a cloud of dust. Actually, it's difficult to find a program
that can match the Buckeyes' receiving alumni of Cris Carter, Joey
Galloway, Terry Glenn, David Boston and Paul Warfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something because they went all those years and never
threw the ball,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's quarterback alumni also are overshadowed by the
Crimson Tide's historically run-oriented offense.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is not thought of as a quarterback school, although NFL
Hall of Famers Joe Namath and Bart Starr, as well as Ken Stabler _
who combined for four Super Bowl victories _ and Richard Todd and
Jeff Rutledge played there
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quarterback school in a different way because in their
dominant years they ran the wishbone,'' University of Texas Coach
Mack Brown said. ``It's like how (Texas) had Marty Akins, who was a
great (wishbone) quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Miami is a quarterback school from when they had the
(Bernie) Kosars and guys like that. Florida State had a run of
guys. UCLA is a quarterback school, BYU and Washington has had four
or five guys. There's more quarterbacks to come out of (Washington)
than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lavell Edwards brought a wide-open passing offense to
Brigham Young, and eventual NFL quarterbacks Steve Young, Jim
McMahon, Ty Detmer, Gifford Nielsen and Marc Wilson flourished in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would ask Lavell how he kept getting good
quarterbacks,'' Brown said. ``He'd say, `I recruit good
quarterbacks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Duh.
</P>
<P>
   You doubt it's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the chicken-or-the-egg question: Did great
quarterbacks make BYU? Or did BYU make great quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``The real good schools do a high level of recruiting for
dominant players. They get a lot of publicity, so they get more
prominent players,'' Brown said. ``Usually there's a trend. We had
great running backs in the past because we played the wishbone.
Then with Fred (Akers) we went to the `I,' so running backs were
important. If you have a great running game you need great running
backs, and then you get great offensive linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California obviously did. It's no coincidence the
school that produced college football's greatest runners also
produced Anthony Munoz, Ron Mix and Ron Yary _ all NFL Hall of Fame
linemen _ as well as Bruce Matthews and Tony Boselli.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on when a school is good and what is their
emphasis,'' Brown said. ``Every school is known for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown wants Texas to continue its tradition of defensive backs,
but he also wants to be known for something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to recruit quarterbacks,'' Brown said.
``We want to be a quarterbacks school.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas?
</P>
<P>
   A quarterbacks school?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Bobby Layne must be laughing.

TOP INDONESIAN ECONOMIST WANTS TO REDUCE ROLE OF IMF 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Two days after he was sworn in as
Indonesia's economic czar, Rizal Ramli said Monday that the
International Monetary Fund had become overly involved in the nuts
and bolts of the country's economy in the course of its $43 billion
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Ramli, an outspoken economist who has long been critical of the
fund, said he wanted to renegotiate the IMF agreement with
Indonesia to limit the fund's role to broader issues like
macroeconomics and monetary policy. ``By doing that, we reduce the
destabilization that comes every time we review the program,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramli, who was named coordinating minister for economic affairs
by Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, as part of a recent
shuffling of the country's Cabinet, said he had spoken to officials
at the fund, who said they were willing ``to exchange views and
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new team,'' Ramli said in an interview. ``We would
like to have a better sense of ownership of the program, so we can
sell it to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Indonesia's fragile recovery from the Asian economic
crisis, and its continued dependence on money from the IMF, it is
not clear how much leverage Ramli will have. But his comments
underscore Indonesia's desire to present a more assertive and
decisive face to foreign governments and markets, which have
watched with alarm as the country has slid into near-chaos in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a no-nonsense guy, and I want results,'' Ramli said.
``When you're in a crisis, you don't have the luxury of holding
long, analytical discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramli acknowledged that Indonesia's new Cabinet got off to a
wobbly start last week. Critics say it is stacked with loyalists of
Wahid and devoid of allies of the popular vice president, Megawati
Sukarnoputri. Those concerns, many said, rattled Indonesia's stock
market and sent its currency, the rupiah, into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati stoked the controversy by pointedly skipping the news
conference at which Wahid announced the Cabinet. Ramli described
the president and vice president as being like a brother and
sister, who might ``quarrel and grumble'' but would never ``damage
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, under pressure from Indonesia's Parliament,
Wahid agreed to delegate some of his power to Megawati. Ramli said
the vice president would play a central role in developing policy,
noting that he and the chief political minister would meet Megawati
for breakfast every Monday morning _ before meeting with Wahid the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors were also unnerved that Wahid named as finance
minister a former banker who had failed a government test to head a
state bank. The banker, Prijadi Praptosuhardjo, was disqualified
after failing a ``fit and proper'' test that assessed his character
and past dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Ramli, who came to prominence for his attacks on corruption
during the regime of former President Suharto, said Prijadi was a
product of that era. Nevertheless, he said the new finance minister
was a ``relatively decent man,'' with whom he could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption in the Suharto era was of two types,'' Ramli said.
``Active corruption, in which you squeeze businesses for money, and
passive corruption, which is like getting thank-you notes. I would
venture to say he belongs in the second category.''
</P>
<P>
   As chief economics minister, Ramli will chart Indonesia's
economic policy and be its public face to the financial markets and
agencies like the IMF. His predecessor, Kwik Kian Gie, was
criticized for his scholarly bent, which critics said translated
into halting policies.
</P>
<P>
   With a doctorate in economics from Boston University, Ramli, 47,
is also an academic. But his most recent job was running Bulog, the
state logistics agency, which was a den of corruption during the
Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   ``That he is willing to criticize the IMF is nothing new,'' said
Gustav F. Papanek, an economist who was Ramli's doctoral adviser at
Boston University. ``He is someone who has the courage of his
convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Parliament voted Monday to investigate allegations
that money was misappropriated at Bulog by a former aide to Wahid.
The incident predated Ramli's tenure there. The Parliament also
approved an investigation of possible misuse of funds involving a
donation from the sultan of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was only his first day on the job, Ramli issued a
10-point plan to rebuild Indonesia's economy. He said the
government planned to increase spending on public-works projects in
rural areas to reduce unemployment and increase wages. And he said
Jakarta would spend more on military troops to police strife-torn
parts of the country, like the Spice Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The perception that Indonesia was coming apart at the seams, he
said, was the main reason investors have steered clear of the
country. He said the violence contributed to the chronic weakness
of the rupiah, which closed Monday at 8,245 rupiah to the U.S.
dollar. Without such instability, Ramli said, the rupiah would
trade at 7,500 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the Jakarta stock market has slid more than 19
percent. Monday, the benchmark index closed down 1.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception in the markets is far away from the reality,''
Ramli said. Indonesia's economy, he said, could grow 4 percent this
year.

POLITICS IN BACKGROUND AS RENO MULLS DEUTCH ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Attorney General Janet Reno decides to prosecute
former CIA director John M. Deutch for mishandling government
secrets, it could be because the political climate, as much as the
law, requires it.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, a professor and former provost at MIT, has admitted that
he breached security rules when he placed large volumes of
classified material on unsecure computers at his home while he
headed the CIA from May 1995 to December 1996. Earlier this year,
Deutch publicly apologized for the violation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Justice Department refused to comment on new reports
that a special prosecutor appointed by Reno to probe the Deutch
case is recommending criminal charges be sought against Deutch for
the security breach. If Reno goes forward, such a prosecution would
be the first ever for a Cabinet-rank official.
</P>
<P>
   It would come in a season of public outrage over the federal
government's failure to safeguard its top-secret information _ from
the case against nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee and missing computer
hard drives at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to the State
Department misplacing laptop computers that contained sensitive
material. And it would answer some of the loud election-year
criticism from Republicans in Congress that the Clinton
administration has assembled a sorry record on security.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Deutch nor his lawyer answered requests for interviews
Monday. But Senator John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a member of the
Intelligence Committee, said it would be wrong to ``allow this
incident to become a political football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that this situation is laden with just that
potential: Politics could conspire to elevate the Deutch situation
_ one man's serious error in judgment _ to embarrass an entire
administration,'' the Massachusetts senator said in a statement.
``I think that would be a mistake, particularly as it appears that
we're dealing here with one case of foibles, however
outrageous...rather than systemic troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry noted that Deutch's security clearances had been lifted
earlier this year by CIA director George J. Tenet after a report by
the agency's inspector general asserted that Deutch knew his home
computers were vulnerable to Internet hacking but had taken no
steps to secure them. The report said there was no evidence that
secrets had been compromised, but it did criticize top CIA
officials for being slow in investigating the breach once it was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As as result of the report, three current and three former CIA
officials have been disciplined for their role in the probe. It
also prompted Reno to reverse herself _ she had initially closed
the case against Deutch _ and name Paul E. Coffey, a retired
Justice Department prosecutor, to work with the FBI to investigate
the security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch disclosures come as defense lawyers for Lee, a
naturalized US citizen born in Taiwan and charged with illegally
transferring and copying Los Alamos's nuclear secrets, say their
client is a victim of racial profiling. They have asked the judge
handling Lee's case to find out why the Justice Department
prosecuted Lee for allegedly downloading top-secret information,
recommended he be held for months under tight security in a Sante
Fe, N.M., jail, and argued against bail while no charges were
brought against Deutch, who also put classified material on his
home computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a problem. The Justice Department put Wen Ho Lee in
shackles, and they did nothing to Deutch, whose actions certainly
have the appearance of recklessness,'' said Theodore Postol, a
professor of science, technology, and national security at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Postol, who has been outspoken in criticizing his MIT colleague,
said that depending on the contents of the classified documents,
Deutch's security breach was potentially life-threatening to
intelligence agents in the field. He called his action akin ``to
driving through a pedestrian mall at 100 miles an hour and arguing
that because you didn't kill anybody, you did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A former senior Defense official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the breach that Deutch acknowledged is serious, and
it was aggravated by the fact that the Pentagon was not informed
for ``at least a year'' after the discovery that sensitive defense
documents were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal,'' the Defense official said. ``Why was he so
absent-minded to not want to have a hardened computer in his home?
He used a regular computer, with no safeguards, and he surfed the
Internet. It boggles your mind why he was so insistent on not
having a hardened computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In using a secure computer, all the information on the
hard-drive must be downloaded after use, a procedure that can take
up to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Simpson, an expert on intelligence matters at
American University's School of Communication, says what Deutch did
is far from uncommon among top government officials; presidential
libraries are filled with classified documents that never were
meant to enter the public domain. But the Deutch case comes as the
country is in what Simpson calls ``a moral panic,'' fed by
politicians and media reports, about official secrets being
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we have seen so far, for Reno to prosecute Deutch
would be a very questionable decision,'' Simpson said. ``But there
is a moral panic going on that has to do with the handling of
sensitive information, and Deutch may be the right man at the wrong
time.''

 &HT;    Circus pitches its big tent by the park
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Early Monday morning, it rose slowly above the
northwest edge of Centennial Olympic Park, downtown, white with red
stars and chevrons, looking like a mammoth angel food cake topped
with strawberry slices. It's the performance tent of ``Barnum's
Kaleidoscape,'' opening Sept. 8. The big top is the first in
decades to be erected downtown and the first from the venerable
Ringling Brothers to rise in Atlanta since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tent of the Cirque du Soleil Age, however _ similar in
shape, size (214 feet across, 50 feet high inside) and comforts
(air conditioning) to that hip Canadian-based circus, coming to a
Turner Field site in November. So, at the paved circus lot (owned
by sponsor Coca-Cola), there was no sawdust or hemp rope, no
essence du elephant wafting on the breeze. The scene looked more
like the setup for a rock festival. Electric winches hoisted the
thick plastic tent on four steel masts loaded with lighting and
sound equipment. There was plenty of work for roustabouts, though:
hosing grime off the tent from its recent Pittsburgh engagement and
tightening support cables _ three men to a cable, yanking in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Ringling launched Kaleidoscape last year to
cash in on the Cirque craze with similar, theatrical,
European-style acts. But the American outfit does bring back a few
beloved critters that the Cirque disdains: prancing white horses
and a gaggle of geese, directed at eye level by a Hungarian midget.
The most distinctive feature of the circus, says spokeswoman Becky
Guthrie, is that ``It's all about luxury! We have red plush seats,
hardwood floors, beautiful designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come out to the lobby tent after the show, to have
dessert and talk to the performers,'' Guthrie adds, ``they'll feel
like they're in P.T. Barnum's parlor in Victorian times.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnum's Kaleidoscape
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sept. 8. 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays-Fridays; 2 and 7:30 p.m.
Saturdays; 1:30 and 6:30 p.m. Sundays. $25-$55. Through Oct. 8.
Under the tent at 284 Techwood Drive N.W. (adjacent to Centennial
Olympic Park).

BUSH ATTACKS GORE ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush Monday unleashed some of his
harshest education criticism of Al Gore to date, accusing the vice
president of offering a plan ``with an illusion of
accountability,'' of presiding over a ``national tragedy'' in
reading, and of being ``locked in old ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential contender unloaded before heading
off Tuesday for Maine and New Hampshire, making his first trip back
to the Granite State since his loss in its Feb. 1 primaries. And,
as he did after his 18-point defeat by Senator John S. McCain of
Arizona, Bush responded to his recent sag in the polls with a sharp
attack on his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore offers more of the same,'' Bush told
reporters he summoned to the tree-capped garden of the Governor's
Mansion to announce the formation of a group called ``Educators for
Bush.'' ``He will not end the status quo because he is the status
quo. He offers the failed ideas of the past. I'm offering new
ideas, ideas that are working.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a hallmark of his plan is greater school, teacher,
and student accountability, the Texas governor declared: ``Schools
should not be rewarded for failure and neither should this
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Bush plans to hold an education discussion at the Moore
Middle School in Portland, Maine. Tuesday evening he is to attend a
$5,000-per-couple fund-raiser for the New Hampshire Republican
Party at the Rye, N.H., home of Cabletron co-founder Craig Benson.
Wednesday he is scheduled to hold another education discussion at
Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign fended off Bush's criticism by citing a litany
of educational improvements since the vice president took office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Mr. Bush hasn't done his homework,'' said Gore
spokeswoman Kym Spell. ``Vice President Gore has a real plan to
improve education in this country, and if Mr. Bush is so sure of
his harsh criticism today, then he needs to be willing to sit down
with the vice president and have an honest, civil debate on these
issues. The American people expect and deserve to hear a debate
from their presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proclaimed improving education as the top priority of
his administration, while Gore has said his first priority would be
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-week focus on education coinciding with the start
of school, Bush has been highlighting his proposals to test all
students in grades 3 through 8; spend $5 billion on reading
programs; appropriate nearly $600 million in additional aid, mostly
for teacher training; and refocus Head Start into an early learning
program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a wider array of federal programs, including
ensuring pre-kindergarten for all 4-year-olds; $10,000 ``signing
bonuses'' for the first 75,000 teacher who agree to work in inner
city and rural areas; and $25 billion in bonds for new school
construction.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is strongly supported by teachers unions, the
governor said ``Educators for Bush'' shows he, too, has frontline
support. The group is currently organized in eight states, but Bush
said it would be expanded to all 50 in ``the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those at the news conference, Laura Owens, a teacher at
Barron County High School in Lexington, Ky., pointed to rising test
scores in Texas as proof that the Bush plan will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have a plan that's just on paper, like others. He
has a plan that has been implemented and worked in the state of
Texas. I want that to work in Kentucky and I want that to work
across the United States,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to his student-testing proposal, Bush noted that Gore
supports a voluntary national test that would be administered in
only the fourth and eighth grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore offers only an illusion of
accountability,'' he said, likening it to a company that releases
its earnings ``once every three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   On reading, he added: ``In seven years in office, my opponent
presides over a national tragedy: 70 percent of fourth graders in
our highest-poverty states cannot read.''
</P>
<P>
   Spell said Gore has pushed accountability and cited the
administration's decision in 1996 to close 100 Head Start centers
that did not meet national standards. She said the administration
already has the goal of teaching every child to read by third
grade, backed up with $260 million in federal grants. Spell also
said Gore supports testing new teachers and peer reviews for
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Bush visited Maine in June for a working vacation at his family
home in Kennebunkport. Reminded that he was making his first visit
back to New Hampshire since his primary loss, Bush chuckled when
asked what he had learned there last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that first place is better than second place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to seeing my friends in New Hampshire and hope
full well I can reach some of John McCain's supporters and carry
that important state.''
</P>
<P>
   A June poll by the American Research Group showed Bush ahead of
Gore in New Hampshire, 49 percent to 39 percent.

TURKEY DROPS ITS CASE AGAINST ISLAMIC LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ In an abrupt reversal, a state security court
on Monday dismissed an arrest warrant for an Islamic leader accused
by prosecutors of trying to overthrow the secular government.
</P>
<P>
   The state security court here said the case against the leader,
Fetullah Gulen, was too weak to support the warrant issued this
month. The court made its decision after reviewing 12 volumes of
files on Gulen assembled by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nuh Mete Yuksel, said the
decision was wrong and pledged to open another investigation into
the activities of Gulen and his followers. Gulen's lawyers said the
decision stopped the prosecutor from starting another inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen, 62, is a prominent Islamic leader who has been friendly
with senior politicians and religious leaders. He is the spiritual
leader of a loosely knit Islamic community that operates hundreds
of schools in Turkey, the Balkans and Central Asia, as well as
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Yuksel, a prosecutor for the security court in
Ankara, opened a criminal investigation of Gulen after television
stations had broadcast excerpts from videocassettes in which he
seemed to urge followers to be patient in infiltrating government.
</P>
<P>
   Yuksel said his inquiry found that Gulen had plotted to replace
the secular government with an Islamic regime, a crime punishable
by death. His effort to obtain an arrest warrant for Gulen was
rejected by one court in Ankara. But on Aug. 11, a second court
there agreed to issue the warrant, though no formal charges were
specified.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen's lawyers appealed the decision, and the security court
here reviewed the case. After having examined the prosecution's
files, that court issued its three-page decision, saying that there
was insufficient evidence to arrest Gulen.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, denied the accusations last
week and said that his enemies had altered the videos. He said he
only wanted Turkey to be more tolerant of ethnic and religious
diversity. He has been receiving medical care in the United States
for the last year.

   The prickly and outspoken interior minister, Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, will resign Tuesday, French news organizations
reported, quoting government officials claiming to be privy to a

   Nestle will contribute $14.6 million to the $1.25 billion

of his ruling Parti Quebecois. Since the 1995 referendum, which the
separatists narrowly lost, Quebec's unemployment rate has fallen to
8.8 percent from 14 percent, and a $4 billion budget deficit has
been turned into the first surplus in 40 years. Bouchard did not
set a date for a vote _ which would be the third in 20 years _ on
Quebec separation, but said his party would start campaigning this

MFS TAKES FUNDING LEAD FOR SITARA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mutual fund managers are becoming coveted sources of
late-stage venture capital for start-ups that aim to go public.
</P>
<P>
   MFS Investment Management says it will take the lead in a $15.5
million round of financing for Sitara Networks Inc. of Waltham. The
Boston mutual-fund pioneer made its bet alongside the likes of
investment bankers Deutsche Bank and Thomas Weisel Partners, as
well as another fund group, San Francisco's Van Wagoner Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Sitara is in the hot field of telecommunications, selling
hardware to help companies route traffic efficiently on data and
voice networks. Telecom-related deals are the IPO flavor of the
summer, and a venture investment assures a generous serving of
shares when a company goes public _ and potential big gains for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   MFS, whose Technology Fund made the Sitara investment, declined
to discuss its new strategy for investing in pre-IPO companies. But
its name was emblazoned on Sitara's funding announcement,
illustrating the star power that start-ups are seeking from their
venture backers.
</P>
<P>
   John Lambros, vice president of business development at Into
Networks Inc., a Cambridge broadband player that recently raised $5
million from Boston mutual-fund giant Putnam Investments, said fund
companies tend to be longer-term investors than venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some investors that may want to get in and flip
quickly, these guys have longer staying power,'' Lambros said. And
having investors with strong reputations at the outset is seen as a
boon in attracting interest in a stock: ``To have two of the
pillars of the institutional investing community behind you when it
comes time to do the IPO, that's a huge plus,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments' venture arm, Fidelity Ventures, also
backed Into Networks. So far, Fidelity has not invested in any
private companies through its mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   While the trend toward betting a small slice of assets on
venture capital is clear among some aggressive fund managers, it's
by no means being done everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Malouf, comanager of the aggressive, small-stock Millenium
fund at Neuberger &AMP; Berman in Boston, observed that the risks of
investing in venture capital are bigger than with publicly traded
stocks. Indeed, a fund manager can't easily sell a venture
investment. Investors typically make their money on a private
company when it is acquired or when it sells shares to the public.
If the climate sours for IPOs, as it did earlier this year, it can
be years before investors see any returns.
</P>
<P>
   The rush among funds to make such investments, he said, ``is in
some part a reflection of the success the VCs have had over the
last three to five years.'' But, he said, ``That success is going
to be hard to duplicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam executives say their analysts and portfolio managers are
accustomed to meeting company managers and assessing risks in order
to make investments. They consider it part of their job to stay on
top of hot companies before they go public. And they like the
chance of getting a bigger pop for investors by betting money
earlier on start-ups with promising technology.
</P>
<P>
   Into Networks's Lambros, a former investment banker at Morgan
Stanley, said big investors can be helpful in providing
introductions to large, publicly traded companies. They're also
great sounding boards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a wealth of connections and some of the best
buy-side research out there,'' he said of Putnam and Fidelity.
``It's really an awesome wealth of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's new Technology Fund plans to invest up to 5 percent of
its assets in private equity. The firm's OTC fund also has done
tens of millions of dollars in venture deals this year, and a
Putnam offshore fund makes similar investments.

MARKET GAUGES NEAR RECORD LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad advance Monday, and major
market gauges crept close to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Led by American Express and General Motors, the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 60.21 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,252.84.
The gain put the blue-chip index less than 30 points from its April
11 high of 11,287.08.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also neared record levels,
climbing 7.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,514.09. Gains in EMC,
General Electric and Oracle pulled the index higher. Its peak of
1,527.46 was set on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose for the 10th time in the last 12
sessions, gaining 27.91 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,070.59. The
advance put the Nasdaq ahead for the year.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq is up 0.03 percent; the S&AMP;P 500 is
up 3.1 percent; and the Dow is down 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With many on vacation, trading volume was light. On the New York
Stock Exchange, some 733.6 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You love to see an up market, but with the volume as poor as
it is, it is difficult to tell what it means,'' said Ned Collins,
head trader at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   With activity at a fairly low ebb, Collins and other traders
said there were no real problems with the introduction of
decimalization on 13 listed stocks. But they said a bigger
challenge could well come at the end of next month, when a much
larger group of stocks is scheduled to be quoted in pennies instead
of fractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to draw any earth-shattering conclusions,'' said
Michael Clark, head of global stock trading at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``There is a reason they decided to introduce this in late
summer, when the volumes are low.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, American Express rose $3.31, to $59.88 a
share. IBM gained $2, to $131, after an analyst from Credit Suisse
First Boston said the stock could reach $150 a share over the next
12 months. GM gained $3.63, to $74.50.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, Microsoft and Cisco Systems were the most actively traded
issues Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Intel gained 94 cents, to $73.88; Microsoft rose 69 cents, to
$71.31; and Cisco closed at $66.07, up 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo was a big decliner among technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock plunged $12.25, to $122, after an analyst at Lehman
Brothers said problems for Yahoo, the largest Internet search
company, continued to worsen because of sluggish advertising
revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a very good day for brokerage firms and financial
services stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch rose $2.88, to $140.25; Lehman Brothers jumped
$3.88, to $137.25; Goldman Sachs closed at $122, up $2.63; and
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette gained $4.69, to $65.81.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership has clearly shifted to sectors that are
interest-rate sensitive,'' said Jim Paulson, chief investment
officer at Wells Capital Management. ``I think we are going to new
highs.''

WAKEFIELD ROTATED _ OUT OF STARTING POSITION _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Tim Wakefield formed a portrait of
frustration, sitting alone in the Red Sox bullpen before the game
with the Devil Rays, staring into the distance of Tropicana Field
and perhaps his future.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield was absorbing the latest blow to his career and his
ego -- the news that he has been yanked again from the starting
rotation, this time to make way for Ramon Martinez, who will start
Saturday at Fenway against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Wakefield had refrained from publicly
expressing the kind of anger he has vented before when the Sox have
taken away the starting job he believes he merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even bother,'' the knuckleballer told a group of
approaching reporters. ``I've got nothing to say. Absolutely
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The hammer fell after Wakefield got pounded for nine runs (seven
earned) on eight hits and three walks in five innings Sunday in
Kansas City. With the loss, Wakefield (6-9) was winless in his last
eight starts since July 18, and his ERA in that stretch had
ballooned to 7.58.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (8-6), who has seen no big-league action in August
after an abysmal July, showed signs last Friday that he had
regained his form. Pitching for Pawtucket in Buffalo, he allowed
only two hits, one walk and no earned runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, noting the team is in the heat of a
pennant race with only 34 games to go, said there is little time to
dawdle over personnel decisions. He said Wakefield will pitch out
of the bullpen and probably get a start or two as the Sox play 34
games in the next 34 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this enough to tell you that he should start?'' Williams
said of Martinez's outing in Buffalo. ``Well, we're going to find
out. . . . If Ramon's skills are good enough to help us win, then
we need to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency comes at an inopportune time for Wakefield, who for
several weeks this summer was Boston's most dependable starter
other than Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   He is earning about $4.5 million this year and the Sox have to
decide whether they want to exercise their option to renew the
contract next year. By pitching out of the bullpen, Wakefield may
have a harder time making the case that he is worth the Sox's
money.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox also have an option on Ramon Martinez valued at more
than $8 million. And Ramon has been anxious to return to action and
try to prove that he is better than the 6.14 ERA he has compiled
this season.
</P>
<P>
   He will pitch in a simulated game Tuesday to stay sharp for
Saturday's return. ``I've been waiting for the chance,'' he said.
``Now they are going to give me that opportunity and I'm going to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wakefield, who was abruptly yanked from the starting
rotation just before the season started to make room for the newly
acquired Pete Schourek, it was another lost opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans might argue that he lost this chance himself. But he
clearly holds the view that the starting spot should be his.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Sunday whether his starting job might be in jeopardy,
he said, ``I don't make the decisions around here. I made something
like 10 quality starts. Now I've had three bad ones, and you're
asking me if I'm out of the rotation. Don't ask me that. That's
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield's woes have stemmed largely from the unpredictable
nature of his knuckler. In one of his lowest moments of the season,
he was knocked out of a game against Texas two weeks ago when he
threw 14 straight balls, walking the bases loaded before he gave up
a grand slam to Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the knuckleball, you're going to give up some runs or
you're going to shut down the best teams in the league,'' Scott
Hatteberg said Sunday after catching Wakefield. ``It's going to
vary. It's a volatile thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Too volatile apparently for the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unhappy,'' Williams said after breaking the news to
Wakefield. ``That's understandable. He likes to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The news brought a mixed reaction from Pedro Martinez, who said
last week that the Sox would need to rely on Ramon's experience
down the stretch. Wakefield is highly regarded by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good that Ramon is back in the rotation,'' Pedro said.
``But it's hard to see Wakie working so hard and doing the things
he does and always having to be the one who gets pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming next: Ramon's big test on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it going to work?'' Williams asked. ``I don't know, but
we're going to give it a shot.''

SWEDISH COMPANY CONSIDERING HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF LONDON STOCK
EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: name Per E. Larsson is CQ)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ British brokers and traders had a hard
enough time absorbing the idea that a German might soon be running
the London Stock Exchange. But a Swede?
</P>
<P>
   OM Gruppen AB, which owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange, may not
succeed in its audacious and unsolicited bid to acquire the
venerable and much bigger London exchange. But it could well
unravel the already fraying plan of the London exchange to merge
with the Deutsche Boerse AG in Frankfurt, and it provides another
example of how Europe's new generation of competitors often come
from unexpected quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, just three weeks before shareholders of the London
exchange and Deutsche Boerse are scheduled to vote on a full
merger, OM Gruppen made an informal cash-and-stock bid of about 800
million pounds, or $1.18 billion, for the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The London exchange rejected the offer, arguing that merging
with the Frankfurt exchange would provide a stronger base in the
long term. OM executives are now weighing a hostile takeover bid
and are expected to spell out their plans later this week.
</P>
<P>
   In response, executives at the Frankfurt stock exchange said
Monday they would consider sweetening their offer if they see the
need. But people close to the German exchange admit the issue is
politically sensitive, because London and Frankfurt officials
labored to formulate an exchange of shares that amounted to a
``merger of equals.'' Increasing the offer would turn the deal into
a takeover and likely increase the hostility of many smaller
brokerage companies that are already upset about having to adopt a
new trading system.
</P>
<P>
   People on all sides are struggling to provide a pan-European
trading system, because national exchanges are under increasing
pressure from electronic trading networks that are faster, cheaper
and potentially better suited to an integrated European
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockholm Stock Exchange is far smaller than its rivals in
London or Frankfurt. But its parent company, founded with in 1985
with nine people, is a fast-growing vendor of trading technology
and has a market value of about $3.7 billion, which is at least
three times that of the London exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not only a stock exchange; they are a technology
company,'' said Andreas Walther, chief financial officer of OZ
Banken, a Swiss investment firm that owns 2.6 percent of OM.
</P>
<P>
   Besides running the Swedish stock and derivatives markets, OM
has supplied trading and information systems to the United Kingdom
Power Exchange, the California Power Exchange, to futures markets
from Hong Kong to Seoul and to stock markets from Oslo, Norway, to
Sydney Australia. In May, it launched a new electronic options
exchange in New York called the International Securities Exchange.
And, in partnership with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, it is starting
its own pan-European stock-trading network called Jiway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are commercial players in a mutual world, which is what
sets them apart,'' said Thomas Johansson, an analyst at Enskilda
Securities in Stockholm. ``They are more aggressive than the
others.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest distinction between OM and most of Europe's other
stock exchanges is its history as a publicly traded company.
Started originally as a company to trade Swedish derivatives, it
went public in 1987 and then orchestrated a takeover of the
Stockholm stock exchange in 1999. Though the merger with the stock
exchange was quite recent, OM itself was always run as a for-profit
corporation rather than cooperative controlled by its members.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months ending last June, revenues climbed 52 percent
over the previous year, to 1.4 billion Swedish kroners, or about
$150 million. OM's stock price has more than doubled so far this
year, to 450 kroner from about 185. Its biggest investors include
Investor AB, the huge holding company controlled by the Wallenberg
family, which owns about 15 percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Per Larsson, OM's 39-year-old chief executive and one of the
company's co-founders, declined to be interviewed today. But when
London Stock Exchange officials publicly announced and rejected
OM's informal offer on Friday, Larsson dismissed the rebuff as
``predictable'' and insisted that ``we are determined that the
London market should have a better alternative'' to its proposed
merger with Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts doubt that OM Gruppen will be successful if it
attempts a hostile takeover of the London exchange. Though the
exchange ended its mutual status and sold shares earlier this year,
most of its stock is held by the banks and brokerage firms that are
members of the exchange. Many of those companies are much more
worried about the exchange's long-term strategic position than its
current share price, and they are likely to agree with exchange
officials who say it makes more sense to merge with a relatively
big exchange than a small one.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in acquiring the London exchange, a company would
have to obtain 75 percent of the shareholders behind it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is widespread unhappiness among the German-British
merger in London. Smaller trading companies are upset about the
costs of installing new equipment to run the Deutsche Boerse's
electronic trading system, called Xetra. In addition, British
regulators were surprisingly critical in a report last week,
insisting that exchange officials had failed to explain themselves
on a host of important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own opinion is that neither of the plans will succeed,''
said Johansson of Enskilda Securities.

BUSH RIPS GORE OVER QUALITY OF EDUCATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ George W. Bush ripped into Democratic rival Al Gore
over education on Monday, contending that Gore would do virtually
nothing to hold schools accountable for the quality of their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore could be president for four years without
parents ever knowing how their students were doing on his watch,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years in office and my opponent presides over a national
tragedy. Seventy percent of fourth-graders in our highest poverty
schools still cannot read, and he's offered little to do anything
about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made the remarks at the Governor's Mansion to help kick off
a campaign week that will take him to five other states and, he
hopes, divert attention from Gore's continuing attacks against him
over health care.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has accused Bush of not offering a detailed plan for
providing prescription drug benefits for the elderly. Gore has
proposed providing such a benefit under Medicare at a 10-year cost
estimated at $250 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said on Monday that he liked a bipartisan congressional
plan that would give Medicare beneficiaries the option of selecting
from a range of private health plans offering drug coverage and
other benefits. He said he plans to provide details of an improved
version of that plan next week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush announced a new campaign organization,
``Education Leaders for Bush.'' He was joined by Houston
Independent School District Superintendent Rod Paige and other
educators from several states.
</P>
<P>
   Although most education policies are determined at the state and
local level and Bush calls himself a strong proponent of local
control in education, the governor criticized Gore's record and
said that Gore would do little more than protect the education
status quo if promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement gap between rich and poor and minority and
non-minority students has stagnated _ or gotten worse _ nationwide
during the Clinton-Gore administration, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign responded with Department of Education
statistics showing that low income students are improving their
reading. For example, from 1992-1996, high-poverty 9-year-olds
narrowed the gap in their reading test scores relative to all
students their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 25 percent of the gap existing when the Clinton-Gore
administration took office was erased in the first four years,'' a
statement from the Gore campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush signed a law in Texas last year that will
require most students, beginning in the third grade, to pass a
standardized state test in certain grades to be promoted. Texas
also has a ``report card'' system, based on test results, for
measuring the performance of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed that all states develop similar evaluations of
their schools' performance, including annual testing of students in
third through eighth grades. Schools with persistent failures would
be stripped of some federal funds. The money would be given to
parents, who could use it to send their children to other public
schools or to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Gore's education proposals offer only an ``illusion of
accountability, words with no actions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His only new testing proposal is a voluntary national test,
once in the fourth grade and once in the eighth grade,'' Bush
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp acknowledged that its proposed testing would be
voluntary, but added that schools would be required to issue
detailed performance reports and that failing schools could be put
on aggressive improvement programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that he would change Head Start to give ``top
priority'' to pre-reading and number skills, while Gore would keep
it as a nutrition and health program.

COMMENTARY: SPIES IN THE ATTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were very few public enemies as nefarious as the 1999
version of Wen Ho Lee, the 60-year-old scientist who's accused of
downloading the ``crown jewels'' of our nuclear secrets with the
intent of harming the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Lee model, brought to you courtesy of the FBI and the
Department of Energy, lied to his colleagues in order to get mounds
of top secret data out of the secure computers in the Los Alamos
labs and put it on tapes, which are still missing _ out there
somewhere. He had fishy-looking contacts with Chinese scientists
when he was abroad, and kept them secret from American authorities.
The director of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos testified that if the
data Lee downloaded fell into the wrong hands it could ``change the
global strategic balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you could see why they put the guy in a segregated cell.
With manacles. ``For a long time, during his one hour of exercise,
he'd have to try to kick the soccer ball around with leg
shackles,'' said his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But after being held for eight months without bail, the biggest
danger to national security since Benedict Arnold is starting to
look a tad less threatening. It turns out:
</P>
<P>
   _The data Lee downloaded was classified as secret only after the
fact. Defense experts _ who seem just as smart as the prosecution
experts _ say virtually all of it is already public knowledge, and
what isn't probably wouldn't pose a threat even if it wound up on
Moammar Gadhafi's bedside table.
</P>
<P>
   _The lie Lee told his colleague to get access to the computer
existed only in the mind of an FBI agent, who now says he made ``an
honest error.'' That agent, Robert Messemer, also now acknowledges
that Lee did file reports of his meetings with Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   _Messemer threatened Lee with the death penalty during one
interview, pointing out what happened to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
when they refused to come clean. The agent, unlike Lee, is still
working at his job.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is denying that Lee spent hours and hours downloading one
large mountain of codes. And nobody has a good explanation for why.
Did he want a backup file? A scientific version of the ``Collected
Works of Wen Ho Lee''? So far, he hasn't explained himself,
although his lawyer says the missing tapes were all destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Other Los Alamos employees in the past have been fired or
disciplined for mishandling classified information. But
Asian-American civil rights groups point out that Lee, an American
citizen who was born in Taiwan, is the first person in the lab's
history to be charged in a criminal case, let alone one carrying a
penalty of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Lee was doing, the government has offered not one iota
of evidence that it was espionage. The prosecution, despite its
grim talk of Chinese spies, claimed in its court papers that Lee
wanted to use the data to impress potential employers during a job
search. We have gone from worrying about rogue nations to a
research lab in Switzerland. And there seems to be no evidence, by
the way, that he ever actually contacted anybody about a job. Last
week a judge in New Mexico ruled that the government's case ``no
longer has the requisite clarity and persuasive character'' needed
to keep holding Lee without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Security cases always involve the politics of paranoia. Lee
looks harmless from here. (How many spies call the computer help
line for advice while they're stealing secrets?) But maybe the FBI
can't tell us the whole story because laying it all out in court
would compromise our security even more. If the prosecution says
``hundreds of millions of people could be killed,'' who wants to
take a risk?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that right now, an average citizen might conclude
that the multitudinous embarrassments over Los Alamos left federal
officials desperate for somebody to arrest. They might assume that,
in a facility where security was so lax even the vending machine
was probably downloading secrets, the authorities picked on Lee
because of his race. They might suspect that the FBI ignored
evidence that he was telling the truth, gave false testimony about
his past activities in court, and kept a 60-year-old man isolated
in a maximum security prison for months in the hopes of getting him
to confess to something that would allow them to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia works both ways.

<P>
   For months a young woman had been flirting with George W. Bush,
resulting in a cash bet among co-workers about whether they would
end up having an affair. And now the flirtation had provoked a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had told the woman off, humiliating her, and a top campaign
official stormed into his office and rebuked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's hurt,'' the official scolded, glaring down at Bush.
``You really hurt her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, good,'' Bush replied icily from his chair. ``I'm a
married man. I'm glad she got the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of 1987 in Washington, in the decrepit
eighth-floor headquarters of Vice President George Bush's
presidential campaign. Doug Wead, then a campaign worker who
happened to be in George W.'s office talking to him when the
confrontation occurred, recalled the episode, along with another
senior campaign official who witnessed it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had moved to Washington to help his father's campaign,
even asked Wead to stick close by when they were on the road
together and to stay with him in his hotel room until late at
night, Wead said. The aim was to fend off the woman, whose
seductive energies Bush valued so long as they were directed at
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted everyone to know that nothing was happening,'' Wead
said.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was getting a first-rate political education, and
proving his skill in maneuvering through an often treacherous
electoral world. He describes himself in those days as having been
``a warrior for George Bush,'' and he became a single-minded
warrior, constantly and sometimes rudely driving home the sole goal
of getting his father into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He learned the importance of a disciplined, loyal and tightly
focused campaign. He made sure that campaign officials would be
distracted neither by hormones nor by the opportunity to become
media stars.
</P>
<P>
   And as he got his first real taste of national politics, Bush
found that he loved it and was good at it. He also learned from a
master strategist, Lee Atwater, how to woo baby boomers and destroy
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one paradox stands out: Bush immersed himself back then in
the practice of national politics while remaining largely oblivious
to its substance. Some people get into politics because they feel
passionately about certain issues; Bush's passion in the 1988
campaign was for his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motivation was, he's been a great dad,'' Bush told
reporters recently, speaking of the 1988 and 1992 campaigns. He
pushed no particular agenda, and no one seems to recall instances
when, of his own volition, he pressed for one policy or another.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the correspondence between father and son during the
Bush presidency, obtained from the Bush presidential library
through the Freedom of Information Act, turns up plenty of times
when George W. asked his father to send autographs to Texas friends
or even to consider particular people for federal jobs _ but
virtually none in which he suggests that his father take a
particular position on an issue.
</P>
<P>
   All of this paints the younger Bush not as a political
chameleon, exactly, but at least as an ad hoc decision-maker who
lacks bedrock passions. Like President Ronald Reagan, Bush is an
amiable leader with tremendous communication skills and limited
interest in policy details, but Reagan had a clearly defined
ideology _ he stood for something. Bush comes across as far more
flexible in his beliefs, and it is much less clear what he stands
for.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that Bush, in that first encounter with national
politics, proved immensely talented at steering his ship to avoid
shoals and rough seas, while keeping the passengers content. But he
sometimes seemed less concerned with precisely where the ship of
state was headed.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was drawn into national politics in part by his
failings as a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   He has sometimes portrayed his year and a half on his father's
presidential campaign, in 1987 and 1988, as simply a bid to help
his father, and there is something to that. But he had not been
active in his father's unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1980.
The difference may be that in the run-up to 1988, oil prices had
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's oil company in Midland, Texas, had been acquired by a
larger concern, leaving him with a fancy salary as a consultant but
no company to run. So Bush accepted a standing invitation from
Atwater to join his father's presidential campaign. At the same
time, another young man who was to fit into this year's headlines
got involved in the 1988 campaign: Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee was
running for president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Republican campaign officials were nervous in April 1987 when
Bush settled in a town house on Massachusetts Avenue and began
working in the ratty Bush headquarters at 733 15th Street NW in
Washington. He would sit in his bare office, door always open, his
cowboy boots on his desk, a wad of tobacco under his lip and a
plastic foam cup in his hand as his spittoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule of the campaign staff is to keep as far away
from the candidate's family as possible,'' said James Pinkerton,
who had an office across the hall from Bush's. ``You can never win.
You can never be as respectful as you need to be, you can never
work as hard as you should.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pinkerton and others said they quickly warmed to Junior, as
he was called then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't just decisive, he was the most decisive person I'd
ever met in my life,'' Wead said. ``He wasn't just energetic, he
was constantly on the go, even missing meals. When you came from
being on the road with him, you felt something like jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even then Bush, the boss's boy, cut himself some slack. He
never wanted to spend more than two nights on the road, so the
campaign would fly him back from the West Coast so he could spend a
night with his wife and daughters, and then fly him out West again.
Any other campaign worker asking for such treatment probably would
have been laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a consultant and senior adviser, paid $5,000 a month,
according to federal election records, but as he told a Texas
reporter at the time, ``When your name is George Bush, you don't
need a title in the George Bush campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   James Baker recalled that ``he was in a sense his father's eyes
and ears.'' Baker, President Bush's longtime friend and a cabinet
member in the Reagan and Bush administrations, said, ``The
president knew he could rely on W. to report truthfully on what was
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush gradually won friends in the office through his humor and
lack of pretension.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come in to a meeting with a cup'' _ his spittoon _ ``and
stick out his hand with a big smile and say, `Hi, I'm George Bush,
and thanks for what you're doing for my dad,''' said Richard Bond,
then the national political director for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won over doubters in part by poking fun at his own role,
sometimes calling himself ``Maureen'' because Maureen Reagan was
then notorious in her father's White House for forever telling
staff members what to do. He also sometimes mocked those he
regarded as the more pretentious associates of his father, like
Nicholas Brady, the future treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, spitting tobacco juice and dropping references to his
father can be seen as signals of a down-home, rustic style _ or of
a dauphin's arrogance. And Bush, for all his charm, eventually
became something of a hit man on behalf of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Bush once was waiting at Washington National Airport with Wead
when they spotted an official on the vice president's staff who was
arguing with an airline employee.
</P>
<P>
   They were too far away to overhear the details, but they saw
that the official was preening and showing off his leather garment
bag and suitcase, which he had decorated with the seal of the vice
president. Wead said he did not recognize the man, but Bush did,
and ``was muttering and simmering'' in embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we boarded, this guy was already in his first-class seat
reading The Wall Street Journal,'' Wead recalled. ``And Junior kind
of flicked his page, and he looked up in fury, as if to say, `Who
would dare interrupt my reverie?' And he saw Junior and recognized
him and registered shock, and he was fumbling and saying, `Where
are you sitting?' and `You should be up here; I'll talk to them for
you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And George W. said: `No, I don't waste taxpayers' money. I
don't waste campaign money. I ride coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his ghostwritten autobiography, Bush suggests that one of his
main roles was dealing with reporters. But aides say he did little
of that, partly because he was too temperamental to be trusted with
journalists. He tended to blow up when he did not like the
coverage. Sometimes he yelled or cursed at them because he thought
their coverage mean-spirited, and once he strode over to a
bewildered television reporter who had just finished his stand-up
commentary and lashed out at him for his statements about his
father.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did play a more substantive role in putting out one
media fire. It was in the summer of 1987, when rumors began
circulating widely, without any particular evidence, that Vice
President Bush was having an affair with a longtime assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater and two other top aides went to the vice president's
residence to discuss it with him. They were standing on the front
porch, deeply embarrassed, when Barbara Bush strolled up and asked
what everyone was talking about. There was a mortified silence,
until finally the vice president explained.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Teeley, then the spokesman for the campaign, remembers
arguing against addressing the rumors, for fear of giving
journalists an excuse to broadcast them. But Atwater and George W.
insisted that they had to do something, and they concocted a
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   George W., a campaign aide recalls, was so adoring of his father
that he never doubted for an instant that the rumors were false.
And so, with characteristic bluntness, he simply asked his father
about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just not true,'' the vice president replied.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater then leaked the exchange to Newsweek, along with George
W.'s colorful conclusion: ``The answer to the Big A question is
N-O.'' The adultery rumors immediately faded and the issue was
defused.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attended senior staff meetings and poked around in areas
ranging from budgeting to convention planning. One role was to give
a quick sense of how his father might react to a proposal, and
another was to be a ``loyalty thermometer,'' to preach pure
dedication to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also deployed in the field to make speeches and press
the flesh, and he impressed campaign officials with his willingness
to slog through snow in Iowa and Michigan to meet tiny groups of
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I saw a ballroom, and I thought he'd kill me because
there were only three people there,'' recalled Mary Matalin, the
political commentator who was then working on the Bush campaign and
had overseen the event. ``That was in Michigan. But he just shook
their hands and talked to them and never said a word to me about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign went on, Bush increasingly became not so much
Atwater's minder as his friend and protector. During the frequent
quarrels between the campaign staff and the vice-presidential
staff, Bush became a forceful advocate for Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically they were the same kind of people,'' recalled Sally
Atwater, Atwater's widow (he died in 1991 of a brain tumor). ``They
were both high-energy level, from the South, interested in
politics, both after the common man. They would always prefer a
barbecue over a candlelight dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwater was tremendously skilled at hardball, negative politics,
and made good use of that skill in the 1988 campaign. Most
famously, he tarred the Democratic candidate, Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts, in connection with a state program that had
allowed a black murderer named Willie Horton out on furlough;
Horton then stabbed a white man and raped a white woman. Critics
complained that the references to Horton had a racist subtext,
although the Bush campaign vigorously denied it.

FREED DISSIDENT POET ARRIVES BACK IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dissident Chinese poet Bei Ling, who has lived here for
years while carrying on an underground fight for free speech in
China, returned Monday exhausted from two stress-filled weeks in a
Beijing jail, but passionate in his determination not to give up
his struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Bei, 40, was arrested Aug. 11 for distributing copies of the
small but influential Chinese-language magazine Tendency Quarterly
that he and his friend, Meng Lang, a resident of Cambridge, founded
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name, only 13 editions were published in seven
years, and circulation never exceeded 3,000 copies. Nevertheless,
Bei caught the attention of central government security police, who
briefly detained and interrogated him several times before this
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday at Logan International Airport, Bei said
the tougher treatment he received this time was triggered by his
having printed the latest issue of the magazine in the Chinese
mainland, and by the authorities' realization that he intended to
move back to China and intensify his campaign for free speech
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised,'' Bei said, describing intense
interrogations during which he was forced to squat, without his
shoes or glasses, with his hands clasped behind his head, and
nights in a cell so crowded the prisoners had to sleep on their
sides. ``I thought they might stop me'' from distributing the
magazine, he said, ``but I didn't know it was so dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   First, security officers told him he was charged with illegal
printing, then they called it illegal publishing. Finally, just
days before his release amid growing pressure from the US
government and international journalists, he was told he would be
charged with illegal business.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bei said, the security forces' real objective in the
interrogations was learning the identity of Chinese citizens who
helped him produce the magazine in China. He was repeatedly told
that he faced a 10-year sentence, but would be treated more
leniently if he told the truth about the underground operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government controls all publishing in China, and people
can't publish anything,'' he said. ``They already knew I had
published in China when they arrested me, but they did not know who
did the typing, who made the films.''
</P>
<P>
   Interrogation sessions sometimes consumed 10 hours of his day _
two hours in the morning, two in the afternoon, and from 8:30 in
the evening until after 2 a.m. Throughout, he said, he insisted
that he had published the edition in Hong Kong, and did not reveal
the names of Chinese who helped him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, gradually, he began refusing to cooperate with the
interrogators' orders. ``I told them I am not a person who robs, I
do not kill people,'' he said. ``I just do my literature and
printing. This is a good journal for the future of China.''
</P>
<P>
   As police officials became more aware of his case, he said, some
of them became easier to deal with. ``Sometimes a gentle,
intellectual 50- or 60-year-old would come as the situation got
bigger,'' he said. ``Sometimes some of them would just watch me
while others asked questions.'' The day before he learned he would
be released, he said, five people whom the jailers described as
``leaders'' came and talked with him until after 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions did not ease in his cell, however. There, Bei was
confined in a space he estimated at 100 square feet with 20 to 25
other people. Their toilet, sink, and shower all were in that
space. He had no change of clothes,there was no hot water, and he
was not allowed to read or write. When he insisted strongly on his
right to reading materials, he finally was given a book by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiao Ping.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through his imprisonment, Bei's brother, Huang
Feng, was arrested, but Bei did not learn of this until two days
before his release. That was the worst moment of the whole
experience. ``I was so angry, so sad,'' he said. ``I couldn't
control my feelings, the crying. They kept saying `Your brother
helps you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bei was allowed to see his brother, who also had been released,
and parents, who returned to China from a US visit to help secure
his release, for only a half hour before security men took him to
the Beijing airport and put him on a flight to San Francisco
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to publish Tendency,'' he said. ``We will
move the editing back here'' from the underground editing studio he
had set up in Beijing. ``We will print in Hong Kong. But we will
have big money problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei said he will try to regain his appointment as a research
associate at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for East Asia
studies, where his position lapsed in June. He said he may seek
academic work at Harvard or another area university, and may apply
for a fellowship from the Neiman Foundation, which supports studies
by domestic and international journalists at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he said, he needs to rest, and to see if he can break
his smoking habit. He quit seven years ago, he said, but the
interrogators gave him cigarettes during breaks, and now he craves
nearly two packs a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy'' to be back in Boston, he said at Logan, though
he badly wanted to go outside so he could smoke. ``Before, I always
wanted to go back to China,'' said Bei, who has been in the United
States since the late 1980s. ``Now I know I cannot. Now I know this
is my new home, my real home.''

 UNDATED: denied it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aides say that Bush was mostly on the road in the fall campaign
and was not much involved in the Horton episode or other
mudslinging. Some also say that he lacked Atwater's exuberance at
bare-knuckled methods.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Atwater rushed into Bush's office, exultant at finding an
old magazine article saying that Dukakis had once honored a witch.
Wead recalls that Atwater was thrilled and urged that it be quietly
circulated among evangelical Christians to discredit Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``G.W. wasn't excited; he was maybe a bit disgusted,'' recalled
Wead, who said that the article was duly disseminated among
Christian groups. ``He wasn't afraid to attack, but I never saw him
show any glee in taking people down.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bush showed a talent for managing people in the
headquarters, reassuring them when they were upset and reproaching
them when they were not working hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the disciplinarian,'' remembered Andy Card, another key
aide. ``I'm blessed that I never got taken to the woodshed. But if
you were a disappointment to the campaign, he would let you know
that you were a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's most remarkable abilities, a particularly useful
one in politics, is making people think he likes them and approves
of what they are saying. He had a knack for melting into any group
he wanted. He could speak in salty language with campaign workers
one moment, and talk about Christ as his personal savior with
evangelicals the next.
</P>
<P>
   Wead recalled flying at night with Bush and a senator and
congressman on a private jet, returning from a campaign appearance.
They were relaxing in their seats, facing each other, and the
lawmakers were drinking Scotch and sodas and getting steadily more
talkative.
</P>
<P>
   ``So these guys were telling all these stories about their
girlfriends,'' said Wead, who was sitting beside Bush. ``And they
were talking about where they stashed their girlfriends and telling
stories about close moments with wives and journalists. They were
saying what they did with their girlfriends, and it got raunchier
the more they drank. And George W. was taking it all in and
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they paused, he said, `I'm a lucky man to have
Laura.' And they sort of gulped and looked down at their whiskeys.
And one said, `Let's toast Laura.' And so they toasted Laura right
there and then in the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave the impression of not liking Washington much.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 election ended in victory for the Bushes, of course,
but George W. immediately became impatient to return to Texas. He
worked with mounting frustration on the presidential transition _
and, aides say, helped kill the prospect that Craig Fuller, his
father's chief of staff, would become White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bush thought that Fuller, among other sins, had been
disrespectful to the Bush family, not even returning calls. So
instead Bush pushed for John H. Sununu to get the job _ and Sununu
did. Likewise, Bush pushed his father to give the job of chairman
of the Republican National Committee to Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once his father won, and he settled in to this transition, he
was very unhappy,'' said Roland W. Betts, a college friend who in
early 1989 joined Bush and other investors in buying the Texas
Rangers baseball team. ``He did not want to be there. He was
looking for `what am I going to do next?' And that's just when the
Rangers came up.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bush returned to Texas to help run the Rangers, but he still
visited the White House periodically and became a trouble-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good sense of what wasn't going right,'' said Alan K.
Simpson, an old family friend who was then a senator from Wyoming,
``and when things weren't going right, George W. would suddenly be
on the front porch.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, aides say that Bush became disenchanted with
Sununu and began plotting with them to oust him. In Bush's account,
he virtually fired Sununu, but that seems to be an exaggeration.
Instead, he took soundings and reported to his father _ and also
spoke bluntly to Sununu of the dissatisfaction. Sununu, instead of
resigning as expected, dug in his heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversation that George had with John was when John was
already under fire,'' recalled Charles Black, a White House
official who himself played a leading role in the episode. ``George
didn't `fire' Sununu. It wasn't the result of that specific
conversation. It was a result of a whole bunch of things.''
</P>
<P>
   A stack of Bush administration documents, obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act, offers a window into Bush's interests
during his father's administration.
</P>
<P>
   The letters between George W. Bush and his father's White House
are strikingly mundane. They almost never mention the grand issues
of the day; nearly all have to do with paying back favors for old
family friends in an old-boy network.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas autograph collector named John W. Dorman, for example,
had written to Bush asking for help in getting the president's
signature. So Bush forwarded it to his father's secretary, with the
notation: ``Patti _ this guy has been loyal to all Bushes. Thanks,
GB.''
</P>
<P>
   The record shows that in each case, President Bush sent out the
autographs, personal notes and other favors, usually with a plug
along these lines: ``George, the Texas Rangers man, did indeed pass
along your letter.'' The result was that the younger Bush gained
chits that would be useful when he began his own political career.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Bush also backed particular appointments, invariably
citing loyalty as his reason. For example, Donald B. Ensenat, an
old Yale fraternity brother and former roommate of Bush's,
recommended Edith Brown Clement, known as Joy, for a federal
judgeship. Bush forwarded the recommendation to C. Boyden Gray, his
father's counsel, with the notation: ``Boyden _ Don Ensenat is a
very good man and good friend of all Bushes. Please give Joy any
consideration you can. Warmly, G.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement became a federal district judge.

 UNDATED: district judge. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only item in the archive containing a policy suggestion from
Bush is a January 1992 letter to Samuel K. Skinner, who replaced
Sununu as chief of staff, about oil prices. ``We have trouble in
the oil states,'' Bush warned, ``because the president is viewed as
favoring cheap energy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Bush suggested that Skinner meet with
representatives of independent oil companies to soothe them and
that ``a mention in the State of the Union message would help.'' He
added: ``Perhaps, the big guy could renew his call for a cleaner
America and announce that -- percent of the government fleet will
be converted to use natural gas or fuel with farm product
additives.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, President Bush signed into law a bill providing
that some new cars in government fleets would use natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was far less involved in the 1992 campaign than he had been
in 1988. He did some public speaking and stayed in regular touch by
telephone with campaign officials, but he did not move to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign obviously wasn't going well, our numbers weren't
good, so he, like all of us, expressed frustration,'' said Skinner.
``He was expressing these frustrations to me, but the phone wasn't
ringing off the hook. I guess he'd call once a month or so. And I'd
see him every month or six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seethed from a distance at the portrayal of his father in
the news media and at the way campaign officials blamed one
another, leaked secrets and generally ran an undisciplined effort.
Bush has seemed cool to Baker this year, and some attribute that to
resentment at Baker's slowness in leaving the State Department for
the White House in 1992 to help in President Bush's re-election
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush may have learned even more from the failed 1992
campaign than from the successful 1988 one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them jumping out the windows in 1992 looking for the
next campaign,'' Bush told reporters last month. ``And that
influenced me. Yeah, that influenced me. I worry that some may be
wanting to be involved in my campaign to enhance their consulting
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   One lesson Bush drew, friends say, is the importance of relying
on old friends in a campaign, even over people with more
experience. This year, Bush has surrounded himself with close
friends who are absolutely devoted to his career, and his leakproof
staff has the discipline and harmony of a chorus line.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush has never picked up, despite having a father in the
White House, is a fascination for the intricacies of foreign or
domestic policy. Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman,
recalls that when they met during his father's White House years
they would chat about baseball, not government.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner puts it this way: ``He was certainly not immersing
himself deeply in policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other presidential candidates, of course, have been even
more removed from politics and policy. Zachary Taylor had never
voted in a presidential election before the one he won in 1848, and
Dwight D. Eisenhower was so apolitical that he had to figure out
whether he was a Democrat or Republican in the months before he ran
for president in 1952. Bush was different in that he enjoyed the
horse race excitement of politics, but he was similarly bored by
policy debates.
</P>
<P>
   So while Bush gained an excellent political education under his
father, it was focused entirely on gaining power rather than using
it. He came across as a work in progress, relishing the theater of
politics, but leaving questions about what he would do with the
reins of government if he got hold of them.

LOEWS' BOND RATING IS LOWERED BY S&AMP;P 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reacting to an announcement from Loews Cineplex Entertainment
that it might default on its debt, Standard &AMP; Poor's Ratings
Services on Monday lowered its rating of the movie theater
company's bonds to B from BB-.
</P>
<P>
   Loews, one of the country's largest movie exhibitors, with 2,967
screens in 385 locations, said on Friday that its second-quarter
earnings would be considerably lower than last year's and that it
was seeking ``alternative arrangements'' with its lenders to head
off a default.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, most of Loews' major competitors have either
filed for bankruptcy protection or acknowledged that they were in
serious trouble because of the rapid expansion of multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Loews executives declined to comment Monday. But in the
statement issued Friday, Lawrence J. Ruisi, the company's president
and chief executive, said revenues were down because of the
disappointing summer box office as well as the ``continued decay at
our older theaters that are experiencing competition from newer
megaplexes.'' Most Loews theaters are in major metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses on movies released since Memorial Day are about
4 percent less than in the same period last year _ $2.5 million,
compared with $2.7 million _ said Paul Dergarabedian, the president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks box-office performance.
Attendance for the year so far is down about 1.5 percent, but
revenues have increased by about 2 percent because of higher ticket
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher P. Dixon, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the
industry was suffering because cinema chains built too many costly
theaters with stadium seating and other amenities. ``They cannot
blame it on the box office,'' he said. ``That's absolute
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said that there were now 37,000 movie screens in the
United States and Canada, but that the industry could only support
about 28,000. He and other analysts said that Loews and its
competitors had not moved swiftly enough to close older theaters
that were at a disadvantage when forced to compete with the newer
moviehouses.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Wilkinson, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said that
Loews had been more aggressive than other operators in shutting
down theaters. Chains are often saddled with long-term leases that
are not easy to break, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent filing with the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission,
Lowes said it was committed to spending $361.9 million to build 34
theaters with 517 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Loews said it was seeking other sources of revenue in addition
to ticket and food sales. In May, for example, the company signed a
long-term advertising deal that it said was worth about $60
million.

ISTANBUL'S STREETS SWARM WITH CHILDREN AND A SURVIVOR MOVES TO
HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Efes Uyanmaz threaded his way up the
embankment, dodging piles of trash and excrement to reach the hole
in the wall. Pulling back a dingy sheet that partially concealed
the opening, he gestured inside and said, ``This is where we
live.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uyanmaz is the leader of an ad hoc family of 15 young men and
children who make their home in this ancient wall four blocks from
Taksim Square, one of the city's busiest intersections. They sleep
on four filthy couches, an armchair and the floor. When a couch
becomes too decrepit or a bottle of water is emptied, the remains
are tossed onto the heap outside the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Uyanmaz is a wily veteran of 15 years on the streets who
shares his survival skills with the newcomers fleeing abusive
parents or poverty or just looking to get high. He is neither proud
nor ashamed of where he lives or of what he does. He scarcely
remembers any other life.
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul is crowded with thousands of street children. Some are
as young as 6 or 7, turned loose by parents to make a few dollars a
day selling chewing gum or tissues to passers-by. Others are older
and harder, graduates of hawking trinkets who are no longer
children at all. Often they are addicted to paint thinner or drugs.
Instead of selling, they resort to begging or stealing.
</P>
<P>
   The children are the most visible part of the population. They
swarm heedlessly into traffic when lights turn red, pleading with
drivers and passengers to pay a few cents for a packet of tissues
or a piece of gum. They slip into restaurants and stores in twos
and threes, pestering patrons and angering owners with their
persistent pitch.
</P>
<P>
   No one has bothered to count them, but everyone in the field
says the problem has grown dramatically in recent years. At the
rate of about a thousand a day, people have been leaving the
country's impoverished rural villages, piling onto buses and trains
in search of a better life in its great and swollen cosmopolitan
city. Just as they are in other big cities around the world, street
children are at the bottom of this heap of humanity, easily ignored
until something happens.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul something happened last week. A 10-year-old girl
selling gum inside a McDonald's restaurant was forced into the
refrigerator by the manager and an employee. Customers summoned the
police and the girl was released unharmed three hours later. The
two men were jailed and may face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The incident generated widespread publicity, and the outcry grew
with the discovery that the girl's parents had willingly sent her
out daily to make money.
</P>
<P>
   The government responded. Istanbul municipal authorities made it
a crime to buy goods from street children and imposed penalties on
parents who allow their children to sell on the streets. Monday
afternoon the police swept through Taksim Square and other busy
neighborhoods, rounding up street sellers. By evening the familiar
swarms of children were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan Gemici, Turkey's minister for women and family affairs,
said on Monday that civic organizations and local government must
shoulder some responsibility for dealing with the thousands of
street children. And he criticized parents for having more children
than they can rear properly.
</P>
<P>
   To Uyanmaz, who came here alone from the central Anatolian city
of Kayseri when he was 11, the crackdown was familiar. The police
periodically chase away the street children, who always come back
when the heat dies down.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, Uyanmaz is trying to break the cycle for
himself and the members of his informal family. He has joined
nearly 200 young street people registered for help and training at
a center called the Hope for Children Association. Uyanmaz hopes to
learn carpentry and get a job.
</P>
<P>
   Yusuf Kulca, the founder of the association and a former street
child, said that for too long, the pattern has been predictable and
inevitable. Children start out selling goods to help their
families, but they come to enjoy the freedom and easy money and
become permanent citizens of the streets. They grow up almost wild,
without education or social skills.
</P>
<P>
   Kulca's association tries to stop the inevitable, at least on a
small scale. Street children and young adults who come to the
building near Taksim Square get a meal, a haircut and a bath while
their clothes are laundered. They learn basic social skills and are
informed about sexually transmitted diseases and other dangers of
street life. A doctor visits once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't smell and their clothes are clean,'' he said,
``they can get on buses and go into cafeterias for food.''
</P>
<P>
   The doors opened three months ago with a $96,000 grant from the
World Bank. Job training and education classes are scheduled to
start in two weeks. Kulca says there is no similar center anywhere
else in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few hours out of harm's way lets some children dream. On
Kulca's office wall are crayon drawings by the street children. One
depicts a beach lined with palm trees. Another shows a stick figure
beside a house in a garden, and a third shows a house tucked into
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   There are concrete measures of success, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-seven kids have returned to their families,'' Kulca
said. ``We didn't force them. They wanted to go home. It's a small
number, but it's a start.''

OPPOSITION GAINS GROUND IN FIRST ROUND OF LEBANESE ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Opponents dealt sharp blows to the government
of President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss, results of
the first round of parliamentary elections showed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The voting, on Sunday, was for 63 seats in northern Lebanon, the
Christian heartland of Mt. Lebanon and the Shuf region, home to the
Druse, a Muslim offshoot. Of those, 33 appeared to have been won by
candidates either critical of the government or in some form of
alliance with Rafik Hariri, the multibillionaire builder who has
conducted a free-spending campaign to regain the prime minister's
office. The newspapers Monday morning, based on early results,
spoke of a ``stunning rout'' of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In elections next Sunday for the rest of the 128-seat
legislature, Hariri is fielding a slate of 18 candidates for the 19
seats that represent Beirut. There will also be elections for the
Bekaa region and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy opposition vote does not immediately appear to
threaten the dominance of Lebanon by Syria, which has exercised
total power here for a decade, political experts said. Nearly all
the candidates have ties to Syria, though to varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But the results do present a problem for the new Syrian
president, Bashar Assad, who took office after his tough, wily
father, Hafez Assad, died in June.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud, a former army commander installed by Syria as president
in 1998, detests Hariri and appears determined to thwart any
comeback attempt. But Hariri could amass a large enough bloc in
Parliament to demand the prime minister's office. And Syria may be
inclined to look favorably on him as the only figure who might
possibly help Lebanon out of its deepening economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the untested Assad may be forced to mediate or to choose
between Syria's fractious Lebanese surrogates. Over the last few
days Lebanese political leaders have been trooping to Damascus _ on
Monday it was Hoss' turn _ for consultations with Assad, apparently
in an effort by Syria to calm the situation. Hariri, Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri and the army commander, Gen. Michel Sulieman,
among others, have already made the trip. The Hezbollah leader,
Sheik Hassan Nasrullah is on the schedule for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most closely watched races on Sunday, the powerful
interior minister, Michel Murr, managed to salvage nearly all of
his ticket in the face of a tough challenge from Nassib Lahoud, a
wealthy businessman. He is a former ambassador to the United States
and a cousin _ though a political opponent _ of President Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
   Murr had been criticized by opposition leaders _ particularly
the Druse chieftain, Walid Jumblatt _ for his dual role as a
candidate and the official directly in charge of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Murr's slate was for the Metn district, mostly in the Christian
mountains north and east of Beirut, with eight seats. As in other
districts, they are allocated by religion in this divided land,
four for Maronite Catholics, two for Greek Orthodox, one for a
Roman Catholic and one for an Armenian Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates aligned with Murr eventually won all but two of the
Maronite seats. But despite his legions of election workers decked
out in blue T-shirts bearing his name and his control of the
electoral machinery, it was a close call. The official announcement
of the results, scheduled for Monday morning, was delayed until
that night.
</P>
<P>
   One Maronite seat went to the dissident Lahoud. The other was
won by Pierre Gemeyal, the 30-year old son of former President Amin
Gemeyal who went into exile in Paris after leaving office in 1988
and only returned this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Jumblatt, warlord of the Druse militia in the war, was a major
winner, taking all eight seats in his own constituency in the Shuf
and most of the nine seats in the neighboring Aley-Baabda
constituency. He has allied himself strongly with Hariri and has
lately taken to harsh public attacks on the role of Syria and its
intelligence agencies here.

TIMELESS MAGIC WITHIN THE DESERT'S SAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With the arrival of photography in the mid-19th century,
the desert entered the European imagination. Endless sand dunes in
the Sahara became metaphors for the grandiosity of Nature, camel
trains and nomadic tribesmen evoked romance and mystery. Of course
the first desert photographers were not artists; as explorers and
scientists, they were merely bent on recording the unknown and
unseen. Yet their work passed one test of art: it made people
dream.
</P>
<P>
   It is no great leap, then, a century and a half later, to
commission 10 contemporary artists to travel into the desert and
record their reactions to it. True, in the meantime the desert has
become less of a secret, with expanses of sand now all too familiar
to both tourists and moviegoers. (The desert was surely the real
star of David Lean's film ``Lawrence of Arabia.'') But that is
where artists come in: they can prod the collective imagination by
finding fresh magic.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Desert,'' a show at the Cartier Foundation for
Contemporary Art in Paris through Nov. 5, they set out to do just
that. The exhibition is built around works made for the occasion as
well as existing works by five other living artists, but it also
provides context through a selection of remarkable photographs from
the 19th and early 20th centuries. The result is to turn the
familiar into a surprise, the unfamiliar into a discovery.
</P>
<P>
   This also happens to have become the Cartier Foundation's
speciality in organizing frequent thematic shows at its gallery
space in the stunning steel-and-glass building on the Boulevard
Raspail that was designed by Jean Nouvel in 1994. These have
included ``Like a Bird'' in 1996, ``Amours'' 1997, ``Being Nature''
in 1998 and ``A Real World'' in 1999, each devised to provide the
artist's take on the commonplace. With ``The Desert,'' which will
be presented at La Caixa Foundation in Barcelona early next year,
the foundation has gone further by virtually creating the show
through commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's main lobby is dominated by three screening rooms.
One is given over to Bill Viola's 1979 film, ``Chott el-Djerid, a
Portrait in Light and Heat,'' in which the American video artist
juxtaposes wintry landscapes from North America with the mirages
and shimmering light of a dried-up salt lake in southern Tunisia.
Another shows ``Alice to Uluru, January '00,'' a commissioned work
by the Swiss artist Beat Streuli comprising 250 slides taken during
long drives through and flights over the Australian outback.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Depardon's film ``Deserts,'' also made for this show, is
a compilation of black-and-white photographs of mainly African
deserts (and their inhabitants), accompanied by atmospheric sounds
of children's voices, market cries, gunshots and wind. But the
Cartier Foundation also invited the Moroccan-born artist Titouan
Lamazou to travel to Timbuktu in Mali with 72 of Depardon's images
and to paint his own observations on the photographs. The results
add human warmth to the harshness of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the gallery's lower floor, though, that the
timelessness of the desert comes into focus through the mixed
display of old photographs and new works of art. Many of the
earliest desert photographs were taken in Egypt, where new
archaeological discoveries were drawing explorers and scientists.
Interestingly, in their photographs of the Sphinx and pyramids at
Giza, outside Cairo, Hippolyte Arnoux and J.P. Sebah made a point
of including camels and people in order to convey the massiveness
of the monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Soon photographers were venturing deeper into the deserts of
North Africa, revealing the majesty of the sand dunes, although
again frequently adding a human figure to show scale. Images taken
in desert communities, on the other hand, often reflected an
ethnographic interest in local customs and clothes. Gaetan Gatian
de Clerambault, for instance, took nearly 4,000 photographs of the
draped clothing of Moroccan women early in the 20th century. But he
also had an artist's eye: many of his images verge on the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Wilfred Thesiger, the British explorer, photographer and
writer (``Arabian Sands'') who is now 90, is in a sense a throwback
to the first desert photographers. Still in his 30s when he
discovered his ``vocation for the desert,'' as he put it, he has
dedicated his writing and photography to preserving the myths and
mysteries of the Arabian desert. In his images on display here,
there is no heat, only silence and solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Balthasar Burkhard, a Swiss photographer, found a new angle,
literally, by taking to the air earlier this year over the deserts
of Namibia in southern Africa, capturing the light and shadows of
boundless shifting sand dunes against the backdrop of arid
mountains. His stunning large-format photographs are echoed in
``Drift: 29 Days, 18 hours, 2 minutes,'' a 1999 film by Michael
Light, an American who has created a likeness of earthly deserts
using NASA images taken on the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Americans were invited to meditate on the deserts of
the United States for this exhibition. Lee Friedlander's
black-and-white photographs of entangled desert vegetation have the
abstraction of a Jackson Pollock painting. William Eggleston's
color photographs of the American Southwest, on the other hand,
remind one abruptly of what can happen when modern life penetrates
the desert: highways, gas stations, garbage. Walter De Maria's 1969
film ``Two Lines, Three Circles on the Desert'' puts Nature first:
it shows a man walking away from the camera in the Mojave Desert
until he disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The one artist who approached her commission with irreverence is
the Egyptian photographer Lara Baladi, who went into the Libyan
desert to create ``Om El Dounia'' (``Mother of the World''), a vast
mosaic of photographs with highly saturated colors. From afar the
work suggests sand dunes against a deep blue sky, but up close it
is alive with surrealist images: a desert with mermaids, a bizarre
picnic, an opium smoker, a sky where fish and clouds compete for
space.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly an exhibition with so many works from so many periods
can only aspire to the sensation of a journey through space and
time, one that starts with a concrete reality and ends up with
impressions and ideas. This show does that much. Reassuringly,
though, it does not pretend that this journey began in the mid-19th
century. The head of an ancient Egyptian mummy and an 18th-century
Iranian manuscript of the Koran in so-called dust writing are
timely reminders that the dead desert has always meant life, too.

 &HT;    First Delta 767-400to arrive in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Delta Air Lines will add a little more flash to its
fleet this week when it brings home its first Boeing 767-400, a new
model that will replace the airline's aging L-1011s.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767-400 set to arrive in Atlanta from Seattle on
Wednesday marks the first delivery under a 21-plane order Delta
placed in 1997. Delta, the first airline to fly the new plane, will
get 11 more by the end of the year. It will take ownership of the
first plane today in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 12 months, 767-400s will replace the
Lockheed-built L-1011 on many high-volume domestic routes,
including Atlanta to Orlando, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and
Tampa starting Oct. 1. By next year, the planes will fly to San
Francisco; Los Angeles; Honolulu; Maui, Hawaii; Salt Lake City;
West Palm Beach, Fla.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Dallas-Fort Worth;
and New York-LaGuardia.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's design isn't new; the 767-400 is a stretched version
of the popular 767, an industry workhorse that began flying in
1982. In addition to a longer fuselage, the new model has wingtip
extensions, new landing gear, upgraded cockpit instruments and a
remodeled cabin interior based on Boeing's 777.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers won't notice differences between aircraft models.
But any Delta frequent flier is familiar with the L-1011, said
Atlanta business travel consultant Chris McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like mom's old station wagon,'' McGinnis said.
``It's comfortable, but it's old. You'll miss it, but you're glad
you're getting a new car because the thing is ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta is the last major airline to fly the L-1011. American
Trans Air, an Indianapolis-based airline, operates the plane on
scheduled and chartered flights.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's list prices values 21 767-400 at a total of $2.4
billion, but large airlines like Delta rarely pay published prices
for new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The 767-400 is the third new model Delta has taken as part of
its 20-year agreement with Boeing, under which Delta buys only
planes built by the Seattle aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   The other two are the 737-800 and the 777.
</P>
<P>
   When seeking a replacement for the L-1011, Delta considered the
A-330, a competing wide-body built by Boeing rival Airbus
Industrie. Boeing's announcement that it planned the new version of
the 767 helped it win the Delta contract.
</P>
<P>
   The first 767-400 was supposed to arrive in May, but an
engineers' strike at Boeing last winter pushed back the date.
</P>
<P>
   Now Delta will start retiring its last 18 L-1011s. First flown
by Eastern Airlines in 1973, the chunky L-1011 could seat more than
300 people. Lockheed nicknamed it Tristar because of its three
engines; some flight attendants called it Tritanic because it flew
at a slight nose-up angle and drink carts rolled downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Though not a financial success, the plane, which competed for
customers with the Douglas DC-10, was advanced for its time and
among the first aircraft equipped to land in complete fog, said Tom
Crawford, a program manager at Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed delivered the last of its 250 L-1011s in the early
1980s. Delta was the biggest customer and at one point owned 56,
including some it bought from Eastern when that carrier shut down
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''With both Eastern and Delta hubbing in Atlanta, if you flew in
a wide-body from Atlanta in the '70s and '80s, there was a strong
chance you were on a L-1011,'' said George Hamlin, a senior vice
president at the Global Aviation Associates in Washington. ``This
is kind of a watershed event at Hartsfield.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear what will happen to all Delta's L-1011s, but one
will be donated to the Federal Aviation Association's Federal Air
Marshal program.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months a young woman had been flirting with George W. Bush,
resulting in a cash bet among co-workers about whether they would
end up having an affair. And now the flirtation had provoked a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had told the woman off, humiliating her, and a top campaign
official stormed into his office and rebuked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really hurt her,'' the official scolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, good,'' Bush replied icily from his chair. ``I'm a
married man. I'm glad she got the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of 1987 in Washington, in the decrepit
eighth-floor headquarters of Vice President George Bush's
presidential campaign. Doug Wead, then a campaign worker who
happened to be in George W.'s office talking to him when the
confrontation occurred, recalled the episode, along with another
senior campaign official who witnessed it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had moved to Washington to help his father's campaign,
even asked Wead to stick close by when they were on the road
together and to stay with him in his hotel room until late at
night, Wead said. The aim was to fend off the woman, whose
seductive energies Bush valued so long as they were directed at
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted everyone to know that nothing was happening,'' Wead
said.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was getting a first-rate political education, and
proving his skill in maneuvering through an often treacherous
electoral world. He describes himself in those days as having been
``a warrior for George Bush,'' and he became a single-minded
warrior, constantly and sometimes rudely driving home the sole goal
of getting his father into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He learned the importance of a disciplined, loyal and tightly
focused campaign. He made sure that campaign officials would be
distracted neither by hormones nor by the opportunity to become
media stars.
</P>
<P>
   And as he got his first real taste of national politics, Bush
found that he loved it and was good at it. He also learned from a
master strategist, Lee Atwater, how to woo baby boomers and destroy
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one paradox stands out: Bush immersed himself back then in
the practice of national politics while remaining largely oblivious
to its substance. Some people get into politics because they feel
passionately about certain issues; Bush's passion in the 1988
campaign was for his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motivation was, he's been a great dad,'' Bush told
reporters recently, speaking of the 1988 and 1992 campaigns. He
pushed no particular agenda, and no one seems to recall instances
when, of his own volition, he pressed for one policy or another.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the correspondence between father and son during the
Bush presidency, obtained from the Bush presidential library
through the Freedom of Information Act, turns up plenty of times
when George W. asked his father to send autographs to Texas friends
or even to consider particular people for federal jobs _ but
virtually none in which he suggests that his father take a
particular position on an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that Bush, in that first encounter with national
politics, proved immensely talented at steering his ship to avoid
shoals and rough seas, while keeping the passengers content. But he
sometimes seemed less concerned with precisely where the ship of
state was headed.
</P>
<P>
   Republican campaign officials were nervous in April 1987 when
Bush settled in a town house on Massachusetts Avenue and began
working in the ratty Bush headquarters at 733 15th Street NW in
Washington. He would sit in his bare office, door always open, his
cowboy boots on his desk, a wad of tobacco under his lip and a
plastic foam cup in his hand as his spittoon.
</P>
<P>
   But James Pinkerton, who had an office across the hall from
Bush's, and others said they quickly warmed to Junior, as he was
called then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't just decisive, he was the most decisive person I'd
ever met in my life,'' Wead said. ``He wasn't just energetic, he
was constantly on the go, even missing meals. When you came from
being on the road with him, you felt something like jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a consultant and senior adviser, paid $5,000 a month,
according to federal election records, but as he told a Texas
reporter at the time, ``When your name is George Bush, you don't
need a title in the George Bush campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   James Baker recalled that ``he was in a sense his father's eyes
and ears.'' Baker, President Bush's longtime friend and a cabinet
member in the Reagan and Bush administrations, said, ``The
president knew he could rely on W. to report truthfully on what was
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush gradually won friends in the office through his humor and
lack of pretension.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come in to a meeting with a cup'' _ his spittoon _ ``and
stick out his hand with a big smile and say, `Hi, I'm George Bush,
and thanks for what you're doing for my dad,''' said Richard Bond,
then the national political director for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his ghostwritten autobiography, Bush suggests that one of his
main roles was dealing with reporters. But aides say he did little
of that, partly because he was too temperamental to be trusted with
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did play a more substantive role in putting out one
media fire. It was in the summer of 1987, when rumors began
circulating widely, without any particular evidence, that Vice
President Bush was having an affair with a longtime assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Teeley, then the spokesman for the campaign, remembers
arguing against addressing the rumors, for fear of giving
journalists an excuse to broadcast them. But Atwater and George W.
insisted that they had to do something, and they concocted a
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   George W., a campaign aide recalls, was so adoring of his father
that he never doubted for an instant that the rumors were false.
And so, with characteristic bluntness, he simply asked his father
about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just not true,'' the vice president replied.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater then leaked the exchange to Newsweek, along with George
W.'s colorful conclusion: ``The answer to the Big A question is
N-O.'' The adultery rumors immediately faded and the issue was
defused.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bush showed a talent for managing people in the
headquarters, reassuring them when they were upset and reproaching
them when they were not working hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the disciplinarian,'' remembered Andy Card, another key
aide. ``I'm blessed that I never got taken to the woodshed. But if
you were a disappointment to the campaign, he would let you know
that you were a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters between George W. Bush and his father's White House,
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, almost never
mention the grand issues of the day; nearly all have to do with
paying back favors for old family friends in an old-boy network.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas autograph collector named John W. Dorman, for example,
had written to Bush asking for help in getting the president's
signature. So Bush forwarded it to his father's secretary, with the
notation: ``Patti _ this guy has been loyal to all Bushes. Thanks,
GB.''
</P>
<P>
   The record shows that in each case, President Bush sent out the
autographs, personal notes and other favors. The result was that
the younger Bush gained chits that would be useful when he began
his own political career.
</P>
<P>
   The only item in the archive containing a policy suggestion from
Bush is a January 1992 letter to Samuel K. Skinner, the White House
chief of staff, about oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Bush suggested that ``a mention in the State of
the Union message would help.'' He added: ``Perhaps, the big guy
could renew his call for a cleaner America and announce that --
percent of the government fleet will be converted to use natural
gas or fuel with farm product additives.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, President Bush signed into law a bill providing
that some new cars in government fleets would use natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was far less involved in the 1992 campaign than he had been
in 1988. He did some public speaking and stayed in regular touch by
telephone with campaign officials, but he did not move to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But he seethed from a distance at the portrayal of his father in
the news media and at the way campaign officials blamed one
another, leaked secrets and generally ran an undisciplined effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush may have learned even more from the failed 1992
campaign than from the successful 1988 one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them jumping out the windows in 1992 looking for the
next campaign,'' Bush told reporters last month. ``And that
influenced me. Yeah, that influenced me. I worry that some may be
wanting to be involved in my campaign to enhance their consulting
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   One lesson Bush drew, friends say, is the importance of relying
on old friends in a campaign, even over people with more
experience. This year, Bush has surrounded himself with close
friends who are absolutely devoted to his career, and his leakproof
staff has the discipline and harmony of a chorus line.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush has never picked up, despite having a father in the
White House, is a fascination for the intricacies of foreign or
domestic policy. Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman,
recalls that when they met during his father's White House years
they would chat about baseball, not government.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner puts it this way: ``He was certainly not immersing
himself deeply in policy.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Bush gained an excellent political education under his
father, it was focused entirely on gaining power rather than using
it. He came across as a work in progress, relishing the theater of
politics, but leaving questions about what he would do with the
reins of government if he got hold of them.

 &HT;    Georgia quarterback Carter finds there's always criticism
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. - It stung Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter like,
well, a Yellow Jacket. Or a Gator. Or a Volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   On page 121 of Sports Illustrated's college-football preview
issue, an opposing coach offered this scouting report on the
Bulldogs' third-year quarterback:
</P>
<P>
   ``Quincy's a beautiful athlete, but there's more to being great
than looking good. I don't see it in him. Every big game he's
played in, he's lost and looked bad. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Only four quarterbacks, including Heisman Trophy winners Ty
Detmer of Brigham Young and Charlie Ward of Florida State, have
thrown for more passing yards than Carter in their first two
college seasons. In only 22 regular-season games, Carter has thrown
for 5,197 yards, the third-highest total in Georgia history. He
needs only 1,138 yards to pass former three-year starter Mike Bobo.
</P>
<P>
   But as Carter begins his junior season Saturday against Georgia
Southern in Sanford Stadium, one glaring statistic continues to dog
him: He has lost all six games against Florida, Georgia Tech and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accepted that (as the way I'm measured), but I can't put
that much pressure on myself,'' said Carter, a former Parade
Magazine All-American from Southwest DeKalb High. ``I can't say,
'Quincy, you're not going to be successful unless you beat those
three teams.' I base success on wins and losses. But, at the same
time, it's a team effort. I'm not going to base it on whether I
beat Tech, Florida or Tennessee. I know my abilities. I believe in
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm going to get what I deserve anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons, Carter isn't getting much in terms of
respect. Even Carter admits that he is probably regarded as a
``third-tier quarterback,'' behind Purdue's Drew Brees, Nebraska's
Eric Crouch and Virginia Tech's Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted by the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser during
last month's SEC Media Days in Birmingham, Carter was named the
``most overrated player'' in the SEC. Auburn quarterback Ben Leard,
who beat Georgia 38-21 in Athens last season, was named the
league's ``most underrated player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All summer, I've been hearing about Michael Vick and Drew
Brees,'' Carter said. ``Now, everybody is saying that I haven't
performed well against Florida and Tennessee and Tech. There's
always criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter contends that his performance the past two seasons has
been overlooked. In 1998, he was the first Georgia freshman to
start at quarterback since Johnny Rauch in 1945. He broke nearly
all of Eric Zeier's freshman passing records, and his 2,713 passing
yards last season were the most for a Bulldog sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one says anything about the yards I've passed for the last
couple of seasons,'' Carter said. ``That's just the way it goes.
I'm like a third-tier guy to everybody else right now. The only
thing I can do is to keep working hard. It shows on film what I do,
so I'll just let people talk, and I'll keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL Draft guru Joel Buchsbaum of Pro Football Weekly has watched
film of Carter and says that Carter needs to show drastic
improvement this season. Buchsbaum says Carter would not be a
first-round draft choice today but could become one if he improves
his decision-making and passing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's a very good athlete with very good skills, but
he's still got a lot to learn about playing quarterback,''
Buchsbaum said. ``He's not as accurate throwing as you think he is,
and a lot of his reads aren't correct. He needs to show tremendous
improvement over the course of the season. He needs to improve his
judgment _ where to throw and when to throw _ and his passing
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchsbaum says some NFL teams might question Carter's ability to
play well in the games that matter most. In his six starts against
Florida, Georgia Tech and Tennessee, Carter has completed 51.5
percent of his passes while throwing for an average of 239.5 yards.
He has thrown five touchdowns and seven interceptions in those
games.
</P>
<P>
   In his other 16 starts at Georgia, Carter has completed 66.2
percent of his passes for 24 touchdowns and only eight
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he plays as well as he played last year,'' Georgia
coach Jim Donnan said. ``I'll be happy with that. He didn't have
the game against Florida like he did the year before, but I think
he played well throughout the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchsbaum rates Brees as the highest-rated passer available in
next year's NFL Draft. If Vick leaves Virginia Tech as a sophomore,
he could be the first player drafted. Carter's status is not
certain. He says he hasn't decided whether he would return to
Georgia for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that Carter could improve his draft projection
with a solid junior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things I want to accomplish,'' Carter said.
``I'm not going to base my decision on turning pro on whether we
win a national championship or whether we're a top team. I'm just
going to look at the whole picture.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, that picture includes criticism and doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to it,'' he said. ``When I was in high school, I was
always regarded as the quarterback behind (former Kentucky and
current Cleveland Browns star) Tim Couch. It always seems like
someone is saying that someone is better than me. If you look at
it, Drew Brees hasn't won a Big 10 title. He hasn't been to the
Rose Bowl. I'll get my credit when it's due.''

 &HT;    A weekend trip through the labyrinthine world of Internet sports
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Memo to: The office.
</P>
<P>
   Re: That assignment you gave me to watch sports on the Internet
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The latest: I'm trapped in cyberhell. It sounds like something
out of Twilight Zone, but it's true. There is a cartoon of a
ballplayer named Ron Jocker on my screen. His lips are moving, and
the audio track is saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the Mets. The biggest thing I don't like about New York
are the foreigners. How the hell did they get in this country,
anyway? I don't have the attention span to go out there and
concentrate much longer than 10 minutes. I am not a racist. I was
not raised that way. Baseball is just a game, and no matter what
happens my parents still love me.''
</P>
<P>
   And I can't get rid of it. Jocker keeps railing on, even though
the computer appears to have shut down. I'm stuck with a cartoon
maniac looming on my screen and coming out the speakers. This is a
computer greeting-card company's idea of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I know it wasn't part of the assignment. But following the
Braves pitch by pitch on the Internet wasn't that exciting. So I
decided to answer the e-mail that carried the subject line: Get
back at Atlanta's Bad Boy Pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that Ron Jocker.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least something dramatic happened during my Internet
surf.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of two days and a long Saturday night, I
felt like I had been trapped in a time warp, back in the days when
news came over a ticker tape, line by line.
</P>
<P>
   Following baseball pitch by pitch, college football play by
play, Tiger Woods hole by hole. It lacked all of the emotion and
color one gets from TV, or by being there. The experiment revealed
this surprising revelation: the best thing to watch on the Internet
is a NASCAR race.
</P>
<P>
   On NASCAR.com, you get the race summary lap by lap, a graphic of
little cars supposedly running in true proximity among the top
four, a graphic of the track layout and a radar image showing how
far rain showers in the Midwest are from Bristol Motor Speedway. A
scoring and timing page gives each car's last-lap speed.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't get are the pit stops and the wrecks. On the Web,
a ``Race Alert'' dialogue box is as intense as it gets: ``Lap 395.
An incident involving Robert Pressley has brought out the 11th
caution in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   If you love statistics, following the pro golf tour is slightly
interesting. PGATour.com posts round-by-round, hole-by-hole scores
of tournaments, followed by a summary of key categories _ driving
accuracy, driving distance, putts per round, sand saves, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers can leave one cold.
</P>
<P>
   I had expected to spend the weekend locked in my computer room
with Cynthia Cooper, Tiger Woods, Venus Williams, Ruben Mavarez,
Hristo Stoichkov and Albert the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them showed up.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to follow Williams in the Pilot Pen finals against
Monica Seles got sidetracked by this revelation: www.WTA.com does
not connect to the Women's Tennis Association but rather to
Anything.com, a company that advises Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some insider's info: type carefully. My typo _ Teenis.com _
brought me to My Teeny Tiny David Cassidy Appreciation Site. After
correcting my error, I was able to navigate to Tennis.com. Without
a match available, I felt obliged to work through the nine Anna
Kournikova Web pages and catch up on her development. The photos
testify that she surely has perfected the art of bending over to
tie her shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Had planned to follow Stoichkov and the Chicago Fire in the MSL
soccer match against Tampa Bay. No such luck. But www.mlssoccer did
offer one of the more interesting sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the latest news on drugs, players in trouble, manager
movement, injuries, scandals and a whole lot of other offbeat
features to keep you amused,'' it promised, but I was too timid to
click on Kickmyballs.com.
</P>
<P>
   My fascination with WNBA.com kept me from tuning into Albert the
Great's near-win in the Travers Stakes. I caught the Houston
Comets-New York Liberty championship game in progress. On the
cybercast, guest analyst Kym Hampton, retired Liberty center, was
available for Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive opportunity cluttered things up:
</P>
<P>
   MODERATOR: At 2:33 p.m. With 1:36 remaining in the half the
score is now 24-23 Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Megan from the Web: ``What do you recommend that New York works
on for the second half?
</P>
<P>
   Kym Hampton: ``Making more shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the game in Portuguese was as informative. ``Your
own photos from Houston with WNBA.cam'' offered still views from
either basket.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over at www.ABCSports.com, Mavarez was pitching
Venezuela to the Little World Series title. Clicked on Myteam.com
to hear the gamecast. Instead, got an insult: ``You have an
outdated version of RealPlayer,'' the dialog box shouted.
``Download RealPlayer8 now, $29.99.''
</P>
<P>
   I always follow instructions. As the computer began the
46-minute downloading procedure, I escaped upstairs to watch the
Venezuelans win the game on TV. Returned to find the computer had
crashed with only 77 percent of the download complete. Scrapped the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Went to Fastball.com. To catch up on the Yankees-A's, already in
the top of the fourth, I clicked on the update and received 12
pages of play by play.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to watch the Kansas State-Iowa football opener. With
no audio available to me from the FANSonly.com site, I settled for
the play by play on www.K-Statesports.com. 2-8 K22 Allen 28 rush
middle (Davison). Just like reporters get in the press box, except
chronologically backwards, with the most recent play listed first.
</P>
<P>
   Another dialogue box popped onto the screen. ``Get out of debt.
Click here.'' How'd those people know I was online?
</P>
<P>
   Followed the game until K-State took a 17-0 lead (Beasley 4 pass
left to Morgan; touchdown (at) 0:19) just before halftime. The site
was packed with stats after the game, including drive charts, play
by play, notes and quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Clicked on over to Atlantabraves.com to see if they had rallied
against the Cardinals. They hadn't. Neither had my audio function.
Clicked on MLB radio, which allows access to every broadcast, and a
voice from inside the computer said, ``Sorry, but we did not
understand the URL you requested. Please check the URL and try
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a long day had become night. Dialed up NASCAR.com to
watch Rusty Wallace run away at Bristol. Neither Seminoles.com nor
BYUCougars.com offered play by play. Clicked on the audio broadcast
at the BYU site and got a message that said: ``Error No. 11. This
document is not a RealAudio document.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when I fell into the Ron Jockerzone.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The Internet is interesting for cold numbers and
requires patience and a more agreeable computer than mine. I'll
take a TV and remote control, thanks.

STUDY FINDS BLACKS DID BETTER BY CHANGING TO PRIVATE SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wis., Wash. D.C., N.Y., Ohio)  By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black public school students who attended private schools on
scholarships that were similar to vouchers performed significantly
higher on standardized math and reading tests than similar students
who remained in public schools, a study released Monday says.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year study of students in three cities, by researchers
at Harvard University, Georgetown University and the University of
Wisconsin, found that the average performance of the black students
who switched to private school was 6 percentile points higher than
students who stayed in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which followed students in voucher programs aimed at
children from poor families in New York City, Washington and
Dayton, Ohio, found no significant overall gains among students in
other ethic groups who moved to private schools from public
schools. The greatest gains for black students were in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are expected to be cited by advocates of vouchers
for public school students during the current election season,
particularly as the two major presidential candidates stake out
opposing positions on school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential
nominee, supports vouchers that poor families can use for
private-school tuition, saying it will force public schools to
improve. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, says
vouchers will drain needed resources from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many previous studies of the effects of school vouchers,
students in the new study were randomly selected to receive the
privately financed scholarships and then compared with students who
applied for them but did not receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students in the New York City and Washington
programs received vouchers paid for by Ted Forstmann and John
Walton, the businessmen and philanthropists who founded the
Children's Scholarship Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Peterson, the Harvard researcher who was one of four
authors of the report and the principal investigator in each of the
three cities, said in an interview Monday that the study provided
evidence that private-school vouchers can help to achieve ``a
nontrivial closing of the gap'' in achievement between black
students and the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that opposed vouchers criticized the study, with some
noting that that among those who helped pay for it were several
conservative research groups and voucher advocates, including the
Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and the Milton and Rose D. Friedman
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The study's results raised questions about why blacks who moved
to private schools improved so much more than students from other
ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, in Washington, where the
improvement among black students was twice as great as in New York
City and one-third greater than in Dayton, the reading scores of
black students declined sharply in the first year that they
attended private school. Only after the second year did those
students record the gains that were the highest of any ethnic group
in any city over the entire two-year study.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson explained the anomaly by saying that some students
might have had difficulty in adjusting to private school during the
first year.
</P>
<P>
   And, Peterson said, when the researchers asked the parents of
all voucher recipients in New York City about the differences
between their children's private schools and their former public
schools, parents of black voucher recipients were more likely to
cite differences in discipline, specifically less fighting,
property destruction and racial conflict at the private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other education experts raised questions about why some 20
percent of students dropped out of the study, either by returning
to public school after the first year or by receiving a voucher but
choosing not to attend private school.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson attributed those results to the fact that voucher
recipients typically had to contribute about half of the
private-school tuition, or received vouchers but could not find
space at a conveniently located private school. In any case, he
said, those results were accounted for in the researchers'
analysis.

   STATEOFSOUTH _ CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - A new report analyzing the
South recommends a politically dicey approach to spreading
prosperity across the region: Nurturing the already-booming New
Economy cities, such as Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill,
because their prosperity ripples to outlying communities. For
decades, the notion of government and business nurturing its strong
cities has been a sore spot among rural area and their politicians.
But noting that ``the challenge before Southerners is at once
sweeping and exhilarating,'' MDC says, ``It is to ensure that the
region's prospering places and people continue to thrive, while
helping the people and places that are falling further behind gain
the capacity to adapt and flourish in a rapidly changing economy.''

   OUTBACK _ Keyed to the opening of the Summer lympics (9/15): The
vast majority of the Australian continent is nothing like Sydney or
Melbourne. It's an arid, sparsely populated moonscape that the
world knows as the Outback. The spiritual heart of it is called the
Red Centre, after the red sand that ripples under the hot wind. We
journey into the region aboard the Ghan train, kick around the
funky town of Alice Springs and make a pilgrimage to Uluru, the
great rust-colored mountain in the middle of the continent that is
sacred to Aborigines and iconic to all Australians. (Auchmutey,

bone marrow cancer. And so, when the 46-year-old McLaurin was
diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few months ago, he was
well prepared to die. He had lived a full life, he told himself. An
ex-Marine who had kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20
years, he had been married and divorced twice, had two teenage

 USE OF SOME HYPERTENSION DRUGS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second-most popular kind of drug used to lower high blood
pressure is less effective than other drugs in preventing heart
attacks and heart failure, according to a study being reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The use of such drugs, known as calcium channel blockers, is
leading to nearly 85,000 unnecessary heart attacks and cases of
heart failure each year worldwide, with half the cases in the
United States, the study's authors are reporting at a meeting in
Amsterdam of the European Cardiology Society.
</P>
<P>
   The findings seem likely to extend a debate over the safety and
effectiveness of calcium channel blockers to treat high blood
pressure, also called hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium channel blockers are not harmful. By blocking calcium's
role in contracting muscles in the heart and arteries, the drugs
relax muscles and directly lower blood pressure. But because the
drugs are less effective, users do not gain the benefits they would
by using other types of antihypertensive drugs, and the reason is
unknown, said the scientific team that was led by Dr. Curt D.
Furberg of Wake Forest University School of Medicine in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Patented calcium channel blockers are also much more expensive
than other antihypertensive drugs, Furberg said. He cited costs of
$740 to $990 a year for calcium channel blockers compared with $60
for low doses of a diuretic drug. Wider use of more effective
antihypertensive drugs could reduce health care costs in the United
States by up to $5 billion a year, Furberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium channel blocker listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference
include: Adalat, Calan, Cardene, Cardizem, Covera, Dilacor,
Isoptin, Nimotop, Norvasc, Plendil, Procardia, Sular, Tiazac,
Vascor and Verelan.
</P>
<P>
   Such drugs should not be taken off the market, Furberg said.
But, he stressed, doctors should be more cautious in prescribing
them as a first-line drug therapy. Furberg's team urged doctors to
limit use of calcium channel blockers to patients who have not
responded to other standard drugs or who cannot tolerate them.
Low-dose diuretics should continue to be considered as the standard
therapy, and all new classes of drugs should be compared with
diuretics, Furberg's team said.
</P>
<P>
   Furberg and other experts stressed that patients should not stop
taking calcium channel blockers without first talking with their
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 28 million people worldwide, including 12.7 million
in this country, take calcium channel blockers to lower high blood
pressure and for other reasons like relieving the pain of angina.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more take antihypertensive drugs from other classes.
They work by different mechanisms and include: ACE inhibitors, the
most popular, which block a cascade of hormones beginning with one
produced by the kidneys; diuretics, which reduce the amount of
fluid in the blood vessels; beta-blockers, which reduce the force
and rate of the heart's contractions; and alpha blockers, which
slow the brain's action on the sympathetic nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Temple, a top official of the FDA, said the agency
would pay close attention to the findings. ``It hasn't been
possible to do this before because there wasn't a great deal of
comparative data,'' Temple said.
</P>
<P>
   Temple said he expected that additional important information
would come from a study that is the largest involving a calcium
channel blocker. It is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute. But the study will not end until 2002, said
Furberg, who is the study's chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   That study and a number of other large-scale trials should
provide evidence supporting the benefits of calcium channel
blockers for hypertension, said Dr. Rob Scott, a vice president of
Pfizer, which makes Procardia XL and Norvasc. ``All the data we
have tells us that blood pressure lowering is a good thing to do,''
Scott said. ``We need to try not to start making recommendations
that could turn out to be wrong until we have the results of those
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcium channel blockers have been marketed for more than two
decades in the United States, and critics have said that their
long-term safety has never been documented, unlike some other
antihypertensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Furberg's team began challenging the drugs' safety and
effectiveness in 1995. The team focused first on the short-acting
form of calcium channel blockers that many American doctors had
prescribed for high blood pressure despite its lacking FDA approval
for such use. In 1995, federal health officials warned that
short-acting calcium channel blockers should be prescribed ``with
great caution, if at all.'' Since then, their use in this country
has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Furberg's team also challenged the safety and
effectiveness of the long-acting form of calcium channel blockers.
But critics contended that they were safer because they lowered
blood pressure more gradually than the short-acting form. The
debate could not be resolved because of a lack of information from
scientifically controlled trials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, The New England Journal of Medicine published a study
from the University of Toronto concerning the debate over the
safety of calcium channel blockers. The study found that doctors
who wrote articles in medical journals supporting the use of
calcium channel blockers were much more likely to have financial
relationships with drug companies than authors who were critical of
such use or had neutral positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Furberg said his team responded to the criticism by doing what
is known as a meta-analysis. It combines a number of small studies
to provide a greater statistical power than any of the smaller ones
can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Furberg's team analyzed information on 27,000 patients who
participated in nine studies. All the studies had been published in
peer-reviewed medical journals that directly compared calcium
channel blockers and other antihypertensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the risk of heart attack was 27
percent higher and the risk of heart failure 26 percent higher
among users of calcium channel blockers. There was no difference in
risk of stroke or total number of deaths from all causes between
those taking channel blockers and other drugs, and no evidence of
differences among the various calcium channel blocker drugs in the
study. The meta-analysis also found that all drugs lowered the
blood pressure by the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of lowering high blood pressure is to prevent damage to
blood vessels that can lead to complications like heart attacks,
heart failure and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional medical wisdom has held that lowering blood
pressure to normal levels was all that mattered in preventing
complications. But doctors are beginning to understand that such
prevention is much more complicated than simply reducing blood
pressure to normal levels, said Dr. Michael H. Alderman, a
co-author of the study from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
the Bronx and a former president of the American Society of
Hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of developing complications is now thought to involve
the interplay of a number of hormones and factors in the walls of
blood vessels and the actions of drugs on them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, drugs that have an equal effect on lowering blood pressure
may vary in their ability to prevent heart attacks and heart
failure, and mechanisms that do not involve blood pressure may be
important in determining the therapeutic effects of
antihypertensive drugs, Alderman said.

GORE TAKES AIM AT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Campaigning in a battleground state home to
many senior citizens, Vice President Al Gore said Monday that
prescription drug pricing that makes the same medication cheaper
for animals than for humans is especially harmful to the elderly
and should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the ability to dictate the price,'' Gore said of the
nation's drug companies. ``But they know the market for cats and
dogs won't bear as high a price, so they have the power to dictate
a much lower price to the veterinarian's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Florida on the first stop of a week that will focus
on health care, specifically his proposal to extend prescription
drug benefits under the Medicare program to an estimated 40 million
people at a cost of &UR;  &LR; $250 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would provide a prescription drug benefit with the
government paying half a patient's annual cost up to $5,000. The
plan, which would be funded by projected budget surplus funds, also
would cover catastrophic drug expenses over $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of several dozen senior citizens on the
Florida State University campus, Gore described how his
mother-in-law and the family Labrador are prescribed the same
medication for different ailments, with the dog's monthly
prescription bill totaling far less.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said such disparities are disturbing at a time when many
senior citizens on fixed incomes are forced to either go without
other necessities or cut back on their medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is time to say to every senior in this country,
we have come to the point when we can improve Medicare by giving a
prescription drug benefit to every single senior in this country,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with the start of Gore's health care week, the
Republican National Committee began airing $7 million in new
advertising critical of Gore's proposals, claiming the vice
president is ``pushing a big government plan that lets Washington
bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, has not outlined
the specifics of his own proposal on health care, but has indicated
preference for letting seniors choose among a variety of private
plans, some of which may offer prescription drug benefits. He said
in Austin Monday that he'll provide more details next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett called Gore's proposal a
``one-size-fits-all, government-run drug plan,'' and compared it to
the failed 1993 attempt by the Clinton administration to establish
a national health care program.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what is fueling the ongoing focus on health care is data
showing voters rating it as an important issue in this year's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the audience at FSU that he would work to improve
health care coverage for veterans, saying health care benefits and
retirement security are among his top campaign priorities. One of
the great hurdles, he said, is how high prescription drug costs
have risen since Medicare was created 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting his struggles to care for a handicapped adult son,
Arthur Flatt, 77, said he and his wife saved for their retirement
but soon found the costs of family health care overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we turn around, we get sick,'' said Flatt.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt, with his voice breaking, told Gore that getting a
reduction on prescription drug prices would allow him to pay for
home health care for his son, a one-time engineer who suffered a
brain aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're carrying a heavier burden than you should have to
carry,'' Gore said, embracing the man.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Dixie, 74, told Gore that it's ``really depressing''
seeing her friends forego their medicine to pay for food, a choice
Dixie said she also is sometimes forced to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can handle the pain, but there are a lot of people
who can't do it,'' Dixie said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, perspiring under the hot lights while he empathized in
turn with members of the audience, encouraged hesitant speakers
with ``I hear ya's'' and frequently intoned ``Bless you, God bless
you.''
</P>
<P>
   After campaigning in the Florida capital, the vice president
headed for a Monday night rally in Albuquerque, N.M. Other health
care-related events for Gore this week include a talk today in
Albuquerque on children's health coverage, and a rally later this
week in support of a patients' bill of rights.

RELEGATED TO THE SIDEWALK, STEEL DRUM BANDS WEATHER EXPOSURE TO
REHEARSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: name Stephan Gleich is CQ) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sleep did not come easily to Yuri Narinesingh the
last few days. He was used to a bed, not the ragged gray rug spread
out above a sidewalk in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the dozens of steel oil drums lining the block
to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   They were sorted into groups, half a dozen or so each, and
lashed to metal frames that could be rolled up and down the block,
like coat racks. Each morning, Narinesingh counted the drums when
he woke up. One stolen here, another misplaced there could spell
disaster for his 75-member band, the Nu Tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this for the sake of music, just music,'' said
Narinesingh, who had not shaved or showered for days while he was
guarding the drums.
</P>
<P>
   This week was supposed to cap a march to glory for the band. The
group is scheduled to compete Sept. 2 with 12 other steel drum
bands for thousands of dollars in prizes before Brooklyn's giant
West Indian American Carnival on Labor Day, which is expected to
draw more than 2 million people. The competition, called Panorama,
is one of the premier contests for pan music, a variant of calypso
played on converted oil drums.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nu Tunes, along with two other pan bands called the Pan
Rebels and the Metro Steel Orchestra, have found themselves
literally out on the street. On Aug. 16, they were forced from a
warehouse at 680 Parkside Ave. where they had stored their
instruments and rehearsed for several years. So the three bands
have been doing a bit of sidewalk improvising ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Through rainstorms and sweltering heat, they have kept their
drums on the pavement right outside the building, rehearsed there,
and even held round-the-clock vigils on the industrial block to
watch over the instruments. The thunderous rehearsals, which draw
hundreds of band members and residents, have also perked up the
ears of police officers, who have dropped by every night to keep an
eye on things.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians said they were trying to find another space,
or help in negotiations with the landlord, but have come up
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The bands had never signed a lease or paid rent for the
warehouse, and the landlord, Klyn Properties, did not know the
bands were there, said Stephan Gleich, a lawyer representing Klyn.
Gleich said that several months ago, he heard there were bands in
the warehouse and asked the police to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, police officers went to the warehouse and arrested
Tony Joseph, the leader of the Metro Steel Orchestra, for
trespassing. The officers told the other bands to leave the
building.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two days, fire marshals and inspectors from the
Department of Buildings dropped by to look at the warehouse. They
cited a faulty roof and issued an order preventing anyone from
using the building. The bands and their equipment were out on the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   This was no way for anyone to live, said Narinesingh, who
usually sleeps in his apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Lounging on
a peeling vinyl couch on the sidewalk, he scratched at his beard.
The stench of urine wafted through the air. The musicians no longer
had use of the warehouse bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so embarrassing,'' Narinesingh said, a pair of
welder's goggles on his forehead, his T-shirt and khaki pants
covered in black grime. ``We're just simple people playing music,
taking part in our own culture. It's not a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The band members, who range from 6-year-old girls to 60-year-old
men, fear the humiliation that may come when music arrangers arrive
this week from Trinidad and Tobago and see them on the street. Two
of the bands have paid thousands of dollars to fly the arrangers
over to help pull together calypso favorites.
</P>
<P>
   But the show must go on, particularly since the Brooklyn
festival is one of the main showcases of the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed with what's happening,'' said Carlos
Lezama, president of the West Indian American Day Carnival
Association. ``But regardless of what the situation is, these
fellows will come out for Panorama. Practice or no practice, they
will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Panorama, which is performed in a lot behind the Brooklyn Museum
of Art, is one of the most renowned pan music competitions in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the bands battle it out, they march in a parade
called Jouvert (pronounced joo-VAY), ushering in the massive and
brightly costumed carnival that winds down Eastern Parkway on Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for the pan competition begins early in the year,
culminating in frenetic rehearsals during the summer. Bands
throughout the city often use empty lots for that purpose,
converting them into what are called panyards. Before this summer,
the three bands on Parkside Avenue practiced both in and outside
the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Edward Roberts, a lawyer representing two of the
bands, filed a request for a temporary injunction in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn asking the landlord to let the bands back into
the warehouse until Labor Day. A hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Dawad Philip, a manager for Pan Rebels, admitted the bands did
not have ``a legal leg to stand on in terms of tenant-landlord
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the bands have been pushing forward with their
daily rehearsals, despite lack of sleep and occasional rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   The three bands rehearse from 9 p.m. until 2 a.m., when the
police end the session. Although there have been no complaints
about noise on the industrial block, some officials at Intermediate
School 2, across the street, have asked band members not to urinate
on the side of the school, Philip said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the headaches, the band members have tried to remain as
up-beat as their calypso standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live for the competition,'' Philip said. ``Will we be as
strong as previous years? That remains to be seen. But we believe
the gods are with us.''

FARE WARS RAGE WITHIN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, September 2) 
 By ROGER COLLIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flying around Europe has never been cheaper, especially for
visitors from abroad. A new Oneworld Alliance air pass offers
bargain fares to non-European visitors to 200 destinations in 50
countries in Europe and North Africa on member carriers _ including
Aer Lingus, British Airways, Finnair and Iberia _ and a raft of
regional affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, no-frills carriers like EasyJet, Ryanair, Go, Buzz
and Virgin Express collectively serve about 50 destinations with
fares up to one-third less than those of conventional carriers, and
with fewer restrictions. Major carriers, such as Alitalia, Iberia,
Swissair and Lufthansa, are responding with aggressive seat sales
on their Web sites with fares that can be 50 percent less than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneworld pass, which became available a few weeks ago, is a
great way to travel around Europe using one-way flights between
most major cities. For example, flying from London to Dublin and
then to Paris and on to Madrid will cost $320. You can buy just the
two flight coupons needed to get the pass _ or as many more as you
like. The price depends on the number and the length of flights.
</P>
<P>
   You must buy the coupons before you travel to Europe in
conjunction with a round-trip intercontinental flight _ either
direct from a Oneworld Alliance carrier (Aer Lingus, American
Airlines, British Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Cathay Pacific,
LanChile, Qantas) or through a travel agent. But you don't have to
cross the Atlantic with a Oneworld carrier to get the air pass,
which can be bought any time before you leave.
</P>
<P>
   Once ticketed, however, you cannot change your itinerary and
must book the first European sector before you leave home;
subsequent coupons, each for a single one-way flight, can be left
open-dated. Changing the date of a flight (or several dates at the
same time) costs $40. You have to decide in advance where you want
to travel within one of five zones (see chart).
</P>
<P>
   You cannot switch coupons between zones. You are likely to get a
booking on the flights you seek. Prices are much cheaper than
normal one-way fares and are on a par with round-trip excursion
fares _ London to Paris, for example, costs $113 to $128, at $1.49
to the pound; an air pass coupon is $60 one-way.
</P>
<P>
   And you do not have to return to the point of departure before
flying on to your next destination; for example, if you had a Zone
1 coupon for London to Amsterdam, you could continue at your own
expense to Munich to use your Zone 2 coupon for Munich to Berlin.
For information: www.oneworldalliance.com or any Oneworld Alliance
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Look for announcements of similar air pass programs from the
13-airline Star Alliance (including Air Canada, SAS, United
Airlines, Austrian Airlines and British Midland) and the
four-member SkyTeam alliance (including Air France and Delta). A
Europe by Air pass (Web site www.europebyair.com) allows travel on
17 regional carriers for $99 a flight (plus tax) to about 120
cities; you must buy at least three coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair has a pass with its 10 Qualiflyer alliance partners,
such as Sabena and TAP Air Portugal (www.qualiflyer.com). Three,
four, five or six coupons cost $299, $389, $469 and $539,
respectively. Add $100 if you do not fly with a Qualiflyer partner
across the Atlantic. You need book only the first coupon before
starting the trip.
</P>
<P>
   An example of a Qualiflyer routing for $469 might be the
following: First coupon, Lisbon to Brussels to Stockholm; second
coupon, Stockholm to Zurich; third coupon, Basel to Nice; fourth
coupon, Nice to Madrid; and fifth coupon, Madrid to Lisbon. The
savings versus regular fares would be at least 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No-frills airlines are expanding at a furious pace and have
captured fans among business and leisure travelers on major routes
within Europe. They are all modeled on Southwest Airlines, whose
quick turn-arounds on short point-to-point routes, no-frills
service in which passengers pay for drinks and snacks, and
electronic ticketing all have helped drive down costs. The European
no-frills lines fly fleets of Boeing 737's and have pioneered in
online booking, often with discounts. (EasyJet says 80 percent of
its passengers book on its Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   The no-frills are all ticketless airlines: You get a reference
number and just show up. The one-class seating has the same legroom
as cattle class on regular carriers, and much the same baggage
rules.
</P>
<P>
   No-frills airlines' Web sites are typically easier to navigate
than those of major carriers. Ryanair (www.ryanair.com), which
became the first no-frills carrier in Europe in 1985, is a ruthless
cost cutter. It operates from Dublin, Stansted (30 miles northeast
of London), Luton (32 miles northwest of London) and Glasgow, has a
fleet of 31 737's and flies to 23 European cities.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Express (Web site: www.virginexpress.com), which operates
from Brussels with a fleet of 16 737's, serves nine major European
cities. EasyJet (www.easyjet.com), which started service from Luton
in October 1997 with a fleet of brand new 737-300s, will take
delivery of 32 Boeing 737-700s over the next four years. The
airline is based in Luton, Liverpool and Geneva; it flies from
Luton to 16 cities, from Liverpool to 8, and from Geneva to Nice,
Barcelona, Amsterdam and the London area (Stansted, Gatwick,
Luton).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Go (www.go-fly.com), British Airways' no-frills clone launched
in May 1998 at Stansted, has a fleet of 13 737-300s and flies to 17
cities, including Reykjavik. Buzz (www.buzzaway.com), a subsidiary
of KLM that was launched in January, also operates from Stansted,
with eight British Aerospace 146 jets and two 737's; it flies from
Stansted to 14 cities.
</P>
<P>
   The no-frills use secondary airports in some cities because they
are cheaper and have fewer slot restrictions. This may be
inconvenient for an international traveler. But for point-to-point
travel in Europe, airports like Stansted and Luton are as easy to
get to from central London and a blessed relief from megahubs such
as Heathrow and Gatwick.
</P>
<P>
   The Stansted and Luton airports, for example, are an easy
40-minute train ride from central London. EasyJet has a special bus
deal from Luton ($7.50 round trip) that delivers you to central
London. I sometimes take the 6:40 a.m. EasyJet flight from Nice to
Luton, arriving in London at 7:50 local time, and I'm where I want
to be in London an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   The no-frills lines often have better punctuality records than
those of the major airlines. EasyJet is the only carrier that gives
passengers a full refund if the flight is delayed by four hours or
more. It also pays for hotel accommodation if the delay means an
overnight at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Ryanair sometimes uses what you might call tertiary airports. It
flies, for example, in and out of Beauvais, 35 miles northwest of
Paris (allow two and a half hours by bus from Porte Maillot in
Paris); Charleroi, to the north of Brussels; and Lubeck, 40 miles
from Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   For many travelers, low fares make up for the inconvenience.
No-frills carriers typically offer a spread of round-trip fares
without the advance-purchase and Saturday-night-stay conditions of
regular excursion fares. Ryanair has set the pace this summer with
a rock-bottom $43 round-trip fare (with a two-day minimum stay)
from Stansted to Hamburg, $103 to Verona and $43 to Stockholm. But
these are lead-in prices, and you could end up paying more than
five times as much if you don't get one of these special offers.
</P>
<P>
   The no-frills carriers maintain that a high percentage of their
seats go for the lower prices. Buzz says that 30 percent of its
seats are sold at its lowest published fare while Go says that half
of its passengers traveled at the lowest advertised fare last year;
Ryanair says that 50 percent of seats are available at the lowest
advertised fare.
</P>
<P>
   EasyJet is the only no-frills carrier that has kept the promise
of low one-way fares that allow almost total flexibility for
midweek travel. I paid $146 for a round-trip ticket from Nice to
London in July, leaving on Tuesday and returning on Thursday, that
would have cost more than $745 with British Airways on a 737 with
similar seating. (EasyJet proudly announced that its 737 _ the
latest addition to the fleet _ was two days old! And there seemed a
normal mix of business and leisure travelers turning up for the
flight.)
</P>
<P>
   One shouldn't forget, however, that EasyJet's fares can rise
five- to tenfold as the plane fills up and that latecomers can pay
more for a round trip than the excursion fare on a conventional
airline. But even if you pay the highest fare out, you may get the
cheapest fare back. You can change your reservation for a $15
charge, although you may have to upgrade to a higher fare. Thus I
paid $74.50 from Nice to London with EasyJet recently, but $268.50
to come back. It would have been cheaper just to have paid the
$74.50 one-way fare out and bought a round-trip excursion ticket
back with British Airways, throwing away the return coupon. Then
the trip would have cost me $255 instead of $358.
</P>
<P>
   This illustrates the fact that while no-frills carriers are
likely to offer the best price on most occasions, never assume that
they are the best value on all occasions. Compare price and
flexibility and buy only as much flexibility as you need. Flight
consolidators like Airline Network (www.netflights.com) and
Trailfinders (www.trailfinders.com) offer bargains with
conventional carriers: London to Amsterdam with British Midland for
$130 with a Saturday night or a minimum two-night stay, or London
to Paris with Air France for $186.50.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair has Zap and Fly fares (www.zapfly.ch) from Geneva or
Zurich to cities like Amsterdam, Barcelona, Brussels, Nice and Rome
with round-trip fares of $77 to $270. Fares are published on
Wednesdays and are valid for 10 days with conditions including a
Friday night stay.

U.S. PROTESTS CUBA'S DENIAL OF EXIT PERMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department accused Cuba Monday of causing
widespread suffering by refusing to allow Cubans to leave the
island even if they hold U.S. visas. Meanwhile, the United States
has told a high Cuban government official that he cannot attend a
meeting at the United Nations of lawmakers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The department lodged a formal protest with Cuba Monday over
what it described as Cuba's arbitrary denials of exit permits. But
a State Department official said Monday evening that American
unhappiness with Cuba did not prompt the United States to bar
Ricardo Alarcon, the president of the Cuban National Assembly, from
attending the session at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's treatment of people who want to leave the country is
``beyond misguided'' and constitutes flagrant human-rights
violations, the department official, Peter Romero, said.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, an assistant secretary of state who specializes in Latin
American affairs, said Cuba's oppressive Communist regime and the
country's policies toward migration had separated families and had
impelled some people to try perilous ocean crossings to the United
States, resulting in numerous deaths.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, when not denying exit permits outright, Cuba has
charged as much as $600 for an adult permit and $200 for a child's
permit _ sums beyond the reach of most Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Romero said, Cuba has repeatedly failed to
live up to a 1994 agreement that supposedly provided for the
orderly migration of 20,000 Cubans plus their relatives to the
United States. Moreover, he said, Cuban officials have refused even
to discuss American complaints seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping this note does the trick,'' Romero said. But he
said the denial of a visa to Alarcon, a former Cuban foreign
minister and one-time representative to the United Nations, was not
done in retaliation. Romero said the meeting of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union this week was not even sponsored by the
United Nations, even though the group is meeting there.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon was among the most prominent backers of the Cuban
relatives of Elian Gonzales, the child who was found floating on an
inner tube in the ocean last November after his mother and several
other people drowned. The boy was returned to Cuba after a
prolonged struggle marked by international recriminations and
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman,
said that for privacy reasons, the department does not discuss visa
applications or denials.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Garcia, an official of the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington, said Monday that the United States' ``criminal, immoral
and discriminatory'' policy was causing suffering, both on land and
on the ocean, by tempting Cubans to try to reach the United States
in hopes of being treated better than refugees from other Latin
American countries.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Dodging falling globs of molten cable, firemen finally
put out a searing blaze Monday that turned the television tower
that is Europe's tallest structure, Russia's pride and Moscow's
communications hub into a 1,772-foot kitchen match.
</P>
<P>
   As the television screens of an estimated 20 million Russians
flickered with snow, firefighters battled for nearly 26 hours
before smothering the fire in the Ostankino tower. As they fought,
they were forced to retreat steadily as flames licked downward
through makeshift asbestos barriers and across firebreaks where
flammable wiring had been torn away.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, officials announced that the bodies of a
firefighter and an elevator operator had been found in one elevator
that had fallen nearly 1,000 feet into a basement sometime during
the fire. A third body was believed pinned in the debris of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Before the firemen declared victory about 6 p.m. Monday, the
fire had engulfed all of the pre-stressed concrete section of the
tower above the 225-foot level, as well as much of a 410-foot metal
antenna planted at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete part appeared in no danger of collapse, engineers
said, although they refused to say the same of the heat-seared
antenna, which is spiked with so many metal bristles that it
resembles a gigantic hairbrush.
</P>
<P>
   The fire apparently began about 3:20 p.m. Sunday on that
antenna, in a mass of wiring at about 1,500 feet, and burned its
way earthward for most of the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The battle against it was fatally hamstrung by the fact that the
only safe way to fight the blaze _ as firefighters belatedly
discovered _ was to carry extinguishers by hand up more than 1,000
feet of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of the fire apparently were trapped sometime Sunday
after power to an elevator failed as they were ferrying
fire-fighting supplies upward.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had probably died of suffocation or heat
even before the fire melted cables and caused the elevator to
plunge into the basement, more than 21 feet below ground.
</P>
<P>
   They were the only human casualties in the harrowing emergency.
Seven other firefighters were rescued from an elevator that plunged
several hundred feet Sunday evening, only to be stopped by
emergency brakes about 950 feet above ground.
</P>
<P>
   But to Russian leaders and the public alike, the disaster
delivered yet another blow to the nation's diminishing standing as
a technological power of the first rank.
</P>
<P>
   As with the explosion and sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk
two weeks ago, rescuers were shown to lack the equipment and the
know-how to deal with the emergency, even when it reached the level
of an ordinary high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Kursk, the Ostankino tower has long been regarded
as a triumph of Russian know-how _ which is to say Soviet know-how,
in the days when the Kremlin was bent on impressing friends and
enemies with its ability to think in gargantuan terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Ostankino tower was the world's tallest free-standing
structure when it was built in 1967 to mark the 50th anniversary of
the Soviet revolution. One writer then compared it to a giant
syringe for ideological injections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when communist plotters tried to seize Ostankino in a
failed coup against President Boris N. Yeltsin, it came to
symbolize the importance of the free exchange of information in a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, President Vladimir Putin suggested it was a metaphor for
Russia's current status as a pitiful, helpless giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This latest accident shows the shape of our vital
installations and the overall state of our country,'' he said. ``We
should not forget the large-scale problems or current economic
issues here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Romanchik, a 36-year-old banker who lives with his wife
and daughter in the tower's reedy shadow, said he took the fire to
heart. ``My wife was born here in 1965, and I moved here in '72,''
he said Monday. ``This tower can be viewed as one of the symbols of
Moscow. I'm proud to say I live here, and if it ceases to exist, it
will be a great loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to fall down,'' he continued. ``But they can't
leave it like this.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fire briefly knocked out television across the entire
country, its effects were mostly confined to Moscow, where the
overwhelming majority of viewers rely on over-the-air broadcasts
instead of more expensive cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire line of television channels, from
state-controlled RTR and ORT to the independent NTV network to
Russia's version of MTV, were knocked off the air, as was one
frequency of the popular news radio station Echo Moskvy and a host
of specialized radio and paging services.
</P>
<P>
   About all that remained was the Russian movie channel NTV Plus,
a satellite channel. It quickly converted its broadcasts to
accommodate NTV and RTR newscasts, as well as some others. But the
reception even then remained quirky.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one Monday seemed sure of the 51,400-ton tower's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The tower's designer, Nikolai Nikitin, shared a birthday with
France's Gustave Eiffel, whose tower was a bit over half as tall.
Nikitin frequently said his work would withstand the elements for
at least 300 years. But he apparently was thinking of wind and
rain, not fire.
</P>
<P>
   While the concrete rings that constitute the tower's frame
seemed structurally intact Monday, 80 of its 149 high-tension steel
cables _ strings that hold the tower upright _ had melted or warped
in the heat. The cables hold the tower upright much as some
children's toys can be jerked upright by pulling tight an elastic
cord, and they make it both taut and flexible in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers said the structure was built to withstand the damage
it endured, but government officials also said it would cost
hundreds of millions of dollars to repair it _ money this
cash-strapped nation can ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   Eduard Sagalayev, the president of Russia's National Association
of Television and Radio Broadcasters, slipped into a eulogy Monday
when talking about the fire, telling Echo Moskvy that the tower
``was a unique structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not speak in the past tense,'' an interviewer said.
``It gives you a funny feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sagalayev replied: ``Unfortunately, one has to speak in the
past tense. If it does not collapse, I doubt that it will be able
to perform its functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was criticized for a lackadaisical response to the
Kursk disaster, wasted no time Monday, ordering engineers to
restore television and other communications to Moscow within a
week. By day's end, brainstormers were proposing to mount
transmitters everywhere from beneath helium balloons to atop the
roofs of Moscow's hilltop state university.
</P>
<P>
   The fire could have been much worse. It surprised the city on a
brilliant Sunday afternoon, when throngs of sightseers had come to
the Ostankino tower for the elevator ride to its 1,105-foot-high
observation platform and a meal in the nearby Seventh Heaven
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began above them, in a section of the antenna used by a
paging service, and tourists and workers were safely evacuated
before it spread.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the fire sputtered out Monday afternoon, hundreds of
onlookers and nearly as many journalists gathered several hundred
yards from the tower _ as close as police would allow _ to take
pictures, gawk and speculate about whether the spire looked as if
it were leaning. (It was not; workers for the city's geological
agency monitored the tilt, and said it was within normal limits.)
</P>
<P>
   Most people here seemed to suffer the loss of entertainment
good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch MTV practically all the time,'' 12-year-old Ivan
Lionov said as he stood along a cordoned-off street in north Moscow
that provided a good view of the tower. ``But we'll live. Of course
it's bad. But soon we'll be in school.''
</P>
<P>
   And an elderly woman selling sunflower and pistachio seeds to
the throngs of gawkers on the street had a contrarian view some
Westerners might appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bury my TV,'' she said. ``There's nothing to watch;
just bad things and naked people.''

FOR EMPLOYEES, EXPANSION OF THE NEW ECONOMY FEATURES NEW SET OF
STRESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ Gary Taylor was ready to be a free agent. Just as
Internet job-search sites and articles in new-economy magazines
encourage people to do, Taylor had decided to quit his job. In this
high-desert city of low unemployment and fast growth, Taylor, a
glass installer, thought he could find something much better.
</P>
<P>
   Within six weeks of casting about, Taylor had an offer from a
utility company to work on one of its growing number of temporary
projects. And local technology companies had dozens of open jobs.
But there seemed to be a problem with every prospect. Either it did
not pay enough to support his wife and three children, he said, or
it lacked the health-care benefits to cover them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he stayed installing glass, though he found a higher
paying job. His wife, meanwhile, went to work part-time as a
secretary and insurance sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are jobs out there,'' Taylor said, ``but I found the
wages were not high enough for me to switch industries and support
a family. At 41 years of age, it's very difficult to step into a
new field even in a booming economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor represents the new face of the still-anxious American
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say few people fret over whether they can find jobs
in the 10th year of the nation's longest stretch of uninterrupted
economic growth. But many employees say they are concerned about
whether they can keep up with technological change and take
advantage of opportunities in the sort of new-economy companies
that are transforming places like Boise. And many either fear what
will happen to their current job, or, like Taylor, have looked but
did not find other employment good enough to persuade them to jump.
</P>
<P>
   This new-style job anxiety does not cut as deeply as the pain
felt all across what was called the Rust Belt in the 1980s, when
waves of blue-collar workers lost jobs as one American industry
after another retooled to face heightened foreign competition. And
it does not carry the pathos of the early 1990s, when many
white-collar employees faced downsizing during and after a
recession that led to another round of efficiency-driven cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the constant turnover in today's job market is exciting
for many young, well-educated workers.
</P>
<P>
   But economists say that the lingering uncertainties within the
nation's 140-million-strong work force help to explain why wage
pressures, while on the upswing, remain more modest than they were
in the milder and shorter economic booms of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evident insecurity felt by workers,'' Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said recently, echoing similar comments he
has made on several occasions, is probably a result of ``a fear of
job skill obsolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems like a strange time for the issue to raise its head.
The contradictions of the early years of the 1990s, when consumer
spending, corporate profits and share prices all rose rapidly but
the median wage was falling, have largely ended. A record
percentage of Americans now say they think that jobs are plentiful,
and the number of people with the confidence to quit voluntarily
has steadily grown since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But if concerns about the availability of work have receded,
worries over the quality of those jobs remain a signature part of
the economy for many people. And while Americans acknowledge an
abundance of jobs, a surprising number still report that they fear
being laid off in the near future. Even in boom towns like Boise _
with thriving high-technology companies and an unemployment rate of
about 3.5 percent compared with the nationwide average of 4 percent
_ corporate mergers and constant efforts to increase productivity
have left many people uneasy.

</P>
<P>
   All this stands in contrast to the previous record-long
expansion in the 1960s. Back then, said Richard Curtin, the
director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, ``the
only issue with living standards was how fast they would improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tension between prosperity and insecurity is also
playing a role in the presidential campaign, analysts said, as Vice
President Al Gore has tried both to claim credit for the economy's
strong performance and to soothe traditional Democratic Party
constituencies who may not be keeping up with pledges to improve
education and health care. George W. Bush, the Republican
candidate, faces a similar tension in pushing a broad-based tax cut
that is supposed to offer financial relief to the middle class, but
that has been attacked as too generous to the wealthy and as an
excessive drain on future budget surpluses.

   ``These times are generally very scary,'' said Marcia Craig, an
executive assistant at Boise Cascade, who had to change jobs last
year when her previous employer, Ore-Ida Foods, moved to
Pittsburgh. ``It seems that no matter what you've done, no matter
how long you've done it, there are kids coming out of school that
are going to knock your socks off,'' said Craig, who is raising two
teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a generation gap has emerged at work. Younger
employees, particularly those with a strong educational background,
often view today's job market as a giant bazaar where their skills
are handsomely rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother gets nervous every time I take a new job,''
said Jill Feeler, 30, who since 1996 has worked for a bank, a
hospital and now for Hewlett-Packard in the marketing department.
``She says, `What about your pension?' I'm like, `Pension,
shmension. It's 401(k)'s, grandma.'''
</P>
<P>
   Workers like Feeler, who has both a bachelor's degree and a
master's degree from Boise State University, say it does not bother
them that the bonds between companies and employees have loosened
over the last decade. They have a hard time imaging spending 20
years with one employer anyway. And they are grateful for all the
pay raises and job offers many have received.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Bell, a recent engineering graduate of Brigham Young
University, for instance, moved to Boise this summer with her
sister and two friends. All quickly received full-time job offers,
said Bell, an engineer at Micron Technology, including the two who
had not yet graduated from college and were coming to Idaho just
for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   For most older workers _ be they carpenters and government
employees here who have received scant raises in recent years, or
bank managers watching their companies merge _ the changes are more
unsettling. The message from companies, said Jerry Bresina, an
employee of Idaho Power for the last 27 years, is: What you did
yesterday is not good enough today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough pill to take,'' Bresina said, noting that Idaho
Power has sent him to more classes in the last five years than in
the previous 20 years altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the glazier, said, ``I don't think we're humanly
engineered for the stress level.'' With his wife planning to become
a full-time worker this fall, their children can look forward to
more ``fish-stick and macaroni-and-cheese dinners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating the uncertainty, many workers say, are a number of
trends that the low unemployment rate does not capture. People are
working harder _ per family, three more hours a week than a decade
ago, according to the Economic Policy Institute _ complicating
other areas of life. And household debt is up while health
insurance coverage is down, raising the stakes for people who do
leave their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Boise, Idaho's capital, is a particularly poignant example of
the contradictions. An old gold-mining town, Boise has evolved from
a city filled with headquarters of manufacturing and food companies
to one that boasts Micron, a semiconductor maker, as its largest
employer and a Hewlett-Packard office of 4,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The city ``has transformed itself from a prototypical
old-economy area to a new-economy area,'' said Mark Zandi, the
chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester,
Pa., which tracks regional statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Help-wanted signs are common, despite an influx of new workers.
The region's economy, covering a metropolitan area of about 450,000
people, is growing more quickly than the rest of the nation,
according to Economy.com. And compared with the rest of Idaho,
where agriculture and heavy industry dominate, the city is wealthy
and becoming more so.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also churn in Boise. The most telling example may
be Ore-Ida, a company that sells potatoes, the region's signature
product, to the world and even has Idaho as part of its corporate
name. Travelers who step off planes into the small airport here are
still greeted by an advertisement for the company: ``Welcome to
Boise,'' it states, ``A city we've been proud to call home for over
a quarter-century!''
</P>
<P>
   But today, all that is left of Ore-Ida in Idaho _ besides the ad
_ are four employees closing up shop in an office just east of
downtown.  &UR; H. &LR; J. Heinz, which owns Ore-Ida, has moved it to
Pittsburgh during the last two years to combine it with its Weight
Watchers frozen-food product line to save money. Boise lost about
300 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the only turmoil here. West One Bancorp was bought
by U.S. Bancorp in 1995, and First Security is disappearing into
Wells Fargo. Hewlett-Packard has shed many of its production jobs
but is adding white-collar workers. Albertson's, a fast-growing
supermarket company based in Boise, has been trying to integrate
its operation with the American Stores Co., which it bought last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, mergers have more than quadrupled in the
last decade to about 8,000 a year, according to Mergerstat, leaving
jobs in jeopardy in nearly every instance. And corporate
relocations have roughly doubled in the last four years, according
to Site Selection Magazine, a trade journal based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But to judge from Ore-Ida, losing a job today does not mean what
it did a few years ago. Nearly all of the company's former
employees seem to have received job offers elsewhere. A surprising
number are earning a salary close to their old one, say both the
workers and Bae Emilson, a consultant with the out-placement firm
Drake Beam Morin that Heinz is paying to help the employees with
their job search.
</P>
<P>
   While they say they miss their old colleagues, some even
consider Ore-Ida's departure to be a good development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every single person I know says this is the best thing
that has happened to them,'' Craig said. Her salary at Boise
Cascade is slightly lower than what Ore-Ida was paying her, and her
new job as an executive assistant is a notch lower. But she finds
the work more creative _ a discovery she suspects she never would
have made had she not been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Ore-Ida alumni agree that few of them will
ever feel as secure in their jobs as they once did.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That view is common in Boise, not just among those who have had
to change jobs but also with those who have only heard about
dislocation through friends or the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said she now keeps her resume updated, especially after
Boise Cascade considered eliminating her department only weeks
after she arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a different attitude,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Miren Lolley, who ran Ore-Ida's information technology
department, has decided to use her severance pay to take about a
year off after working for the company for 21 years. Then she hopes
to become a consultant so she can control her own schedule, leaving
time to eat lunch and dinner with her friends and two sons, as she
has been able to do since Ore-Ida left.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Lolley said, she wants to avoid working long
hours for a company without knowing whether her job is secure.
``Nobody,'' she said, ``trained us for that.''

BASILICATA, ROCK HARD AND STILL UNTAMED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By FREDERIKA RANDALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nightfall does not come gently to Matera. It's more like a flash
flood rising from the bottom of the ravine. One minute, I am
watching a couple of bats wing over the rooftops beneath the hotel
terrace where I sit. The next minute, they are invisible. The
houses on the hill go gray as tombstones, and all that is human and
terrestrial turns pale and wan.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the heavens, though, something like the Creation is
happening. The sky, a dome of crazy cobalt blue, is streaked with
fresh phosphorus stars. A big coppery moon is pitched on the
horizon, smoldering like the halo of a Byzantine Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   This must be something like the way the cosmos once unfolded
every night before the watching eyes of Dark Ages villagers, or
Homeric-era Greek wanderers, or the Paleolithic nomads who 15,000
years ago first burrowed in here and made their cave shelters in
the sassi, the city's distinctive limestone cliffs. Art, myth,
religion _ you can see how they grew out of nights like this. Some
giant forces were at work out there, and it wouldn't be wise not to
pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Big thoughts like these hadn't yet crossed my mind when I began
the day under brilliant April sunshine, barreling along the almost
empty roads of the Basento Valley into the heart of Basilicata, in
southeastern Italy. I was on my way back for a return look at
Matera's frescoed cave churches, and to explore some even more
remote corners of this remote and rugged region.
</P>
<P>
   The hilly part of southern Italy between the more populous
coastlines of Campania and Puglia, Basilicata is a sort of Italian
Appalachia, where nature hasn't been tamed by humans and the people
don't like being bossed around, either. An Appalachia where at one
time or another prehistoric shepherds, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines,
Lombards, Saracens, Normans, Swabians and Albanians fleeing the
Turks after the fall of Constantinople have passed through.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, Vittorio, was actually the one pushing the speed
limit, while I read out an occasional passage from our faithful
traveling companion, ``Christ Stopped at Eboli,'' by Carlo Levi.
The road to Matera from Potenza, the regional capital, coasts along
the valley, and once you get past a gargantuan snake of a modern
housing project on Potenza's outskirts, scarcely another building
appears except for a few tiny farmhouses. There are olive groves,
stands of ilex, pine and cypress, and the glint of greenhouses on
the hillsides. Along the way, there's the turnoff for Aliano, the
village where in 1935, Levi, a painter who was a member of the
anti-Fascist group Giustizia e Liberta from Turin, was sent into
confinement by Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   It was Levi, with his passionate account of his year in
Basilicata, who first awakened cosmopolitan Italy to the flinty
poverty and archaic dignity of this place. Trained as a physician,
he went out to see the sick in their miserable homes. Many, back
from America after a lifetime of hard work, now had nothing to
protect them from endemic malaria but the little photo of Franklin
D. Roosevelt that so often hung over a returned emigrant's bed. The
reason their lives were so hard, they told him, was that Christ had
never got farther than Eboli (a city toward Naples). Civilization,
in other words, had never climbed these mountains.
</P>
<P>
   About beautiful Matera, Levi wrote that it was a ``sad, gray''
city that spiraled downward like the circles of Dante's Inferno,
where ``men, women, children and beasts'' shared the same cramped
caves. That vision of hell disturbed Italians from more prosperous
regions, and after the war, there were calls to level the sassi. It
didn't happen, but in 1952, old Matera was evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1993, Unesco designated the sassi of Matera a World
Heritage Site. It was an ironic and welcome turn of events for a
town that still smarts under its onetime label, ``la vergogna
nazionale,'' Italy's shame.
</P>
<P>
   Today, people are moving back into the old town, our guide,
Giuseppe, tells us later that day as we gaze over the canyon carved
by the Gravina torrent far below, before setting off on our tour.
``Let's just hope they don't start painting everything up,'' he
says, narrowing his eyes fiercely at the freshly painted facade of
a cave house that is just a whisper the green side of cement gray.
</P>
<P>
   He points out another one below us that has the faintest aura of
yellow. ``The sassi are not in color,'' Giuseppe says. ``The sassi
are black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash gray inside and out, the dwellings in the sassi were hewn
out of the natural caves and water cisterns that run through the
chalky rock. Blocks were cut out and used to add front rooms and
facades, some quite ornate. The roofs served as the roadbed to the
level above, and there were gardens and little public squares on
various levels.
</P>
<P>
   In a book about Matera's cave dwellings, the Italian architect
Pietro Laureano shows how they were designed around a sophisticated
system to capture and store water, a precious resource here after
the uplands were deforested by farming and grazing as far back as
the Neolithic era. The caves have affinities with those of
Cappadocia and the ancient city of Petra, among others around the
Mediterranean, and they are anything but poor architecture,
Laureano says. The sassi deteriorated badly under the Fascist
regime, when paved roads wiped out all the green areas and public
spaces, and economic conditions were so grim that people had to
crowd into their storerooms and stables with their animals.
</P>
<P>
   Around the seventh century, when this part of Italy answered to
the Byzantine empire, Greek-rite hermit monks started to use the
grottoes as primitive chapels. Those Easterners were chased away by
Roman Catholic Benedictines in the 12th century, but religious art
here continued to have a strong Byzantine flavor. In the wall
paintings of the little Matera church of Santa Maria de Idris, a
stylized Virgin appears with a precious amphora of water. One of
the flanking saints is giving the Latin benediction. Another holds
his fingers in the perpendicular Orthodox way.

PRESSURE BY CLINTON, MANDELA FAIL TO PRODUCE BURUNDI PEACE DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ Persuasion by President Clinton and pressure
by former South African President Nelson Mandela failed Monday to
produce a peace deal that could have headed Burundi down the road
to end a bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups and the president of Burundi, Pierre Buyoya,
signed an agreement brokered by Mandela to share power between the
majority Hutus and the Tutsis, who seized power in the small
central African nation three years ago. But five small, influential
Tutsi militant groups refused, putting the accord's durability in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a section of the leadership who do not care for the
slaughter of innocent people inside Burundi, who are still refusing
to sign,'' a visibly angry and exhausted Mandela said. ``That type
does not want peace. That type wants to drag out these negotiations
for eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, also clearly disappointed, urged the holdouts
in less emotional tones to have the ``courage and vision'' to sign
the agreement and move toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk away from this and fight some more. No matter how
long it takes, when it comes down to it you will still be dealing
with the same issues,'' Clinton told the holdouts. ``If you let
anyone else die, all you are doing is making it harder for somebody
else to make decisions you will have to make anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said he would not support a cease-fire, a key demand of
the Tutsis, who have been battling Hutu insurgents in the nation of
5.7 million for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our trump card, this is our weapon to change things,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that if a realistic peace were signed by all
factions, the United States would urge a United Nations effort to
enforce the peace, participate in building a national army and
provide help in settling refugees and supporting the tens of
thousands of war orphans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to help your children to remember your history, but
you must not force them to relive your history,'' Clinton said.
``When all is said and done, only you can bring an end to the
bloodshed. No one can give you peace, you must choose it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 have been killed in Burundi's civil war, which is
part of a wider, regional clash between Tutsis, who have held power
since colonial days, and Hutus, who have sought to topple them. The
sometimes genocidal struggle has engulfed several countries in
central Africa, most tragically Rwanda where between 600,000 and 1
million Tutsis were massacred in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsis and Hutus have been fighting in Burundi since 1993 when
Tutsi troops assassinated President Melchoir Ndadye, a Hutu,
shortly after his election. The Tutsi-controlled military seized
power in the nation of 5.7 million in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's persuasive tone was in stark counterpoint to Mandela's
disgust at what he repeatedly described as a betrayal by men
lacking ``honor and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mandela, the effort to broker the deal, coming after 27
years spent in prison and four years as president of South Africa,
was a reluctant labor at a time he had hoped to withdraw from
public life, African experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal Mandela negotiated would have provided a framework for
the Tutsis and Hutus sharing government power and for building an
army whose ranks would have been half Hutu, half Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   But even had the accord been signed by all parties, the most
important issues would not have been addressed. including who would
lead the country during a transition to a shared government, and
what would happen to the 11,000 prisoners that the Hutus and
Mandela call political prisoners but the Tutsis say are criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said after
the partial signing ceremony, ``I think people are hopeful that
(the holdouts) will eventually sign the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger described the fluid nature of the day's events. ``When we
arrived here today we honestly couldn't have told you what would
have transpired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a ``one-two punch'' of Clinton cajoling and Mandela
threatening brought 14 of 19 signatures to the document, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the two ``sticking points'' were details of a
cease-fire sought by Tutsis but which Mandela feared was a stalling
tactic and the question of who would run the country in a
transition to a shared government.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing ceremony, Mandela lost his balance and fell
forward. Several African leaders caught him and set him back on his
feet. The 81-year-old Mandela it waved off, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival here earlier in the day, Clinton was greeted with
the wild enthusiasm he had encountered throughout his African
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Tanzanians, including several hundred
school children in worn but clean matching uniforms, waved tree
branches and American flags and cheered for the first American
president to visit this country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on a three-day trip to Africa, came to this small
resort in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro's snow capped peak at the
request of Mandela after spending two days in Nigeria, Africa's
most populous nation. But even before Clinton left Nigeria earlier
on Monday, aides sought to lower expectations for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to go to Arusha was made irrespective of whether
or not there was to be a signing. And there will be a further and
continuous effort to push the process forward in the direction of
progress and hopefully to an ultimate conclusion,'' Susan Rice, the
assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, said in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials played down expectations, they
were blunt about the stakes involved, saying that the stability of
central Africa could be affected by the Burundian war.

 UNDATED: Orthodox way.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In time, many of the chapels became houses, wine caves or
refuges for shepherds. In Santa Lucia alle Malve, for example, you
can see where metal rods were stuck into the decorated walls so
that wool could be carded. A large piece of painted surface with a
figure of St. Agatha was converted into the pillar of an old
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, up on the plain over the ravine, the air smells of
wild thyme and nepitella, a kind of wild mint. Hawks are circling
overhead _ falchi grillai, or cricket hawks, we're told. This area,
too, is honeycombed with chapels.
</P>
<P>
   In one low, deep cave, travelers have carved hundreds of crosses
into the rock. On the wall, there's a sober, beautiful red and blue
painting of the Madonna del Melograno (Virgin of the Pomegranate)
at the Annunciation. Others to look out for include San Pietro in
Principibus, Santa Maria della Colomba and the Cripta del Peccato
Originale, with its delicate 10th-century frescoes on the theme of
original sin.
</P>
<P>
   From Matera, the road turns north toward Venosa and the traces
of a different era. When the Romans first marched through these
parts around 300 B.C., they found the Lucanians, a local people who
roasted their meat on long bronze skewers, drank a lot of heavy red
wine and celebrated Dionysus. The Latin poet Horace was born here
in 65 B.C., when this was a thriving provincial Roman city.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it looks like a toy town, with diminutive two-story
buildings decorated with iron railings, a big castle and a major
archaeological site on the outskirts. On the way there, we have to
stop and wait for a large, pokey flock of sheep.
</P>
<P>
   In Venosa are the ruins of an amphitheater, a second-century
B.C. Roman domus and a thermal bath with mosaic floors from
Imperial times. Down the road, several narrow tunnels and tiny
cubicles are all that are left of late-Roman-era Jewish catacombs.
Early Christians built a church on top of a Roman temple, and on
top of that stand the grandiose ruins of a unfinished Benedictine
abbey, where the Norman conquerer Robert Guiscard is said to be
buried.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the small but thoroughly interesting collection of the
national archaeological museum in the dazzling, wind-swept Norman
castle of Melfi, not far from Venosa, gives you an idea of how much
wealth a fifth-century B.C. Lucanian nobleman could afford to take
to the grave. He had fanciful crowns shaped of leaves of beaten
gold, amber necklaces imported from the Baltic, Etruscan pottery
and red-figure Attic vases, glass pitchers and bronze serving
plates, and a set of bronze armor with a scary riot-gear-style
helmet, made to imitate the weaponry of Greek hoplite warriors.
Those luxury goods were supposed to allow the departed to carry
their reputations to the beyond. And in a way they have, because we
wouldn't know much about them without their tombs to dig up.
</P>
<P>
   Heading south from Melfi the next day, we stop at Rapolla, a
pinched, hilly little town of low white houses that looks like a
village in Greece or Albania. In a tiny square, some long-legged
girls are playing volleyball without a net. I wonder if they have
been to the museum in Melfi to see the fine imperial Roman lady on
the beautiful sarcophagus (imported from Asia Minor) that was dug
up in their town. The languid, liquid marble folds of her robe
suggest a level of comfort and ease that isn't known in these parts
today.
</P>
<P>
   Rapolla's onetime cathedral of Santa Lucia is locked, but a
passer-by calls her neighbor and gets the key. The graceful,
spiritual little church, built in 1200, has just been meticulously
restored, with glass floor panels so that you can peer down and see
the caves of the Byzantine mystics on which it was built.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, we drive back and forth for nearly an hour
looking for the turnoff to another cave chapel dedicated to Santa
Lucia. We are just about to give up when we find the road, leading
into the woods. Ferns, nettles and violets grow up to the door of
the tiny, whitewashed church. We peer in through an iron grate:
there are a couple of wooden benches and many vases of fresh
flowers. The apse is painted floor to ceiling in stylized red and
black scenes from the saint's life. The floor is mossy where the
chapel runs back into the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is Rionero in Vulture, which like Rapolla and the
nearby town of Barile (not to mention Matera) was repopulated by
Albanian Christians fleeing the Turks in the 15th and 16th
centuries. Today, the local dialect is heavily inflected with
Albanian, one more reminder of how close Basilicata is to the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Rionero, on the bottom slopes of Mount Vulture, a spent volcano,
is the region's prime wine-growing area. The excellent local wine _
made with the aglianico vines imported some 2,700 years ago by the
settlers of Magna Graecia _ has had a DOC, an official wine
denomination, since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The aglianico del Vulture red is rich and clean, good company
for the stewed wild cardoncelli mushrooms, the creamy fave e
cicoria (bean puree with greens), the home-made scorze di mandorla
and cavatelli pasta, the grilled sausages flavored with fennel, and
the many interesting sheep and cow cheeses found here. These
include the rare caciocavallo podolico, made from the exotically
flavored milk of a cow that grazes only the highest pastures,
chewing up rare grasses and wildflowers, tender mushroom caps or
rucola muralis, the tiny-leafed spicy wild rocket. (We lunched on
slivers of that wonderfully spicy, crumbly yellow cheese from
Latteria Rizzi, a cheese shop in Matera.)
</P>
<P>
   We hike partway up Mount Vulture hoping to catch a glimpse of
some of those high-grazing cows, but no luck. What we can just see
are the pretty Monticchio lakes nearby, where, Horace tells us, he
once ran away from his wet nurse as an infant and got lost in the
woods. Fortunately _ befitting a baby who was going to become a
famous poet _ magical doves came and covered him with bay and
myrtle leaves, so that the bears and vipers wouldn't harm him.
</P>
<P>
   Heading back toward Potenza and Naples, we make a last stop at
Castel Lagopesole, a big square reddish castle built in 1242 by
Frederick II of Swabia (or of Hohenstaufen), who ruled southern
Italy. It dominates the heights so absolutely that a chicken
couldn't have crossed the road in the valley below without the
Hohenstaufens knowing about it.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is hot and a cuckoo begins to hoot, loud as a foghorn.
If you think of it in premodern terms, says Vittorio, who likes to
read history, Frederick was probably the most tolerant and
enlightened signore who ever ruled these parts. What would
Basilicata be like today if his line had survived and the corrupt,
absentee Angevins, Spanish and Bourbons had never gained control?
</P>
<P>
   Much more prosperous, but possibly not so wild and beautiful, I
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' Vittorio says. ``Yes, that's probably right.''

   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   Matera is 170 miles east of Naples on the A3 Autostrada to
Potenza, then Strada Statale 407. There are flights to Naples and
Bari, which is about 40 miles from Matera. Renting a car is
advisable; train service in Basilicata is very slow.
</P>
<P>
   Although the summer heat is not unbearable, April through June
and September through December are the most pleasant months to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   For information on Basilicata, contact the APT (tourist office)
in Matera, (39-0835) 331-983, or in Potenza, (39-0971) 411-839.
Carlo Levi's 1945 book ``Christ Stopped at Eboli'' (Noonday Press,
$13) remains a wonderful guide to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect luxury hotels in Basilicata, although all of these
offer a telephone, TV and minibar.
</P>
<P>
   Grande Albergo, Corso XVIII Agosto 46, Potenza 85100, telephone
and fax (39-0971) 410-220, is Potenza's most modern hotel. The 70
rooms offer spectacular views of the valley below. A double with
bath, including breakfast, costs about $85, at the rate of 2,150

   Hostel I Sassi, Via San Giovanni Vecchio 89, Matera 75100;
(39-0835) 331-009, fax (39-0835) 333-733. ``Hostel'' suggests bunk
beds and shared bathrooms, but there are no privations at this
delightful place built right into the sassi, with superlative
views. Our cool, white room, on two levels, had a large private
terrace and a funky bathroom carved out of the rock. The bar,
breakfast room and 14 other guest rooms are also in converted caves
(four rooms have air-conditioning). Doubles with bath are $65,
breakfast included.
</P>
<P>
   Albergo Italia, Via Ridola 5, Matera 75100; (39-0835) 333-561,

   Hotel La Pergola, Via L. Lavista 27-31, Rionero in Vulture,
(39-0972) 721-179, fax (39-0972) 721-819, is well situated for
exploring Mount Vulture. This modest, comfortable hotel has 43
rooms and a large, cheery restaurant with a good local wine list.
Doubles with bath cost $55, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   Simple, rustic and based on the freshest of ingredients, the
delicious food of Basilicata is what the shepherds might have eaten
in Arcadia. Specialties include grilled meat and homemade sausages,
wild mushrooms and field greens, fresh sheep- and cow's-milk
cheeses, and distinctive wheat pastas like manate, cavatelli and
strascinati, shaped roughly like little caps or boats.
</P>
<P>
   Ristorante Due Torri, Via Due Torri 6-8, Potenza, (39-0971)
411-661, serves regional specialties in a nicely restored space in
a twin-towered Aragonese fortification in old Potenza. Dishes
include pureed fava beans with dark, winey-flavored sauteed chicory
and pepperoncino in sauce; homemade pastas; grilled pecorino, and
creamy sheep's milk ricotta with wild honey and nuts. Two-course
dinner for two, with local aglianico wine, costs about $45. Closed
Sunday.

sassi. The fine regional menu begins with extensive antipasti, like
fresh little rounds of mozzarella, prosciutto and rocket, and local
hams. Scorze d'amelle pasta, like large orecchiette, are served

<P>
   La Buca, Via San Pardo 95, Matera, (39-0835) 261-984, is a
simple place serving local specialties: baked veal shank with
onions, pasta and cicerchie, a type of bean that grows wild in the
area. Two courses for two with wine, about $40. Closed Sunday night
and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vaddone, Contrada Santa Abruzzese, Melfi 85025, (39-0972) 24323,
is a family restaurant offering good local salami, cheese and
olives, grilled sausages and lamb, and local fruit. Two-course
dinner for two with wine, about $40. Closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What to See
</P>
<P>
   Because many sites are locked, you will need a guide to visit
the sassi of Matera and the chiese rupestri, or cave churches.
Freelance guides abound, but you're probably better off with one
from an agency. Itinera, (39-0835) 263-259, and Nuovi Amici dei
Sassi, (39-0835) 331-011, are among the reliable agencies for
guides. For other suggestions, call the tourist office, (39-0835)
331-983, or ask at your hotel for an English-speaking guide. A
reasonable price for a group of one to four is around $35 for a
two-hour tour.

MODERN COMFORTS, ANCIENT SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, September 3) 
 By CATHARINE REYNOLDS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring or autumn, Sicily heads my short list of holiday
destinations. It combines sun; good, plain food; natural beauty;
and enough history, art and architecture to leave me reeling. What
it doesn't promise is a selection of great hotels. Apart from a
handful of deluxe establishments in the larger cities and in
Taormina, Sicily's innkeepers have been getting a bad press since
Goethe bemoaned their shortcomings two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, on a spring visit around the island, my husband, Ken,
and I saw old hotels being overhauled and old buildings morphing
into new hotels with admirable results. We weren't looking for
grandeur as much as comfort, charm and a sense of place, and in a
10-day stay we found three special hotels (outside the well-known
standards in Palermo and Taormina).
</P>
<P>
   Starting from Palermo, we circled the island clockwise. After
Taormina, we headed for Syracuse. This city, which to fifth-century
Greeks was New York to Athens' Washington, traces its origins
beyond history to myth, romantic myth at that. The comely nymph
Arethusa, pursued across Arcadia by the river god Alpheus, implored
Artemis, goddess of virginity, for protection. The goddess answered
her prayers, transforming Arethusa into a fountain, in which form
she fled to Sicily's eastern coast, settling on the island of
Ortygia, the heart of what became ancient Syracuse. Determined to
woo her, Alpheus channeled himself across the Ionian Sea, forever
to mix his waters with hers. Understandably then, a romantic spirit
imbues Syracuse, in spite of Athens' bloody defeat there in the
Peloponnesian War.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Hotel
</P>
<P>
   Not a half mile from Arethusa's supposed fountain stands the
58-room Grand Hotel. Its four-story bulk sits comfortably against
the backdrop of Ortygia's medieval fortifications.
</P>
<P>
   We admired the hotel's neo-Gothic stone details as we parked.
Slipping through the snazzy automatic glass doors, we were taken
aback by the interior _ a glossy revamp, about five years old, of
the pre-World War I hotel. As we signed the register, I admired the
flower arrangements. Examining them closely, I was disappointed to
discover they were artificial.
</P>
<P>
   Our second disappointment was the announcement that the elevator
was out of order. But the harbor view from our third-floor room
proved worth the climb on the polished white marble stairs: fishing
boats tied at our feet and the ghosts of Athenian triremes to
entertain my imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The airy room was eminently comfortable, with a firm bed; good
reading-in-bed lights; state-of-the-art telephone, unfortunately
without dataport (those can be found in rooms on the first floor);
and woodwork with whimsical post-Modernist eyebrows and loopholes.
The muted multicolored jacquard upholstery was soothing if
unmemorable. The bathroom was well fitted, though the shadowy
lighting left me wondering about my eyeliner. A convenient outlet
for my laptop required some jury-rigging, but the hotel's handyman
was as quick to sort out the problem as he had been to see that the
elevator was repaired.
</P>
<P>
   We had arrived at midday, just as the town was tying a
collective napkin around its neck, so we headed to the rooftop
dining room, hungry but with low expectations. The classic Italian
hotel service _ black tie, comic opera charm and all _ relaxed us
after the morning's Sicilian driving. The ethereal sea bass risotto
turned our smiles into grins of pampered satisfaction, a sensation
compounded by the sunlight tipping the waves in front of us.
</P>
<P>
   The following two days were packed with visits to Neapolis, the
Greek theater and the Latomia del Paradiso (an ancient quarry, now
overgrown), never leaving us time to use the hotel's inviting
private beach. On Ortygia we admired the cathedral, which
incorporates columns from the Temple of Athena, and the handsomely
installed Museum of Medieval and Modern Art, with Antonello da
Messina's beautiful, if highly restored ``Annunciation.''
</P>
<P>
   We were especially glad to be staying on tiny Ortygia itself
(where there are only two other hotels), able to roam the island's
byways into the evening, ogling the Baroque details of small
palazzi that are increasingly being restored as ravishing secondary
residences, and waltzing across the near-perfect, stagy Piazza del
Duomo by moonlight. Each time we left our room, the blinds closed
automatically, which we found slightly unnerving. But each time we
returned, we opened them with a press of a button, compounding the
theatrical impression Syracuse left on us.
</P>
<P>
   Eremo della Giubiliana
</P>
<P>
   This hotel was altogether different, situated deep in rolling
countryside south of Ragusa about an hour from Syracuse.
Approaching it along the Marina di Ragusa road and passing
well-tended farms outlined by dry-stone walls, my husband reminded
me that Sicily had been the breadbasket of the Roman Empire. Within
the electric gates of the property a bell tower rose over the
landscape-hugging whitewashed buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A charming young man welcomed us, and in impeccable English
sketched some of the estate's history as he deftly unloaded our
bags and carried them through the arched door into a beamed hall.
He explained that the buildings had started life in the 15th
century as a hermitage that in time was fortified to guard against
Barbary pirates raiding the nearby coast. The property was acquired
by the Nifosi family in the 18th century. Oriental rugs, sofas and
exuberant arrangements of field flowers warmed the austere
limestone walls and intaglio stone floors.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the nine rooms and two suites, each with a high iron
bedstead, are small, as befits their former role as cells for the
community's friars, but the spacious tiled bathrooms, bright with
halogen pin spots, are positively sybaritic. In keeping with the
building, the handsome furnishings are spare, with only a few small
rugs on the stone tile floors and antique cupboards providing
hanging space _ a welcome contrast to the overupholstered clutter
of many hotel rooms. Simple wooden lamps provided good bedside
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with instructions from the desk, we took off on a long
ramble around the countryside, accompanied by Pedro, the Eremo's
Maremmano sheepdog, who introduced us to the livestock. We paused
to take in the sweep of Mediterranean coast only a few miles from
the Nifosi family villa and wished it were warmer so we could use
the hotel's small, sandy beach. On our way back, we came upon a
lush vegetable patch, tended by a voluble gardener. In a Sicilian
buzz that bore no relation to my schoolgirl Italian, he described
how he sowed his organic rucola (arugula). We parted with more
smiles and nods than comprehension, but a conviction that dinner in
the vaulted basement dining room would be good.

 &HT;    Bush to offer seniors discounted drug prescriptions
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the rising cost of prescription drugs
becoming a key issue this year, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said he
will offer a comprehensive plan to reduce the cost of drugs for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan could be released in a few days, but Bush,
during a meeting at the governor's mansion with six reporters from
key battleground states, said his idea will include pooling seniors
into a consumer group that will get drug discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, speaking in the
parlor of the two-story mansion built in 1856, said his plan also
would include an option for seniors to make some sort of small
payments to get discounted drugs. Those too poor to make the
payments would be eligible to have them made by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Patented drugs also should be moved more quickly into the
generic market, Bush said. ``I think that is going to require
working with the industry,'' he said. ``I'm not for price controls.
I'm for continuing to encourage research and development. But the
idea of moving generics into the market is a good idea to keep
prices down.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare also needs to be changed, told reporters from Florida,
Pennsylvania, Missouri, Oregon, Georgia and Michigan, because the
program is hampered by more than 130,000 pages of regulations and a
failure to keep up with new medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare has done a good job for seniors for a long time. But
the problem is that medicine has changed while Medicare as a
program itself has not changed,'' he said. ``I believe we ought to
say if you're happy with the current system, fine ... but give
seniors a variety of options from which to choose to tailor their
own program to meet their own needs ... including a prescription
drug benefit in all the programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats released a television commercial Monday
that criticizes Bush's lack of details about his proposal to make
prescription drugs more affordable for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats claim millions of seniors would go without
prescription drug coverage under Bush, and those who do receive a
benefit would be forced to go through HMOs and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush approach is favored by big drug companies and leaves
millions with no help,'' according to the TV ad, set to start
airing across the country today.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Vice
President Al Gore, is trying to start a ``class war in America,''
Bush said he will ``not practice the politics that divide us.'' He
accused Gore of promising too much and leaving himself little room
to successfully govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is important that you learn as governor
is how to accumulate and spend your political capital,'' Bush said.
``My point of view is that you can't try to be all things to all
people and then be effective when it comes time to spend political
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to set priorities, and my priorities are going
to be Social Security and Medicare, education, tax relief and
strengthening the military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scoffing at Gore's suggestion that Bush does not believe the
military is the best in the world, Bush said that is not the issue.
``Will we still be the best 10 years from now?'' he said. Bush
argues that military morale is low and that it does not have the
resources it needs for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Tallahassee, not far from the mansion of Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who has the better mansion, the Texas governor said he
hasn't spent much time in his younger brother's place, but ``ours
is more historic.'' Told that his brother has a pool, on a day when
the temperature in Austin was approaching 100, Bush said, ``really?
He has a pool? Then he got the better deal.''

 UNDATED: be good.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And it was: rustic bread to be dipped in olive oil pressed from
the fruit of the estate trees, ravioli filled with spicy eggplant,
grilled swordfish and beef, and irresistible blackberries. The
estate's own wine, a sturdy Il Frate Nero red, suited the fare, and
we climbed the stairs to fall asleep to the strains of ``Al di La''
rising from the wedding reception taking place in the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, with advice from the art historian who also
manages the front desk, we scouted the enchanted towns of the
``Sicilian Highlands'': Noto, Ragusa and Modica. All were largely
constructed after the devastating earthquake of 1693 and reflect
the best of Baroque town planning. We wished we had allowed more
time for this less visited corner of Sicily and vowed to return.
Another time we will take advantage of the hotel's other offerings:
small-plane tours of the island and North Africa organized by the
Nifosi family, as well as antiquing and horseback expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Foresteria Baglio della Luna
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we headed west to the ruins of Agrigento, the city
described by Henry Adams as ``Athens with improvements.'' What was
one of Magna Graecia's richest cities boasts a spectacular setting
along two ridges rising parallel to Sicily's south coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Baglio della Luna hotel, off the Porto Empedocle road, sits
at the west side of the Valley of the Temples, which, in an
unexplained historical misnomer, is not a valley but a ridge
overlooking the sea. Among the glorious fifth-century B.C. temples
are the nearly intact temple of Concord and the largest of all, the
sanctuary dedicated to Olympian Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   My goggle-eyed rapture with the temples created some traffic
risk, so my husband was relieved to reach the classical columns
that frame the gate of the Baglio della Luna safely. It opens into
a handsome courtyard centered on an ancient stone wellhead. Parts
of the Baglio date to the 13th century. Fortified in the 16th
century, it served as a manor house from the 18th century until
Ignazio Altieri converted it into a 24-room hotel five years ago.
Though the Baglio can't lay claim to a location as privileged as
the well-known Villa Athena Hotel alongside the Temple of Concord,
its decor is altogether fresher and, as we quickly realized, its
staff eager to please.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional antiques, cheerful Italian chintzes and rug-scattered
wooden floors define both public rooms and bedrooms. Altieri has
lovingly collected paintings and prints depicting Agrigento's
temples since the 18th- century Grand Tour put it on the map as
Sicily's most visited archaeological site. The bathroom adjoining
our small but cheery bedroom gleamed with white tile (and feebler
water pressure than my shower-maven husband prefers).
</P>
<P>
   After a hot day's temple crawling, I found a chaise longue in a
shaded area of the central courtyard ideal for sipping lemonade,
thumbing my Thucydides and dozing.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of the Baglio lies in being able to fling open the
shutters at sunrise to the panorama of the limestone temples
stretched across their ridge, softened by olive, almond and fruit
trees. In the background, modern white buildings rise with the
geometry of a Cubist painting, the contemporary town clinging to
Agrigento's ancient Acropolis. I revisited the image on a morning
wander under the pergolas and palms of the hotel's hillside garden.
</P>
<P>
   The dining room has the same view, rendered all the more
dramatic when the temples are lighted at night, like a golden
necklace strung across the landscape. The menu sounded worryingly
ambitious but proved very successful, with lightened versions of
Sicilian classics like eggplant caponata, wonderful fish and veal
and the ice-cream-based desserts for which the island is known.
</P>
<P>
   As with all three hotels, my only major quibble was breakfast.
Italians do not share Anglo-Saxon notions of how to start the day.
To please us, hotels up and down the boot of Italy lay out an
abundant breakfast buffet. But a sashay along the laden tables
reveals packaged crackers, cereals and jams. Even places that pride
themselves on homemade breads with lunch and dinner serve cardboard
croissants at breakfast. And hardest to swallow: juice fresh from
cartons, metallic-tasting when served in sight of orange groves in
this country of delicious blood oranges. Fortunately, more and more
hotels like the Baglio and the Grand propose some local
alternatives at their buffets: prosciutto and salamis along with
ripe fresh fruits. And Seattle can only hang its head once you've
started the day with Sicilian coffee.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest we were delighted to have found hotels that were
not only comfortable but, by reflecting the best of their
localities, also had significantly enhanced our understanding of
what the writer Mary Taylor Simeti so fittingly calls Persephone's
Island.

MICROSOFT LINKS WITH BIG BOOKSELLERS TO CAPTURE E-BOOK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stepping up the competition to set the standard for software to
read books and other documents on computer screens, Microsoft and
Adobe Systems both announced rival alliances intended to strengthen
their respective positions in the burgeoning market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft announced a plan for Amazon.com to open an electronic
book store on its Web site that would distribute free copies of
Microsoft's Reader software. Amazon.com will make Microsoft's
format the site's ``preferred'' format for electronic books, said
Lyn Blake, general manager of bookselling at Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said the site would begin selling electronic books for a
variety of formats, including Adobe's, but Microsoft's format would
appear first when customers searched for a title in electronic
form. She said that Microsoft's software would probably also be
promoted elsewhere on the site as well. She said Amazon would begin
selling electronic books ``soon,'' but declined to specify.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Brass, vice president for technology development for
Microsoft, called the alliance with Amazon.com ``a great vote of
confidence in what is becoming a very competitive market.''
Amazon.com is the largest online bookstore with 23 million
customers, and its support will bolster adoption of Microsoft's
format over rivals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft makes no money from its Reader software but receives
an undisclosed ``single digit'' commission on the sale of
electronic books for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Microsoft started a similar cooperative
marketing venture with Barnesandnoble.com, the second-largest
online bookseller _ with about six million customers _ to coincide
with the release of the newest version of its Reader software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had initially approached Amazon.com about
participating in the well-publicized release of its software, its
first version for use on personal computers as well as hand-held
devices. But Amazon.com decided to wait until the market
progressed, Blake said. Brass said more than 500,000 copies of its
new software had been downloaded in the three weeks since it became
available.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Adobe Systems, whose software for electronic
publishing and reading on-screen is currently the most widely used,
agreed to buy Glassbook, a smaller maker of software for reading on
screen. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Glassbook also provides digital book distribution services to
publishers and others. Glassbook software is easier to read and to
use than Adobe's, and the two companies said they planned to
combine Glassbook technology in upgrades of Adobe's software. A
spokeswoman for Adobe said that customers had downloaded over 180
million copies of its free software for reading.
</P>
<P>
   The deal leaves three main rivals in the race to become the
dominant format the standards for electronic publishing: Microsoft,
Adobe and Gemstar. Gemstar's format is used on portable appliances,
like the Rocket e-Book, instead of a laptop or desktop computer.

CRUISE SHIPS PRESSURED TO BE KINDER TO THE SEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, September 3) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed cases of illegal
discharges of oil, chemicals, garbage or plastic in U.S. waters
from 1993 through 1988, the General Accounting Office said in a
report to Congress in February. What's more, some cases involved
illegal discharges numbering in the hundreds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That report, together with several high-profile cases in which
cruise lines were fined for polluting waters in Alaska, the
Caribbean and elsewhere, did little to inspire public confidence in
industry statements that cruise lines were doing their best to
protect the environment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet federal and state officials say that many ships have
improved waste management and other environmental procedures. The
GAO report concluded that 72 percent of those illegal cruise-ship
discharge cases in U.S. waters were accidental, and noted that
their number declined from 24 in 1994 to 9 in 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is persuaded by the GAO figures or by the cruise
industry's vows that it is committed to protecting the environment.
Many environmentalists say that the reason there appear to be so
few violations is that there is little enforcement and even less
monitoring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The cruise ship industry has to bring down violations to zero
before anybody should give them credit,'' said Dr. Russell Long,
executive director of the Bluewater Network, a San Francisco
organization concerned with protecting waters and ecosystems.
``Otherwise it's like a lawbreaker telling a judge that even though
he's committed a lot of serious crimes, he deserves praise because
he's working to do better.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But other environmentalists hail the recent turnabout by the
cruise industry. ``A lot has changed in the culture of cruise
lines,'' said Michael Conway, who coordinates cruise-ship
compliance for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
``They're working hard to comply and they've been very
responsive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One area that almost everybody agrees needs improvement was at
least partly addressed in July when the Senate passed a bill
containing an amendment pushed by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,
banning the release of untreated black water (sewage) or hazardous
chemicals anywhere in Alaska's Inside Passage and tightening rules
for the release of treated black water and gray water (water from
sinks, showers and basins). The bill must still be approved by the
House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even without the amendment, cruise lines operating in Alaska
agreed last winter not to discharge garbage, refuse and untreated
sewage in the Inside Passage, and not to discharge waste into
``doughnut holes,'' areas beyond the three-mile limit but within
the inside waters of Southeast Alaska. (The Murkowski amendment,
too, would prohibit ships from dumping waste water into doughnut
holes.) They have also agreed to have the Coast Guard monitor their
overboard discharges and send samples to an independent laboratory
to be tested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In March the 15 members of the Florida-Caribbean Cruise
Association, which includes the leading ship lines, signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection promising, among other things, to embrace
new technology in managing waste and designing environmentally
friendly ships. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While some critics view voluntary compliance as a stratagem for
fending off stricter regulation, Conway of the Alaskan
environmental office said that such agreements can avoid political
wrangling that might otherwise mean taking several years to get
rules enacted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, cruise lines do seem to be embracing
environmental protections that go beyond the merely cosmetic,
ranging from having environmentalists aboard to ``zero discharge''
policies even where certain discharges are allowed. Some ships have
installed computerized systems and recorders to track hazardous and
chemical wastes and monitor smoke and water emissions. Most have
eliminated or cut down on plastic cups, straws, even individually
packed condiments. Crystal Cruises, which has extensive policies
for safeguarding the environment, uses recycled paper for printed
items and is experimenting with soy-based inks. Princess Cruises
said its policy to reduce the use of plastic has resulted in a
reduction of seven million pieces of plastic waste a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, the world's biggest cruise line, has agreed to install
a monitoring device in its Carnival Triumph this month to collect
ocean data in the Caribbean and transmit them to the University of
Miami, whose scientists developed the device. Carnival is also
working with a Finnish company to develop a low-pollution diesel
engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean's Radiance of the Seas, scheduled to sail in
Alaska, the Caribbean and Hawaii beginning next spring, will be
powered by gas and steam turbines that the line says will reduce
exhaust emissions by 80 to 90 percent. Holland America said that
all five ships on order for delivery through 2005 will be outfitted
with cleaner-burning propulsion technology estimated to reduce fuel
consumption, and thereby emissions, by as much as 40 tons a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever the cruise industry's progress in safeguarding the
environment, Conway said it is necessary to keep up the scrutiny to
prevent backsliding and to be sure that laws adequately protect the
environment and human health.

DESPERATE IN 1995, A SMALL CITY'S FORTUNES REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Just five years ago, this small city on the Hudson
River was literally broke.
</P>
<P>
   It had racked up millions of dollars of debts, but had scarcely
enough money in the bank to cover a week's bills. It could put only
two police cars out on the streets to patrol a city of 51,000
people. And city officials were scrambling to sell anything they
could lay their hands on, up to and including City Hall, which at
one point bore a sign reading ``For Sale by Owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed for the better in Troy _ and how.
</P>
<P>
   The city's budget was balanced last year, for the fourth year in
a row. There is finally enough money for improvements, like new
police stations and fire trucks. The city's extraordinary downtown
_ it looks like New York City might have in the 1870s _ has been
repaved and replanted. New businesses, once scared off by the
threat of municipal bankruptcy, have started moving in.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important to the people of Troy, their city is
no longer a national laughingstock, as it was in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people look over here and say, `That place is doing all
right,''' said William Fagan, an insurance agent and head of the
area's industrial development authority.
</P>
<P>
   How that turnaround came is a tale of local grit, of citizens
who would not give up on their city and a new mayor who was brave
enough to raise taxes and make hard choices.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy also got a huge amount of help from the state, which in
the last four years has pumped about $20 million of direct aid into
the city and spent millions more on economic development projects.
</P>
<P>
   So Troy has been relying on the kindness of friends, like its
state senator, Joseph Bruno, who is the state Senate majority
leader. And in an odd way, it is relying on the kindness of
strangers: the taxpayers down in the booming southern tip of New
York who have helped fill the state's coffers so that there is
money available for Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Troy is not alone. Almost every small city in the state, from
Newburgh to Niagara Falls, has faced some of the same pressures
Troy has: loss of manufacturing jobs, loss of population and loss
of property values, which means loss of tax revenues. A handful,
including Utica, mismanaged themselves into a similar municipal
mess.
</P>
<P>
   And though their rebounds may not be as sharp as Troy's, many
cities have clearly been helped by an improving economy upstate and
assistance from the state.
</P>
<P>
   But they remain dependent, fiscally and economically, on the
financial success of once-scorned New York City, said Helen
Cregger, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service, which
evaluates credit ratings on municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without those training wheels, they're not ready to do it
alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox that has New York City and its environs, long
reviled upstate, helping to subsidize the urban north, is not lost
on H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one state _ everyone's in this together,'' he said,
adding that the Legislature could improve matters by making state
aid for cities more predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each city in New York has its own story. Situated on
the east bank of the Hudson River, north of Albany, Troy was a
center of transportation, especially after the Erie Canal opened in
1825.
</P>
<P>
   And it was an industrial center before and after the Civil War:
The Chamber of Commerce boasts that practically every horseshoe for
the Union Army was made in Troy. Later, in the 1920s, it became
known as Collar City, as more than 10,000 people sewed detachable
collars and cuffs for men's shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, city fathers say, Troy was the 11th largest city
in the country, and the fourth richest.
</P>
<P>
   Even after motorcars and washing machines doomed the horseshoe
and collar businesses, Troy usually held its own. It has two
colleges _ Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Russell Sage
College for Women _ that boomed after World War II, and it is close
to the state government jobs in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   And well into the 1970s, Troy residents say, Troy remained a
shopping mecca. Young couples might buy their wedding rings at a
jeweler near Monument Square, then go up River Street to Nellick's
to buy their furniture, just as their parents and grandparents did.
But eventually, malls mushroomed and the suburbs beckoned, and the
quaint downtown became increasingly empty and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   As far as city government, the trouble began in 1991, when the
state economy was in a recession and New York state cut aid to
cities. Aid to Troy fell by almost one-third. City revenues
dropped, while its expenses jumped, according to a scathing 1995
report by the independent Center for Governmental Research in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   But while some cities coped with similar problems, Troy _ where
bare-knuckle politics are a blood sport _ did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can share in the blame,'' said Sen. Bruno, a
Republican. ``We were fighting more for turf than for the best
interests'' of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the government's financial health worsened, the
Democratic city council, which governed through a city manager, was
reluctant to raise taxes or cut expenses. Instead, it turned to
accounting gimmicks, like a complex bond issue that basically
mortgaged City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 bond issue, which was later condemned by McCall as
improper and bad for taxpayers, raised money to cover the deficit
and finance some grandiose building projects, like a recreation
center the city has never been able to afford to operate. It also
saddled Troy with enormous interest payments that ate up more than
20 percent of its budget.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Troy was more than $50 million in debt; it couldn't
borrow any more. A new city council, led this time by Republicans,
fired 50 city employees, but it wasn't enough. Thus, the ``for
sale'' sign on City Hall, a structure much larger than the city
needed, and talk of selling the city's water system or filing for
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The mood around town was dismal, said William Patrick Madden,
who runs a nonprofit housing program in the city and whose family
has been there for generations. The city's financial crisis ``just
broke people's spirits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that economic times were hard in other ways; in
the mid-1990s, he added, his staff spent half its time counseling
people who were about to default on their financial obligations.
(Today, that takes up just 3 percent of their time.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mark Pattison was elected mayor of Troy, the first in
30 years. A rumpled and outspoken Democrat whose family settled in
Troy back in canal days and whose father served briefly in
Congress, Pattison had run group homes for the mentally handicapped
before he became a mayoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the only politician who found that things were
exactly as bad as he said they were,'' Pattison now says. Every day
seemed to bring some new financial calamity, like the discovery
that although the city had more than 100 police officers, there
were only enough working police cars to put two on the street at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Pattison immediately raised property taxes in the city by 21
percent, and raised water charges by 38 percent. And 200 protesters
picketed City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Pattison also negotiated with bondholders to cut the amount of
debt the city owed, and embraced a state-imposed supervisory board
that had veto power over the city's financial decisions. In return,
a municipal assistance corporation, like the one that bailed out
New York City in the 1970s, helped Troy raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city regained control of its finances.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pattison tried to keep up the spirits of town
residents. He decided to hang on to the bunker-like City Hall,
which was built in the early 1970s to replace an ornate structure
that burned in 1938. ``It would have been a death knell,'' he says.
``Selling your city hall, in a community with a lot of pride, does
not motivate people.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and his city learned to make do. (His office still
features its original ``space age'' white plastic and brown leather
furniture, and the brown and blue carpeting has seen better days.)
When the city could not afford new police cars, it bought 10 used
ones. When it could not replace things, it repainted them.
</P>
<P>
   And in a break with precedent, Pattison and Bruno managed to put
politics aside and work together to bring new development into
Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' Bruno said, ``I had a lot of naysayers
approaching me and saying, ``Let 'em sink.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bruno helped Troy get about $4 million a year in state
aid for distressed cities. He had money appropriated to turn some
abandoned storefronts on the main square into a new arts center. He
provided $2 million to renovate the Rice Building, a fabulous
edifice designed by Calvert Vaux, to hold small high-technology
companies affiliated with Rensselaer Polytechnic. And he managed to
have more than 1,000 state workers stationed in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   All those office workers have been a lure for shopkeepers like
Gary Kiddney and Steven Fox, who last year moved their gift shop,
Mary Elizabeth, into downtown Troy from a nearby mall. ``We saw it
as a golden opportunity, even when everyone else saw it as a pit,''
Kiddney said.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop's success has, in turn, inspired other store
owners, like John Waters, who just this week opened a new jewelry
store near the arts center. (Troy is sufficiently small that the
mayor performed the ribbon-cutting.) ``Five years ago, I wouldn't
have come here,'' Waters said, adding that he initially thought
about opening in a strip mall. ``But now there's a lot of foot
traffic here.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, however, are vacant storefronts, a reminder
of how far Troy still has to go before anyone can call it vibrant.
Nearby, a big block of buildings, supposed to house fledgling
businesses, has reverted to city ownership and is up for sale.
Carmella Mantello, who ran against Pattison in November and got 45
percent of the vote, said her supporters were worried about crime
and falling property values and rallied to her call for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Troy's partisans argue, however, that their city's genuineness
and uniqueness are what will save it _ and are already attracting
people. Sure, there may not be a Starbucks, but there's Barb's
Coffee-Tyme, Open 24 Hours, and Famous Lunch, where $2.98 buys you
four small chili dogs, a can of soda, and conversation with a
waitress who knows everybody's name (and dental problems).
</P>
<P>
   Pattison remains both optimistic and cautious. ``We've had micro
successes _ tremendous victories _ but we still have macro
problems,'' he said. As a society, he added, ``We have to decide
whether we want small cities _ because they really depend on state
and federal support.''

 &HT;    Drkoop.com gets new infusion of capital
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN - The venture capitalists who stepped in to save Austin's
drkoop.com Inc. have upped their investment to $27.5 million, which
they estimate gives the battered Internet health company another 18
months of life.
</P>
<P>
   The added capital completes the latest round of financing for
drkoop.com, which a week ago reported that it had run through its
cash and was relying on credit for operating capital. The
investors, who initially pledged $20 million, replaced the
company's management, are taking control of its board of directors
and received preferred shares in drkoop.com that are convertible to
common stock at 35 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The new management team says it is now ready to begin the
difficult work of resuscitating one of the Internet's best-known
dot-com flops.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few days on the job, executives have set a couple of
major goals: get control of the company's books, which have been
bleeding red ink; and expand the company's relationship with Shared
Medical Systems, which plans to distribute drkoop.com content to
computer systems in hospitals and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the new executives do not plan to
abandon drkoop.com's audience of about 700,000 consumers, despite
the stock market's recent backlash against consumer-oriented
Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that was God's greatest gift six to nine months ago
is not man's greatest evil today,'' said Edward Cespedes, the
venture capitalist who has taken over as president of drkoop.com.
``This is a very lucrative audience that we serve. And quite
frankly, the content on drkoop is better than other content.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts have warned that drkoop.com needs a new focus _ and
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a magazine; they were a publication delivering on
the Web,'' said Eric Brown, who follows online health companie--
for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``To just have another
go at it is not going to cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, investors gave drkoop.com stock a slight boost to $1.13
a share, up 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The group of firms investing in the company now includes Eco
Associates, the Austin venture fund that is pledging money to
distressed dot-coms. Two weeks ago, Eco took control of local
Internet retail site mall.com Inc. and promptly laid off half of
the staff. Scott Hyten, founding partner of Eco, will take a seat
on drkoop.com's revamped eight-person board of directors, which
will include six new members.
</P>
<P>
   The new management is still evaluating the company's expenses,
which might mean cutting back on the company's 130-person
workforce, Cespedes said. It expects to reduce costs to between $1
million and $1.3 million a month this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went through $100 million in nine months. That's
obviously what went wrong,'' Cespedes said. ``If we weren't going
to deliver on improved financial performance we wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, drkoop.com has laid off employees, cut back on
marketing and renegotiated costly agreements with Internet portals
America Online and Go.com, reducing its cash burn rate from $18.6
million in the first quarter to an estimated $6.5 million in cash
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's too late at all,'' Hyten said. ``Drkoop
traditionally has bled cash profusely. They've now suddenly focused
on the fact that they can, in fact, break even and generate cash
short-term. That was something they didn't even try to do months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyten said he is particularly hopeful about the company's plans
with Shared Medical, its biggest potential business-to-business
revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Drkoop.com) spent most of its efforts on creating the
consumer experience and not that much on the business-to-business,
so it's a huge move for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cespedes, new chief executive Richard Rosenblatt and new chief
financial officer Stephen Plutsky joined drkoop.com from Prime
Ventures, a firm they ran in Santa Monica, Calif. Prime has now put
up $6 million for drkoop.com and all three men have signed
three-year employment agreements, Cespedes said.

 &HT;    Drkoop.com gets new infusion of capital
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN - The venture capitalists who stepped in to save Austin's
drkoop.com Inc. have upped their investment to $27.5 million, which
they estimate gives the battered Internet health company another 18
months of life.
</P>
<P>
   The added capital completes the latest round of financing for
drkoop.com, which a week ago reported that it had run through its
cash and was relying on credit for operating capital. The
investors, who initially pledged $20 million, replaced the
company's management, are taking control of its board of directors
and received preferred shares in drkoop.com that are convertible to
common stock at 35 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The new management team says it is now ready to begin the
difficult work of resuscitating one of the Internet's best-known
dot-com flops.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few days on the job, executives have set a couple of
major goals: get control of the company's books, which have been
bleeding red ink; and expand the company's relationship with Shared
Medical Systems, which plans to distribute drkoop.com content to
computer systems in hospitals and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the new executives do not plan to
abandon drkoop.com's audience of about 700,000 consumers, despite
the stock market's recent backlash against consumer-oriented
Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that was God's greatest gift six to nine months ago
is not man's greatest evil today,'' said Edward Cespedes, the
venture capitalist who has taken over as president of drkoop.com.
``This is a very lucrative audience that we serve. And quite
frankly, the content on drkoop is better than other content.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts have warned that drkoop.com needs a new focus _ and
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a magazine; they were a publication delivering on
the Web,'' said Eric Brown, who follows online health companie--
for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``To just have another
go at it is not going to cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, investors gave drkoop.com stock a slight boost to $1.13
a share, up 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The group of firms investing in the company now includes Eco
Associates, the Austin venture fund that is pledging money to
distressed dot-coms. Two weeks ago, Eco took control of local
Internet retail site mall.com Inc. and promptly laid off half of
the staff. Scott Hyten, founding partner of Eco, will take a seat
on drkoop.com's revamped eight-person board of directors, which
will include six new members.
</P>
<P>
   The new management is still evaluating the company's expenses,
which might mean cutting back on the company's 130-person
workforce, Cespedes said. It expects to reduce costs to between $1
million and $1.3 million a month this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went through $100 million in nine months. That's
obviously what went wrong,'' Cespedes said. ``If we weren't going
to deliver on improved financial performance we wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, drkoop.com has laid off employees, cut back on
marketing and renegotiated costly agreements with Internet portals
America Online and Go.com, reducing its cash burn rate from $18.6
million in the first quarter to an estimated $6.5 million in cash
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's too late at all,'' Hyten said. ``Drkoop
traditionally has bled cash profusely. They've now suddenly focused
on the fact that they can, in fact, break even and generate cash
short-term. That was something they didn't even try to do months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyten said he is particularly hopeful about the company's plans
with Shared Medical, its biggest potential business-to-business
revenue stream.
</P>

MITSUBISHI SHARES DROP AFTER POLICE RAID HEADQUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Shares of the Mitsubishi Motors Corp. tumbled on Monday,
as speculation mounted that the company's president would resign
after the Tokyo police raided its corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors denied that the president,
Katsuhiko Kawasoe, would resign to take responsibility for a
scandal that erupted last week when the company admitted that it
had covered up customer complaints and auto defects for more than
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shares of Mitsubishi fell more than 12 percent in trading
here _ its sharpest decline since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, investigators from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police
searched the company's headquarters and factories, as well as homes
of executives. They retrieved piles of conference minutes, floppy
disks and other materials. It was the first such search since Japan
introduced its current law on automotive recalls in 1969. The
police had been expected to act on a complaint from the Ministry of
Transportation, which was due early next month, but they did not
wait.
</P>
<P>
   For 23 years, Mitsubishi Motors had hid the bulk of its
documents on customer complaints from the sight of the regulators
who routinely visited the company for on-site inspections. In 1992,
the auto maker incorporated the cover-up process into its computer
system, maintaining a dual set of records on customer complaints:
those to be reported to the authorities and those to be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Monday, the company president, Kawasoe,
expressed his ``deepest apologies'' for the trouble his company
caused customers and other parties involved. ``I shall personally
assume full responsibility for doing everything necessary to regain
the trust and confidence of customers and all who have dealings
with the company,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The leading financial daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported
Monday that the chief executives of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Mitsubishi Corp. had met with Kawasoe,
and that he had expressed his willingness to resign to take
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was held so that Mitsubishi Motors could report
about the affair'' to Mitsubishi companies, said Wataru Ichikawa,
public relations manger at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. He declined
to discuss the content of the talk.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Mitsubishi group companies were concerned
that the scandal might taint the Mitsubishi name and began to sense
a need for a measure such as the resignation of the company's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from serving as major stock holders, the leading
Mitsubishi companies carry a strong voice in the decision making of
other companies in the group.

 &HT;    Powertel to fill a gap in VoiceStream coverage
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - In agreeing to be purchased for $7.1 billion, Powertel
of West Point, Ga., will fill a critical gap for VoiceStream
Wireless and its soon-to-be corporate parent, Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced late Sunday _ worth $5.9 billion in
stock and $1.2 million in debt _ is meant to be completed as soon
as the German telecom giant consummates its $50 billion acquisition
of VoiceStream. Should that purchase be blocked by regulators,
VoiceStream is committed to buying Powertel with its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, intended to close next year, will replace
Powertel with the VoiceStream brand and give VoiceStream licenses
serving nearly 90 percent of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will compete effectively with the national
players,'' said Allen E. Smith, Powertel president and chief
executive officer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of public disclaimers by both VoiceStream and
Powertel, the companies came to see a marriage of some kind as
virtually inevitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone thought it was very logical that we try to do
a deal,'' Smith said. ``We were making our numbers. However, there
are a lot of investment dollars that are seeking a national and,
therefore, a global player. Telecom is going global.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Powertel launched service in 1996, phone use has become
increasingly common and users _ especially mobile professionals and
executives _ have come to demand that their service follow them
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The twist is _ this one deal will kick over two dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was clearly inevitable,'' said Richard Prentiss, analyst
at Raymond James. ``We saw wireless moving from local to regional
to national to international, and it really is playing out nicely
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Powertel and VoiceStream will have licenses to offer
service to nearly 90 percent of the United States. Powertel's
12-state coverage includes some of the fastest-growing markets in
the country and has virtually no overlap with VoiceStream. But the
two companies do share the same technology, known as GSM, which is
also used by European carriers like Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   While Powertel has fewer customers, it is ahead of VoiceStream
in making its business profitable and in its penetration of its
markets.
</P>
<P>
   That equation has made Powertel a takeover target for months.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the stock closed at $81.06, down $5.56, after spiking
to close at $86.62 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts chalked up the difference between the stock price and
the potential payoff from Deutsche Telekom to doubt _ about how
long it will take to pass regulatory review, about whether the deal
will be stymied altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Smith said every investor he had heard from was
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But when official news about the deal was released, at least
some ostensible Powertel shareholders on Internet message boards
derided the company for selling itself too cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement now calls for each Powertel share to be traded for
2.6353 shares of Deutsche Telekom, a setup that values Powertel at
about $106 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But since Deutsche Telekom stock is trading near its 52-week
low, a rebound is possible or even likely.
</P>
<P>
   When Deutsche Telekom shares bounce back, the value of the deal
to Powertel shareholders will too, Prentiss said. ``If it gets to
even $50 a share, that is $131 a share for Powertel.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again, maybe Deutsche Telekom is overspending.
</P>
<P>
   Even adding Powertel's 727,000 subscribers, VoiceStream will
boast a mere 3.3 million subscribers compared with AT&AMP;T with 13
million, the planned SBC-BellSouth alliance with 17 million and
Verizon with 26 million.
</P>
<P>
   To catch up to the leaders will require billions of dollars of
investment in equipment and marketing. Moreover, VoiceStream still
doesn't have a complete national presence and will need to buy more
licenses _ or smaller wireless carriers _ in the Carolinas and
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are way behind,'' said Andrew Cole, head of the global
wireless practice at Renaissance Strategy. ``But they will have a
nationwide network, and GSM is a great technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In Powertel's favor is the logic of the newcomer. Companies like
BellSouth and Verizon, which incorporates the former AirTouch, have
been in business since the early 1980s and enjoy a far larger
customer base. But analysts say Powertel's aggressive marketing _
which has undercut other carriers' prices and introduced new
features _ has made it one of the leaders in scooping up new
wireless users.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates for that ``incremental market share'' range as high as
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. wireless use has already surged past 80 million
subscribers, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association. But industry analysts _ and the executives at Deutsche
Telekom _ believe that the wireless industry is morphing to a new
model, making the first wave of carriers vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the new wireless world, the devices will become conduits more
for data than voice.
</P>
<P>
   Users will commonly use them as electronic wallets to make
purchases, as communication modules sending and receiving e-mail,
as Internet connections linking to stocks, sports and news, and,
perhaps, as agents that link them to their home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the spread of wireless phones for conversation, the
United States lags Europe by about a year, Cole said. ``The market
in the United States is still fairly immature.''
</P>
<P>
   As wireless changes toward data, carriers that do not have scale
will have trouble competing, Cole said. ``There will be four or
five major players in the U.S. They will be the fifth player for
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   But even that will take some rapid expansion. After the merger
with Powertel, VoiceStream will still lag not only Verizon,
BellSouth-SBC and AT&AMP;T, but also Alltel and Nextel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, deep pockets can make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Walter, analyst with Robinson-Humphrey, said the company
will emerge ready to battle the big players. ``They're going to
have $5 billion from Deutsche Telekom to improve the network, and
Powertel has a lot of cash on their balance sheet,'' he said.
``They can compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of VoiceStream is far from
assured. The company faces congressional resistance, led by Sen.
Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.). That opposition focuses on the
still-majority stake held by the German government in Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream Chairman John Stanton said Monday that he believes
the deal will make the wireless markets more competitive by giving
added muscle to a smaller player. While acknowledging Hollings, he
said he is more worried about the members of Congress who hold key
leadership posts, like Trent Lott (R-Miss.).
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Hollings) is one member who has a strong view,'' Stanton
said. ``We are working with Sen. Lott and we are working with other
members, but we are not concerned.''

HASTERT OFFERS KEY CONCESSIONS ON RAISING MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Updates and expands throughout; now two takes and coded for
front page.)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT and LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert on Monday offered key
concessions to Democrats on a plan to raise the federal minimum
wage, moving to end months of stalemate on a popular bill that
Republicans feared could damage them at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate earlier this year approved an increase in
the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour, with the increase coming
in 50-cent increments over two years in the House version and
smaller annual amounts over three years in the Senate bill. The
conflicting bills then stalled in the conference committee that was
supposed to reconcile them, raising fears among some Republicans
that they they were handing Democrats a potent campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Monday, Hastert sought to take that threat off the
table. He proposed that the committee would agree to the Democrats'
demands to spread the $1 increase over two years but continued to
insist that the compromise measure must include $76 billion in tax
cuts for small business over 10 years to help these companies pay
``the costs of this wage increase.''
</P>
<P>
   In another concession, Hastert proposed dropping pension
provisions and a repeal of the estate tax attached to the bill by
House Republicans and that Democrats had criticized as a giveaway
to wealthy Americans. Both of these provisions, however, have moved
through the Congress on separate tracks and now must be dealt with
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that a vast majority of congressional
Democrats and Republicans would like to see a balanced approach
before we adjourn,'' said Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's proposal makes the minimum wage, in effect, the
opening issue among Democrats and Republicans in Congress when they
return next week from their late summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials expressed cautious optimism that the
Republican-controlled Congress and the Clinton administration could
strike a deal in the next month to raise the minimum wage for the
first time since 1996. Officials signaled that the Republican
insistence on the small business tax cuts would not be a deal
breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at long last the Republicans are serious about dropping
many of their roadblocks to a $1 increase over two years, then
that's good news,'' Gene Sperling, head of the White House's
National Economic Council, said in an interview. ``There still
remain some obstacles, but the president stands ready to work in
good faith with Congress to get a bill he can sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's letter reflects his desire to position House
Republicans for the legislative endgame with Clinton, and to turn a
political liability into a virtue in time for the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative for the minimum wage offer came from Hastert and
reflects how House Republicans feel more politically vulnerable on
the issue than their Senate counterparts. Hastert said that Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott shared his views, but only the speaker
signed the letter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott, John Czwartacki, said he had not seen
Hastert's letter but added, ``Senator Lott supports moving the
minimum wage increase as long as it's tied to small business tax
relief. Politics is the art of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that Hastert is seeking to secure his
legislative gains for the bruising fall elections, the speaker is
also paring back on the tax-cut proposals that he will press for,
cuts for married couples and retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's offer comes just a few days after Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the Republican nominee for president, found himself
defending his proposed tax cut, and admitting that he needed to do
a better job of promoting it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats greeted Hastert's offer cautiously, and
seemed tempted to milk even more political mileage out his
political predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal that the speaker made was in the right
direction,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
House Democrat and a sponsor with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts of the Democrats' original $1-over-two-years bill.
``It raises the question of whether 50 cents a year is enough or
whether we want to do 50 cents a year over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are high on the tax relief side and low on the benefit to
minimum-wage workers,'' Bonior added, ``but it is my view that we
can work this out and we can get a bill by sometime next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior noted that the current minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, has
lost purchasing power in the more than two years since since he and
Kennedy first asked Congress for the additional $1 increase.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.15 would have to rise by 24 cents to restore its 1998
purchasing power, according to an estimate furnished by Jared
Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. The
minimum wage reached its greatest purchasing power in 1968 when it
was worth the equivalent of $7.49 in 1999 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hastert beat them to the punch, going public with the
Republican proposal, the Democrats had been discussing a revision
of their original bill, one that would increase the minimum wage by
more than $1.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's proposal of a $76 billion tax cut for small business
drew criticism from Bonior, who said that it was almost four times
greater than the $20 billion in tax relief that the Republicans had
sought in 1996, the last time Congress approved a minimum wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal would also remove from minimum wage
coverage some workers now covered by the law, including some
``computer professionals'' and funeral home workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''After three years of foot-dragging, Republicans appear ready
to sign on to a wage increase for the lowest paid workers,''
Kennedy said in a statement. ``But their proposal is loaded with
poison pills and oversized tax breaks for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans, however, criticized Hastert for
compromising at all. ``I've never been in favor of bargaining on
the minimum wage,'' said Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who voted
against the wage increase in March. ``The package does not give
businesses anywhere near the relief they're going to need.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address on July 29, just before the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Clinton appealed to
Republicans to break the impasse on the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republican leaders really want to make their compassion
count, they ought to join me in getting back to business and
raising the minimum wage,'' Clinton said. ''I hope the majority
will join the Democrats to seize this moment, to stop the delays,
to work with me to help our working families.''
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the minimum wage, to $6.15 an hour, would affect
10.1 million workers who now earn between $5.15 an hour and $6.14,
and millions more who earn up to $6.70 an hour and would enjoy
raises to maintain their margin over the new minimum wage,
economists say.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the 10.1 million directly affected workers are
over age 20, often a family's principal earners, while one-third
are teen-agers. When Congress voted in 1996 to raise the minimum in
two annual steps, to $5.15 an hour on Sept. 1, 1997, from $4.25,
there was much concern that millions of low wage workers would lose
their jobs because they lacked enough skills to justify higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   But the increases came just as the economy began to boom, and
the unemployment rate, instead of rising, fell steadily. Now, the
concern over job loss is muted, the argument being that the strong
economy is raising the pay of low-skilled workers anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modest proposal people are talking about _ $1 over two
years _ is pretty close to what would happen anyway in the
marketplace,'' said Kevin Murphy, a labor economist at the
University of Chicago, who had argued in 1996 that the proposed
increase in the minimum wage, to $5.15 an hour, would cost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the
Texas governor supported a $1-an-hour increase in the minimum wage
although he did not know if Bush supported the specific details in
the compromises being discussed by Hastert and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush approves a dollar increase in the minimum wage
with flexibility for the states so that entry level workers are not
priced out of the market,'' he said.

INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES TEST FOR EPO 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee's
executive board announced Monday that it had approved plans to
carry out tests for the banned synthetic hormone known as EPO at
next month's Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, the board member from the United States, called
the approval ``a significant test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a reminder to any cowardly athlete who doesn't have
confidence in himself or herself to compete without crutches or
stay home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic erythropoietin has been the performance-enhancing
drug of choice in cycling and other endurance sports for much of
the past decade, but the extent of the abuse was not clear until a
large cache of EPO was found in an official Tour de France car
driven by a Belgian employee of one of the competing teams in 1998.
After that, efforts accelerated to detect the substance, which was
initially developed to treat kidney transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Schamasch, the IOC's medical director, said testing
would begin in Australia on Saturday and continue through the
Sydney Olympics, which begin Sept. 15 and conclude Oct. 1.
Schamasch said that a minimum of 300 random EPO tests would be
administered, but that the IOC hoped to administer at least a
hundred more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The new IOC-approved test requires both a blood sample and a
urine sample. For reasons of hygiene, Schamasch said, the tests
will be administered ``out of competition'' instead of at sports
sites, where conventional urine tests are traditionally
administered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to say which sports we are going to target,
but we will make sure we target the right sports,'' said Dr.
Jacques Rogge, the executive board member from Belgium, who is also
vice president of the IOC's medical commission.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been blood testing or out-of-competition testing
in any form at the Summer Games. The IOC modified the Olympic
charter last year to allow for blood testing, and athletes will
have to sign a form upon arrival in Sydney agreeing to submit to
it. Rogge said that any athlete who refuses, even on religious
grounds, will not be allowed to participate and any athlete who
refuses after competing will be disqualified retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   To test positive for EPO, an athlete must test positive in both
the blood and urine samples. The urine test developed by French
researchers, which could not be validated in time for use during
this year's Tour de France, can detect synthetic EPO injected in
the previous three days. The blood test developed by Australians,
which requires 12 milliliters of blood to be removed by syringe
from an athlete's arm, can detect EPO use up to 20 days after the
fact. But unlike the French test, it detects EPO by an indirect
method based on probabilities and young red blood cell
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the blood test's indirect nature, IOC officials were
not confident it alone could withstand legal challenges, but after
the medical commission approved the two-pronged test earlier this
month, the IOC's legal commission approved it on Sunday and
recommended approval to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there will still be legal challenges,'' Rogge said.
``But we expect that the scientific validation we have and legal
study we've done will convince every judge of our rights.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another significant move Monday, the executive board cut the
number of candidate cities for the 2008 Summer Games to five from
10. The survivors are: Beijing; Osaka, Japan; Paris; Toronto; and,
in the least convincing fashion, Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote is scheduled for next July 15, at the IOC meeting
in Moscow, one day before the full membership is scheduled to elect
a successor to the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. But
for now and despite the vote-buying scandal involving the Salt Lake
City bid that shook the Olympic movement last year, the 80-year-old
Samaranch remains in charge. Monday's winnowing process was the
first phase of the new selection system that he lobbied belatedly
to put in place in order to reduce the chronic influence-peddling
that plagued the former process.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members who are not part of the small evaluation commission
are no longer permitted to visit bidding cities, and the
assessments of the 10 prospective hosts were made by a working
group on the basis of questionnaires filled out by the applicants
and with the help of outside experts in transport,
telecommunications and financial and legal affairs. In the next
phase, the evaluation commission will visit the five bid cities and
prepare detailed reports to present to the full membership.
</P>
<P>
   These five cities were eliminated from contention for 2008, in
descending order of quality as determined by the working group:
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Seville, Spain; Bangkok, Thailand; Cairo,
Egypt, and Havana. Istanbul also did not meet the minimum
acceptable grade established by the working group, but the
executive board, essentially the board of directors, decided by a
majority vote to allow Istanbul to bid because its candidacy was
considered the strongest of the second tier.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, Osaka, Paris and Toronto were all approved unanimously
by the board, which declined to establish a pecking order, although
Beijing, which lost by only two votes to Sydney in the bidding for
the 2000 Games, is considered the early favorite. China's human
rights record, considered a factor in Beijing's loss in 1993, is
again expected to be a major campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that our human rights situation is not perfect, just
like in every country in the world,'' the executive board member He
Zhenliang of China said. ``You cannot say France has no problems.
You cannot say Japan or America have no problems. But what we
should do is let the Olympic Games be a means to help this country
improve its social environment, including human rights, and not use
this as an instrument to go against.''

SCOUTS LOSE FINANCIAL AND MORAL SUPPORT SINCE RULING ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Mass., Conn., R.I., N.J.)   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the two months since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Boy Scouts of America have a constitutional right to exclude gays,
corporate and governmental support for the organization has slipped
markedly.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, San Diego and San Francisco, Calif., have told local
Scout troops that they can no longer use parks, schools and other
municipal sites. Companies like Chase Manhattan Bank and Textron
Inc. have withdrawn hundreds of thousands of dollars in support to
local and national scouting groups nationwide. Dozens of United
Ways from Massachusetts to San Francisco have cut off money.
</P>
<P>
   And one state, Connecticut, in what may prove to be a test case,
has banned contributions to the Scouts by state employees through a
state-run charity. In addition, the state is considering whether to
block the Scouts from using public campgrounds or buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a watershed issue,'' said C. Joan Parker, assistant
counsel to the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities, which must issue a ruling by Nov. 8 on whether the
Scouts violate state antidiscrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission rules that the group does violate those laws,
the Boy Scouts would be prevented from using any public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide, Are we aiding and abetting someone that
discriminates?'' Parker said. ``Clearly, any public entity needs to
have clean hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Shields, a national spokesman for the Scouts, said the
organization respected the right of private companies to donate
only to groups of their choice. But the organization is suing the
state of Connecticut to restore state employees' ability to donate
to the Scouts, and Shields said his group would fight to maintain
access to public schools and public places in other states as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts of America since 1910 have taught traditional
family values,'' Shields said. ``We feel that an avowed homosexual
isn't a role model for those values.''
</P>
<P>
   For public and private officials around the country, the problem
is a complex and painful one. On the one hand, they do not want to
cut off valuable opportunities for the young or run afoul of First
Amendment principles. On the other hand, by allowing a group that
bans gays to use public facilities, and by supporting it, they
violate their antidiscrimination statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The trim uniform of the Boy Scouts has become almost a cherished
national symbol. But at a time when same-sex benefits, diversity
training and nondiscrimination policies have become routine, some
companies and organizations say the Scouts' refusal to admit gays
has come to seem almost un-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their position is, on the face of it, in conflict with our
commitment and our values on diversity,'' said Jim Finn, a
spokesman for Chase, which had contributed about $200,000 annually
to the Boy Scouts until stopping it last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in June by a 5-4 vote that the
organization had a constitutional right to exclude gays because
opposition to homosexuality is part of the organization's
``expressive message.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling last year by the New Jersey
Supreme Court that applied the state's law against discrimination
in public accommodations to require a New Jersey Scout troop to
readmit a longtime member and assistant scoutmaster, James Dale,
whom it had dismissed after learning he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling did not address the merits of the ban on gays,
only whether the Boy Scouts is a private group, and so has the
right to set its own membership rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts, whose membership has grown to 6.2 million, said that
the group's charter since 1910 had promoted ``family values,'' and
that its oath pledged a ``morally straight'' life. A homosexual,
the organization said, is not the proper role model for those
values.
</P>
<P>
   While the decisions to withhold support will not seriously dent
the $125 million raised annually by the Scouts national
organization, the growing effort to block local chapters from
meeting in places like public schools and state campgrounds raises
practical problems for the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ruling, many public bodies, charities and companies,
including Merrill Lynch, are beginning the discussion that has
taken place in Hartford, Conn. The options, they say, are equally
unpleasant: hurting children who are benefiting from scouting, or
supporting a position they find ethically untenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we just cut off funding, and so hundreds of kids in
Hartford aren't getting a program they so desperately need?'' asked
Susan Dunn, senior vice president of the United Way of the Capital
Area. ``Our mission is to serve our community, especially children.
But it's also in our mission that we don't discriminate. That's
where it becomes difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the
city of San Diego on Monday asking a federal court to revoke a
50-year-old agreement that lets the Scouts lease 18 acres of
parkland for $1 a year. The lease is set to expire in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   In Fall River, Mass., the executive director of the local United
Way, Bob Horne, said he was stunned at how swiftly and strongly his
board had acted to cut support to any Scout troops that did not
sign a form saying they would not endorse the Scouts' ban on gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that some people would try to skirt the issue,''
Horne said. ``But attendance was unbelievable, the best attendance
we've had all year. It could not have been a more unanimous,
enthusiastic vote. Obviously, there was concern for the kids, but
it all came down to, we really have an obligation to do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the people of Fall River, an old mill city, have
Portuguese immigrants in their background, and an influx of
Cambodians has occurred in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those growing groups,'' Horne said, ``people are being
more aware of diversity and doing things right and being fair and
not setting up separate views, the idea that people are people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People felt very strongly that we should take this step. I
didn't get the feeling there was anyone who didn't want to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who are eliminating or reconsidering their support are
trying to respect, as the Supreme Court affirmed, the Scouts' right
to set its own mission.
</P>
<P>
   And cutting off money or access to one private group raises more
questions, officials say. Do those same charities then cut off
financing to groups chartered to serve, say, Latinos? Do states
stop allowing Roman Catholic youth groups to use public campgrounds
or school meeting rooms because the church does not ordain gays?
</P>
<P>
   ``If a group has in its charter that they're set up to serve
women,'' Dunn asked, ``is that discrimination?''
</P>
<P>
   Among those debating whether to end support, some are reluctant
to do so because they believe the local Scout chapters do not agree
with the ban on gays, which was put into effect by the national
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows their work with kids is good, and it's a policy
that's not commonly enforced,'' said Marty Milkovic, executive
director of the United Way of Northern Fairfield County, in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Like chapters in many other cities, the Southeastern New England
United Way in Providence, R.I., has said it will require any Scout
council to sign a form saying it will not discriminate. But the Boy
Scouts' Narragansett Council, which receives $200,000 from the
United Way, has said it must abide by the national policy. And
Shields, the spokesman for the national group, said local councils
were not allowed to disavow any part of the national charter, so
the councils are not allowed to sign any nondiscrimination policy
that would require them to admit gays. Troops that disobey the
national charter could face eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Within the local councils, though, there is increasing dissent
from the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting for All, a group started by a 15-year-old scout in
California, which advocates opening up the organization to gays,
held a national protest day outside Boy Scout headquarters in
several cities last week. In Montclair, N.J., parents in a local
Cub Scout troop are signing a petition saying they do not endorse
the national policy.
</P>
<P>
   In New Milford, Conn., Gale Alexander said he and his wife were
torn about whether to allow their 9-year-old son to remain in the
Boy Scouts. They like the skills and self-confidence the program
has taught, but at the same time, Alexander said, ``I couldn't look
at my friends if I couldn't stand up and say this is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   So as a compromise, the Alexanders are letting their son
continue scouting, but they have decided to become vocal in their
opposition to the policy. In conversations, they have discovered
that other parents do not agree with it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that all the rank and file is just fine with this is
just a bunch of malarkey,'' Alexander said. ``It's time now for
parents to speak up and say, I don't agree with it. It's time for
people to start fighting from within.''

GORE, IN ATTACK ON DRUG INDUSTRY, FOCUSES ON 2 COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore Monday escalated his
attacks against the pharmaceutical industry, criticizing two drug
companies by name and calling for greater competition in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry has long been one of Gore's corporate
bogeymen, along with oil, tobacco and insurance. But in Monday's
speech to a forum of elderly people on the campus of Florida State
University, Gore expanded his criticism, saying he would veto any
legislation that would extend monopoly patents for prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore singled out for criticism the manufacturers of two
medications: the Schering-Plough Corp., which makes Claritin, and
the American Home Products Corp., the parent company of
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes Lodine. In the case of
Claritin, he said the manufacturer spent more money on advertising
than on research. And in the case of Lodine, an arthritis medicine
prescribed for both people and pets, he said American Home Products
charged pharmacies more than veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for them making profits and having more research and
whatnot,'' Gore said. ``But I'm not going to stand by if they
behave in an unfair way.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's trip was Gore's second to Florida in less than a week,
underscoring the importance his campaign places on the state and
its 25 electoral votes. The governor here is Jeb Bush, the brother
of Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and Gore
was greeted by taunts from a larger-than-usual collection of Bush
supporters when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee's address kicked off a four-day,
four-state trip that Gore is devoting to health care policy, an
issue on which Gore feels he has an advantage over Bush. He also
plans to highlight his proposals for a patients' bill of rights,
expanded health care coverage for children, the solvency of
Medicare and investments in medical research at stops in New
Mexico, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the centerpiece of Gore's health care program is his
proposal for a voluntary Medicare benefit that would provide
prescription drug coverage for the elderly. About 13 million
Medicare beneficiaries have no drug coverage, while many others pay
expensive premiums through Medigap plans, Gore aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, seniors with no coverage who have incomes of
135 percent of the poverty level or below, about $12,000 for an
individual and $14,000 for a couple, would have their drugs covered
without cost.
</P>
<P>
   Those with higher incomes would pay a premium, on a sliding
scale, and would be reimbursed half of the cost of their
prescriptions up to a total of $5,000. After Medicare recipients
paid $4,000 out of pocket for prescriptions, the government would
pay all remaining costs. The Gore campaign estimates the cost of
the proposal at $253 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is complicated, and Gore misstated some of the details
while explaining it to his audience Monday. But his larger points
were clear: He has a detailed plan, while Bush, does not; his plan
would be affordable within a balanced budget, while Bush, he says,
cannot afford a comprehensive plan because of the size of his
income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has yet to propose a specific plan, but his aides say that
he would build on the proposal of a bipartisan congressional
commission that would seek to spur competition between public and
private plans for Medicare recipients, giving consumers a choice of
public and private plans, some of which would provide a drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has said he supports a sliding prescription drug
subsidy for the low-income elderly, but would leave the amounts to
be determined in negotiations with Congress. Gore said Monday that
``the insurance companies have said they will not offer such
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on prescription drugs Monday coincided with the
release of a television advertisement on the topic by the
Democratic National Committee. Both the Bush campaign and the
Republican National Committee began broadcasting ads on
prescription drugs last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ad, which will appear in eight states, charges
Bush with ``siding with the big drug companies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Gore's main target Monday was the drug companies. He
described an industry that kept prices artificially high while its
patents remained in effect, forcing seniors to choose between
prescriptions and sometimes between prescriptions and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just wrong,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Schering-Plough of spending more on advertising
than on research.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the Wall Street Journal, they spend more money
every year advertising Claritin and promoting Claritin than
Coca-Cola spends to advertise and promote Coca-Cola,'' Gore said.
``So if they're using these profits more for that than for research
and if a lot of the most valuable research is being paid for by the
taxpayers anyway, then I believe that we need more competition.''
</P>
<P>
   To force that competition, Gore said, he would veto all patent
extension legislation that would benefit drug companies.
Schering-Plough is seeking such an extension for Claritin, whose
patents begin to expire in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Donnell, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said, ``The
pharmaceutical industry is responsible for breakthrough discoveries
that make invaluable contributions to the nation's health care
system. The real issue in the United States is the fact that a
significant portion of our population lacks prescription drug
coverage. Schering-Plough believes that all Americans should be
provided with access to drug coverage through private sector
mechanisms, without resorting to government price controls, which
history has proven simply do not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, denounced
Gore's proposals as a ``nationalized drug plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is similar to Hillary Clinton's attempt to nationalize
health care in 1993,'' Bartlett said. ``Al Gore is fully embracing
the old-style, government-knows-best approach that the American
people soundly rejected when Hillary Clinton tried it in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also accused American Home Products, which markets the drug
Lodine, sets significantly lower prices for veterinarians than for
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it costs $108 a month for a person, it costs $37.80 for
a dog,'' he said. A spokesman for American Home Products declined
to comment.  &QL;

 &HT;    Bar codes give new Web link
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - In the beginning, magazines and newspapers ran stories
about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then they printed Web addresses along with their ads and
stories. Readers could carry the paper to their computers and peck
in the addresses to find more on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now, media companies have begun their first mass tests of direct
print-to-Web connections using scanners and bar codes.
</P>
<P>
   Readers sitting at their computers can use special scanners to
swipe bar codes in magazine or newspaper ads or stories and jump
directly to related Web sites. Publishers hope the technology will
help them increase advertising revenue and satisfy increasingly
Internet-dependent, time-crunched subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will enough readers and advertisers use it to
make it worthwhile?
</P>
<P>
   Both Forbes magazine and electronics retailer RadioShack have
just begun distributing more than 3 million hand-held scanners for
free.
</P>
<P>
   The scanners, called :Cue:C.A.T.s and resembling a computer
mouse, can be connected to computers, then swiped across special
bar codes to log on to related Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create a shortcut between Web sites and printed
content. Readers no longer would have to wander through several Web
pages or type lengthy Internet addresses to reach specific pages
deep within a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have proposed competing technologies for the
scanners. Charleston, S.C.-based GoCode, providing its technology
for free to 1,000 subscribers of The Post and Courier newspaper in
Charleston, uses a pen-shaped scanner that costs $75 to produce,
with a version planned later this year at a third the price.
</P>
<P>
   But the :Cue:C.A.T., a product made by Dallas-based
Digital:Convergence, is apparently the first that is cheap enough
to mass produce and distribute for free. The company is providing
them free to certain partner companies, which then are distributing
them to the public or subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Digital:Convergence declined to say how much the scanners cost
to manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge, I think, is just getting it in people's hands
and getting them swiping,'' said Peter Eschbach, a spokesman for
Digital:Convergence.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to make money by licensing the technology to
media outlets and other companies. The media companies hope to
attract more advertisers and possibly charge more to run ads that
have the special bar codes of Digital:Convergence. (The scanners
also can jump to some Internet sites reading more traditional bar
codes found on groceries, CDs and other items.)
</P>
<P>
   RadioShack has begun distributing at least 2.5 million of the
scanners at more than 7,000 stores nationally. The electronics
retailer's 2001 catalogs include special bar codes that, when
scanned, connect directly to Internet pages where the products can
be purchased online.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' 850,000 subscribers began receiving free :Cue:C.A.T.'s
Friday in time for them to scan bar codes alongside ads and stories
in the magazine's Sept. 11 edition. A listing of ``Forbes
Favorite'' Web sites includes scannable bar codes that connect with
winning sites. The magazine plans to use bar codes in its future
editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets people to Web sites they want to visit faster and
easier, then it is a success,'' said Ray Healey Jr., the magazine's
vice president of editorial information. ``One question will be how
many of them actually hook them (the scanners) up and start to zip
to advertising Web sites or editorial Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes isn't the only publication tying in with the scanning
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Wired magazine is distributing the scanners free to its more
than 400,000 subscribers starting late next month. The Dallas
Morning News is involved in plans to send out several hundred
thousand scanners free to homes in metro Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Other publications aren't giving away scanners but are including
ads and stories featuring special bar codes in upcoming editions.
Among the participants is Parade magazine, which will include
special bar codes in its Sept. 10 edition. Parade is inserted in
the Sunday editions of many U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with competing scanner technologies are hoping the
:Cue:C.A.T.'s mass distribution won't create an insurmountable
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is part of one rival venture in the works. Digimarc,
another competitor, uses scannable marks that can be read by
certain Web cameras. The technology was incorporated in ads running
in recent editions of Wired magazine and Popular Mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   At GoCode in South Carolina, Marketing Vice President Prioleau
Alexander said his company won't follow Digital:Convergence's lead
and send scanners to people who haven't asked for them. ``We don't
want our hardware to end up in somebody's garbage can.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company has given scanners to about 1,000 people _
some selected by the company and others who requested it _ in the
Charleston area and plans to begin distributing scanners to another
4,000 people in Colorado Springs, Colo., where it has struck a deal
with a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At The Post and Courier, which is using the GoCode technology,
executives are trying to craft a business plan to profit from the
device.
</P>
<P>
   So far the newspaper isn't charging advertisers more for using
the bar code, Assistant Publisher Larry Tarleton said. But he said
that might be an option in the future. Another is charging extra
for classified ads with the GoCode bar code, which is about the
size of George Washington's ponytail on a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper is also contemplating how to get the scanners into
the hands of more readers. Tarleton said options include charging
subscribers more to receive scanners or giving them away free for
subscribers who sign up for a year or more of service.
</P>
<P>
   But Tarleton said the new Web connection won't draw hordes of
new readers to his newspaper's printed page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone is going to want to have the technology,'' he
said. ``A lot of people are not going to be interested in the
Internet.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with
the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly
pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed
evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's Navy sank to the
bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The other submarine was the Memphis, a nuclear-powered attack
submarine based in Groton, Conn., and one of two American
submarines spying on the largest Russian naval exercise in years
when disaster struck the Kursk on the morning of Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Memphis reached Bergen, Norway, officials in
Russia, including the defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, had
said that the Kursk probably had sunk after colliding with either a
foreign submarine or a World War II mine. So the arrival of the
Memphis spawned news reports in Russia that a damaged submarine
needing repairs had limped into port.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Pentagon still refuses to comment on the
whereabouts or the mission of the Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   But American military and intelligence officials now privately
acknowledge its spying mission.
</P>
<P>
   They insist that the Memphis was not damaged. Nor was it, the
other American submarine or any other foreign submarine involved in
any collision, they said. The Memphis' arrival in Norway was a
long-scheduled liberty call, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The call allowed the submarine to unload sonar tapes and other
recordings that the Americans say captured two explosions that
ravaged and sank the Kursk, killing all 118 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Those tapes, now being analyzed at the National Maritime
Intelligence Center in Suitland, Md., contain the strongest
evidence, until now not discussed in detail, to support the leading
American theory of what destroyed the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   And that theory, they said, does not include the collision that
the Russians have said probably occurred. ``We have subs that hear
everything that goes on,'' a senior officer in Washington said.
``It's pretty clear to us what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American theory, a rocket-propelled torpedo
being loaded or launched as part of an exercise misfired, its
engine or its fuel exploding. After 2 minutes and 15 seconds _
during which time the Kursk's captain either increased power from
the nuclear reactor or blew ballast in an effort to surface _ a
powerful explosion of the torpedo's warhead tore a gaping hole in
the submarine's bow, killing most if not all of the crew instantly.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, Russia, a former submarine officer who is a
member of a governmental commission investigating the explosion
said Monday that a new weapons system was being tested on board the
Kursk when it sank. But the former officer, Sergei Zhekov, would
not elaborate during a news conference about the system, saying
that it was a state secret, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kursk sank, the United States knew about it within
hours. The Americans collected telltale recordings from submarines,
a surface ship and even from shore. They detected no sounds of a
collision. And they monitored the Russian fleet's emergency radio
transmissions closely in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two submarines, the Navy had also sent a surface
ship to the Barents, the Loyal. The Loyal is part of a class of
surveillance ships that are operated by civilian contractors, but
include as many as 15 Navy seamen and officers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Navy, ships like the Loyal have only a single
mission: ``to gather underwater acoustical data'' in support of
``the anti-submarine warfare mission'' of fleet commanders. The
ship can tow an array of underwater listening devices that pick up
the most minute data, and that, the officials said, was precisely
what it was doing.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American officer said that the two submarines were ``a
long ways away'' from the Kursk at the time of the explosions, but
he declined to say how far. Another senior officer said that under
the Navy's rules of engagement the submarines would not have gone
any closer than five miles, especially because the Russian ships
were testing weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Loyal, whose presence would have been obvious to the Russian
fleet, was presumably farther away than the submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the senior officer said, the submarines were close enough
not only to detect the explosions with their sonar, but also to
actually feel the underwater concussion caused by the second,
larger blast. Even so, there was no damage to either the Memphis or
the other submarine, according to all the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a tea cup was rattled,'' the senior military officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the only other country whose submarines regularly prowl
the Barents, has denied having a submarine in the area at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the explosions, the two American submarines
radioed messages back to fleet headquarters. ``They were alive and
well and had no bumps,'' another senior officer said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American officials, neither the two submarines
nor the Loyal detected any sounds that would suggest the Kursk had
been involved in a collision of any sort. Even at great distances,
the signals created by a collision or an explosion are easy to
distinguish, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One official also said that given the Kursk's immense size,
larger than the American Trident ballistic missile submarines, it
was unlikely another vessel could have endured a collision without
suffering significant and perhaps debilitating damage. It is also
unlikely, given the Kursk's double-hulled design intended to
withstand crashes or torpedoes, that a collision alone could have
caused the damage that doomed the Kursk, the officials and experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Kursk sank, Russian accounts of what happened
have been imprecise and sometimes contradictory. Officials in
Russia did not report the accident until early Aug. 14, which was a
Monday, a day after they realized something went wrong and nearly
two days after it happened. Even then they said that the accident
had happened on Sunday, rather than on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians do not deny that a major explosion hit the Kursk.
But they have insisted that the submarine first was involved in a
collision with some huge object, possibly a submarine or a World
War II mine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The assertions are based in part on five hours of underwater
video now being examined by an investigative commission headed by
the deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov. Russians officials have
cited external damage on the submarine's hull that they said could
have only been caused by scraping another large object, and they
have reported detecting pieces from unknown foreign submarines
lying on the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview a week ago, Sergeyev, the defense
minister, said that Russian surface ships racing to the rescue had
detected a second vessel on the seabed near the Kursk and had found
an unknown signal buoy like those used by submarines. Some Russian
reports said the buoy's markers were green and white and did not
match those of the Russian fleet. Sergeyev said the buoy was never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   American officials questioned the reports of the buoy. They said
rescue buoys on American and British submarines were orange, while
emergency communication buoys were gray.
</P>
<P>
   They also discounted the possibility that the second vessel the
Russians claimed to have detected on the ocean floor could have
been one of the two American submarines. ``They didn't go in that
close to look at what happened,'' a senior intelligence official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the explosion, the two submarines did not
immediately leave the area, the officials said. They continued to
gather intelligence, intercepting frantic, confused radio messages
between the other Russian ships trying to determine what had
happened to the Kursk and to coordinate a rescue effort, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials and submarine experts said it was possible that
some of the crew _ perhaps 15 men or more _ survived the initial
explosions if they managed quickly to shut the watertight doors to
their compartments in the stern.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians said that they had detected tapping sounds from
within the Kursk at least two days after it sank, raising hopes
that a rescue of some crewmen might be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials said that neither the Loyal nor the
American submarines detected the sounds, though they might not have
been able to do so if they were too far away.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said it also appeared likely that the force of the
second explosion tore apart the Kursk with the force of one to two
tons of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian divers who reached the Kursk a week after the
accident also found the rear escape hatch deformed, suggesting the
force of the blast may have rocketed throughout the submarine's
compartments.
</P>
<P>
   One question is whether the American submarines could have done
anything to help the rescue effort. The American officials said
that the submarines were not carrying the kind of rescue equipment,
like a submersible vehicle, that could have helped.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans had a fair guess of what happened to the
Kursk early on, it was only after the Memphis unloaded its sonar
tapes on Aug. 18 that officials in Washington began to offer the
theory of the misfiring of the torpedo missile.
</P>
<P>
   While the submarine's sonar equipment allowed the crew to
distinguish the explosions, a closer analysis of the recordings had
to wait until the tapes reached shore.
</P>
<P>
   But how much the Pentagon will be prepared to say in public
remains in question. The submarine fleet has been traditionally
wrapped in silence, and even now, more than two weeks later, the
Pentagon has not publicly acknowledged the presence of two
submarines in the Barents. Officials privately confirmed the role
of the Memphis only when it surfaced in Norway, and they still will
not disclose the name of the other submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the Americans provided information on the submarines'
exact whereabouts at the time the Kursk went down.
</P>
<P>
   Given that secrecy, and the likelihood that the Russians will
not fully share what they learn even if they recover the wreckage,
it will be difficult to learn with any certainty what happened to
the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, an American submarine, the Scorpion, sank in the
Atlantic near the Azores. Like the Kursk, it may have have been
destroyed in an accident involving a torpedo misfiring. Other
experts have argued a faulty battery led to a fire and explosion.
But to this day, there is no public explanation of what happened.

AGREEMENT REACHED TO CLOSE PUMICE MINE ON SACRED INDIAN PEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ It's a long way from the catwalks of Paris to
the craggy forests of the San Francisco Peaks, but the two have
been linked for more than a decade by the demand for stonewashed
denim: new jeans made to look old by laundering them with pieces of
volcanic pumice.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pumice came from a strip mine on Sugarloaf Mountain,
one of the Peaks, twelve miles northeast of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rated as the No. 1 supplier to the industry back in
the mid-1990s,'' said Ed Morgan, vice president of Arizona
Tufflite, the Phoenix company that owns the mine. Morgan estimated
sales by his company at $25 million to $30 million over the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pumice washed jeans went all over the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For just as many years, the Sierra Club and 13 American Indian
tribes have been trying to limit the company's mining, saying that
it damages the environment of the Peaks, which the Indians believe
are sacred ground.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   On a rocky outcrop overlooking Tufflite's 100-foot deep White
Vulcan Pumice mine, federal officials and the company signed an
agreement to close the 90-acre site within six months.
</P>
<P>
   That was welcome news for the Hopi tribe, which believes that
the Peaks are the home of kachina spirits who live part of the year
as clouds in the mountains, and bring rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have believed these things for thousands of
years,'' said Wayne Taylor, chairman of the Hopi tribe.
</P>
<P>
   For the Navaho, the mountains are one of four borders to their
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Just as galling as the desecration of the land, Indian
representatives said, was the purpose for the mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further destruction of the countryside in this Sacred area
just so the fashion conscious can wear jeans which make them seem
to have spent time outside, is to us, ludicrous,'' wrote one tribal
leader to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have to work to get that look,'' complained Andrew
Bessler, an organizer for the Sierra Club who runs the group's
`Save The Peaks' effort linking the Indian tribes with
environmentalists. ``Besides, stonewashing takes two years out of
the life of the jeans, and that's why the industry likes it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Tufflite applied for a permit to expand their operations in
1998, the Indian' and Sierra Club's public relations campaign
against the mine went into overdrive with concerts, demonstrations
at the mine site, and relentless pressuring of state, local, and
federal public officials.
</P>
<P>
   All thirteen tribes passed resolutions opposing the mine, as did
the city of Flagstaff and Coconino County, where it is located. Of
6,000 public comments received by the Forest Service on the
expansion project, only four favored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that this mine is being shut down and this long
controversy is ending. It's time to restore the Peaks to their
natural splendor,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in a
statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the government will pay Tufflite $1 million
and drop a lawsuit that demanded $300,000 in unpaid royalties for
previous sales of the pumice. In return, the company will shut down
the mine, which has just four employees, but will be able to sell
extracted pumice for the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great victory,' says Bessler. ``It will protect a
key cultural and archeological site from the continued desecration
of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   To Morgan, the mine closure is just a relief.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years of fighting, we decided that the
government was going to make it harder and harder to do business,''
he said. ``We were paying our lawyers, plus paying our taxes which
paid the government's lawyers, and in the end it just didn't make
sense to keep going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes the best years of using pumice to stonewash
denim are behind Tufflite anyway. ``They've got new techniques now
that use enzymes that are biodegradable and cheaper. Our market was
declining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Indian tribes, at least one tribal chairman saw some
significance in an unusual event that occurred in these
drought-stricken mountains just minutes after the closure agreement
was signed:
</P>
<P>
   It rained.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the spirits way of thanking us,'' said Taylor.

COURTHOUSE KLAN-FIGHTER TAKES ON ARYAN NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Calif., Colo., Ark., Pa., Ala., Ga., Ore.)   By JO THOMAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Morris S. Dees Jr., who has won a series
of civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist
groups in a campaign to put them out of business, came to court
here Monday to try to seize the Aryan Nations compound that has
nurtured white supremacists for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit here, Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law
Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son,
both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July
1998. The idea is that a large judgment will force the Aryan
Nations to turn over the compound to the plaintiffs in payment.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that not only the guards but also the Aryan
Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his
second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable, on the
ground that they run their security force in a negligent manner and
encourage violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the assault, the guards said later, they thought
they were under armed attack by militant Jews. And in response to
the suit's accusation that he encourages violence, lawyers for
Butler maintain in court documents that ``demonizing Jews is still
legal under the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still legal in this country to be a bigot,'' the defense
says. ``It is still legal to hate. Pastor Butler quite properly
erects the twin defenses of both free speech and religion contained
within the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the security guards, who pleaded guilty to criminal
charges in the assault and are now in prison, are expected to be
called as witnesses for the plaintiffs. A third guard is a fugitive
in the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection began Monday morning in the Kootenai County
Courthouse as members of a special police weapons unit patrolled
the roof and the grounds and a sole Aryan Nations supporter marched
on the sidewalk nearby, waving the group's black and red flag.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son Jason, now
21, told the police that they were driving home to the nearby town
of Sand Point from her niece's wedding at dusk on July 1, 1998,
playing music and having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said that her son had been in the Job Corps and that he
threw his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and,
inadvertently, his wallet along with it. The wallet had been a gift
from his grandfather, she said, so she turned her car around and
drove back to look for it. Her son got out with a flashlight and
quickly found the wallet, she said, and that is when she realized
that they were near the entrance to the Aryan Nations compound, in
the community of Hayden Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan testified at a hearing that when she turned around, her
1977 Datsun had backfired, as it often did. Inside the compound,
Shane Wright, an Aryan Nations security guard, thought he heard a
gunshot. Seeing a car parked on the road, he and Jesse Warfield,
then head of security, jumped into a pickup and began driving down
the compound's long driveway. John Yeager, a skinhead from
California, leaped into the back of the pickup, armed with a
semiautomatic rifle. The Keenans fled, with the guards _ three or
more in all _ pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager, Keenan told the police, fired five rounds from an
assault rifle as the guards bore down on her car, screaming for her
to pull over. When a bullet flattened the Keenans' rear tire, their
car slid into a ditch. Their pursuers ran up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said a man, later identified as Warfield, struck her with
a rifle butt, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her. Other
men tried to pull her weeping son out of the car, she said,
striking him with a bat and the butt of a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   A gun ``was pointed at me,'' Keenan told the authorities. ``It
made me very scared. I thought I was going to die.'' She begged
them to leave her son alone. After determining that the Keenans
were unarmed, the men relented, explaining that they were doing so
because both were white, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses are expected to testify that as a result of the
assault, Keenan and her son suffer from post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Edgar J. Steele, a lawyer representing
Butler, Teague and the Aryan Nations, pointed out that on the night
of the attack, the volunteer guards made no effort to notify Butler
of their actions. ``Wright, Yeager and Warfield were way out of
bounds, and they knew it,'' Steele argued. ``One can only do so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Dees and his legal team were trying ``to paint this
ragtag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organized,
well-trained and disciplined military organization.'' That, he
said, would be ``laughable if not so patently preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 27 years since he moved to northern Idaho from
California, Butler and his organization have welcomed many white
supremacists later convicted of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best known, and a model for the Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy J. McVeigh, was Robert Mathews, who in 1983 formed a
terrorist group known as the Order. Mathews and members of his gang
robbed armored cars, bombed a synagogue in Boise and assassinated
Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host in Denver. Mathews died in a
siege by the FBI in 1984, and other members of the organization are
serving federal prison sentences of 40 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Butler himself and 12 other white supremacist leaders were
arrested in 1987 on federal sedition charges but were acquitted at
trial in Fort Smith, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thomas, the leader of the Aryan Nations in Pennsylvania,
confessed to being part of another terrorist group, the Aryan
Republican Army, that in the mid-1990s robbed 22 Midwestern banks
in an effort to finance a white supremacist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has
taken the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to court, starting
with a successful suit against the Invisible Empire Klan, which in
1979 attacked a group of peaceful civil rights marchers in Decatur,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the center won a $7 million verdict for the mother of
Michael Donald, a black youth who had been lynched by members of
the United Klans of America in Mobile, Ala. The group was forced to
turn its headquarters over to the victim's mother, and two Klansmen
were convicted of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the center won a large verdict against Klan groups and
members for an assault on peaceful civil rights marchers in Forsyth
County, Ga., on Jan. 17, 1987. The Invisible Empire, the major Klan
defendant, was forced to disband, and the group's office equipment
went to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the center also sued Tom and John Metzger, founders
of a group called the White Aryan Resistance, in 1990 after
skinhead followers of theirs from Portland, Ore., killed Mulugeta
Seraw, an Ethiopian student. A jury awarded the victim's family
$12.5 million.

CLINTON'S VISIT TO COLOMBIA SAID TO HERALD NEW ERA IN TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ President Clinton is about to raise the
curtain on a new era in United States-Colombian relations with a
visit to this Caribbean port on Wednesday, and the acts that follow
will probably include shooting at Marxist guerrillas by
American-supplied helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is all the more important because it comes at a time
when the government here has been weakened politically,
administration officials say. It has lost control of nearly half of
its territory to several guerrilla groups and to the drug
traffickers the guerrillas are protecting.
</P>
<P>
   In Cartagena, Clinton will visit a new U.S.-financed community
justice center, walk the stone streets of the walled colonial
center to greet pedestrians, give encouraging handshakes to
Colombian customs officials and offer condolences to the widows of
policemen who have died in combat with the rebels who make money
off the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The series of burnished photo ops, along with a private meeting
with President Andres Pastrana, will symbolize a dramatic departure
from a relationship with Colombia that has been cool, if not
hostile, in recent years. Only three years ago, the previous
Colombian president could not get a U.S. visa because there was
evidence that he received a campaign contribution from the Cali
drug cartel. Anti-narcotics aid was funneled to the police rather
than the army because army officers had protected leaders of the
Medellin drug cartel in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Such embarrassing official ties to the cocaine and heroin trade
were a major reason why no United States president has set foot on
Colombian soil in nearly 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton will break that dry spell with his seven-hour stop
here, along with the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, a Republican,
and other senior members of Congress from both parties. In so
doing, senior United States officials say, Clinton and high-level
Republicans will demonstrate that they are ready to shed old
concerns and embrace Colombia well into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia has become a first-tier foreign policy issue, and
this trip will show that,'' said Arturo Valenzuela, the top Latin
America analyst for Clinton's National Security Council. ``The
president wants to make sure that the bipartisan consensus on
Colombia that has developed in the last months of his
administration continues on after he leaves office.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trip's brevity, Colombian officials are placing
great symbolic importance on the event since it is the kickoff of
their $7.5 billion ``Plan Colombia.'' The plan is intended to
strengthen the central government's presence throughout the
provinces with better courts, aid to peasants displaced by the
fighting and alternative development projects for farmers dependent
on growing coca.
</P>
<P>
   The United States part of the plan is a new $1.3 billion aid
program recently approved by Congress; it includes 60 military
helicopters and training for a new anti-narcotics army brigade to
support police efforts in eradicating coca fields that are
spreading across southern Colombia behind guerrilla lines. On
Tuesday, Clinton waived several human rights conditions put on the
aid program by Congress, declaring Colombia a national security
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moment to display our new alliance,'' Colombia's
foreign minister, Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, said in an interview
last week. ``This visit will show that we have passed from one era
in which the United States did not recognize the dimensions of
Colombia's problems into another in which the United States is
ready to put teeth into an effort that we must make together.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials have told the White House that Pastrana
would like a strong public endorsement from Clinton for Pastrana's
stalled efforts to negotiate a settlement with two guerrilla
groups, which have bred skepticism among the army and business
elite. He will also press for special trade agreements to help
Colombia's ailing textile industry and an exception for Cartagena
in the State Department's warning that it is dangerous for American
tourists to travel in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   For United States officials, the visit will highlight for the
American public the importance of helping South America's second
largest country to fight a drug trade that produces 90 percent of
the cocaine and about a quarter of the heroin that enter the United
States. American officials hope to underscore that Pastrana, a
Conservative Party leader who took office two years ago, is making
a strong effort to break with the corruption of the last president,
Ernesto Samper, a Liberal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has steadily increased its anti-narcotics
assistance to Colombia during Clinton's second term, from $65
million in 1996 to $300 million this year. But even though aerial
spraying to kill coca crops has increased, coca cultivation
mushroomed by 20 percent in 1999, after a 28 percent increase in
1998, according to a recent State Department report.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in Colombian coca cultivation came as Peru and
Bolivia pressed largely successful campaigns to eradicate
cultivation and arrest major traffickers. In the past, those
countries provided most of the coca leaves and cocaine base, though
it was shipped to Colombia for final processing and shipment to the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian coca growers have been pushing their plantings deeper
into the Amazonian jungles, causing severe deforestation and
raising concern in Brazil that it is only a matter of time before
they press into its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Success in the so-called war on drugs is often fleeting, and the
deepening United States role in Colombia is not without risks,
especially if the guerrillas decide to shoot at the United
States-supplied helicopters or military trainers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Clinton administration's experience in Colombia so
far is that any escalation is bound to have unpredictable
consequences. After the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA
helped the Colombian police break up the Cali drug cartel in the
mid 1990s with arrests of its top leaders, smaller trafficking
organizations took its place, and the flow of cocaine continued
unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Those smaller organizations sought the protection of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest rebel
group. United States and Colombian officials say the drug
operations have paid the rebel group hundreds of millions of
dollars in protection money. The guerrillas call the payments war
taxes, which they say they levy on all businesses that operate in
areas they control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will press Pastrana to complement the new military
anti-narcotics offensive against those groups in the south with
civilian aid programs to avert a refugee problem that could add
fighters to the guerrilla ranks and spread the conflict to
neighboring countries. American officials say Clinton will
emphasize the importance of holding local elections in the southern
provinces, improving the human rights record of the armed forces,
providing jobs for refugees and promoting alternative development
projects for peasants who currently grow coca.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton wants to put his arm around President
Pastrana's shoulder and demonstrate our support,'' said Peter
Romero, acting assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, ``but also our expectations that a lot of work needs to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government has a large security presence in
Cartagena to protect the two presidents and their large cabinet and
congressional delegations. Local press reports say that at least
5,500 troops and police officers will be here, and army units will
guard the periphery of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has 4 navy frigates and 18 patrol boats in the waters
surrounding Cartagena, and six military helicopters will patrol the
skies over the Clinton delegation. Twelve police roadblocks are
checking cars entering the city, and travelers flying into the
airport in the last several days were obliged to undergo computer
checks of their names and passports in a system that includes
Interpol and FBI software.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover police officers are patrolling the streets, and
electronic cameras and high-powered microphones have been placed
atop buildings for surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The Army of National Liberation, Colombia's second largest rebel
group, said it would step up attacks on highway transportation in
response to the Clinton visit. The larger rebel group has promised
not to interfere with the visit, even while sharply criticizing the
growing American role here.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Cano, a senior commander of the group, told Colombian
reporters that Clinton ``will carry suitcases full of the dollars
necessary for Colombians to continue killing each other
indefinitely.'' He added, ``That's why he is not welcome.''

   By their own admission, the Dallas Cowboys broke summer camp
with no one who could replace Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys drafted three cornerbacks, hoping one or two might
become suitable replacements. Six days before the season opener,
the Cowboys made another move to strengthen the position.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks signed with
the Cowboys on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Sparks on the 53-man roster, the Cowboys
released veteran linebacker Chris Bordano.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Ryan McNeil and fourth-round rookie Kareem Larrimore
will be the starting corners when the season opens Sunday at Texas
Stadium against Philadelphia. Sparks will play in nickel situations
and could replace Larrimore as a starter if the rookie has early
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, 31, played eight seasons with the Giants after being
drafted from Arizona State in 1992. After the 1999 season, he told
friends he would retire, and was not part of any team's roster in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks intercepted 22 passes with the Giants, one last season. A
physical player, Sparks recorded at least 50 tackles in each of the
last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not been impressed with their cornerbacks after
Sanders moved to Washington and Kevin Smith retired. McNeil,
formerly with St. Louis and Cleveland, has been the most effective
newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore outplayed rookie teammates Dwayne Goodrich and Mario
Edwards in camp. Goodrich and Edwards have missed the last three
weeks with assorted injuries. Veteran Charlie Williams has not
played since having arthroscopic knee surgery.

SCOUTS LOSE FINANCIAL AND MORAL SUPPORT SINCE RULING ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Mass., Conn., R.I., N.J.)   (SUBS to replace San Diego with San Francisco in in 2nd
sentence.)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the two months since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Boy Scouts of America have a constitutional right to exclude gays,
corporate and governmental support for the organization has slipped
markedly.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., have told local
Scout troops that they can no longer use parks, schools and other
municipal sites. Companies like Chase Manhattan Bank and Textron
Inc. have withdrawn hundreds of thousands of dollars in support to
local and national scouting groups nationwide. Dozens of United
Ways from Massachusetts to San Francisco have cut off money.
</P>
<P>
   And one state, Connecticut, in what may prove to be a test case,
has banned contributions to the Scouts by state employees through a
state-run charity. In addition, the state is considering whether to
block the Scouts from using public campgrounds or buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a watershed issue,'' said C. Joan Parker, assistant
counsel to the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities, which must issue a ruling by Nov. 8 on whether the
Scouts violate state antidiscrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission rules that the group does violate those laws,
the Boy Scouts would be prevented from using any public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide, Are we aiding and abetting someone that
discriminates?'' Parker said. ``Clearly, any public entity needs to
have clean hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Shields, a national spokesman for the Scouts, said the
organization respected the right of private companies to donate
only to groups of their choice. But the organization is suing the
state of Connecticut to restore state employees' ability to donate
to the Scouts, and Shields said his group would fight to maintain
access to public schools and public places in other states as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts of America since 1910 have taught traditional
family values,'' Shields said. ``We feel that an avowed homosexual
isn't a role model for those values.''
</P>
<P>
   For public and private officials around the country, the problem
is a complex and painful one. On the one hand, they do not want to
cut off valuable opportunities for the young or run afoul of First
Amendment principles. On the other hand, by allowing a group that
bans gays to use public facilities, and by supporting it, they
violate their antidiscrimination statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The trim uniform of the Boy Scouts has become almost a cherished
national symbol. But at a time when same-sex benefits, diversity
training and nondiscrimination policies have become routine, some
companies and organizations say the Scouts' refusal to admit gays
has come to seem almost un-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their position is, on the face of it, in conflict with our
commitment and our values on diversity,'' said Jim Finn, a
spokesman for Chase, which had contributed about $200,000 annually
to the Boy Scouts until stopping it last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in June by a 5-4 vote that the
organization had a constitutional right to exclude gays because
opposition to homosexuality is part of the organization's
``expressive message.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling last year by the New Jersey
Supreme Court that applied the state's law against discrimination
in public accommodations to require a New Jersey Scout troop to
readmit a longtime member and assistant scoutmaster, James Dale,
whom it had dismissed after learning he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling did not address the merits of the ban on gays,
only whether the Boy Scouts is a private group, and so has the
right to set its own membership rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts, whose membership has grown to 6.2 million, said that
the group's charter since 1910 had promoted ``family values,'' and
that its oath pledged a ``morally straight'' life. A homosexual,
the organization said, is not the proper role model for those
values.
</P>
<P>
   While the decisions to withhold support will not seriously dent
the $125 million raised annually by the Scouts national
organization, the growing effort to block local chapters from
meeting in places like public schools and state campgrounds raises
practical problems for the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ruling, many public bodies, charities and companies,
including Merrill Lynch, are beginning the discussion that has
taken place in Hartford, Conn. The options, they say, are equally
unpleasant: hurting children who are benefiting from scouting, or
supporting a position they find ethically untenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we just cut off funding, and so hundreds of kids in
Hartford aren't getting a program they so desperately need?'' asked
Susan Dunn, senior vice president of the United Way of the Capital
Area. ``Our mission is to serve our community, especially children.
But it's also in our mission that we don't discriminate. That's
where it becomes difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the
city of San Diego on Monday asking a federal court to revoke a
50-year-old agreement that lets the Scouts lease 18 acres of
parkland for $1 a year. The lease is set to expire in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   In Fall River, Mass., the executive director of the local United
Way, Bob Horne, said he was stunned at how swiftly and strongly his
board had acted to cut support to any Scout troops that did not
sign a form saying they would not endorse the Scouts' ban on gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that some people would try to skirt the issue,''
Horne said. ``But attendance was unbelievable, the best attendance
we've had all year. It could not have been a more unanimous,
enthusiastic vote. Obviously, there was concern for the kids, but
it all came down to, we really have an obligation to do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the people of Fall River, an old mill city, have
Portuguese immigrants in their background, and an influx of
Cambodians has occurred in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those growing groups,'' Horne said, ``people are being
more aware of diversity and doing things right and being fair and
not setting up separate views, the idea that people are people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People felt very strongly that we should take this step. I
didn't get the feeling there was anyone who didn't want to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who are eliminating or reconsidering their support are
trying to respect, as the Supreme Court affirmed, the Scouts' right
to set its own mission.
</P>
<P>
   And cutting off money or access to one private group raises more
questions, officials say. Do those same charities then cut off
financing to groups chartered to serve, say, Latinos? Do states
stop allowing Roman Catholic youth groups to use public campgrounds
or school meeting rooms because the church does not ordain gays?
</P>
<P>
   ``If a group has in its charter that they're set up to serve
women,'' Dunn asked, ``is that discrimination?''
</P>
<P>
   Among those debating whether to end support, some are reluctant
to do so because they believe the local Scout chapters do not agree
with the ban on gays, which was put into effect by the national
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows their work with kids is good, and it's a policy
that's not commonly enforced,'' said Marty Milkovic, executive
director of the United Way of Northern Fairfield County, in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Like chapters in many other cities, the Southeastern New England
United Way in Providence, R.I., has said it will require any Scout
council to sign a form saying it will not discriminate. But the Boy
Scouts' Narragansett Council, which receives $200,000 from the
United Way, has said it must abide by the national policy. And
Shields, the spokesman for the national group, said local councils
were not allowed to disavow any part of the national charter, so
the councils are not allowed to sign any nondiscrimination policy
that would require them to admit gays. Troops that disobey the
national charter could face eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Within the local councils, though, there is increasing dissent
from the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting for All, a group started by a 15-year-old scout in
California, which advocates opening up the organization to gays,
held a national protest day outside Boy Scout headquarters in
several cities last week. In Montclair, N.J., parents in a local
Cub Scout troop are signing a petition saying they do not endorse
the national policy.
</P>
<P>
   In New Milford, Conn., Gale Alexander said he and his wife were
torn about whether to allow their 9-year-old son to remain in the
Boy Scouts. They like the skills and self-confidence the program
has taught, but at the same time, Alexander said, ``I couldn't look
at my friends if I couldn't stand up and say this is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   So as a compromise, the Alexanders are letting their son
continue scouting, but they have decided to become vocal in their
opposition to the policy. In conversations, they have discovered
that other parents do not agree with it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that all the rank and file is just fine with this is
just a bunch of malarkey,'' Alexander said. ``It's time now for
parents to speak up and say, I don't agree with it. It's time for
people to start fighting from within.''

   TALLAHASSEE _ Launching his strongest single-issue offensive
since becoming the official Democratic nominee, Vice President Al
Gore pledged Monday to provide prescription drug coverage for all
senior citizens, lambasting pharmaceutical companies for rocketing
prices and chiding the Bush campaign for not offering its own plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aimed his message squarely at the 39 million elderly
covered by Medicare, a political bloc that turns out in huge
numbers on Election Day. And he made his target obvious, embarking
on a weeklong health-care tour with a trip to Florida, where he
addressed senior citizens and staged a photo-op with two arthritis
sufferers in a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to the point where we can improve Medicare by
giving a prescription drug benefit to every single senior in this
country,'' Gore said before diving into a 20-minute monologue on
the details of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the familiar message was not simply that Gore had seized the
upper hand on health care _ which his campaign, buoyed by good poll
numbers and favorable press, believes he has. The strategy also
indicated that Gore views health care as his opponent's greatest
weakness, and hopes it will serve as his Achilles' heel as the
campaign heads into the critical Labor Day stretch.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who had hoped to spend this week discussing his
education programs, was forced again Monday to defend his position
on prescription drug coverage, promising to reveal more details of
his plan next week. The Texas governor also defended what he has
said about health care thus far, saying he had ``laid the framework
for reform'' by supporting a bi-partisan plan by Senators Bill
Frist and John Breaux to overhaul Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important for me; this is an important issue,'' Bush
said at a press conference at the Texas governor's mansion intended
to focus on education.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, Gore had already given his opponent a stinging
rebuke, outlining their differences on health care more starkly
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of 150 seniors invited to a
question-and-answer session at Florida State University, Gore said
he was ``not going to say a single negative personal thing'' about
Bush. Still, he said, ``A campaign is also a contest, and I invite
you to look at what is said on the other side, and I'll let them
speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve a detailed, adult, intelligent discussion of
exactly what the specifics are of the plans that we are
proposing,'' Gore said. ``When the other side gets around to
proposing a specific plan, then we can compare it and contrast
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the prescription drug plan laid out by the vice president,
Medicare recipients who earn less than $11,500 a year would have
all of their co-payments and premiums taken care of. The package
would cost $253 billion over 10 years, Gore aides said. Gore also
took on the pharmaceutical firms, calling for ``more competition
for the big drug companies,'' as he accused them of wielding undue
influence on Capitol Hill to secure monopoly rights over certain
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides criticized the Gore plan as inefficient and bulky,
deriding it as a version of ``Hillarycare,'' the national
health-care program proposed by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
in 1993 and later rejected. Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush,
said the Gore plan would still force some seniors to pay $625
annually in premiums and co-payments for prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is trying to do for prescription drugs what Hillary
Clinton tried to do for health care, and that's have government
control of drugs,'' said Bush's communications director, Karen
Hughes. ``He would have the federal government be the nation's
pharmacy for senior citizens. Senior citizens don't want that. They
want more options. They want more choices.''
</P>
<P>
   To blunt that line of attack, Gore put two senior citizens in
the spotlight, using the examples of Myrtle Jennings, 82, and Eddie
Barrington, 80, to draw a larger conclusion about prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president publicly greeted the pair, both arthritis
sufferers, in a family pharmacy here that often subsidizes seniors
who cannot afford all their medicine. On bended knee before
Jennings, a Tallahassee resident who sometimes chooses between
prescriptions because she cannot afford them all, Gore raised a
litany of concerns. Was it true that many seniors pay as much as
$200 a month for drugs? Were some drugs in fact cheaper at the
vetinarian than at the pharmacy? The pharmacist nodded yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty bad, when you've got to pretend to be a dog or a
cat to get a price break,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore aides disputed the calculations made by the Bush
campaign about the vice president's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee also upped the ante Monday,
announcing a new TV ad focusing on prescription drugs. The ads will
begin Tuesday in nine states, in response to an ad campaign
launched by the Republican National Committee that criticizes the
Gore plan. Bush is also running an ad in several states pledging to
reform Medicare and Social Security without reducing any benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a TV appearance on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Gore
mocked his Republican counterparts for the expenditure. ``On the
other side, I think they could best serve the American people not
with a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign about a nonexistent
plan but rather by presenting specifics so the American people can
make a judgment for themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was scheduled to fly to New Mexico, where he will promote
children's health care. He then plans to travel to Oregon and
Washington before returning to Washington on Thursday night.

FINAL CHAPTER IN ATTICA UPRISING: SETTLEMENT DIVISION CAPS LONG
LEGAL BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story will be expanded) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Declaring that the inmates who were beaten and
tortured during the 1971 Attica prison uprising were
``dehumanized'' and treated ``like garbage,'' a federal judge
divided up an $8 million settlement on Monday to compensate more
than 500 inmates and relatives for the abuse prisoners suffered at
the hands of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   The allotment of the landmark settlement caps one of the longest
and most ignominious chapters in American criminal justice history,
fleshing out a deal reached in January between New York State and
lawyers representing 1,281 former inmates.
</P>
<P>
   At more than 200 pages, the settlement filed on Monday reads
like a harrowing encyclopedia of personal anecdotes, incorporating
months of testimony from nearly 200 former inmates who stood before
U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca here and recounted how the
uprising and siege at the western New York prison left 43 people
dead, 80 wounded and countless more scarred psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, which range from $6,500 to $125,000 per former
inmate, were ``modest,'' according to Telesca's decision. And many
of the inmates and their lawyers, agreed, adding that no amount of
money could compensate them or resolve an episode that has become a
dubious symbol of prison life and state-sanctioned brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it is history does not mean it is all in the
past,'' Telesca wrote. ``Indeed, Attica is the ghost that has never
stopped haunting its survivors _ both the inmates and the families
of the deceased guards and prison personnel. But at least the
settlement of this case provides the basis for the former inmates
to close the book on the past and to focus on the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the judge devoted the bulk of his decision to
short but powerful summaries of each inmate's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Frank B.B. Smith, for instance, was stripped naked, pelted with
hot and spent shell casings and threatened with castration, during
the uprising. He was awarded $125,000 _ the highest amount.
</P>
<P>
   For George ``Che'' Nieves, Attica was primarily a nightmare of
the mind. Like so many others, he was punched, beaten and forced to
crawl in the mud. But what still unsettles him is the memory of a
guard drawing a giant ``X'' on his back as if marking him as a
target in what one state prosecutor described as a ``turkey
shoot.'' He received $6,500 _ the lowest amount.
</P>
<P>
   For Josh Melville, Attica was simply the haunted place where his
father, Samuel, was fatally shot. So he traveled from Florida to
Rochester to introduce a forensic ballistic report and photos to
bolster his claim that his father was murdered. He was awarded
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   There was no celebration following Monday's settlement order.
Smith was the only former inmate who attended a news conference
organized by several of the former inmates' lawyers _ and that is
because he now works as a paralegal with Elizabeth Fink, the
principal lawyer, on prisoners' rights cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money; money would not compensate if it was
$125 million,'' Smith said. ``I want everybody to concentrate,
everybody, on what happened at Attica and how we can prevent
that.''

INTERNET MUSIC COMPANY CEO DEFENDS COMPANY AS RESPECTING
COPYRIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of MP3.com, the internet music company, told
a federal judge in Manhattan Monday that he believed he was acting
legally when he created a Web-based database of thousands of
copyrighted record albums.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com is facing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in
damages for copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony from MP3.com's chief executive, Michael Robertson,
marked the first day of hearings in a trial pitting the San
Diego-based startup against Seagram Co.'s Universal Music Group,
the world's largest record company, after negotiations this weekend
failed to produce a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case already has ruled that MP3.com infringed
Universal's copyrights, but the size of the damages in the case
will depend on whether the court determines the action was
``willful.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal and four other major record companies sued MP3.com in
January, but the other companies have since settled. In the
original suit, the companies asserted the MP3.com violated their
copyrights with the creation of the service called My.Mp3.com.
</P>
<P>
   The service created an ``online locker,'' permitting users to
store their music albums centrally on MP3.com's computers, then get
access to them through various digital devices, such as computers,
or portable music players.
</P>
<P>
   To make the service easy to use, MP3.com did not require users
to load their own music into the virtual lockers. Rather, a user
had merely to insert a copy of the music into the CD-ROM drive of a
computer, at which point, MP3.com would verify that the person had
possession of a CD, then the company would automatically put a copy
of the music into the person's virtual locker.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com amassed 65,000 albums to create the database from which
it drew its music.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lawsuit by the record companies asserted the
MP3.com had violated copyrights by creating the digital database of
albums to which they held the copyrights. In April, U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff ruled that MP3.com had infringed companies'
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing months, MP3.com reached settlements with four of
the record companies, including Sony Music, Time Warner, EMI Group
and Bertelsmann. Details of the settlements were not made public,
but analysts estimated the company paid $20 million to each
company.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Scheier, an industry analyst with Forrester Research,
speculated that Universal has not yet settled for two possible
reasons: as the biggest record company it wants a larger
settlement; or because it has intentions to launch a competing
service with My.Mp3.com and does not want to license its music
content to MP3.com, a condition of the MP3.com's settlement with
the other record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Universal may not want to license music to ``MP3.com or more
generally to anybody they don't feel they can control or express a
lot of authority over about what kind of business models are going
to be used,'' Scheier said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Universal Music Group declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Universal is an investor in MusicBank, a company that has said
it plans to launch a virtual locker music business sometime in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's hearing, Robertson told the court he believed the
My.mp3.com service was respectful of the record companies'
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I had looked at suggested this was illegal use or a
copyright violation,'' he said, according to a report by the Dow
Jones news service.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, which is scheduled to continue through Thursday,
will provide the basis for Rakoff to assess damages against
MP3.com. People close to the trial said that if the judge decides
the action was willful, MP3.com could face damage payments of
between $750 and $150,000 for each album infringed.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge finds the conduct not willful, the damages could
range from $750 to $30,000. People familiar with the case said that
MP3.com's database included roughly 10,000 albums with copyrights
owned by Universal.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com in May suspended the My.mp3.com service, which it said
had roughly 500,000 participants.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing comes as the music industry continues to fight on
other legal fronts, notably in its battle against Napster, a
popular service that permits individual users to exchange music
files online. It is a practice the music industry asserts amounts
the theft. The industry's case against Napster is being tried in
federal court in San Francisco.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Women's rights groups across Mexico celebrated a
victory Monday against resurgent efforts by conservative
politicians and church leaders who had sought to chip away at
already-limited rights to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest battle was fought in the central state of Guanajuato
where the legislature passed a bill this month that would have made
the state the only one in Mexico to extend the ban on abortions to
cases of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread Monday that the governor would send the bill back to
the state congress for further study; the action amounts to a veto,
his aides said. The current legislature lacks enough votes to
overturn a veto. The governor, Ramon Martin Huerta, is to announce
the decision on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators of the conservative National Action Party narrowly
passed the measure, inciting furious protests across Mexico by
activists who worried that the measure would move Mexico a step
closer to making all abortions illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also provoked left-wing legislators in the local
government in the nation's capital to pass legislation that
expanded abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion laws differ from state to state in Mexico. But in all
31 states and the Federal District of Mexico City, abortion is
generally illegal except in cases of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Several other states also permit abortion when pregnancy puts
the mother's life at risk, when the fetus appears to suffer serious
malformations and when a woman has been artificially inseminated
without her knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In the most liberal exception, women in the southern state of
Yucatan with at least three children can have legal abortions if
they are financially strapped.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the measure in Guanajuato say it was the most
alarming example of how the Roman Catholic Church and its
right-wing allies in the National Action Party, known as PAN, have
been politically energized by the election of Vicente Fox, a native
of that state and a Catholic; he becomes president on Mexico in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for all women in Mexico and a warning to
the PAN,'' said Veronica Cruz Sanchez, 29, who coordinated weeks of
protests that helped defeat the abortion measure. ``In just a few
months, they will hold the office of the presidency, and now it
should be clear that they cannot impose their will on the people.''
</P>
<P>
   While the overwhelming majority of Mexicans call themselves
Catholics, the intellectual and the middle class have historically
been guardedly secular in their politics. After the revolution at
the turn of the last century, the Mexican government passed some of
the toughest anti-church laws in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Religious schools were closed; foreign priests were deported;
church property was seized; and Mexican priests were prohibited
from voting or even wearing religious garb in public.
</P>
<P>
   Although the laws were not always strictly enforced, they served
to limit the Catholic Church's involvement in politics. Then in
1992, under the leadership of Mexican President Carlos Salinas, the
government amended the constitution to repeal those restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, said the church historian Martaelena Negrete, church
leaders have become increasingly outspoken and active.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks after Fox, a divorcee, was elected, a Catholic
newsletter, Nuevo Criterio, urged him to stand as a moral example
to the country and reconcile with his ex-wife or vow never to
remarry.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Cardinal Norberto Rivera condoned the actions of
two vandals who destroyed a drawing called La Patrona on display at
an exhibit in Guadalajara; it portrayed the Virgin of Guadalupe as
a naked blonde bombshell. Rivera called the drawing an insult to
Catholics and insisted that the church had to defend itself against
all forms of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, formerly the governor of Guanajuato, has tried not to get
pulled into the political storm in his home state by restating
campaign pledges not to initiate any changes in the abortion laws
after he takes office, even though he opposes abortion. And, he
promised not to meddle in the decisions of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But those favoring looser restrictions on abortions called the
statements troubling doublespeak that emboldened the most
conservative sectors of the National Action Party. By refusing to
speak out for or against the proposals, they worry, conservative
forces within the PAN feel that they have tacit approval to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the things that most worried us when Mr. Fox
was elected,'' said Susana Vidales, a spokeswoman for a
reproductive rights group called GIRE. ``Fox may have different
feelings than the ones expressed by the legislators in Guanajuato,
but we knew the most conservative sectors of his party would feel
that his triumph was theirs. And groups supported by the church
have been empowered.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the importance of the measure, a PAN legislator
who helped pass it said her party's ideology called for protecting
the lives of unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that a woman who has been raped has suffered a
great trauma,'' said the legislator, Angelica Patricia Flores.
``What we are trying to prevent is that she suffer another one by
having an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, newspapers have been filled with comments from
bishops and priests across the country in support of the measure.
In Mexico City on Sunday, as word began to leak that the governor
would not sign the measure, Rivera said during his homily: ``Even
in the case of a pregnancy that is the result of rape, we must ask
the woman to accept the mysterious designs of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments have stirred furious reactions from women's rights
activists. And last week, the socially liberal mayor of Mexico City
signed legislation that legalized abortions in the capital in cases
where the mother's life was in danger and the fetus showed serious
malformations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely no one has indicated they are in favor of abortion,
much less as a family planning measure,'' said Mexico City Mayor
Rosario Robles of the Democratic Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fight is against death, against the deaths of thousands of
women,'' she said, referring to deaths resulting from abortions
performed by unlicensed and untrained practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop Jose G. Martin Rabago, the bishop of Guanajuato's
industrial capital Leon, said in a recent interview: ``There has
been a new, clearer consciousness within the church that it has the
right to express itself. And so it has changed from a church that
was timid, even silent, to one that makes its opinions known.''

 &HT;    Cowboys sign Sparks in effort to improve at cornerback
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By their own admission, the Dallas Cowboys broke summer camp
with no one who could replace Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys drafted three cornerbacks, hoping one or two might
become suitable replacements. Six days before the season opener,
the Cowboys made another move to strengthen the position.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks signed with
the Cowboys on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Sparks on the 53-man roster, the Cowboys
released veteran linebacker Chris Bordano.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Ryan McNeil and fourth-round rookie Kareem Larrimore
will be the starting corners when the season opens Sunday at Texas
Stadium against Philadelphia. Sparks will play in nickel situations
and could replace Larrimore as a starter if the rookie has early
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, 31, played eight seasons with the Giants after being
drafted from Arizona State in 1992. After the 1999 season, he told
friends he would retire, and was not part of any team's roster in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks intercepted 22 passes with the Giants, one last season. A
physical player, Sparks recorded at least 50 tackles in each of the
last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not been impressed with their cornerbacks after
Sanders moved to Washington and Kevin Smith retired. McNeil,
formerly with St. Louis and Cleveland, has been the most effective
newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore outplayed rookie teammates Dwayne Goodrich and Mario
Edwards in camp. Goodrich and Edwards have missed the last three
weeks with assorted injuries. Veteran Charlie Williams has not
played since having arthroscopic knee surgery.

 &HT;    Gore touts prescription drug plan as he campaigns in Florida
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ This week is health-care week for the Gore
campaign. And on Monday, returning to Florida's capital for the
second visit in six months, the vice president kicked it off with a
town-hall discussion of his plan for dealing with the high costs of
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wasn't about to concede the spotlight
on his home turf. So two hours before Air Force II touched down at
Tallahassee Regional Airport, Bush changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where has the vice president been on the issue of education?''
he asked, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with state regent Steve
Uhlfelder, a Democrat, and several Florida teachers, principals and
</P>
<P>
   other educators. Compare the education record of his brother,
the Texas governor, he urged, with 7 1/2 years of ``squandered
opportunities of Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The George W. Bush camp hadn't planned a Florida campaign talk
on education this week. But that changed over the weekend, ``right
about when we found out the vice president was coming,'' Florida's
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential election is months away. Not even Labor Day has
passed. But the fight for Florida continues to heat up. There are
25 electoral votes at stake, nearly 10 percent of the total needed
to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is a state where I'm going to fight hard with
everything I've got right up to the night of the election. I'm not
taking a single state or single vote for granted, and I'm not
writing any state off,'' Gore said. ``I mean, there are probably a
few that are Republican, I'll have to admit, but Florida is not in
that category.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gore is pinning his hopes on health care. Over the
weekend, Bush running-mate Dick Cheney conceded his team had no
detailed plan yet of how to pay for prescription drug benefits _ a
fact Gore revisited Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve a detailed, adult, intelligent discussion,'' he
told 200 senior citizens who were bused from Tallahassee area
retirement communities to the forum at a Florida State University
building. ``When the other side gets around to proposing (one), you
can compare and contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long discussion, Gore praised the substantial
advancements in drug treatments in the past 20 years, but said the
problem now is how to make those treatments affordable, especially
for seniors on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a voluntary prescription drug plan under
Medicare that would cover all drug costs for recipients with
incomes of about $12,000 a year. Medicare recipients making more
would have to cover half the cost of their drugs up to $5,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore believes that would help elderly patients such as
77-year-old Arthur Flatt. ``Every time we turn around, we get
sick,'' Flatt told Gore. With ailments including a bad heart, he
pays $225 a month for medications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, unable to afford a full-time nurse, Flatt and his wife
also care for their 48-year-old son, George, who is 6-feet-2 and
severely disabled. With Gore's prescription drug plan, ``we'd have
more money to have somebody come in and help us, even one day a
week,'' Flatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Dixie, 74, told Gore that since she can't afford all the
medicine she needs, she takes some, but not others. No longer does
she get arthritis medicine. ``I think I can handle the pain,''
Dixie said, ``But there are a lot of people who can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also spoke from personal experience, talking about his
mother-in-law, who lives with his family. To treat her arthritis,
doctors prescribed a drug, lodine, that cost $108 a month, he said.
The same drug was prescribed for the family's 14-year-old black
Labrador at $38 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty bad when you have got to pretend to be a dog or
a cat to get a price break,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at the town-hall style meeting was sold, though.
``It's one thing to say things; it's another to make them happen,''
said Karen Pinney, administrator at the Woodmont Assisted Living
Facility in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would cost $253 billion over 10 years. ``We need to
give a lot of thought over the next 10 weeks as to what we want to
use the surplus for,'' Gore said, chiding the Bush plan for tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He also slammed pharmaceutical companies for stifling
competition and therefore keeping drug costs high.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded by trying to tie Gore to the one man
he seeks distance from: President Clinton. ``Al Gore today is
proposing a nationalized drug plan that makes the federal
government the dispenser of drugs for seniors, similar to Hillary
Clinton's attempt to nationalize heath care in 1993,'' said Bush
spokesman Dan Bartlett in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is also running television ads
touting the Bush prescription drug plan, which relies largely on
one proposed by a bipartisan congressional commission. Those ads
will run in nine states; Florida is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with local Democratic candidates and supporters,
Gore left about 6 p.m. for the next stop on his four-day tour, in
New Mexico. His wife, Tipper, who came with him to Tallahassee,
will stay in Florida today, with campaign stops planned for
Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will probably visit Florida two or three more times before
Election Day, including the swing-voter-rich middle part of the
state between Tampa and Daytona Beach, said Sen. Ron Klein, D-Boca
Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're welcoming Vice President Gore back to the state,'' Gov.
Jeb Bush said before Gore's arrival Monday. ``And we're taking
Florida very seriously.''

MARKETPLACE: STOCK OPTIONS COSTING COMPANIES MORE THAN ACCOUNTING
SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is one of the prettiest lies in corporate America.
Stock options dispensed to executives and workers are not accounted
for as an employee expense, even though they clearly are.
</P>
<P>
   So companies that reward their employees with stock options do
not include the costs of those programs in their overall expenses,
giving their earnings a boost.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the stock market rose, few investors seemed to care
that corporate earnings were overstated. But now with the stock
market mostly moving sideways, perhaps they will begin to notice
what option programs really cost them in the way of lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Pat McConnell, a senior managing director and head of the
accounting and tax group in equity research at Bear, Stearns, has
completed a comprehensive study examining how earnings at the
companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index would fare if
employee stock option grants were accounted for as an expense.
</P>
<P>
   Given that option mania has swept the country, it is not
surprising that McConnell finds that options had a bigger, and more
negative impact on corporate earnings last year than ever. Net
income at the S &AMP; P 500 companies, which totaled $51.68 a share in
1999, would have been 6 percent lower if options were accounted for
as an expense, she said. This compares with a 4 percent reduction
in 1998 and a 3 percent hit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the jump is that last year was the first year in
which company financial statements reflected the full impact of
some stock option programs. The Financial Accounting Standards
Board requires companies to include in the footnotes to their
financial statements the effects of options granted in fiscal years
beginning after Dec. 15, 1994. Because many companies' plans allow
employees' options to vest in five years or less, last year was the
first in which the full effect of some of those plans appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rule makers recommend that companies charge the fair
value of options granted to employees as a compensation expense,
but they do not require it. If companies do not run the costs of
options through their profit and loss statements, they must
disclose in a footnote in their annual reports what net income and
per-share earnings would have been had the cost of stock options
been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies choose the latter approach. In fact, McConnell
identified only two of the 500 companies in the S&AMP;P index that
account for options as a cost: Boeing and Winn-Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the larger the option grants, the bigger the cost to
a company's earnings. McConnell found four industry groups in the S
&AMP; P 500 whose earnings would have declined 10 percent or more in
each of the last three years if option grants were counted as an
expense. Companies in the business of health care services would
have shown a 38 percent decline in earnings last year; computer
networking concerns, 24 percent; commercial and consumer services
companies, 21 percent; and communications equipment makers, 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at 122 companies _ almost one quarter of the stocks in
the index _ declined more than 10 percent last year when stock
options were accounted for as an expense. That compares with 79
companies showing such declines in 1998 and 61 companies in 1997,
McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   But earnings at 21 companies fell by more than half when
adjusted for stock options. These included McDermott International,
an oil services company; Yahoo, the Internet company; Autodesk, a
computer software designer; Polaroid; and Palm.
</P>
<P>
   Even more compelling, 12 companies that had an operating profit
in 1999 would have had an operating loss if stock options were
considered an expense. For instance, the $6 million in operating
income that Micron Technology made last year would have been an
operating loss of $120 million. Grant Jones, a Micron spokesman,
said, ``We treat options in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect of stock options on corporate earnings is
decidedly negative. According to McConnell's study, the S &AMP; P's
three-year compound annual earnings growth rate dwindles from 11
percent to 9 percent when options are considered a cost. And the
compound annual growth in operating income for the S &AMP; P slows from
a three-year rate of 12 percent to 10 percent when the favorable
accounting treatment for options is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell expects the impact of options on earnings to continue
to grow in coming years. Will accounting rules ever change to
reflect the true cost of options?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in three to five years, if standard setters outside
the U.S. adopt a fair value approach for employee stock options,
then I think the U.S. will have to take another look at this,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she said she was relieved to find that the
overall impact of stock options on S &AMP; P earnings remained below 10
percent and that she believed that investors were fully aware of
the problem that stock option mania posed among technology
companies. Nevertheless, she added: ``I think it essential that
investors look at this information in making comparisons. If you
want to buy the best company in an industry, you have to take this
into consideration or you may be misled.''
</P>
<P>
   And investors need more information, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the footnote information allows you to dig in,'' she
said, ``it's not a substitute for doing the accounting correctly in
the financial statements themselves. In addition, this footnote is
only provided annually. Investors need this information more often
and sooner.''

SETTLEMENT IN DIET DRUG CASE COULD REACH $3.75 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge approved a national settlement on Monday that
covers tens of thousands of people who took fen-phen, the diet drug
combination that was sold by American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which American Home has said will cost up to
$3.75 billion, offers benefits depending on a person's injuries,
ranging from refunds for the cost of the drugs to cash payments of
more than $1 million to those harmed the most.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 people have registered so far to join the
settlement, which was approved on Monday by U.S. District Judge
Louis C. Bechtle in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement's approval does not resolve American Home's
legal problems with fen-phen. At least 45,000 people have decided
not to join the settlement and are instead pursuing separate
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, for example, hundreds of people have filed suits
against American Home, contending that the company knew the diet
drug combination could cause dangerous side effects but did not
warn consumers. And in July, an Oregon jury awarded $29.2 million
to two people who suffered heart valve damage. Weeks later that
case was settled for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, American Home said it would increase the $4.75
billion it has set aside to pay for the fen-phen litigation. The
company gave few details but said that the new money would be
``significantly less'' than the $4.75 billion already put into its
fen-phen reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the company said that Bechtle's decision ``resolves
the vast majority'' of the fen-phen claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always felt this was a fair and equitable
settlement,'' John R. Stafford, the company's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers representing fen-phen users said yesterday that
they might appeal the settlement. Many lawyers had filed papers
opposing the national settlement, saying that it was not fair and
offered too little compensation for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may get sick in the future and not be covered,''
said Edward Blizzard, a lawyer in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers chosen to represent the plaintiffs in the
national class-action case said yesterday that the settlement
covered any person who had taken the drug for more than 60 days.
Even if those people are not ill, the lawyers said, they will get
money to pay for a test to look for heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we've protected everyone,'' said Arthur Levin, a
lawyer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of prescriptions for fen-phen were written before Sept.
15, 1997, when American Home took the diet drugs off the market. A
prescription for the fen-phen combination included American Home's
Pondimin, its brand name for fenfluramine, and phentermine, another
diet drug. American Home also sold Redux, a drug discovered by
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, which was marketed as the improved
version of Pondimin.
</P>
<P>
   American Home said it had done more than a dozen clinical trials
since 1997 that showed that serious heart valve disease among
former diet drug users was rare and that the actual incidence of
heart valve damage was ``far lower'' than was suggested when the
drugs were taken off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of American Home were unchanged Monday at $54.56. In
after-hours trading, they climbed as high as $56.06.

 &HT;    Interview of Ramseys gets tense
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The first interview John and Patsy Ramsey have given
police in two years nearly crashed Monday during questioning from a
prosecutor their attorney called ``overzealous'' and ``obsessed.''
</P>
<P>
   The blowup occurred several hours into the interview with Patsy
Ramsey, when her attorney challenged several questions addressed to
her. The disagreement escalated until prosecutor Mike Kane
threatened to walk out, said Ramsey attorney Lin Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mike Kane is an overzealous, obsessed special
prosecutor who long ago lost objectivity,'' said Wood after the day
of talks at his downtown Atlanta office. He blasted Kane as intent
``on asking any question'' so he can carry on ``a fishing
expedition to find anything against this family.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kane nor Boulder, Colo., Police Chief Mark Beckner was
available for comment Monday evening. Kane, a consultant in the
case, is a Pennsylvania prosecutor hired to lead a grand jury probe
on the 1996 slaying of the Ramseys' daughter, 6-year-old beauty
queen JonBenet. The grand jury returned no indictment, but the
couple remains under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys, who moved back to metro Atlanta from Boulder
afterJonBenet's death, are voluntarily participating in the talks
expected to wrap up today. In agreeing to the interviews, the
couple say they disregarded their attorney's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to prove our innocence,'' John Ramsey told
reporters. ``We're here to find the killer of our daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monday morning session, in which Patsy Ramsey was
interviewed by Beckner, was congenial. Before heading to lunch, she
commented on the fairness of the questions, saying, ``I feel very
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the afternoon, Wood said, the two sides jousted over
several inquiries. Among other areas, Kane asked about the security
measures taken when the Ramseys' son returned to school after the
murder, and he questioned the activities of the JonBenet Ramsey
Foundation formed after the girl's death. Those questions, Wood
said, violated the vow made by Boulder police to focus on new
questions, not to rehash old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting drew about 60 news personnel _ as well as some
remarks from those watching the media gather again for the nearly
4-year-old murder mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so stupid,'' said lawyer Suzanne Hashimi. ``Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged, however, ``I keep up with this story like
everybody else.''

A BLACK WOMAN AIMS TO KEEP LAZIO'S SEAT REPUBLICAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY SHORE, N.Y. _ It was, she says, divine inspiration that cast
her into a race that could make her the first black Republican
woman ever to serve in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I am on a path that someone higher than me is
preparing me for,'' says Joan B. Johnson, 66, the elected town
clerk of Islip, who has mounted a campaign to win the Suffolk
County seat that Rep. Rick A. Lazio is giving up for his Senate
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, some earthly machination as well. Two of
Suffolk County's most powerful Republicans, the party leaders of
the county organization and the town of Islip, the largest
community, threw their support behind Johnson, a blunt-spoken
former social worker. She may lack the polish of a political pro,
party leaders reasoned, but she is a proven vote getter whose
moderate stances to the left of Lazio _ and perhaps her race and
sex _ will attract Democrats' votes in the 2nd Congressional
District, where Republicans hold only a slight edge in voter
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, one of a few black Republican women running in the
country but the one political analysts say has the best shot, finds
herself in the semi-comfortable position of blazing a trail, maybe
two, lined with obstacles. She must win a primary on Sept. 12, and
confront the possibility that, as she and her supporters concede,
some people may not vote for her, simply because of her race and
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people really thought they were going to get this
nod, mainly because here on Long Island you tend to have a
cookie-cutter type profile of what a congressperson should look
like,'' Johnson said, alluding to the Island's penchant for sending
young, white male lawyers to Washington. ``And it didn't look like
me. It's never female. And in that respect, that's the historic
piece of this. I would be the first Republican woman in either
Nassau or Suffolk Counties to ever run for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who grew up in Florida when segregation was legal and
has lived in Islip for 38 years, said the racial aspect of her
potential achievement never occurred to her until a reporter for a
political journal raised the issue, shortly after she entered the
campaign in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, my God.' First time I heard it. Never even
thought about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who teaches Bible study on Saturdays and dispenses
marriage licenses and other bureaucratic documents during the week,
now weathers the gale of a high-stakes congressional race, one
symbolically and tactically important for Republicans. Their
five-seat hold on the House is on the line, and they are loath to
surrender any seat, much less that of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson, town clerk since 1991, is surrounded by a staff she
hardly knows, with a state party operative serving as her campaign
manager and a Washington consultant, Tony Marsh, as campaign
strategist. Her eyes bulge at her fund-raising goal, $1.5 million,
88 times the most she ever raised for a town clerk campaign and a
far cry from what she has now, about $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   The open seat has brought out a bevy of contenders to a contest
that Congressional Quarterly, a leading political journal, rates a
tossup between the eventual Democratic and Republican nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has received the endorsement of the Republican and the
Conservative Party organizations, but faces a primary on both
lines. Her Republican challenger is Robert T. Walsh, a retired
banker from Deer Park who represents a Russian humanitarian
organization at the United Nations. Walsh also plans to run on the
Right to Life line, as he did in 1994 when he ran for governor.
(Johnson favors abortion rights with no restrictions, unlike Lazio,
who opposes both public financing for abortions and late-term
procedures.) Richard N. Thompson of West Islip is challenging her
on the Conservative line.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, pointing to Johnson's positions on abortion and gun
control as out of step with the district's electorate, said, ``I
think she is an extraordinarily weak candidate and has little
chance to beat the Democrats running.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his years as a banking executive and as a goodwill
ambassador at the United Nations stood above her qualifications
``or lack thereof'' as town clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a lawyer from West Islip who was a pitcher for the
Cleveland Indians and Montreal Expos in the 1980s, said he viewed
Johnson as too far to the left on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she was the best candidate chosen by the
Republicans,'' Thompson said. ``I didn't think she was a voice for
conservative values, so I felt compelled to run.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponent the primary winners will face is still
undetermined. Democrats are headed for a three-way primary, with
the victor almost guaranteed strong backing by the national party
in an effort both to embarrass Lazio by grabbing his seat and to
help win back the House. They are seeking to reclaim a seat held by
a Democrat, Thomas Downey, for 20 years before Lazio defeated him
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But among the biggest question marks looming is how voters will
take to Johnson's race and sex, in a district that has never sent a
woman to Congress and whose population of 580,000 is about 79
percent white, 9 percent black, 9 percent Hispanic and 2 percent
Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have portrayed her candidacy as groundbreaking and
emblematic of the diversity and inclusiveness they seek. National
party officials gave her a brief but nonetheless valuable daytime
speaking role at the Republican National Convention this month. The
National Republican Congressional Committee, which conducted a poll
in early June that placed Johnson near the top of the potential
candidates in name recognition, is expected to send a hefty sum to
her campaign this fall.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even some of Johnson's supporters openly wonder
whether people will choose not to vote for her principally because
of her race. ``I'd like to say that won't happen, but realistically
it might,'' said State Senator Carl L. Marcellino of Syosset, who
said he was hopeful that ``people in the district will look beyond
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans privately worry about Johnson's age and lack of
political or legislative experience and rue the decision of Peter
McGowan, the powerful Islip town supervisor, to skip the race even
though he topped the list of six or seven contenders for the
party's backing. Johnson, who was not on the initial list, is most
often described as kindly, but lacking the fierce ambition that
could make waves in a local party striving for stability after
scandals and a succession of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   She scoffs at those who question her experience, saying the
administrative tasks of the town clerk's office and service on
numerous community organization boards adequately prepare anyone
for Congress. She cites the case of Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a Long
Island Democrat, who won office in 1996 with no political
experience by running on a gun control platform rooted in the death
of her husband in the Long Island Rail Road shooting in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As for strategy, she hammers an antitax message but also has
firmly hitched her fortune to Lazio, a popular figure in the
district. In remarks at a recent ``meet the candidates'' picnic,
Johnson scarcely mentioned herself for all her praise of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Black Republicans have always tilted at political windmills,
said David Bositis, senior political analyst for the Joint Center
for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based organization
that studies African-American affairs. There is only one black
Republican now in Congress, J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, and there have
been only five this century, Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, there is a lot of history between African-Americans
and the GOP,'' said Bositis, citing as an example the party's
advocacy during the 1960s and '70s of ``states' rights' and other
positions that blacks have seen as racially tinged appeals to white
Southerners. ``At least in the recent past, most of it is negative.
No amount of image making in the short term is going to change that
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson grows impatient with talk about one party being for one
race or another, a form of ``racial profiling,'' she says with a
laugh. If Democrats are perceived as more likely champions of
racial advancement, people need to go further back in history, she
says with mounting bitterness, rattling off names of Southern
Democrats with reputations for intolerance. ``I'll tell you who the
people were in power when my people were hanging from ropes in
trees. They were Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Her views are generally liberal. She is for not only abortion
rights, but also affirmative action, and _ as the godmother of a
17-year-old murder victim _ gun control, including registration.
She supports the death penalty, for the most heinous crimes like
serial killings, but she says her positions are not rigid and
shifted uncomfortably as she discussed the topic. ``These issues
don't come easy to me,'' she says. ``All life is precious.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson says she feels philosophically closer to Republicans
because of her goals to lower taxes and shrink government.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, however, Johnson senses victory in her web
of community connections, from her work at Head Start to children's
clubs to the town clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that robe?'' she says, motioning to a black gown hanging
in the campaign office here on East Main Street that once was the
place where she got her nails done. ``I've married 2,500 couples.
That's 5,000 people who personally know me because I've put them
together.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I go to the Eagle Scout awards, and I was a member
of the Boy Scouts Council, and I was a vice president of the Girl
Scouts Council, so I do a lot of things locally. My weekends are
always filled with community things, the Fire Department, the
whatever, the church events.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Sanders, president of the Urban League of Long Island, a
nonpartisan group, said: ``She always has been an unsung hero in
our community. What Joan Johnson does represent is we've always had
progressive, articulate, dedicated African-Americans in our
community, and Joan Johnson is no stranger to us.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN BALKS AT 3 PRIME-TIME NETWORK DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Mass., Ky., N.C., Texas)   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aides to Gov. George W. Bush are balking at a
series of three presidential debates proposed by an independent
commission, saying they do not want to commit to three sessions
that would be broadcast in prime time by the three major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said they also objected to the site of one of
the proposed debates and were hoping for a relaxed and
conversational format _ possibly with the candidates sitting at a
table _ with a moderator who is not too adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's preferences were conveyed in interviews with campaign
officials and have not formally been made to the Commission on
Presidential Debates, which has set up presidential debates
starting with the 1988 campaign. Even so, those preferences have
caused something of a standoff with Vice President Al Gore, who
readily accepted the commission's plans for three debates. Gore has
accused Bush of maneuvering to reduce his exposure against him. The
vice president has far more national debate experience than Bush,
the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, the commission's executive director, said her
organization was not about to make significant compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposal is the result of 2{ years' worth of deliberations
and planning on dates, formats and venues,'' Brown said. ``And I
don't believe it's possible for the campaigns to improve upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the Bush campaign's misgivings, she said: ``I would
certainly hope that this commission isn't being seen as the bad
guy. The commission was set up to try to represent the interests of
the public.'' The commission is headed by Paul Kirk, the former
chairman of the Democratic Party, and Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the
former chairman of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Bush campaign insisted that Bush was ready _
and eager _ to face off with Gore, but some viewed the commission
as trying to dictate their debate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The commission announced in January that there would be three
prime-time debates in October. Each would last 90 minutes and would
have one moderator (none have been selected yet) but no panel of
reporters. One of the debates may also have a town hall format, so
ordinary citizens can ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a lot of different options, and we're going to
look at all the options,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications
director.
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes was not ready to agree to the commission's premise of
three debates in prime time. Asked whether the campaign would
commit to prime time, she said: ``We have not made decisions about
all the venues and formats. Some, maybe, could air in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush aides said one option would be to agree to a debate
on a Sunday morning public-affairs program, which would draw a far
smaller audience than a prime-time event.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush officials and outside advisers said in interviews
that they feared that the commission might pick moderators who
would be too aggressive. The moderator in 1996 _ Jim Lehrer of PBS
_ was hardly known as combative.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``feels this should be more of a discussion and less trying
to be a gotcha format,'' one Bush campaign official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, a Republican consultant and an adviser to the Bush
campaign, said of the questioners at debates: ``Everyone tries to
be the one that trips up a candidate. That's the mind-set that's by
and large at play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush officials said they also objected to the proposed site
of the first debate because of its proximity to the John F. Kennedy
Library in Boston. The actual site is the University of
Massachusetts, which sits on Columbia Point, a property shared with
the Kennedy library. The library is a partner with the commission
in providing educational programs tied to the debate. Bush
officials complained that holding a debate near the library of a
Democratic president was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``At face value,'' said one Bush official, ``it seems difficult
to argue that it's neutral territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston debate is scheduled for Oct. 3. The commission has
also set a debate at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
on Oct. 11 and one at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct.
17. A vice presidential debate has been scheduled for Oct. 5 at
Centre College in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   In their eagerness to gain the most leverage over what has
become the most-watched events of the political season, campaigns
always posture and position during the run-up to the presidential
debates. Gore and Bush say they expect that debates will take
place. ``I know we're going to have three debates,'' Bush said
Monday at a news conference in Austin. ``I look forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in both camps concede that given the differences
on the two sides, there may be compromises made, such as the
prospect that one of the debates may not be broadcast in prime time
on all three major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has presented himself as much more willing to debate than
Bush. He has been calling for twice-weekly debates with Bush since
March. But his aides insist that before they participate in any
debates with the governor, Bush has to agree to the commission's
three face-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Mocking Bush as reluctant to debate, Chris Lehane, Gore's
spokesman, said, ``George W. Bush's ideal debate would take place
on a local cable access channel in Austin during the Olympic finals
of the women's gymnastic contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides insist they are not ducking, and in fact are
calling their proposal for five debates _ three presidential and
two vice presidential _ a record number.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, accused Gore of playing
games by making any other debates contingent on the candidates'
agreement first to take part in the commission debates. He said the
commission had ``equal standing'' with other prospective debate
sponsors, and that the campaign felt no obligation to agree to the
commission's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received scores of debate offers,'' Fleischer said.
``We have approached all of them as viable options.''
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, and Donald Evans, his
counterpart with the Bush campaign, have spoken twice about the
debates, most recently late last week, according to aides in both
camps. But the two sides said no genuine negotiations had begun.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the sides seem to agree on is that they do
not want third party candidates, namely Patrick J. Buchanan and
Ralph Nader, to participate. But they would be excluded anyway by
the commission, whose rules prohibit the participation of any
candidate who does not have at least 15 percent support in national
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials were particularly worried that Buchanan
would use such a forum to hammer away at the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the Bush campaign chairman, questioned whether the
commotion over debates was necessary. ``Absent some extraordinary
mistake _ Reagan blowing the first debate in '84 or Ford giving
away Eastern Europe in '76 _ debates generally tend to reinforce
the partisans,'' Rove said. But, he quickly added that because
``the race is going to be very tight,'' even a 1 percent shift
because of debates ``could make a difference.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOLLOWING IN THE PATH OF A PIONEER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daughter hailed mother on the cell phone, in Miami,
at the airport, with the flash that was no longer news.
</P>
<P>
   ``She already knew I won,'' said Allison Bradshaw, looking every
bit the 19-year-old whose family surprise was ruined.
</P>
<P>
   An anxious mother can only stand so much. The minute Valerie
Ziegenfuss landed, shuffling her national team of 14-and-under
players off the flight from Prague and through immigration, she
switched on the phone, and found the messages from the National
Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Two other U.S. Tennis Association coaches and Lynne Rolley, the
director of programs, had already reported Bradshaw's 6-4, 6-2
first-round takeout of France's Sarah Pitkowski in Bradshaw's Grand
Slam debut at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allison reached me at the baggage claim but we could only talk
for a couple of minutes because I had to check in for the flight
home to San Diego,'' Ziegenfuss said by phone, about to board.
``After we hung up, I started thinking that people in the press
might be asking her questions that she doesn't know the answer to.
I guess it's time I start filling her in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziegenfuss never decorated the house with trophies, with photos,
with reminders that her daughter had any path to follow but her
own. She made a point of not regaling her with 30-year-old tales of
a very different time. Yet now that Bradshaw had an Open victory
under her belt, now that she was part of a tour that keeps
redefining itself, keeps growing, she ought to know how it all came
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know more, considering my mom was involved,''
Bradshaw said. ``But more because everyone on the Tour should try
to learn about what Billie Jean King and the rest of them did.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows her mother was in Houston, with King and Rosie Casals
and the publisher Gladys Heldman, leaders of nine breakaway players
who in 1970 rebelled against the USTA and shunned a Tour stop in
Los Angeles. While the USTA was paying the women about one-tenth
what it gave the men, Heldman put up $5000 of her own money and the
players signed $1 contracts. They were banned by the USTA, told
they had committed career suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Ziegenfuss said, she would have to tell her daughter of
the anxious phone calls and the late-night fears and the
uncompromising faith in Heldman and King that ultimately pulled
them though.
</P>
<P>
   Four times in the top 10 in singles and No. 1-ranked in doubles,
Ziegenfuss lost to Rosie Casals that week in Houston and guessed
she made $300. For surviving one round after receiving a wild card
into the main draw, her daughter Monday guaranteed herself at least
a $19,000 Open haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I amazed by the prize money?'' Ziegenfuss said. ``Yes. But
I'm more amazed by the level of play. Not in my wildest dreams did
I ever hit a forehand like my daughter, and she's not one of the
top players.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Open slogged its way out of the starting gate, it began
with one potential response to Tigermania, to the kind of attention
golf gets, and that would be a women's final of Williams versus
Williams. For all of Pete Sampras' 13-Slam greatness and Andre
Agassi's inherent appeal, the men's game has stooped to a new
publicity campaign directed at those preoccupied with the
wrestlers, the rappers and other renowned reapers of the attention
the men don't command. ``New Balls, Please'' sounds more like an
excerpt from Bob Knight's autobiography than a sound marketing plan
for tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The transcendent superstar doesn't achieve the big television
rating by merely taking off his (or her) shirt. You either have a
compelling product, or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing from Venus and Serena is so far athletically
beyond anything we knew back then,'' Ziegenfuss said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw, who first beat her mother when she was 12 or 13, is 5
feet 10 inches, with reddish hair and an aggressive style. ``I
don't get nervous,'' she said, after proving it by ignoring the
noise pollution around Court 18, a bathroom dash by the 24-year-old
Pitkowski after Bradshaw had won 12 of 15 points to ice the first
set and an ensuing rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a Challenger event earlier this summer after
leaving Arizona State, she's come a long way without Virginia
Slims, and does not even consider herself a feminist. Here at the
Open, the one Grand Slam event that pays equal prize money, she
doesn't have to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegenfuss will be here Wednesday to tell her daughter more
about how this all came about. &QL;

APPLIED MICRO CIRCUITS BUYS NETWORK CHIP DESIGNER FOR $4.5 BILLION
IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Applied Micro Circuits Corp., a San Diego-based
maker of chips for networking equipment, said Monday that it had
agreed to acquire MMC Networks Inc. in a stock swap valued at about
$4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   MMC Networks, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., designs chips
to speed the connections between fiber optic communications lines
and electrical circuits. The company contracts out the fabrication
of their chips.
</P>
<P>
   Both Applied Micro and MMC are large suppliers to network
equipment manufacturers like Nortel, Cisco and Lucent, and the
acquisition is part of Applied Micro's strategy to broaden its
product line.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Micro shares closed Monday at $183.81, down $4.75, in
Nasdaq trading, while MMC shares jumped $31.75, to close at $110.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the acquisition as a logical strategic move,
but noted that the price was high for a small, little-known
company.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Motey, an analyst with CE Unterberg Towbin, said that
Applied Micro and its primary competitors, PMC-Sierra Inc. and the
Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., had all been bulking up through
acquisitions so that they could offer the network equipment
companies a complete catalog of chips. Companies like Nortel and
Cisco ``are no longer just looking for component suppliers, but
partners at the architectural level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the chip suppliers,'' he said, ``are all trying to build a
war chest of components.''
</P>
<P>
   Although voice and data communications are increasingly
transmitted as optical signals carried over fiber optic cable,
those pulses of light must be translated back into electrical
current for the switches and routers that direct them across the
Internet to their ultimate destination. In acquiring MMC Networks,
Applied Micro gains a leading provider of network processors,
traffic management and switch fabric technologies, which are at the
core of a wide variety of switches and routers, including optical
networking, Web switching, subscriber management, broadband access
and other communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new market emerging for intelligent optical
networking systems,'' said Dave Rickey, Applied Micro's president
and chief executive, in a statement. ``With this merger, we can
provide the most complete and powerful integrated circuit solutions
for this rapidly growing market.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Spreng, as president of MMC, which will become a subsidiary
of Applied Micro, will report directly to Rickey and join the
Applied board upon completion of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen, said this merger, as well
as some earlier deals, transformed Applied Micro from a niche
player to a powerhouse. ``With this deal, they've basically become
the dominant network component supplier,'' he said. ``They have the
highest performance across the broadest array of products.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is not without risk, Peck added. ``The bet they're
making is that huge customers like Cisco, Nortel and Lucent will
happily stop making these components internally, and use more
generic components,'' he said. ``If you believe in this strategy,
then the question is how much was it worth. There have been myriad
acquisitions of unheard-of companies at unheard-of valuations, but
it will be two or three years until we know if it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Motey of CE Unterberg said he believed the deal would start
paying for itself soon. ``We're estimating an additional $140 to
$150 million in revenues in 2001, on top of the $500 million we
were estimating for AMCC,'' he said. ``With MMC, AMCC gets a
company with a proven track record, with 72 design wins and 42
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the largest in a recent string of networking
component acquisitions, including that of Quantum Effect Devices
Inc., which was bought last week by PMC-Sierra in a transaction
originally valued at $2.3 billion; that of the closely held SiTera
Inc., acquired in May by Vitesse for $750 million; and that of the
closely held Agere Inc., which Lucent bought in April for about
$504.5 million. Lucent has said it plans to spin off its unit that
makes chips and optical parts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore Monday escalated his
attacks against the pharmaceutical industry, criticizing two drug
companies by name and calling for greater competition in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry has long been one of Gore's corporate
bogeymen, along with oil, tobacco and insurance. But in Monday's
speech to a forum of elderly people on the campus of Florida State
University, Gore expanded his criticism, saying he would veto any
legislation that would extend monopoly patents for prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore singled out for criticism the manufacturers of two
medications: the Schering-Plough Corp., which makes Claritin, and
the American Home Products Corp., the parent company of
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes Lodine. In the case of
Claritin, he said the manufacturer spent more money on advertising
than on research. And in the case of Lodine, an arthritis medicine
prescribed for both people and pets, he said American Home Products
charged pharmacies more than veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for them making profits and having more research and
whatnot,'' Gore said. ``But I'm not going to stand by if they
behave in an unfair way.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's trip was Gore's second to Florida in less than a week,
underscoring the importance his campaign places on the state and
its 25 electoral votes. The governor here is Jeb Bush, the brother
of Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and Gore
was greeted by taunts from a larger-than-usual collection of Bush
supporters when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee's address kicked off a four-day,
four-state trip that Gore is devoting to health care policy, an
issue on which Gore feels he has an advantage over Bush. He also
plans to highlight his proposals for a patients' bill of rights,
expanded health care coverage for children, the solvency of
Medicare and investments in medical research at stops in New
Mexico, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the centerpiece of Gore's health care program is his
proposal for a voluntary Medicare benefit that would provide
prescription drug coverage for the elderly. About 13 million
Medicare beneficiaries have no drug coverage, while many others pay
expensive premiums through Medigap plans, Gore aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, seniors with no coverage who have incomes of
135 percent of the poverty level or below, about $12,000 for an
individual and $14,000 for a couple, would have their drugs covered
without cost.
</P>
<P>
   Those with higher incomes would pay a premium, on a sliding
scale, and would be reimbursed half of the cost of their
prescriptions up to a total of $5,000. After Medicare recipients
paid $4,000 out of pocket for prescriptions, the government would
pay all remaining costs. The Gore campaign estimates the cost of
the proposal at $253 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is complicated, and Gore misstated some of the details
while explaining it to his audience Monday. But his larger points
were clear: He has a detailed plan, while Bush, does not; his plan
would be affordable within a balanced budget, while Bush, he says,
cannot afford a comprehensive plan because of the size of his
income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has yet to propose a specific plan, but his aides say that
he would build on the proposal of a bipartisan congressional
commission that would seek to spur competition between public and
private plans for Medicare recipients, giving consumers a choice of
public and private plans, some of which would provide a drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has said he supports a sliding prescription drug
subsidy for the low-income elderly, but would leave the amounts to
be determined in negotiations with Congress. Gore said Monday that
``the insurance companies have said they will not offer such
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on prescription drugs Monday coincided with the
release of a television advertisement on the topic by the
Democratic National Committee. Both the Bush campaign and the
Republican National Committee began broadcasting ads on
prescription drugs last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ad, which will appear in eight states, charges
Bush with ``siding with the big drug companies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Gore's main target Monday was the drug companies. He
described an industry that kept prices artificially high while its
patents remained in effect, forcing seniors to choose between
prescriptions and sometimes between prescriptions and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just wrong,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Schering-Plough, Gore said: ``According to The Wall
Street Journal they spend more mon- ey every year advertising
Claritin and promoting Claritin than Coca- Cola spends to advertise
and pro- mote Coca-Cola. So if they're using  &UR; -------------------- &LR; 
these profits more for that than for research and if a lot of the
most valuable research is being paid for by the taxpayers anyway,
then I be- lieve that we need more competi- tion.''
</P>
<P>
   To force that competition, Gore said, he would veto all patent
extension legislation that would benefit drug companies.
Schering-Plough is seeking such an extension for Claritin, whose
patents begin to expire in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Donnell, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said, ``The
pharmaceutical industry is responsible for breakthrough discoveries
that make invaluable contributions to the nation's health care
system. The real issue in the United States is the fact that a
significant portion of our population lacks prescription drug
coverage. Schering-Plough believes that all Americans should be
provided with access to drug coverage through private sector
mechanisms, without resorting to government price controls, which
history has proven simply do not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, denounced
Gore's proposals as a ``nationalized drug plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is similar to Hillary Clinton's attempt to nationalize
health care in 1993,'' Bartlett said. ``Al Gore is fully embracing
the old-style, government-knows-best approach that the American
people soundly rejected when Hillary Clinton tried it in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also accused American Home Products, which markets the drug
Lodine, sets significantly lower prices for veterinarians than for
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it costs $108 a month for a person, it costs $37.80 for
a dog,'' he said. A spokesman for American Home Products declined
to comment.  &QL;

 &HT;    Vietnam veteran to keep a promise he made 32 years ago
 &HT;    By Gene Metrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. - Lynn Hughes had a promise to keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a promise - no matter how long it takes to keep it
- you try your best to keep your word,'' the 53-year-old Rocky
Mount roofing contractor said. ``For me, it took 32 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Hughes will take the final step in keeping that
promise when he travels to Texas to meet the family and visit the
grave of the man who saved his life in Vietnam, Sgt. James Warren
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' saga began in the summer of 1968. After six weeks in
South Vietnam serving in the Aviation Battalion of the 4th Infantry
Division, Hughes was assigned to refuel helicopters at a Special
Forces airborne base in Dar Loc province.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of his third day in Dar Loc, Hughes met
26-year-old Green Beret Sgt. James Smith, of detachment A-233 of
the 5th Special Forces Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't act like a typical sergeant - he was very
mild-mannered,'' Hughes said. ``I guess that's why he took me under
his wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was in his second 12-month tour of duty in Vietnam. He
looked out after the new arrival, and the two young men soon struck
up a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me the ins and outs, what to look for,'' Hughes
said. ``Smitty was almost 6 feet tall and I'm about 5-4, so they
got to calling us 'Mutt and Jeff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes remembers the base as a ``huge dirt field consisting of
bunkers, tents and makeshift barracks with tin roofs.'' Surrounded
by dense jungle and sloping hills - and hostile Viet Cong guerrilla
units -- the base was enclosed with barbed wire and sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down in a valley, so if Charley wanted to, he could
have taken us at any time,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 5 p.m. on Aug. 23, 1968, Smith and Hughes heard
incoming fire as they stood in the chow line. The two young
soldiers ran to the mortar pit they were assigned to man during
enemy attacks and began to return fire.
</P>
<P>
   It was 21-year-old Hughes' first firefight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing most of the shooting,'' he said. ``You can
imagine how shook up I was.''
</P>
<P>
   They fired off two rounds, but as Hughes handed Smith a third
mortar shell, a huge explosion tore up the ground in front of their
pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying, 'Boy, were we lucky,''' Hughes said.
``Smitty carried me into the bunker right beside us, then grabbed
his chest and went to his knees.''
</P>
<P>
   To his horror, Hughes realized that Smith had taken a major
shrapnel wound to the chest. Struggling to keep pressure on the
wound as his friend gasped for breath, Hughes didn't realize at
first that he too, had been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that bunker, waiting for help as the battle raged
around them, that Hughes promised his friend to find his family and
tell them of his ``strength and courage'' during his final moments
of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been me that died that day, but he saved my
life,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and a Bronze
Medal. Hughes spent 35 days in a military hospital in Japan before
returning to Vietnam to complete his first and then a second tour
of duty. He was wounded again during his second tour. Like his
buddy Smitty, he was awarded a Silver Star and Bronze Medal for his
actions defending the Dar Lac Special Forces' base.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to civilian life, Hughes faced a daunting task
in trying to find Smith's relatives. He knew his friend was from
Texas, but he couldn't call or write to every Smith in the state.
He contacted the Defense Department, but that avenue of
investigation yielded information that only added to the apparent
hopelessness of his search: At least 26 men named James Smith had
been killed during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up against a brick wall,'' Hughes said. ``Trying to find
his family was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail led to many dead ends. He learned that Smith's father
had lived in Houston, but he continued to fall short of the answers
he was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   When Hughes bought his family a personal computer and got hooked
up to the Internet, his search was suddenly reinvigorated by the
seemingly limitless resources of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got on the Web, I thought, 'Now I can really find
them,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in June, his Internet detective work began to pay off when
Hughes came across a Web site named TAPS, where friends and family
can post tributes to fallen Vietnam servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   As he scrolled down the list of names, he couldn't believe his
eyes when he came to the entry, ``Sgt. James Warren Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart stopped, and I yelled for my wife,'' he said. ``I
kept saying, 'Robin, look at this, look at this - I found him!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He let out a big yell,'' Robin said. ``I thought he had fallen
out of his chair or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribute entered for Smith came from Linda Burns, a cousin of
Smith's father, Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, 53, of Red Rock, Texas, had first come across her second
cousin's name on the TAPS Web site in October 1999 while looking
for a friend's brother's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw James' name there with nothing written underneath it,
and I thought that it was a shame that someone hadn't posted
something there,'' she said. ``When I visited the site again in
November, I thought to myself, 'Maybe that someone is me.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes' hope soon turned to frustration, for the e-mail
messages he sent to Burns' posted reply address came back to him as
undeliverable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That e-mail address was wrong,'' he said. ``She had changed
her e-mail address shortly after posting that.''
</P>
<P>
   After telling his fiend Pat Ezzelle about finding the TAPS
posting, Ezzelle told him about a Web site he had heard of that
helped veterans contact lost comrades. Hughes ran a Web search and
found the American Veteran Search home page, and e-mailed his story
to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one person could have done this all by themselves,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   American Veteran Search was the brainchild of New Yorkers Rich
Palmeri and Jack Gentile. The two veterans created AVS to be
exactly what Hughes needed - an online resource where veterans and
their families could connect with military comrades they or their
loved ones had served with. The AVS Web site went online at
www.veteransearch.com on Veterans Day in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn sounded real to us right up front, and we verified his
story,'' Palmeri said. ``We help out with a lot of these cases, and
every reunion is great - but this is a special story.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeri, 48, located Burns using Internet databases. He
telephoned her in early July, planning to tell her about Lynn, give
her his telephone number and let her decide if she wanted to call.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns was at work when Palmeri called, so he left a message
on her answering machine. And when she got home she found her
husband, Tommy, also a Vietnam veteran, waiting for her at the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'I'm going to tell you something that is going to
change your life.''' she said. ``And that was true.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Vietnam War, Burns served as an Army nurse at an
evacuation hospital at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. In
an almost unbelievable coincidence, Robin Hughes also served as an
Army nurse at the same hospital during the same time, although the
two women never met.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was 21 when James was killed in action. But even though
she worked with wounded soldiers at the hospital, she said her
second cousin's death brought the reality of war home to her in a
very personal way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the end of innocence for me,'' she said. ``When he
died, I realized for the first time that bad things really can
happen to good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said it's practically impossible for him to put into
words how he felt the day Burns called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' he said. ``She cried; I cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing from Hughes had an equally strong impact on her, Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the same person I was ... it restored the faith I have
lost over the years,'' she said. ``The whole family has benefited
from what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns told Hughes that his old friend's father had passed away,
but that his mother, Oleta Smith, was living in Dumas, Texas. She
gave Smith's telephone number to Hughes, but the two agreed that
Burns should call her first to make sure Smith would want to speak
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to open up any old wounds by talking to Mrs.
Smith - I didn't want to hurt her,'' Hughes said. ``She had already
been hurt enough by losing her only son.''
</P>
<P>
   The first telephone conversation between Hughes and the
83-year-old Smith was initiated by a wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was calling Linda back, because I had a few more
questions about (Hughes) that I forgot to ask her,'' Smith said.
``But I hung up without saying anything when he answered the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes recognized Smith's number on his caller ID display and
called her right back. His heart froze when he heard her voice
answer the phone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was talking to Smitty's mother, but I could hardly
say anything at first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both described their first conversation as a bittersweet
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to get started talking - I didn't know know how to
express myself,'' Smith said. ``I wanted to make sure he was
talking about my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Burns before her, Smith quizzed Hughes in an attempt to
authenticate his story, asking him questions only someone who had
served with her son would know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why they asked - I don't blame them,'' Hughes
said. ``You can say you were somewhere, but you have to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon their discussion started to warm up as the two strangers
began to connect with each other through their common bond. They
talked for 90 minutes during that first telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought back many, many tears. We cried a lot, but we also
laughed a little, too,'' Smith said. ``It did upset me, but I'm
very grateful for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said he felt the years of pent-up emotions surging
through him as he realized that his quest had finally reached its
long-awaited goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really very emotional for both of us,'' he said. ``I
remember her saying, 'You're a part of my life now.' And I said,
'Yes ma'am!'''
</P>
<P>
   Two young American servicemen named James Warren Smith were
killed during the Vietnam War, and Smith said that talking to Lynn
quelled any buried doubts inside of her that her son was killed
that August day in Dar Loc province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really glad that I talked to him. It really relieved a
lot of questions that I wanted answers to,'' she said. ``Talking to
someone who was with my son when he died - knowing that he didn't
die alone - was a big help.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hope it has helped him, too. I know it has been a burden
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hugheses have already purchased their tickets for the
airline flight that will take them to Houston on Sept. 22. On the
following day, they plan to drive to San Antonio to meet Oleta
Smith, Linda and Tommy Burns and several other members of their
family at Fort Sam Houston Military Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy and I'm also very excited, but I know it will be
very emotional,'' Hughes said. ``The main thing that I'm worried
about isn't visiting Mrs. Smith or the family - I think the most
hurtful thing for me will be seeing James' resting site.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said she also has mixed feelings about the upcoming
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be very happy to meet them because they're very nice
people and I think the world of them, but I'm also extremely
nervous about it,'' she said. ``I can't help but think about the
past - it brings back things I'd rather not think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith said she too is concerned about the many
conflicting emotions that meeting Hughes in person will likely
arouse in her, she is looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wanting to meet him in person because I feel very
close to him,'' she said. ``I think it will more or less bring a
closure to this for me, because I really hadn't had that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunions of this sort can generally help bring about such a
sense of ending to years of internal turmoil for the people
involved, Palmeri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often the final chapter for these folks, and it works
both ways - for the vets and their families,'' he said. ``When we
see the response of these vets, that's our payment right there. Our
motto is, 'We make grown men cry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said she believes Hughes' story ``cries to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it can encourage others to do the same kind of thing,''
she said. ``We all need to heal from this war, and this is one way
we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And after 32 years, full healing has finally begun for Lynn
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to take away all that guilt I've felt for all these years
and have it lifted away is just a simply wonderful feeling,'' he
said. ``There are no tears now - the weight is off my heart.''

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL PLANS TO REPORT SOON ON MRS. CLINTON

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel, said he
expected to issue a statement of his findings and conclusions about
the Whitewater investigation a few weeks before New York voters go
to the polls to choose between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick
Lazio, her Republican opponent for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, whose office has investigated President and Mrs. Clinton on
a range of issues for more than four years, also said in an
interview that he would announce his decision shortly after the
president left office on whether he would seek an indictment of
Clinton in connection with his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor suggested that the announcement about the
possible indictment of Clinton would come within weeks after a new
president is inaugurated on Jan. 20. Ray has already issued two
reports, one essentially clearing the Clintons in the collection of
confidential FBI files about Republicans, and another critical of
Mrs. Clinton's role in the dismissal of longtime employees in the
White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Setting out for the first time an explicit timetable on those
two matters in an interview on Friday and in comments through a
spokesman Monday, Ray also discussed some considerations about the
timing. Any criticism of Mrs. Clinton from Ray in the final weeks
of her campaign could turn into a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, said
Monday in response to Ray's plans: ``New Yorkers have already made
up their minds about this. They know there is nothing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray refused to discuss what the Whitewater report might contain.
While it has long been known there will be no recommendation of any
criminal indictment, the statement is almost certain to discuss how
his findings compare to Mrs. Clinton's assertions to investigators
and to the public about her role as a lawyer in connection with
several real estate dealings in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my intention to issue those findings and conclusions
prior to the election,'' he said. ``Right now I'm trying for
mid-September.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he would issue his Whitewater conclusions the moment
they are ready and ``not a second later.'' He said it would be
wrong to delay disclosing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even withholding them could have political repercussions,'' he
said, ``and that could be viewed as being manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he believed that issuing his statement a few weeks
before the election would provide enough time for anyone to respond
to it and for the public to fully absorb both his views and those
of anyone who disputed his findings.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the one situation that might change his plans would
be if the statement was not ready until just a few days before the
election. If that were the case, he said, he would consider
withholding it.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to his decision about the president and the
possibility of bringing an indictment after Clinton leaves office,
Ray said he had an obligation to conclude the matter as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time this matter was brought to closure,'' he said. ``And
it is coming to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I know the country is weary of this. The country
needs to get past this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray impaneled a new grand jury on July 11 to consider whether
Clinton should be indicted in connection with his denials under
oath about whether he had a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   He described the decision-making process as largely ``a
deliberative one now, not an investigative one.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the sole issue is whether to charge the president after
he leaves office, Ray said he intended to take full advantage of
the time until Clinton left office to make up his mind. He said his
deliberations would require a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also said there were other factors to consider but declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   One possible factor is whether Clinton is disbarred. A state
judge in Arkansas is considering a recommendation from a special
bar committee that Clinton be stripped of his law license because
of his denials under oath of a relationship with Lewinsky. A trial
on the matter is likely to be held this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ray is an independent counsel, he is obliged to follow
Justice Department guidelines that allow for prosecutors to show
discretion and decline to prosecute a case if the subject has
already paid a penalty _ like disbarment or even suspension from
the practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater report that Ray is expected to file with a
special three-judge panel at the same time he issues his statement
of findings and conclusions will probably be his last investigative
report.
</P>
<P>
   He has already filed two reports with the panel, one in March on
allegations that the White House, and particularly Mrs. Clinton,
collected hundreds of confidential FBI files, many of them of
prominent Republicans, as part of a political
intelligence-gathering scheme. Ray concluded that the improper
acquisition was a bureaucratic foul-up involving midlevel White
House officials and that Mrs. Clinton had no involvement, as she
had asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But in his second statement of findings and conclusions, issued
in June, about whether Mrs. Clinton played a role in the firing of
seven longtime White House travel office employees, Ray was far
more critical of her sworn statements.
</P>
<P>
   He made a point of saying that despite Mrs. Clinton's strong
denials, he concluded that she had played a substantial role in
causing the employees to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater report may well follow that model as it is
expected to explore what Mrs. Clinton did as a lawyer for various
Arkansas clients, and contentions that she tried to conceal or
minimize her role.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one issue is a 1985 telephone call Mrs. Clinton
made on behalf of a client, Madison Guaranty and Trust, to a senior
Arkansas official who worked for her husband, then the governor.
She telephoned Beverly Bassett, the state securities commissioner
in Gov. Clinton's administration, to discuss a proposal for Madison
to float preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton told investigators that she did not remember whom
she spoke with at the agency. She also said she had only been
trying to find out the appropriate official for an associate at her
firm, Richard Massey, to contact, and that she had not discussed
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the regulator recalled the conversation in detail when she
testified before the Senate Whitewater committee. She said that
Mrs. Clinton had spoken with her and discussed the substance of the
proposal. And Massey testified he had already known whom to
contact.

MS. SOCIAL CHARMER A SLACKER AT WORK  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
 &HT;    By Ken LLoyd  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Q: There is a very popular employee in my department. She is
well-liked by her fellow employees and by many of my peers in
management. The problem is her work, it is often sloppy and late,
and she does not seem concerned about it. I have talked to her
about this, but she seems to think she is so well-liked that
nothing can happen to her. I am ready to terminate her but am
concerned about the backlash against me. Any suggestions? T.R. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: As a manager, sometimes you have to take an unpopular stance
when dealing with a popular person. Be sure you have documented her
performance, discussed it with her, and given her the opportunity
and support to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   If you have done so, only to find she continues to believe
popularity is more important than productivity, it is time to make
a managerial decision. And this decision should not be based on her
popularity, or on the impact the decision will have on your
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking this action, however, consider one unique aspect
of this situation: Employees who do not carry their weight
typically are regarded with disdain rather than adoration. This
worker's popularity indicates she must have some rather compelling
people skills -- which raises the question of whether she is simply
in the wrong position.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies today are trying to fit jobs to people, rather
than fitting people into jobs. If there is a more people-oriented
position in your firm, perhaps she would fare better in it. At the
same time, if there is no appropriate internal option for her, then
it is time for the external option. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whenever I talk with my manager, he inevitably brings up my
co-workers and tells me things about them that are not my business.
He likes to talk about who is struggling and whom he just
counseled. This puts me in a bad position, but I don't want to tell
my manager how to manage. What do you suggest? L.A. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You are in a bad position, and your manager is in the wrong
position. This single act clearly indicates he has a long way to go
before he is ready for prime time. It sounds like your company is
either overly eager to fill managerial slots on the organization
chart or it lacks adequate communication, education and follow-up
with the managerial staff.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you do not want to tell your manager how to manage, yet
you can still discuss his babbling. One approach that may protect
his ego and protect you is to mention you are concerned about his
openness. By using the word ``openness,'' already you are placing
your comments in a positive context.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to mention it is not really fair to your fellow
employees for you to have this kind of information about them. And
further, it may not even be fair to your managr himself, since
other employees might be upset if they learn about this.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not get this obvious message from you, there will be
plenty of other messages he is bound to miss as well. When this
occurs, it should only be a matter of time before senior management
send him the clearest message of all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last week my manager told me that I am too focused on family
matters and I need to pay more attention to work. I have no idea
where this comment came from. I asked for some examples, but he
couldn't think of any specifics. That's how the discussion ended,
but I'm concerned about what's happening. Should I do anything
else? H.M. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Whether dealing with employees, children or pets, most people
know that the time to provide feedback is as close to the behavior
in question as possible. If your family dog has chewed up a family
heirloom, it's not going to do much good to confront Fido three
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   When managers stockpile their concerns about an employee and
then unload at a later date, the employee's reaction is a
combination of defensiveness, denial and distress. If an employee
is engaging in a behavior inappropriate for the job, the manager
should discuss the situation with him or her at the time. That's
the best way to have any kind of acceptance, credibility and
impact.
</P>
<P>
   You should revisit this situation with your manager. Tell him
you have thought very carefully about it and you still do not see
any family interference in your work. In addition, suggest that if
he ever sees such interference, you would like to discuss it with
him at that time. It is hoped he will not need any more feedback
about his feedback. &QL;

LIEBERMAN IS ASKED TO STOP INVOKING FAITH IN CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League called Monday for Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, to stop
making ``overt expressions'' of religious belief on the campaign
trail. Such appeals in a political context, the league said, risk
alienating people and also run ``contrary to the American ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's request to Lieberman came in a letter signed by
Abraham H. Foxman, its national director, and Howard P. Berkowitz,
its national chairman. They said that although the organization
believed that candidates ``should feel comfortable explaining their
religious convictions to voters,'' there was ``a point at which an
emphasis on religion in a political campaign becomes inappropriate
and even unsettling in a religiously diverse society such as
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday night, Foxman said that the letter was in
response to remarks Lieberman made at a Detroit church during its
Sunday services, calling for a greater role for religion in
American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not think that religion belongs in the political
campaign and the political arena,'' Foxman said. ``There's nothing
wrong with somebody professing their faith and going to church or
synagogue, but this is almost hawking it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the speech in Detroit, Lieberman, the first Jew to run on the
presidential ticket of a major party, said that he hoped his
nomination encouraged people ``to feel more free to talk about
their faith'' and that it also reinforced the idea that ``there
must be a place for faith in America's public life.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``As a people we need to reaffirm our faith and renew
the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman returned to the theme of religion in public life
Monday, when he spoke to religious leaders in Chicago. He called
the United States ``the most religious country in the world'' and
said that not only were Americans citizens of the same country, but
that ``we are also children of the same awesome God.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was not alone Monday in invoking a public role for
religious belief. In a speech to a B'nai B'rith convention in
Washington, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee
for president, spoke of his support for Israel and also praised the
work conducted by faith-based social programs.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush said, ``Our nation is chosen by God and
commissioned by history to be a model to the world of justice and
inclusion and diversity without division. Jews and Christians and
Muslims speak as one in their commitment to a kind, just, tolerant
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxman said he had not been aware of Lieberman's or Bush's
comments Monday. He said that the league, a division of B'nai
B'rith, had not received a reply from Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates in the presidential campaign have expressed their
religious faith in public terms on previous occasions. During a
debate among the Republican presidential candidates in December,
Bush identified Jesus as his favorite philosopher. The same month,

BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE ASKING VENEZUELAN DEALERS TO RETURN TIRES
MADE THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced Monday evening
that it had asked its dealers in Venezuela to return unsold 15- and
16-inch light truck tires made there, but the company rebuffed the
Ford Motor Co.'s call for a recall of identical tires already in
use in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Ford recalled its Ford Explorer and Ford Ranger pickup
trucks equipped with the tires in all three countries, and the
company said Monday that it had urged Bridgestone to recall suspect
tires used on other manufacturers' sport utility vehicles. Ford
also scheduled a news conference on Tuesday in Caracas, Venezuela,
to explain why they thought that tire-related crashes of Ford
Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela had solely been the
result of defective tires and not because of any excessive tendency
of Explorers to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said that Ford had cut open
Firestone tires returned during the recall in Venezuela and found
that many lacked a protective layer of nylon, or were unable to
withstand high-speed driving.
</P>
<P>
   None of the tires made in Venezuela were shipped to the United
States, Ford and Bridgestone said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bridgestone said that problems with its tires were limited
to a mislabeling of their sidewalls and insisted that the tires met
Ford specifications, including the use of nylon layers. The tire
maker said that a broader recall was unnecessary and that it was a
coincidence that the mislabeled 15-inch tires in Venezuela were the
same size as the tires being recalled in the United States because
the treads occasionally come off during high-speed driving.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, which used some of the tires on Toyota Land Cruisers
sold in Venezuela, said that it had not received any reports of
problems and did not think a broader recall was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Dominguez, a senior investigator at the Institute for
Consumer Protection and Education in Venezuela, said that the
agency was convinced that Ford was partly responsible for a problem
that had caused more than 60 deaths in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have documentary evidence,'' he said. ``The responsibility
is shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the agency's evidence, he said, were communications
between the two companies, as well as stickers that Ford put on its
vehicles showing a lower recommended tire pressure than Firestone
favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tire manufacturer said the tire should be inflated to
32 pounds pressure, they put on their stickers that it should be 26
to 28 pounds,'' Dominguez said. ``We even have photos of the
crashed vehicles showing these stickers in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone have only recently differed in public in the
United States over the recommended tire pressure. Ford has long
favored 26 pounds per square inch. Firestone, after 10 years of
acquiescing to this number, abruptly announced at the beginning of
its recall in the United States on Aug. 9 that the pressure should
be 30 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   Tires inflated to low pressure can overheat and come apart at
high speeds. Virtually all of the deaths in the United States have
occurred when sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers, have rolled
over when their tires came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Tire makers tend to prefer higher air pressures because it
reduces the risk of failure for the tires, which are covered by the
tire makers' warranties. But higher-pressure tires increase the
risk that sport utility vehicles will roll over during some driving
situations without tire failure.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford memorandum distributed by consumers' lawyers in the
United States showed that Ford rejected higher-pressure tires on a
prototype of the Explorer because they tended to cause rollovers.
Ford ended up choosing a different, lower-pressure tire and a
different suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Ford contends that rollovers are the main cause of crash deaths
for occupants of all brands of midsized sport utility vehicles.
Explorer occupants actually have a lower death rate in rollovers _
and in crashes overall _ than occupants of other midsized sport
utility models, according to Ford safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   In television commercials scheduled to begin Monday night,
Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president, said that
Ford had one of the best safety records, according to government
data for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   George Pipas, a Ford market analyst, said Monday that Ford's
sales in the United States in August would be roughly equal to last
year's levels and only slightly below the company's early
projections, a shortfall that he said might reflect response to the
tire recall but also a somewhat slower economy and a highly
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Harmon said the company had not found protective nylon
layers in 71 percent of the 15-inch tires from Venezuela that it
cut open, nor in 55 percent of the 16-inch tires. Auto companies
commonly specify that tire makers include nylon for vehicles to be
sold in South America because of the poor roads and because drivers
frequently go extremely fast in the absence of enforced speed
limits, Harmon said. The tires also came apart before reaching 112
miles per hour on a dynanometer, a speed they were supposed to be
able to withstand, particularly because the Explorer's engine has a
computer control to keep drivers from going more than 99 miles an
hour, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been criticized by consumers' lawyers for not having
Firestone include the nylon layers on Explorer tires for the United
States market. Because of the good roads in the United States,
manufacturers rarely use the layers except for very high-speed
models like the Chevrolet Corvette sports car and the Ford F-150
Lightning pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone hinted in a letter Monday to the Venezuelan consumer
agency that Ford might not have asked for nylon layers until
recently. The letter said that Ford had specified in 1999 that the
nylon be included and that nylon had been included since then. The
tires in question have been produced since 1996, and the
Bridgestone letter did not say whether the earlier tires had the
nylon, nor were officials willing to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Harmon said the company had always asked for the nylon.
``Firestone specified a nylon ply to meet Ford's performance
specifications from the beginning of Ford's Explorer sales in
Venezuela,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Firestone tires in Venezuela, as in the United States, bear
no external signs that the tread may come apart from an inner layer
of rubber. Yet Ford engineers who cut apart the tires from
Venezuela found that they were 100 to 1,000 times as likely to show
early signs of tread separation as even the recalled Firestone
tires in the United States, said a person who had seen the results.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigators for the House Commerce Committee visited
Bridgestone's U.S. headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., Monday seeking
evidence on what the company knew about its American tires and
when.

<P>
   Peru's top military court Monday revoked the life sentence
imposed more than four years ago on Lori Berenson, an American
accused of treason, and granted her a new trial in civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Supreme Military Justice Commission gave no
reason for the decision, and there was no immediate comment from
the office of President Alberto Fujimori, who had insisted for
years that Berenson would remain in prison for life as a convicted
terrorist. She had been charged with helping rebels of the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an aborted attack on Peru's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Grimaldo Achahui, said that the new trial would
begin soon, and that she would remain in prison until then.
</P>
<P>
   The Berenson case has long bedeviled relations between Peru and
the United States. In Washington Monday, the new development was
hailed by the State Department, which had criticized the conduct of
Berenson's trial in January 1996 and the harsh conditions of her
imprisonment, while not taking a stand on her guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased by the decision by the military court,''
said Philip Reeker, a department spokesman. ``Since Ms. Berenson's
conviction nearly five years ago, we have maintained that the trial
proceedings against her did not meet due-process standards, and so
we welcome the court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that ``there remain serious concerns
about the openness and fairness of trial proceedings in the
military court and in cases related to terrorism in civilian
courts.'' In this he echoed concerns outlined in a State Department
report issued in February that Peru's courts did not meet
international standards of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights officials and Berenson's parents also warned that
in a country whose court system has been sharply criticized, the
decision did not mean the new trial would be fair.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in front of their New York City apartment,
Berenson's parents demanded her immediate release. ``There is no
basis in truth or law for holding Lori another day,'' said her
father, Mark L. Berenson, adding that it was impossible for her
case to be heard in an impartial court.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, now 30, was tried in secret before a tribunal of
military judges wearing ski masks to conceal their identities. Her
lawyers were not permitted to cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, hundreds of Peruvian civilians were also being
tried in ``faceless'' courts, under emergency measures that the
government justified as necessary to combat guerrilla violence. But
in recent years, more than a thousand Peruvians convicted under the
draconian anti-terrorism law used to convict Berenson have been
pardoned and released after their cases were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But Berenson has languished, for the first three years in
Yanamayo, a high-mountain prison for terrorists, and then, after
she developed health problems including intermittent blindness in
one eye, in the lower-altitude Socabaya jail.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division
of Human Rights Watch, said it was not clear whether the same
anti-terrorism law would be used in Berenson's new trial. Under the
law, he said, ``the definition of terrorism is so broad and so
vague that almost any activity could qualify as terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivanco added that the new trial could be influenced by
political concerns whether or not the law was used. ``If there is
one serious problem in Peru,'' he said, ``it's lack of rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bank has suspended its programs on judicial reform
in Peru because there's no evidence of an independent judiciary,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons complained Monday that high-level Peruvian
officials and judges had made prejudicial comments about the guilt
of their daughter, whose defiant television appearance before her
first trial made her a controversial figure in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Her imprisonment even became a campaign issue when Alejandro
Toledo, the opposition candidate, said in April that he would
review her case if elected. Fujimori accused him of advocating her
release, and Toledo suffered in the polls as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, whose parents describe her as having been empathetic
with the downtrodden even as a child, grew up in Manhattan and
attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before beginning
extensive travels in Latin America in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 she moved to Peru, telling her parents that she wanted
to write magazine articles about the poverty and suffering she
found there.
</P>
<P>
   She does not deny that once there, she befriended the rebels,
but has said that she believed the group's violent history was
exaggerated. One of her attorneys, Thomas Nooter, has said that she
was romantically involved with the rebel who testified against her,
and that he may have incriminated her in exchange for a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Before her trial, an angry, defiant image of Berenson was
imprinted in the minds of Peruvians whose lives have been scarred
by terrorism. She was taken before journalists at a detention
center and filmed raising a fist to the cameras. ``If it is a crime
to worry about the sub-human conditions in which the majority of
this population lives,'' she said, ``then I will accept my
punishment.''

BUSH AND HIS OPPONENTS, ANOTHER TUG-OF-WAR DAY
</HEADLINE>
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to pull the campaign debate back onto
what he considers his turf, Gov. George W. Bush sharply attacked
Vice President Al Gore on education policy on Monday, asserting
that the Clinton Administration had complacently presided over ``a
national tragedy'' in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he tried to seize the offensive, Bush for the second
straight week found himself responding to criticisms from the Gore
campaign, which this time argued that he does not have a detailed
plan for creating a prescription drug benefit for the elderly. In a
sign that Gore's latest attack may have stung him a bit, Bush
announced in a news conference on Monday that he would spend part
of next week unveiling a proposal to have the government subsidize
prescription drug purchases by the low-income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's press office also spent much of the day hammering at
Gore's proposal to create a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare, asserting that the plan would effectively raise taxes for
most seniors citizens and nationalize prescription drug policies,
``similar to Hillary Clinton's attempt to nationalize health care
in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkably like Mrs. Clinton's plan,'' said Ari
Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ``It is a
government-run, one-size-fits-all plan. And just like her plan, the
Democrats thought it was popular and would put Republicans on the
defense. But once people look at the details, they will rebel
against it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the discussion of health care, Bush intended to kick off
this week's tour through New England, Ohio, Kentucky and
Pennsylvania to promote his ideas for revamping the nation's public
schools. He had also planned to spend last week discussing
education, but was knocked off message when he spent a good chunk
of time defending his plan to cut income taxes across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The push and pull between the two campaigns to control the
debate on Monday placed in clear relief the issues they consider to
be the strongest for each of their candidates. Aides to Gore assert
that voters trust Democrats more on health care, and they believe
that the more Bush is forced to talk about it, the better the vice
president will perform in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that is on Gore's territory,'' said an
advisor to the vice president. ``The Republicans just don't get it.
And they don't have a plan. So they fall back on tired old
rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign contends that the governor's focus on
improving education, particularly for poor and minority students,
underscores his commitment to ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore offers more of the same,'' Bush said on
Monday. ``He will not end the status quo because he is the status
quo. He offers the failed ideas of the past. I offer new ideas,
ideas that are working and that can appeal both to Republicans and
Democrats to break the gridlock of education in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   At his event outside the governor's mansion here on Monday, Bush
surrounded himself with teachers and school administrators from
Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan _ all important swing states _ who have
helped form a group called Educators for Bush that could provide a
counterweight, albeit a mostly symbolic one, to the powerful
teachers unions that support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Bush touted his plan for funneling federal money
to the parents of students in failing public schools so they could
attend other schools, public or private. He would also encourage
the growth of charter schools, require annual state reading tests
for students in grades 3 through 8, and reward districts that issue
report cards on their schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor devoted almost as much time to attacking Gore's
education policies as he did promoting his own. He asserted that
Gore's proposals would provide only ``the illusion'' of school
accountability. And he sharply criticized the Clinton
administration's record, citing seven and a half years of
``neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationwide, we are spending more on our public schools,'' he
said. ``But the achievement gap between rich and poor, minority and
non-minority, has remained the same or grown worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan focuses on increasing federal education spending by
$115 billion over 10 years for things like modernizing crumbling
schools, reducing class sizes and increasing teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is proposing real reforms and resources to improve our
public schools, while Bush is pushing a voucher plan that would
drain money away from our public schools,'' said Doug Hattaway, a
spokesman for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush's education event on Monday, he was pressed on health
care issues by reporters. Asked if he would sign legislation based
on a bipartisan Senate plan, Bush offered a conditional yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can make it better,'' he said. ``One idea is to
make sure low-income seniors are better helped in paying for
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, Karen Hughes, Bush's press secretary,
said it was not necessary for Bush to explain details of a
prescription drug plan, because those details could be left to the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   She also blamed the Clinton administration for ``a litany of
squandered opportunities'' in failing to win bipartisan support for
a prescription drug plan. ``That's seven and a half years of
failure,'' she said.

A GEYSER FILLED PARK TO LET OFF SOME STEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 3)  
 (Editors: A 430-word information box appears at end of 2nd take.)  
 By GERALD HERTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Just my luck,'' I muttered, gazing at the unattended welcome
sign to Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California.
``STOP. Pay $10 here,'' it said. All I had was a $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation was strong to ignore the demand. There was most
likely no ranger for miles around. But not wanting guilt to
jeopardize a good night's sleep, I placed the bill in an envelope,
attached a note asking for $10 change, and included my address. I
dropped it into the collection box, never expecting to see my $10
again. I had flown into Reno the night before, so there had been no
time to do much damage at the casino. Were my fortunes changing?
</P>
<P>
   The drive west from Reno that morning had covered 135 miles of
wide, green valleys crisscrossed with fast, churning rivers,
surrounded by low-lying pine-covered mountains. The landscape
became increasingly impressive as stately Lassen Peak rose 10,457
feet above the wooded landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Lassen Volcanic National Park, with its headquarters in Mineral,
Calif., is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the chain of volcanoes
along the rim of the Pacific Ocean that includes Mount Shasta in
California and Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. Lassen has
geologic features similar to Yellowstone's _ steam vents and
boiling mud pots _ though on a smaller scale. The peak itself is
one of the world's largest plug-dome volcanoes (a plug dome is
created when a volcano's expanding lava dome becomes so huge that
it plugs its own vent). Still considered potentially active, Lassen
Peak last erupted in 1914 and 1915. North of the mountain is what's
known as the Devastated Area, stripped of all vegetation by the
eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I reached the park entrance, I had completed 15 of
the 17 miles of Warner Valley Road, winding deep into the southern
end of the 106,000-acre park from the little town of Chester. My
compact rental car bounced and groaned along the rocky, rutted dirt
lane that crosses the final three miles to Drakesbad Guest Ranch,
the only lodging within the park.
</P>
<P>
   My visit last summer required getting on the waiting list two
years in advance just to try for reservations at one of only 19
spartan, rustic lodge rooms, cabins or more spacious bungalows. The
news had come in January, a year and a half later. Thanks to
cancellations, the five rooms our group had requested for a weekend
were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   After a few more jarring moments, I finally spotted the
weathered wood structures of Drakesbad Guest Ranch, among the tall
evergreens at the end of the road since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Drakesbad,'' Billie Fiebiger said, greeting me
warmly as I stepped into the dining hall that doubles as the
registration office. With her husband, Ed, Billie runs the ranch
during the short June-to-October season. They both know the
mountains; Ed is from Garmisch, Germany's well-known ski resort,
and Billie is from Bern, Switzerland; they moved here many years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though I wasn't scheduled to check in until later that
afternoon, Billie welcomed me to a free lunch of salads and
make-your-own sandwiches. The rest of my group, which consisted of
five families with various ties to our accounting firm in Orange
County, soon arrived in three separate vans from the day's various
starting points of nearby Redding, Chico and Red Bluff.
</P>
<P>
   We have been making these annual scenic outings together for
more than two decades. In the early years, the group consisted
mostly of myself and a few colleagues, who sought out rugged
backpacking adventures. Now, along with a client, we were joined by
four spouses and their seven children, ranging in age from 1 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Before lunch was over, Billie had taken a genuine interest in
helping us with plans for the weekend. Our general idea was to hike
to nearby thermal areas that day, then drive over to the west side
of the park the next day to climb Lassen Peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger children can join our kids club, which runs from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m.,'' Billie suggested. The older children, she
added, could make the 2.3-mile round-trip hike to Devil's Kitchen
to see the smoking steam vents and bubbling mud pots. The hardiest
hikers could continue on to Terminal Geyser, with its spouting
20-foot high steam plume. Everyone seemed agreeable, so we decided
to quickly unpack.
</P>
<P>
   Our rooms were on the second floor of the separate lodge
building. They were small, with wood paneling, one or two beds and
half baths. The showers were down by the hot-springs pool, which we
would become well-acquainted with after our hike. There are no
locks on the rooms (although you can secure them from the inside
with a chain.).
</P>
<P>
   The lodge's first floor was a single large room with a stone
fireplace at one end, comfortably furnished with soft chairs and
couches. An array of T-shirts and supplies were sold on a
self-serve honor basis.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we were off to Devil's Kitchen. The trail wove across a
wide meadow and into thick pine woods. Before long, the kids were
holding their noses. The distinct rotten-egg smell of sulfur
permeated the air. Then there was an opening in the woods and we
came to a clearing of desolate beauty. Steam billowed from several
pink-yellow, mounded rock cauldrons near and far. The heat and
minerals in the steam inhibited plant growth near these fumaroles.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-age boy in our group reveled in ignoring the numerous
warning signs to stay well back of the steam vents. Even I leaned
in too close to view a boiling mud pot nearby. A large bubble burst
from the thick pool of ooze, spraying my hat with hot mud drops;
luckily, I was not burned, like others who have ignored warnings
posted there. Suitably impressed with the strange phenomenon, we
returned to the ranch for a soothing swim in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was a delight. Our table of 16 was by far the largest of
a roomful of diners that totaled about 40, mostly families who
return year after year. The meal, prepared and served by the
friendly ranch staff, was surprisingly ambitious _ mahi-mahi in a
pineapple salsa, rice, mixed vegetables, salad and ice cream with
caramel sauce. Meals are included in the room price (the nearest
restaurant is back in Chester). Several moderately priced
California wines and rich German beers were available for an extra
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Later as we congregated around a campfire, the fixings for
s'mores appeared from the kitchen. Darkness fell. Soon the kids
were wide-eyed, cheeks sticky with marshmallows, listening to one
of their fathers start an eerie tale. They awoke often that night
to check under the bed for Big Foot.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning began with hearty breakfast choices of fruits,
juices, bagels and muffins, cereals and yogurt, topped off with a
hot cheese quiche served at the lodge's dining roomtable.
</P>
<P>
   Well fortified, the five men in our group plus 10-year-old
Monica and 16-year-old Tom grabbed the lunches we had ordered the
night before, and set out for Lassen Peak in one family's van.
Following Billie's advice, the others decided to seek adventures
closer to the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   We took a costly wrong turn, and by the time we returned to the
main road, Route 36, we had lost an hour. Finally, after two and a
half hours of driving, we approached the trail head to Lassen Peak.
</P>
<P>
   Starting up at 11:55, we were eager to reach the summit before
lunch. After a rapid start, the pace soon slowed, as the 8,500-foot
altitude and steep slope strewn with volcanic rock took their toll,
despite perfect weather.
</P>
<P>
   The gray mountain was still streaked with patches of snow and
there were intermittent trees on the lower reaches. We were passed
by an adventurer bearing skis, planning a more challenging descent.
</P>
<P>
   The steep two-and-a-half-mile trail is popular. For a while, I
hiked with a family from Ulm, Germany. I was dismayed to realize
that it had taken me and my companions 20 years to discover this
gem within our own state, only to find plenty of foreign visitors,
including travelers from England and France already enjoying
Lassen's splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular vistas greeted us at every turn as we moved up the
side of the mountain. The volcano is actually just a remnant on the
edge of huge Mount Tehama, which collapsed thousands of years ago,
forming the fascinating caldera defining the surrounding mountain
formations.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Jeff, two colleagues and the fastest of our group,
reached the summit by 1:15 p.m., with the rest of us staggering
over the last boulders at 1:30. At 10,457 feet, we were all a
little lightheaded, but energized by our accomplishment. Mount
Shasta beckoned nobly in the distance to the northwest. We feasted
on our box lunch _ sandwiches, fruit and chips _ amid the grandeur
of this once and future mountain of molten power. Although it was
crowded, there was room to stretch out for a nap.
</P>
<P>
   The hike down was much faster. By 3 p.m. we were driving back to
Drakesbad, passing the Sulphur Works thermal area. After a quick
stop in Chester for root beer floats, we headed to the ranch for
showers and a swim in the lodge's pool. We found the stay-at-homes
looking as weary as us. Their day had included horseback rides,
canoeing on the small, peaceful Dream Lake, and a respectable hike
to Terminal Geyser.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, we were rewarded with another delicious meal of prime
rib, steamed artichokes, mashed potatoes, salad and strawberry
cheesecake. Afterward, some still had energy for a round of
horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, seeking one last adventure, Larry, Jeff and I got up
at 6 and hiked a short mile from the ranch to Boiling Springs Lake,
one of dozens of fumaroles in the park. Approaching the rim, we
listened as the morning silence was broken by gurgling sounds. All
across the 300-yard diameter of the eerie lake, steam rose thickly
from the milky surface. The edge was ringed with bubbling mud pots.
</P>
<P>
   We hurried back to the ranch only to linger over a sumptuous
breakfast before leaving. Weeks later, as I thumbed through the
mail back home one day, I found an envelope from the National Park
Service. Inside was a $10 refund check.
</P>
<P>

CLINTON ADDS CAIRO STOP TO TEST WATERS FOR MIDEAST PEACE &HT;     

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Ending a whirlwind journey in Africa that
stretched from the Niger Gulf to the Nile, President Clinton
planned a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Tuesday to
discuss prospects of reviving the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the meeting, scheduled to last two to
four hours, was designed to get a reading from Mubarak about how he
and other Arab leaders feel about the prospects for a new round of
high-level meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The talks will be similar to the summit at Camp David, Md.,
between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat that collapsed in July.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations broke down over the issues of Jerusalem, which
both sides claim as their capital, and the right of Palestinians to
return to their lands in what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has planned a series of meetings with leaders close to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at next month's Millennium Summit
in New York. But Mubarak will be unable to attend.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. official on the president's Africa trip, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said, ``Quite clearly there will be no
progress without Mubarak's backing, so it is important for the
president to have this meeting, and the timing worked out for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said he did
not expect any decisive action from the Mubarak meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope will be furthered by this is the process by which
we can work with the Egyptians to try to get the parties closer
together,'' he said aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo stopover was added at the end of a three-day Africa
trip by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president began the trip in Nigeria, where he had saluted
that nation's new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the presidential party flew to Arusha, Tanzania, for peace
negotiations aimed at ending a civil war in the central African
nation of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential trip ends with the stopover in Cairo, where the
president's plane will be refueled.

COGNAC OF NAPOLEON IS PROMOTED AS STATUS SYMBOL OF URBANE BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may still be the self-proclaimed Le Cognac de Napoleon, but
Courvoisier is definitely not just the emperor's brandy anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it is still the favorite of some dinner-jacketed gentlemen
in wood- paneled rooms. But Courvoisier's future lies with a
different, more vibrant constituency, according to Stephanie
DeBartolomeo, marketing director for the brand at Allied Domecq
Spirits USA in Westport, Conn. It is to these people _ ``young,
urban adults who subscribe to hip-hop culture, the vast majority of
whom are African-American'' _ that the company, a unit of Allied
Domecq of London, has now decided to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   These consumers are different, she said. For one thing, ``they
drink twice as much Cognac as anyone else.'' For another, they
believe that Courvoisier is uniquely a ``symbol of stature and
class.'' That is because it is ``the only cognac that resonates as
French to them,'' even though all true Cognac must, by definition,
hail from western France. Consequently, Courvoisier is ``the only
liqueur that urban young adults actually call a fashion
accessory,'' DeBartolomeo said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the group's taste in music is said to define its taste
in other things, too, for its marketing efforts Courvoisier has
decided to go to the source: dRush LLC of New York, the joint
venture between Donny Deutsch, chairman of Deutsch Inc., and
Russell Simmons, the music and entertainment executive whose Rush
Communications group includes Def Jam Records, which helped kick
off rap music and hip hop, as well as Phat Pharm, the clothing
company, which sells the look in its own outlets and in department
stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And dRush has just introduced a campaign entitled House of
Courvoisier, intended to make Courvoisier appeal to ``urban
influential trend setters,'' the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which will also feature event sponsorships and
billboards, will run to ``considerably more than $5 million'' in
print and broadcast by year's end, DeBartolomeo said. It is set to
break next week with a four-page spread in the September issue of
Vogue and to continue through the autumn in magazines like Essence,
Vibe, Elle, GQ and XXL.
</P>
<P>
   The ads represent quite a departure from those in Courvoisier's
previous ``welcome to the state of Courvoisier'' campaign by Weiss
Stagliano Partners, which did not directly challenge notions of
Cognac as an after-dinner drink, and which featured unexplained,
puzzling photographs, like one that showed people running up a hill
toward a giant rock.
</P>
<P>
   That has all been changed. For example, two of the four pages
running in Vogue feature images of low-cut dresses and high-heeled,
zip-up boots emblazoned with tiny silhouettes of Napoleon. They
also feature pictures of cocktail glasses and suggest flat out that
Courvoisier should be drunk with ice or mixed with pineapple and
orange juice, an idea that might alarm Cognac purists but one that
is apparently in keeping with the way young consumers actually
drink the liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggest that the drink should henceforth be called by
the nickname ``CV.'' The reason: Courvoisier has become more than a
brandy; now it is also ``a badge,'' according to DeBartolomeo.
</P>
<P>
   Such a description might astonish the Emperor Bonaparte were he
around to hear it, especially because the ``CV'' the ads promote is
actually Courvoisier XO, which contains 25- to 30-year-old Cognac,
and is among the brand's most expensive products, retailing at $100
a bottle or more. But it makes perfect sense to Simmons, who calls
the images in his ads ``aspirational and decadent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Courvoisier has already got a certain kind of image, a certain
kind of attitude and integrity,'' he said. ``Our goal is to build a
strong base in the young community, and to market it without
cheapening it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has already attempted similar feats for other clients
like ESPN, HBO and Coca-Cola, for whom he created spots featuring
the rapper and actor L.L. Cool J, a Def Jam Records artist. But
there are those who think he faces a more formidable challenge this
time with Courvoisier, which sold 440,000 cases last year but lags
far behind the category leader Hennessy, which sold 1.38 million
cases, according to the Adams Handbook Advance, an industry
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courvoisier is an old brand and, over the years, it has fallen
back in the pack,'' said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark, a
beverage consultant in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``It has also been a
black brand of preference for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can find a way to integrate it to the spread of hip
hop, that could be really something,'' he continued. But while
Essence and Vibe ``are a much better match, I don't know how many
of your consumers you're going to find reading Vogue.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Simmons insists that Courvoisier's target
consumers are ``very into the American dream,'' and that they do
read Vogue. He said that he expected his campaign to catch on and
to ignite an enormous growth in Courvoisier. He believes that the
results will be immediately measurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't count their money,'' he said, ``then I haven't
done my job.''

TO BE YOUNG, TALENTED AND MARGINALIZED IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Being a young designer in New York _ and the city
seems flush with new talent now _ hardly means that one will
survive to be an old designer in New York. The fashion business
here, especially, functions with a kind of Darwinian magnanimity.
Either you're good or you're gone.
</P>
<P>
   Talent alone doesn't ensure survival, as Isaac Mizrahi found
out. Nor is financial success the only measure of fashion
greatness. Can anyone really say that Ralph Lauren is a better
designer than Stephen Burrows?
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the designers who have risen in Mizrahi's wake
seem to possess neither his exciting talent nor his old-fashioned
skills of self-promotion. They are often shy, inarticulate, vague
to the point of appearing self-consciously cool, and even when they
become stars, as Miguel Adrover did this year, there is something
so reticent in their demeanor as to make one wonder if the very
notion of the designer as a personality isn't dead. ``I would like
to hide myself,'' Adrover said last Thursday in his new workroom on
the Bowery. ``But in the United States, that is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a way, the era of personality has ended. Ten or 15 years
ago, when designers like Donna Karan and Michael Kors were building
their businesses, and Todd Oldham, Marc Jacobs and Mizrahi were
emerging, it was assumed that they would seek the same
tried-and-true laurels. The cover of Vogue. The limousine lines of
store executives and editors stretching outside their shows. The
distinction, so American, of being hailed by their first names.
</P>
<P>
   In ways that fulfill the ideal of the self-made, individualistic
designer, they did aspire to those things. But it is also true that
in the last few years, as these designers have dropped out or taken
their companies public, or merged them into larger companies, the
story has shifted from personality and toward business. It is a
comment, if not on this change then on the way the industry is
responding, that for all the attention being paid to fashion, and
for all the names filling next month's show calendar in New York,
no single new designer has stood out. It isn't even clear that the
brightest star wants to. As Adrover said: ``I don't feel that
connected to the glamour of the fashion world. I hang out with my
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   There used to be cachet attached to young designers _ or poets
or musical artists _ whose work bubbled to the surface through some
underground channel of discontent or outrage. One thinks
immediately of Vivienne Westwood and her punk consort Malcolm
McLaren changing the name of their London shop five times to
reflect each new subtle wave of style. Or of Rudi Gernreich, who
was a rebel in his own way in California in the 1960s. Yet, because
of the speed with which change occurs, the underground doesn't mean
what it once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder for something to remain underground now because
there's so much more information telling you where the underground
is,'' Julie Gilhart, a vice president of Barneys, said. Like a lot
of store buyers, Gilhart scans indie magazines like Dutch, I.D. and
Purple for the names of new designers. It was in one of those
magazines that she first came across the label United Bamboo, a
sportswear line designed in New York by Miho Aoki and Thuy Pham.
``Their clothes are adorable and very nicely made,'' she said.
``They're serious but also funny in that polished/unpolished way
that you see on girls in Japan.'' Barneys is carrying United Bamboo
for fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a true underground _ and the avant-garde has
never gained much lasting credibility here _ many young designers
who have something inventive to say find themselves struggling in
the margins. Among those who are worth watching are Alice Roi,
whose shapely suits and neck-tie blouses play up some of the
feminine cliches (secretarial glam, librarian frumpiness) that were
first explored by Susan Cianciolo; Sonja Rubin and Kip Chapelle,
who combine strict tailoring with fluid hand-knits that often defy
you to guess how they're made; and Bruce, which is designed by
Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli, and has consistently been in
the vanguard of a cerebral, slightly helter-skelter femininity.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, when a reporter phoned Noselli to make an
appointment, with the intention of including Bruce in an article
about designers preparing for the collections, her response said a
great deal about how her generation thinks. She said, ``Frankly,
you'd just be in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was endearing. The two Bruce designers were up to their
eyeballs in work, as they recalled last week in their Lower East
Side apartment, which is also their studio, and what, honestly, did
they need a reporter around for? How could they explain themselves,
the day-to-day struggle _ no money, but above all, no time _
without the whole thing sounding like some Andy Hardy tale? It
might be eye-opening _ but who needs it? ``People think that
because we're young designers we'll do anything,'' Noselli said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day Greg Mills, a former president of Isaac
Mizrahi, who owns a showroom that represents Bruce and a dozen
other lines, including the men's wear label Richard Edwards, gets
calls from young designers looking for help. Lack of capital is
obviously a problem. So is striking a balance between artistic
integrity and commercial viability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just keeps getting harder,'' said Cianciolo, whose fall
production of only 400 pieces neither helps her bottom line nor
reflects her influence.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Mills suggested, the real problem may be an industry
that is increasingly dominated by a few brands. ``I recently got a
call from an owner of a men's store who told me he basically writes
three checks _ one each to LVMH, the Gucci group and Prada,'' Mills
said. ``That's unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, none of these designers want to create clothes
that are novel but don't sell. ``I sometimes feel as if I'm in a
race: we've got to win,'' Roi said. Her 15-month-old company, which
is being financed by her mother, produced about 1,200 pieces for
fall, and they are sold at Kirna Zabete and Fred Segal. ``We want
people to wear the clothes, not keep them so underground.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Adrover's aim, too. ``I still scratch through the
garbage, because that's my nature,'' he said. ``But I don't use the
word `avant-garde,' and I don't feel like a downtown designer,
either. It's about showing a different view.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fashion business _ especially in New York _ is
nothing if not a prolonged search for the obvious. Two designers
who will not be on the runways this fall are Aoki and Pham of
United Bamboo, though not because they are shy or too cool but
rather because, for now, they think it's better to focus on
developing their business. Pham, who several years ago was part of
a maverick but short-lived design company called Bernadette Corp.,
said that after a while ``designers start to find that it's their
business, doing shows.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I would like to consider doing something like APC or
Polo, more of a lifestyle kind of business where the design doesn't
change every season.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, who happened to be wearing a red-striped little boy's
shirt from Ralph Lauren with one of her charming wraparound skirts,
looked at Pham doubtfully. ``That might get boring,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pham smiled slightly. ``I don't think so,'' he said. &QL;

INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES TEST FOR EPO 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS grafs 9-12 and three grafs at end with details)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee's
executive board announced Monday that it had approved plans to
carry out tests for the banned synthetic hormone known as EPO at
next month's Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, the board member from the United States, called
the approval ``a significant test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a reminder to any cowardly athlete who doesn't have
confidence in himself or herself to compete without crutches or
stay home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic erythropoietin has been the performance-enhancing
drug of choice in cycling and other endurance sports for much of
the past decade, but the extent of the abuse was not clear until a
large cache of EPO was found in an official Tour de France car
driven by a Belgian employee of one of the competing teams in 1998.
After that, efforts accelerated to detect the substance, which was
initially developed to treat kidney transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Schamasch, the IOC's medical director, said testing
would begin in Australia on Saturday and continue through the
Sydney Olympics, which begin Sept. 15 and conclude Oct. 1.
Schamasch said that a minimum of 300 random EPO tests would be
administered, but that the IOC hoped to administer at least a
hundred more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The new IOC-approved test requires both a blood sample and a
urine sample. For reasons of hygiene, Schamasch said, the tests
will be administered ``out of competition'' instead of at sports
sites, where conventional urine tests are traditionally
administered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to say which sports we are going to target,
but we will make sure we target the right sports,'' said Dr.
Jacques Rogge, the executive board member from Belgium, who is also
vice president of the IOC's medical commission.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been blood testing or out-of-competition testing
in any form at the Summer Games. The IOC modified the Olympic
charter last year to allow for blood testing, and athletes will
have to sign a form upon arrival in Sydney agreeing to submit to
it. Rogge said that any athlete who refuses, even on religious
grounds, will not be allowed to participate and any athlete who
refuses after competing will be disqualified retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very fine day for us,'' said Rogge, who indicated
that progress had also been made toward developing a test for human
growth hormone (hGH), an- other banned substance which is believed
to be widely used and remains undetect- able.

<P>
   The IOC has been criticized internally (by Arne Ljunqvistof
Sweden) and exter- nally (by Richard Quick, the U.S. women's
Olympic swim team coach) for failing to direct enough funds into
human growth hormone testing research.
</P>
<P>
   ``With hGH, we are in the same phase as with EPO one month ago;
the problem is with validation,'' said Rogge, who made it clear
that it could take several months more.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as April, IOC officials considered it unlikely an
EPO test would be ready for Sydney, but with an acceler- ated
validation timetable and the com- bined efforts of French
researchers, who developed a urine test, and Australian
researchers, who developed a blood test, the test was approved.
</P>
<P>
   To test positive for EPO, an athlete must test positive in both
the blood and urine samples. The urine test developed by French
researchers, which could not be validated in time for use during
this year's Tour de France, can detect synthetic EPO injected in
the previous three days. The blood test developed by Australians,
which requires 12 milliliters of blood to be removed by syringe
from an athlete's arm, can detect EPO use up to 20 days after the
fact. But unlike the French test, it detects EPO by an indirect
method based on probabilities and young red blood cell
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the blood test's indirect nature, IOC officials were
not confident it alone could withstand legal challenges, but after
the medical commission approved the two-pronged test earlier this
month, the IOC's legal commission approved it on Sunday and
recommended approval to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there will still be legal challenges,'' Rogge said.
``But we expect that the scientific validation we have and legal
study we've done will convince every judge of our rights.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another significant move Monday, the executive board cut the
number of candidate cities for the 2008 Summer Games to five from
10. The survivors are: Beijing; Osaka, Japan; Paris; Toronto; and,
in the least convincing fashion, Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote is scheduled for next July 15, at the IOC meeting
in Moscow, one day before the full membership is scheduled to elect
a successor to the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. But
for now and despite the vote-buying scandal involving the Salt Lake
City bid that shook the Olympic movement last year, the 80-year-old
Samaranch remains in charge. Monday's winnowing process was the
first phase of the new selection system that he lobbied belatedly
to put in place in order to reduce the chronic influence-peddling
that plagued the former process.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members who are not part of the small evaluation commission
are no longer permitted to visit bidding cities, and the
assessments of the 10 prospective hosts were made by a working
group on the basis of questionnaires filled out by the applicants
and with the help of outside experts in transport,
telecommunications and financial and legal affairs. In the next
phase, the evaluation commission will visit the five bid cities and
prepare detailed reports to present to the full membership.
</P>
<P>
   These five cities were eliminated from contention for 2008, in
descending order of quality as determined by the working group:
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Seville, Spain; Bangkok, Thailand; Cairo,
Egypt, and Havana. Istanbul also did not meet the minimum
acceptable grade established by the working group, but the
executive board, essentially the board of directors, decided by a
majority vote to allow Istanbul to bid because its candidacy was
considered the strongest of the second tier.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, Osaka, Paris and Toronto were all approved unanimously
by the board, which declined to establish a pecking order, although
Beijing, which lost by only two votes to Sydney in the bidding for
the 2000 Games, is considered the early favorite. China's human
rights record, considered a factor in Beijing's loss in 1993, is
again expected to be a major campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that our human rights situation is not perfect, just
like in every country in the world,'' the executive board member He
Zhenliang of China said. ``You cannot say France has no problems.
You cannot say Japan or America have no problems. But what we
should do is let the Olympic Games be a means to help this country
improve its social environment, including human rights, and not use
this as an instrument to go against.''
</P>
<P>
   The human rights prob- lem is a problem that can only be solved
through mutual understand- ing and common efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the executive board has the power to further reduce the
field before next year's final vote, Fran- cois, the IOC's director
general, said that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The EPO tests will be adminis- tered throughout Australia before
the Games as athletes participate in training camps, and in Sydney
_ primarily in the Olympic Village once the Games begin. A record
total of 3,200 drug tests, including 800 ``out of competition''
urine tests in an at- tempt to detect fast-clearing modern anabolic
steroids, are scheduled to be administered to the approximate- ly
10,400 competing athletes.

F.C. BOCK, MONITOR OF NAGASAKI BOMBING, DIES AT 82
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Mass. Colo., Mich., Ill, Britain, Japan)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick C. Bock, a retired scientific researcher who piloted
one of the planes monitoring the drop of the atomic bomb on
Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, died on Friday at his home in
Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Bock flew a plane used to measure and photograph the devastating
explosion. It came three days after the first bomb destroyed
Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   A civilian observer on Bock's B-29 Superfortress was William L.
Laurence, science writer for The New York Times, whose account of
the mission won the Pulitzer Prize for reporting in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence, in his book ``Dawn Over Zero'' (Knopf, 1946),
described how the nine men of the crew and the plane's maze of
instruments had melded into a single smoothly functioning unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Capt. Frederick C. Bock, the pilot of our ship, go
through the intricate motions of lifting a B-29 off the ground and
marveled at the quiet efficiency of this Michigan boy who had
majored in philosophy at Chicago University,'' Laurence wrote. ``I
talked to him on the ground and I was amazed at the transformation
that had taken place. Man and machine had become one, a modern
centaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Greenville, Mich., Frederick Carl Bock graduated from
the University of Chicago in 1939 and enrolled in a graduate
program in philosophy. When the United States entered World War II,
he enlisted in the Army Air Forces and became a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   He flew combat missions from India across ``the Hump'' of the
Himalayas. Later he was part of heavy bombing raids against
Japanese targets flown out of China.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected for the 509th Composite Group of B-29s, secretly
assembled in December 1944 under Col. Paul Tibbets, who commanded
the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the bomb over Hiroshima. In
the second raid, Bock's instrument plane was dubbed Great Artiste,
while his squadron commander, Maj. Charles Sweeney, flew the
captain's usual bomber, which he had named Bockscar, to drop the
bomb on Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Bock rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Distinguished
Flying Cross and the Air Medal. After the war he returned to
Chicago for his doctorate, specilizing in genetics and
mathematical statistics.
</P>
<P>
   While working at research institutes in Chicago, he developed
algorithms for efficient strategies to solve complex problems. He
retired in 1986 as a research scientist for Baxter Travenol
Laboratories, for which he established a mathematical model of
peritoneal dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Bock is survived by his wife of 53 years, Helen Lossman Bock;
two daughters, Katherine Jocz of Cambridge, Mass., and Heidi
Teraberry of Arvada, Colo.; a son, Wyman, of Cheam, England; a
sister, Gretchen Bock of Phoenix; two grandsons; and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The Bockscar is on display at the Air Force Museum near Dayton,
Ohio. But for all the individual medals for their crews, the 509th
as a unit never got an official decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Only last September, and partly on Bock's prompting, the
secretary of the Air Force awarded the squadron the Air Force
Outstanding Unit Award, with valor, for exceptional service in
combat.

GOP DRUG AD RATES LOW ON ACCURACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ark., Del., La., Mich., Mo., Ohio, Pa., Wash. Wis.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee began showing a new
commercial, ``Priority MD'' in nine states on Monday. Dealing with
prescription drugs, the commercial takes on the issue that has
grabbed center stage in the presidential campaign. The Democratic
National Committee plans to answer it, starting Tuesday, in the
same nine states _ Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan,
Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Cold Harbor Films
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The commercial opens with a shot of prescription
drug bottles. Then Bush speaking in front of an American flag,
meeting with elderly people, shaking hands at an airport rally and
speaking from a podium. Vice President Al Gore is shown, looking
embarrassed, on television. Then, reinforcing the words of the
announcer, graphics declare: ``Interfere with doctors,'' ``The Gore
Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide,'' and ``The Bush Rx Plan:
Seniors Choose.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial closes with a glimpse of Bush, campaigning in
shirt sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: Narrator: Under Clinton-Gore, prescription drug
prices have skyrocketed _ and nothing's been done. George Bush has
a plan: add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Every senior will have access to prescription drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: And Al Gore? Gore opposed bipartisan reform. He's
pushing a big-government plan that lets Washington bureaucrats
interfere with what your doctors prescribe. The Gore prescription
plan: bureaucrats decide. The Bush prescription plan: seniors
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: On its central claim, zero. Bush does not have a
prescription drug plan. He has said he likes some elements of plans
proposed in Congress, but has not endorsed any. His running mate,
Dick Cheney, said on Sunday, ``We will shortly have a detailed
proposal to put forth.'' When the commercial accuses Gore of
favoring a plan that would let bureaucrats override doctors'
prescriptions, it is mistaken. The administration proposal would
involve hiring private industry managers, like those who administer
insurance plans today. The managers could establish lists of drugs
allowable under Medicare, but those limits could be overridden by
any doctor whose prescription identified a particular drug as
``medically necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORE CARD: Political advertisements that are flat wrong in
essential elements are rare, and that failing may handicap their
effectiveness. But otherwise it is a classic ``contrast''
commercial that both advocates a policy and attacks the opponent's
approach. Extensive research has found this sort of political
advertisement more effective than either pure attack advertisements
or those that are only self-promotional.
</P>

Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/politics.) &QL;

   CRUCIAL CONCESSION MADE ON MINIMUM WAGE BILL
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert offered crucial concessions to
Democrats on a plan to raise the federal minimum wage, moving to
end months of stalemate on a popular bill that Republicans feared
could damage them at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate earlier this year approved an increase in

The gain put the blue-chip index less than 30 points from its April
11 high of 11,287.08. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also
neared a record, climbing 7.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,514.09.

MEXICAN ENVIRONMENTALIST IS FOUND GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY, Mexico _ A poor indigenous farmer was found guilty
Monday of drugs and weapons crimes and sentenced to nearly seven
years in prison, closing a case that led to outrage among
environmental groups around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The groups consider the farmer, Rudolfo Montiel Flores, 44, to
be a political prisoner, saying his only crime was to organize
protests against loggers who were cutting forests around his
village north of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gunmen killed several members of a rural ecological
group led by Montiel. In May 1999, Montiel said that he was
detained and tortured by soldiers who forced him to sign statements
that confessed to marijuana cultivation and possession of illegal
arms.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Mexican National Human Rights Commission said
that his rights had been violated, and that evidence against him
had been planted.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel was arrested and convicted with a friend, Teodoro
Cabrera Garcia, who was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the men pledged to appeal the sentences, issued by a
district judge in the state of Guerrero, and to help organize
protests to reignite interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Amnesty International in Mexico City said they would
urge President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada to dismiss the sentences
against the two men after he takes office in December.

   INTEL RECALLS NEW CHIPS
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. said Monday that it has recalled its fastest chip _
the 1.13 gigahertz Pentium III _ because the chip could cause
system errors when running certain programs at a particular
temperature and voltage. The problem is with certain circuits of
the chip that have been shown to malfunction in laboratory tests
running either a standard industry test called Sysmark2000 or a
particular Linux compiler, said Michael Sullivan, an Intel
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it has received no reports from customers, but Dell
Computer and IBM have stopped shipping PCs with the processor.
Sullivan said few of the processors have been shipped to date, and
that a replacement should be ready within two months. He said the
recall would not affect Intel's financial results. Some analysts
agreed, saying the injury would be primarily to Intel's pride,
especially since its archrival, Advanced Micro Devices, began
shipping a 1.1 gigahertz version of its Athlon chip Monday.

GORE PUSHES HEALTH CARE ISSUES IN FLORIDA &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
GORE-HEALTHCARE1stLD WRITETHRU Editors: adds new material 
 
By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Campaigning in a battleground state home to
many senior citizens, Vice President Al Gore said Monday that
prescription drug pricing that makes the same medication cheaper
for animals than for humans is especially harmful to the elderly
and should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the ability to dictate the price,'' Gore said of the
nation's drug companies. ``But they know the market for cats and
dogs won't bear as high a price, so they have the power to dictate
a much lower price to the veterinarian's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Florida on the first stop of a week that will focus
on health care, specifically his proposal to extend prescription
drug benefits under the Medicare program to an estimated 40 million
people at a cost of $250 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would provide a prescription drug benefit with the
government paying half a patient's annual cost up to $5,000. The
plan, which would be funded by projected budget surplus funds, also
would cover catastrophic drug expenses over $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of several dozen senior citizens on the
Florida State University campus, Gore described how his
mother-in-law and the family Labrador are prescribed the same
medication for different ailments, with the dog's monthly
prescription bill totaling far less.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said such disparities are disturbing at a time when many
senior citizens on fixed incomes are forced to either go without
other necessities or cut back on their medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is time to say to every senior in this country,
we have come to the point when we can improve Medicare by giving a
prescription drug benefit to every single senior in this country,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with the start of Gore's health care week, the
Republican National Committee began airing $7 million in new
advertising critical of Gore's proposals, claiming the vice
president is ``pushing a big government plan that lets Washington
bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, has not outlined
the specifics of his own proposal on health care, but has indicated
preference for letting seniors choose among a variety of private
plans, some of which may offer prescription drug benefits. He said
in Austin on Monday that he'll provide more details next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett called Gore's proposal a
``one-size-fits-all, government-run drug plan,'' and compared it to
the failed 1993 attempt by the Clinton administration to establish
a national health care program.
</P>
<P>
   After campaigning in the Florida capital, Gore headed for a
Monday night rally in Albuquerque, N.M. Other health care-related
events for Gore this week include a talk Tuesday in Albuquerque on
children's health coverage, and a rally later this week in support
of a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said aboard Air Force Two en route to New Mexico that
``it's put up or shut up time'' for Bush to offer detailed plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for generalities without specifics is kind of over,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the voters deserve a chance to compare agendas, Gore said
he welcomes a critical debate of his own proposals and looks
forward to ``a vigorous competition of ideas'' in this election.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what is fueling the ongoing focus on health care is data
showing voters rating it as an important issue in this year's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the audience at FSU that he would work to improve
health care coverage for veterans, saying health care benefits and
retirement security are among his top campaign priorities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great hurdles, he said, is how high prescription drug
costs have risen since Medicare was created 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting his struggles to care for a handicapped adult son,
Arthur Flatt, 77, said he and his wife saved for their retirement
but soon found the costs of family health care overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we turn around, we get sick,'' said Flatt.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt, with his voice breaking, told Gore that getting a
reduction on prescription drug prices would allow him to pay for
home health care for his son, a one-time engineer who suffered a
brain aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're carrying a heavier burden than you should have to
carry,'' Gore said, embracing the man.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Dixie, 74, told Gore that it's ``really depressing''
seeing her friends forego their medicine to pay for food, a choice
Dixie said she also is sometimes forced to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can handle the pain, but there are a lot of people
who can't do it,'' Dixie said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, perspiring under the hot lights while he empathized in
turn with members of the audience, encouraged hesitant speakers
with ``I hear ya's'' and frequently intoned ``Bless you, God bless
you.''

MOMA AND UNION FINALLY MEET IN STRIKE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Museum of Modern Art and the union representing
its 250 administrative workers will hold negotiations next week in
what will be the first face-to-face talks between the two sides
since the union went out on strike four months ago, management and
union officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Batterman, the museum's chief negotiator, said in an
interview that he contacted a federal mediator last week to tell
her that the museum thought it was time for her to bring the two
sides together.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, negotiators for the two sides said that the
mediator, Kathleen Murray-Cannon, had repeatedly declined to bring
the two sides together because she did not think such a meeting
would result in meaningful progress.
</P>
<P>
   Maida Rosenstein, president of the union local representing the
strikers, said the museum requested the negotiations because of two
recent union successes in pressuring, even embarrassing, the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the union, Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers,
released a letter signed by 125 prominent artists that criticized
the museum for refusing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which also asked the public to honor the picket line
in front of the museum, was signed by, among others, Robert
Rauschenberg, Barbara Kruger, Eric Fischl, Sol LeWitt, Steven
Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Bill T.
Jones and Susan Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman said: ``Of course the museum was troubled by the fact
that 125 artists signed such a letter. It is unfortunate that they
didn't have all the facts. The letter proceeded from a totally
fallacious assumption, namely that the museum was refusing to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week, after intense lobbying by the union, the
Manhattan members of the City Council failed to give the museum
majority backing for the zoning variance it needs for its
renovation and expansion project estimated at more than $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the whole City Council votes against granting a
zoning variance when a majority of the delegation from the affected
borough fails to recommend such a variance.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman said neither the artists' letter nor the action by the
Manhattan council members caused the museum to ask for the talks.
Rather, he said, the museum asked to resume negotiations because he
thought it was wrong that no talks had been held for such a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenstein insisted that the museum had repeatedly blocked
any resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   On April 28, the union, which represents librarians, assistant
curators, visitor assistants, bookstore workers and others began
its strike. About half of the 250 workers represented by the
bargaining unit have since returned to work.
</P>
<P>
   Since the strike began, workers have often shouted and banged
steel bars in front of the museum. The workers are demanding that
health benefits remain intact without any reductions and that all
newly hired administrative workers be required to join the union or
pay union dues. The union also wants management to agree to rehire
all workers who will be laid off during the renovation project,
which will entail closing large parts of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of labor leaders attending the New York State AFL-CIO
convention in Manhattan joined the strikers Monday afternoon to
picket in front of the museum.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRM PLANS THEME PARK IN CHINA  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a champagne toast marking the historic
occasion, the Landmark Entertainment Group signed a contract to
design a world-class theme park in China.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Christopher, Landmark's president and chief executive
officer, said Monday that the Yangtze Theme Park on more than 100
acres will be the ``most expensive theme park ever built in
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   A joint project with the Wuhan Yangtze Entertainment Development
Co. LTD, the entertainment complex will be built in Wuhan, in the
Hubie province of central China. Construction will begin in January
of next year and is scheduled to be completed in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy to sign this design contract with
Landmark,'' Mao Dong Sheng, chairman of Wuhan Yangtze
Entertainment, said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the Yangtze Theme Park will set a new standard for
theme parks around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher said it took two years of negotiations to reach this
point. Landmark has also invested an undisclosed amount in the
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think China is an incredible market in terms of future
growth,'' he said. ``We think we can build something that the
Chinese people can be proud of and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Landmark has designed and produced other attractions in China,
as well as in South Korea and the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landmark Asia, which is based in Seoul, South Korea, oversees
our projects in Asia,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Goddard, chairman of Landmark, said, ``This is the first
theme park in China that will combine the best of the East and West
to create a very unique attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   He said attractions at Yangtze Theme Park will include a roller
coaster, a high-tech simulator ride and a twin dragon Ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard said half of the park will feature Chinese-theme rides
and attractions, while the other half of the theme park will
feature attractions from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This theme park will be to China what Disneyland meant to
Southern California when Disneyland opened in 1955,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1980, the company based in North Hollywood, Calif.,
has designed and built entertainment venues around the world,
including Terminator 2/3D for Universal Studios Florida, the
Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas and Star Trek: The Experience for
Paramount Parks.

FINAL CHAPTER IN ATTICA UPRISING: SETTLEMENT CAPS LONG LEGAL
BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for rewriting throughout. Adds optional 2nd take, 600 words) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Declaring that inmates beaten in the 1971
Attica prison uprising were treated ``like garbage,'' a federal
judge divided up an $8 million settlement on Monday to compensate
more than 500 inmates and relatives for the abuse that the
prisoners suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The allotment of the landmark settlement caps one of the longest
and most ignominious chapters in U.S. criminal justice history,
fleshing out a deal reached in January between New York state and
lawyers representing 1,281 former inmates.
</P>
<P>
   At more than 200 pages, the settlement reads like a harrowing
encyclopedia of personal anecdotes, incorporating months of
testimony from nearly 200 former inmates who stood before U.S.
District Judge Michael Telesca and recounted the uprising and siege
at the prison in western New York that left 43 people dead, 80
wounded and countless more psychologically scarred.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after almost three decades of waiting and legal
maneuvering, the former inmates are scheduled to receive their
shares by October.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Telesca wrote in his decision, most of the awards _ from
$6,500 to $125,000 per former inmate _ were modest sums. Many of
the inmates and their lawyers agreed, adding that no amount of
money could compensate them or resolve an episode that has become a
symbol of prison life and state-sanctioned brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it is history does not mean it is all in the
past,'' Telesca wrote. ``Indeed, Attica is the ghost that has never
stopped haunting its survivors _ both the inmates and the families
of the deceased guards and prison personnel. But at least the
settlement of this case provides the basis for the former inmates
to close the book on the past and to focus on the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the judge devoted the bulk of his decision to
short but powerful summaries of each inmate's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Frank B.B. Smith, for instance, was stripped naked, pelted with
hot and spent shell casings and threatened with castration during
the uprising. He was awarded $125,000, the highest amount.
</P>
<P>
   For George Nieves, Attica was primarily a nightmare of the mind.
Like so many others, he was punched, beaten and forced to crawl in
the mud. But what still unsettles him is the memory of a guard
drawing a giant target-like ``X'' on his back. He received $6,500,
the lowest amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really made me paranoid,'' Nieves said in a telephone
interview from Mount Vernon, N.Y., where he is social worker.
``Attica always continues.''
</P>
<P>
   For Josh Melville, Attica was simply the haunted place where his
father, Samuel, was fatally shot. So he traveled from Florida to
Rochester to introduce a forensic ballistic report and photographs
to bolster his claim that his father was murdered. He was awarded
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   And on it went, story after cathartic story, littered with
``brutal beatings and acts of torture'' and unlimited racial
epithets, Telesca wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Telesca approved 502 claims and divided the awards
into five categories based on the severity of the injuries: $6,500,
$10,000, $31,000 and $125,000 for the inmates, and $25,000 for the
relatives of the inmates who died during the uprising. More than
half fell into the $6,500 category; only 15 qualified for $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was understandable, perhaps, that there was no celebration
after Monday's settlement order. The case was a maddeningly slow
one, outlasting hundreds of inmates who have died since the
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in fact, was the only former inmate who attended a news
conference organized by lawyers for several of the former inmates _
and that is because he now works as a paralegal with Elizabeth
Fink, the principal lawyer, on prisoners' rights cases. ``It's not
about the money; money would not compensate if it was $125 million,
Smith said. ``I want everybody to concentrate, everybody, on what
happened at Attica and how we can prevent that.''  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The uprising began on Sept. 9, 1971, when inmates at the Attica
Correctional Facility, about 30 miles east of Buffalo, took several
guards hostage, seized control of parts of the prison and demanded
improvements in prison conditions. When negotiations stalled, Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller ordered the retaking of Prison Yard D and
authorized state troopers to storm the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers used helicopters, dropped tear gas and fired
indiscriminately into a crowd of 1,281 prisoners. Then, after
regaining control, prison guards and law enforcement officials
forced inmates to crawl naked over broken glass and denied them
rudimentary medical care.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the five-day siege, 11 guards and 32 prisoners had
died.
</P>
<P>
   For years, though, all efforts to exact an official apology,
much less legal redress, achieved little. The widows of some guards
killed during the melee sued, with varied results. A class-action
suit against the state, filed on behalf of the 1,281 inmates,
languished for 18 years before going to a liability trial, and an
additional 5 to reach the damages phase.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Smith won a $4 million jury verdict in Buffalo, while
David Brosig, another inmate who had been in the D Yard, won
$75,000. But a federal appellate court reversed those verdicts last
year, saying that the trial judge, John T. Elfvin, had mishandled
the case. As a result, the case wound up with Telesca.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a deal materialized: the state agreed to set aside
$12 million, the biggest ever in a prisoners' rights case, with $8
million for the former inmates and $4 million for lawyers' fees. As
is routine in settlements, the defendants admitted neither
wrongdoing nor liability.
</P>
<P>
   To divide up the $8 million, Telesca asked the plaintiffs to
tell their stories in open court. From May to August, almost 200
did, in what turned out to be an emotional and often wrenching
experience, Fink said.
</P>
<P>
   One former inmate, Charles L. Williams, told the judge that the
beatings to his right leg were so severe that his leg had to be
amputated below the knee in 1998. He has suffered from
post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse and nightmares. He
was eventually awarded $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm leaving Attica here today, Your Honor,'' Hitchens said.
``I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to live it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, the plaintiffs will receive a letter from
the judge outlining his decision. But those who heard about their
fate on Monday through reporters said that while they were
disappointed, there was very little choice, this late in the
process. Many said that they did not know what they would do with
the money, other than pay some bills and debts.
</P>
<P>
   And while the money, presumably, will eventually be gone, the
memories will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to go away,'' said George Alexander Shorts
Jr., a Brooklyn resident whose toes were broken during the
uprising. He was awarded $31,000. ``I had blocked a lot of things
out, but going before the judge, a lot of this stuff came back, and
a lot of it hurt. Thank God it's over.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Peru's top military court Monday revoked the life sentence
imposed more than four years ago on Lori Berenson, an American
accused of treason, and granted her a new trial in civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Supreme Military Justice Commission gave no
reason for the decision, and there was no immediate comment from
the office of President Alberto Fujimori, who had insisted for
years that Berenson would remain in prison for life as a convicted
terrorist. She had been charged with helping rebels of the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an aborted attack on Peru's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One of her lawyers, Grimaldo Achahui, said that the new trial
would begin soon, and that she would remain in prison in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights officials and the Berenson family were not
satisfied by the plan for a new trial. They said her first trial
was unfair, and that they had no confidence the second would be any
better.
</P>
<P>
   The Berenson case has long bedeviled relations between Peru and
the United States, and the new trial may represent a gesture by
Peru to soothe relations, especially after the country's recent
tarnished presidential election. Fujimori was re &UR; - &LR; elected in May
after a campaign marked by irregularities and charges of voter
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Monday, the new development was hailed by the
State Department, which had criticized the conduct of Berenson's
trial in January 1996 and the harsh conditions of her imprisonment,
while not taking a stand on her guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased by the decision by the military court,''
said Philip Reeker, a department spokesman. ``Since Ms. Berenson's
conviction nearly five years ago, we have maintained that the trial
proceedings against her did not meet due-process standards, and so
we welcome the court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that ``there remain serious concerns
about the openness and fairness of trial proceedings in the
military court and in cases related to terrorism in civilian
courts.'' In this he echoed concerns outlined in a State Department
report issued in February that Peru's courts did not meet
international standards of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights officials and Berenson's parents also warned that
in a country whose court system has been sharply criticized, the
decision did not mean the new trial would be fair.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in front of their New York City apartment,
Berenson's parents demanded her immediate release. ``There is no
basis in truth or law for holding Lori another day,'' said her
father, Mark L. Berenson, adding that it was impossible for her
case to be heard in an impartial court.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, now 30, was tried in secret before a tribunal of
military judges wearing ski masks to conceal their identities. Her
lawyers were not permitted to cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, hundreds of Peruvian civilians were also being
tried in ``faceless courts,'' under emergency measures that the
government justified as necessary to combat guerrilla violence. But
in recent years, more than a thousand Peruvians convicted under the
draconian anti-terrorism law used to convict Berenson have been
pardoned and released after their cases were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But Berenson has languished, for the first three years in
Yanamayo, a high-mountain prison for terrorists, and then, after
she developed health problems including intermittent blindness in
one eye, in the lower-altitude Socabaya jail.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division
of Human Rights Watch, said it was not clear whether the same
anti-terrorism law would be used in Berenson's new trial. Under the
law, he said, ``the definition of terrorism is so broad and so
vague that almost any activity could qualify as terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivanco added that the new trial could be influenced by
political concerns whether or not the law was used. ``If there is
one serious problem in Peru,'' he said, ``it's lack of rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bank has suspended its programs on judicial reform
in Peru because there's no evidence of an independent judiciary,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons complained Monday that high-level Peruvian
officials and judges had made prejudicial comments about the guilt
of their daughter, whose defiant television appearance before her
first trial made her a controversial figure in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Her imprisonment even became a campaign issue when Alejandro
Toledo, the opposition candidate, said in April that he would
review her case if elected. Fujimori accused him of advocating her
release, and Toledo suffered in the polls as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, whose parents describe her as having been empathetic
with the downtrodden even as a child, grew up in Manhattan and
attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before beginning
extensive travels in Latin America in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 she moved to Peru, telling her parents that she wanted
to write magazine articles about the poverty and suffering she
found there.
</P>
<P>
   She does not deny that once there, she befriended the rebels,
but has said that she believed the group's violent history was
exaggerated. One of her attorneys, Thomas Nooter, has said that she
was romantically involved with the rebel who testified against her,
and that he may have incriminated her in exchange for a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Before her trial, an angry, defiant image of Berenson was
imprinted in the minds of Peruvians whose lives have been scarred
by terrorism. She was taken before journalists at a detention
center and filmed raising a fist to the cameras. ``If it is a crime
to worry about the sub-human conditions in which the majority of
this population lives,'' she said, ``then I will accept my
punishment.''

HARDAWAY STILL WAITING FOR MIAMI TO SHOW HIM SOME RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ Tim Hardaway's knees are swollen, ice packs
wrapped around them. A grueling practice for the U.S. Olympic team
is over and the Miami point guard is hurting.
</P>
<P>
   If his body is sore, his ego is throbbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserve a lot more respect than I'm getting,'' Hardaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has watched the Heat overhaul its roster this summer,
swinging deals for Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason from Charlotte and
Brian Grant from Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The trades, expected to be completed this week, will transform
Pat Riley's mechanical and methodical Eastern Conference team into
everybody's finals favorite _ a team capable of trading blows with
whomever emerges from the West.
</P>
<P>
   With three new starters to complement Alonzo Mourning, the Heat
has all the talent and improvisation to finally make sweet music on
the court. There is but one problem: they have no maestro. At least
not one under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``And without that,'' Mourning said, ``you have a lot of noise
and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who turns 34 Friday, is an unrestricted free agent who
has seen almost every other significant player for the Heat be
compensated financially _ everyone except himself. He watched P.J.
Brown sign a $36 million contract and Mourning procure a $100
million deal several years ago. Even his backup, Anthony Carter,
has been re-signed by Miami.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones and Grant prepare to sign contracts in the neighborhood
of $90 million, Hardaway is seriously considering taking his
talents elsewhere to secure the last payday of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dead serious,'' Hardaway said. ``I'll go play for a
contending team like the Pacers. I'll go somewhere where they
appreciate me. Right now, I'm getting no love from the Miami
Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway is the only player on the Olympic team not under
contract with his team. He is seeking a three-year deal worth about
$10 million a season. While those numbers may seem high for a
player who has physically broken down the last two postseasons, the
Heat's floor leader feels as if the organization owes him for his
loyalty as much as longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took less money to stay there,'' he said of the deal he
signed with Riley three years ago. ``He said he'd take care of me,
and it hasn't happened yet. I want to be there, but I've got to
look out for Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley and Miami General Manager Randy Pfund are expected to fly
to Hawaii this week to meet with Hardaway and watch him scrimmage.
The Olympic team will play exhibition games Thursday against Canada
and Saturday against the U.S. Select Team.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Heat would like to sign Hardaway for one year, the
two sides will most likely arrive at some sort of compromise _
perhaps a two-year deal worth $8 million a season with a third-year
option. But if negotiations don't accelerate, Mourning has promised
to get further involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into this, he should have been signed,'' Mourning said.
``But it's like this: This is a cold, unpredictable business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Timmy's going to be taken care of because there's a
certain level of loyalty with our organization, unlike other
organizations that I won't necessarily name,'' Mourning added,
speaking not so inconspicuously of the Knicks and their dealings
with his friend, Patrick Ewing. ``We take care of our own, and I
know they're going to take care of Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last time the Heat eliminated the Knicks from the
playoffs, Hardaway had a huge series and became the primary reason
Miami advanced, scoring 38 points in Game 7 of the second-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are among several teams worried about Miami's
off-season acquisitions. New York is concerned enough that it has
made several overtures to other teams about unloading Ewing in
attempt to get younger and more versatile on the front line.
</P>
<P>
   But the fragile chemistry of incorporating three new starters
into the offense is something that may take a while.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway has already thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not on that team, so I'm not going to talk about the moves
they made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat has everything, it seems. Everything but the guy who
made the big shots for the franchise the last few years, the player
who made sure Mourning got the ball and the Heat had a chance at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke after the United States team practiced at the
Lahaina Civic Center, the stout point guard who bobs up and down
the court more than he runs these days could overhear an Olympic
teammate nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take you in Seattle,'' Gary Payton said. ``I'll move to
the two-spot if you want. I'll play shooting guard. I don't care.
To get Tim Hardaway, it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, not smiling, said, ``See, at least someone appreciates
me.'' &QL;

BRUINS ENJOY SUCCESS AT ROSE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has taken great pains, mostly in the weight
room, to shed the image of Gutty Little Bruins. And judging from
the biceps of Kenyon Coleman, Rodney Leisle and a number of other
linemen, it's clear they've succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Bruins shouldn't be so quick to discard the role _
particularly this season.
</P>
<P>
   They open the season Saturday with No.3-ranked Alabama and two
weeks later play No.6-ranked Michigan. Both games are at the Rose
Bowl, a place where the Bruins have played their gutty little
behinds off against some of the nation's best teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven non-conference games at the Rose Bowl against
teams ranked higher, the Bruins are 4-3 but not far from being
undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   The three losses were to No.5 Michigan, 24-23, on a last-second
field goal in 1989; to No.8 and near-national champion Nebraska,
14-13, in 1993, and to No.3 Tennessee, 30-24, in 1997. In the loss
to Tennessee, the Bruins had the ball inside the Tennessee 22-yard
line twice in the final two minutes but couldn't score.
</P>
<P>
   The victories have come over Tennessee, Miami, BYU and Nebraska
_ all teams that have won national championships in the past 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo has no problem explaining this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're UCLA _ we still should have a pretty good program,'' he
said. ``We're not little sisters of the poor. Obviously, if we beat
Alabama (a 6-point favorite), it would be an upset. But we've got
good players, we've got a pretty good program here, and we should
be playing those kind of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least playing them in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When UCLA goes on the road, it's another story. Since 1985, the
Bruins have one road victory over a non-conference opponent who was
ranked higher than they were _ the 66-3 rout of Texas three years
ago. They are 1-8 in that span and the scores have been just as
one-sided: an average of 39-17 and only one that's been closer than
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance travel is the most-cited reason for the road woes.
The Bruins also have played in hostile environments _ Ann Arbor,
Lincoln, Norman, Knoxville, etc. _ and towns where college football
is the center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when many powerhouses come to Los Angeles, it's a
different environment for them. Few Alabama players have ever
ventured west of the Mississippi, and the trip here has been used
as a carrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how we're going to play, but I think the game
is going to be good for us,'' DuBose said. ``It helped us last year
in recruiting. When you can go into a home and tell a young man you
have the opportunity to go to the West Coast, it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alabama players were dragging during spring or fall
practice, DuBose wasn't shy about getting his players to do a
little California dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA receivers coach Ron Caragher, a backup quarterback for the
Bruins in the late '80s, says he's seen teams with stars in their
eyes rather than X's and O's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football isn't the center of attention like it is a lot of
places, and maybe teams come out here and aren't as focused,''
Caragher said. ``I think the Rose Bowl might have something to do
with it, too. It's a place with a lot of history and a lot of these
schools have never been there before.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA strength and conditioning coach Mike Linn, like Caragher,
was on the sidelines in 1988 when the Bruins scored one of their
biggest victories. After getting pummeled in three previous
meetings against Nebraska, the fifth-ranked Bruins jumped on the
No.2 Cornhuskers, scoring 28 points in the first quarter and
building a 38-7 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It removes the stigma that we couldn't beat Nebraska,'' UCLA
coach Terry Donahue said after the 41-28 victory, which would
catapult the Bruins into the No.1 spot in the nation that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I came to UCLA for _ to be part of games like
that,'' said Linn, a guard at UCLA from 1988 through '92.
``Obviously that was a real good team. We had Troy Aikman and
several other guys who are still playing in the NFL. But that team
believed it could win and really got up for that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our kids are the type who are excited to play the best
in the country, who want to prove that we're just as good as
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Pete Dalis doesn't think there's anything
special about the Bruins' success at home _ or their failures on
the road _ against the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is how the Bruins play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year as athletic director in 1983, we were 0-3-1 and
had just lost a close game to (BYU),'' Dalis said. ``But I told
Terry Donahue after that game that `You've got a football team,'
and we ended up going to the Rose Bowl that year. You can tell a
lot by the way a team plays even though you may not win.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a tune Toledo is singing this week, too.
</P>
<P>
   He's called Alabama the best team the Bruins have played since
he came to UCLA in 1994 and that it's important for their
confidence to play well. He even called out to the fans to help
offset the 25,000 Alabama fans who are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we have as many people wearing blue as they do
wearing red,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gutty Little Bruins, it appears, are alive and well. &QL;

   CAIRO, Egypt _ Ending a whirlwind journey in Africa that
stretched from the Niger Gulf to the Nile, President Clinton
planned a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Tuesday to
discuss prospects of reviving the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the meeting, scheduled to last two to
four hours, was designed to get a reading from Mubarak about how he
and other Arab leaders feel about the prospects for a new round of
high-level meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The talks will be similar to the summit at Camp David, Md.,
between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat that collapsed in July.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations broke down over the issues of Jerusalem, which
both sides claim as their capital, and the right of Palestinians to
return to their lands in what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has planned a series of meetings with leaders close to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at next month's Millennium Summit
in New York. But Mubarak will be unable to attend.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. official on the president's Africa trip, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said, ``Quite clearly there will be no
progress without Mubarak's backing, so it is important for the
president to have this meeting, and the timing worked out for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said he did
not expect any decisive action from the Mubarak meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope will be furthered by this is the process by which
we can work with the Egyptians to try to get the parties closer
together,'' he said aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo stopover was added at the end of a three-day Africa
trip by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president began the trip in Nigeria, where he had saluted
that nation's new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the presidential party flew to Arusha, Tanzania, for peace
negotiations aimed at ending a civil war in the central African
nation of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential trip continued with the stopover in Cairo,
where the president's plane will be refueled.

 &UR; MARRIAGE:  &LR; They call it the ``marriage penalty'' _ as if marriage
isn't penalty enough. It's a quirk in the federal tax schedules
that forces many married couples to pay more income tax than they

RUSCH AND ALFONZO LEAD METS INTO 1ST-PLACE TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Turner Field in Atlanta, the Braves were pitching
their No. 1 starter, Greg Maddux, against Cincinnati. At Shea
Stadium here, the Mets turned to their No. 5 entry, Glendon Rusch.
The Mets had a chance to move into a first-place tie with their
National League East rivals, but they would need Rusch to come up
big to get there.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Rusch has said, he has felt like a momentum
stopper. He has not pitched poorly, but he has not been sharp,
either. Monday night, as the Braves fell behind against the
Cincinnati Reds en route to a 6-3 loss, Rusch stayed tough for
seven innings and the Mets went on to beat the Houston Astros, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time since April 5 that the Mets have owned a
share of first place, and they have not been there by themselves
since Aug. 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani, who has been hot, singled off Brian Powell to
lead off the game for the Mets. On a hit-and-run play, Derek Bell,
who has been in a rut for three weeks, followed with a single. That
snapped a 0-for-21 stretch and made general manager Steve Phillips
look prophetic. Before the game, Phillips said Bell's lengthy
slumps did not worry him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the season's pattern holds true,'' Phillips said, ``we're
on the verge of an upswing. We've got him right where we want him
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo has been much more consistent, and he followed
Bell's single with a three-run blast over the fence in left-center
field. It was Alfonzo's 17th homer of the year, and it provided the
Mets with firepower in a game for which Mike Piazza was rested.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell in the early innings that Rusch would make
that 3-1 lead stand up and improve to 9-10. Rusch has found himself
in a self-proclaimed ``dead period'' in recent weeks, and his
performance has suffered. But he felt himself improving in his last
two starts, and he got an extra day of rest for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch has run up high pitch counts in recent starts, which is
out of character for a control pitcher who does not walk or strike
out many hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Through four innings Monday night, he had thrown 82 pitches and
allowed three walks. With the Mets' bullpen thin, partly because of
soreness in John Franco's pectoral muscle, that was a bad sign. But
Rusch worked out of trouble at critical moments, before he began
conserving pitches.
</P>
<P>
   With two on and two outs in the second, Rusch walked Roger
Cedeno, who had homered leading off the game in his first
appearance at Shea since being traded last December. The bases were
loaded for Julio Lugo, but Rusch retired him on a fly to center,
using a curveball to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, after another two-out walk to Cedeno, Rusch faced
Lugo with men on first and third. Lugo grounded to second, ending
the inning. At that point, Rusch had allowed a pair of bases-empty
home runs (the other was by Richard Hidalgo), but he had survived
the second and fourth innings, which began with extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   He settled in after that. Jeff Bagwell singled to lead off the
fifth, but Mike Bordick ranged well into left field to catch a
pop-up and Rusch got Moises Alou to ground into an inning-ending
double play. In the sixth, after Chris Truby's one-out double,
Rusch struck out Tim Bogar looking and retired pinch-hitter Lance
Berkman on a groundout off a first-pitch curve.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch's efficiency continued into his last inning, the seventh.
After finally retiring Cedeno, on a ground ball, Rusch retired Lugo
and Bagwell on fly balls, using only five pitches between the two
hitters. Rusch threw 117 pitches, 70 for strikes, and allowed two
runs on seven hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   While Rusch was not always sharp, Powell missed his spots
continually. Powell, a right-hander who beat the Mets earlier this
month for his first victory in the majors in two years, walked six
in five innings and threw more than half his pitches for balls.

NOTHING HIDDEN IN NEW YORK REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE'S INCOME TAX
RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After weeks of declining to release his tax returns,
Rep. Rick Lazio tried Monday to end the swirling speculation about
his finances.
</P>
<P>
   His aides provided limited access to 10 years of federal and
state returns, and a review of the long-sought documents found
little, at least at first glance. No arcane tax shelters,
tortuously reasoned exemptions, or offshore bank accounts on the
Isle of Man. No evidence of a scheme to take a high charitable
deduction for donating an old pair of chinos to the Central Islip
Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Lazio and his wife, Patricia, seem to have
relatively ordinary finances. They declared a 1999 adjusted gross
income of $150,400, largely from his congressional salary of
$126,740, with money also from her part-time work as a nurse, and
investments in the stock market and real estate. They gave $2,422
to charity.
</P>
<P>
   While such an income might be the envy of most Americans, it
would place Lazio among the poorest members of the Senate should he
be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides seemed pleased to put the clamor about the tax
returns behind them, but the contents of the documents stirred only
more conjecture: if there's nothing there, why did he wait?
</P>
<P>
   Lazio pledged to release his tax returns soon after entering the
Senate race in May, but had not done so, raising suspicions about
whether he had the kind of financial problems that have tripped up
other politicians in New York in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
criticized the delay, asking whether he was hiding something. The
state Democratic Party even sent a young campaign worker dressed as
Uncle Sam to Lazio's campaign events to shout at him to disclose
his tax filings.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides said the delay stemmed from their need to review
the returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we would release them by the end of the summer, and we
did,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign. ``The
only story here is Clinton's desperation in basing so much of her
campaign in attacking Rick on this issue. It shows the lack of
seriousness on her part, and I think calls her credibility into
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lazio campaign said it wanted to clear up the
mystery, it did not exactly put the returns on the Internet. On
Monday, reporters _ but not the public _ were allowed to view the
returns at Lazio campaign headquarters near Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters got as much time as they wanted and were permitted to
take notes, but the returns could not leave the room. Asked about
such restrictions, McLagan said other politicians, like Gov. George
Pataki, had used the same system. Many, including President and
Clinton, distribute copies.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign did not provide originals of the returns, and
they did not include the dates they were filed. Aides said Lazio
has always filed on time and had never sought extensions or filed
amended returns. He used an accountant, except in 1990, when it
appears he did his return himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's wife has proudly declared that she cleans her own house,
and there was nothing in the returns to disprove that. The Lazios
did not pay any taxes on salaries for household help or day care,
and McLagan said they had never used hired help to care for their
two young daughters. Other politicians in recent years have run
into trouble for not paying taxes on wages to domestic workers.
</P>
<P>
   As had already been apparent from the disclosure forms that he
files with Congress, the returns show that Lazio was smitten with
the stock market in recent years, often engaging in short-term
stock trades, though his lackluster results suggest he might have
been better off putting his money in a mutual fund that tracked the
market.
</P>
<P>
   One of his costliest trades was in the stock of Halliburton, the
oil services company whose chief executive then was Dick Cheney,
now the Republican vice presidential nominee. Lazio lost about
$5,000 trading Halliburton stock in 1998, when the stock was
sagging along with oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The returns confirm the details provided earlier by the campaign
about one of Lazio's biggest successes in the market, his 1997
windfall from speculating in the stock of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a
brokerage firm. Those investments were the subject of an insider
trading inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission that
ended last week with the agency taking no action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1999, the Clintons reported income of $416,039.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazios' adjusted gross income has hovered around $150,000 in
recent years, largely because of his congressional salary. Their
highest-earning year was 1997, when they declared $159,258 in
adjusted gross income.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, before he went to Washington in 1993, Lazio
was a county legislator and a lawyer, and his and his wife's
adjusted gross income was as low as $88,928 in 1992, according to
the returns.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Lazios gave $1,397 to charity, or 1.6 percent of
their adjusted gross income. On average, Americans donate 2 percent
of their income to charity, and Lazio and his wife in recent years
have usually given between 1 and 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign did not release a list of charities that
received the money. Lazio did not use his state tax return to
contribute to the Breast Cancer Research Fund or three other
charities that are listed.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years in the early 1990s, Lazio owned three investment
properties on Long Island, but he sold two of them, leaving him
with a house on Fire Island that he rents out in the summer and
uses in the spring and fall. According to the returns, the Fire
Island house has often given the Lazios large deductions that have
helped them lower their taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton campaign has seemingly been deprived of an
angle to attack now that the returns have been disclosed, it
continued to try to stoke the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Lazio can't explain why it took three months to release
his taxes,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Clinton campaign spokesman.

CALIFORNIA MUNI BONDS A PRICEY INVESTMENT  
 BY KATHLEEN PENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ High-tech workers, parking places and affordable
housing aren't the only scarcities in California.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been an acute shortage of municipal bonds this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with cash from the booming economy, cities, counties and
the state haven't borrowed as much money _ by issuing bonds _ as
they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, demand for tax-free munis just keeps growing from
people with old money and new money, especially high-tech
millionaires looking for a safe place to stash some cash.
</P>
<P>
   The result: California muni bonds are trading at higher prices,
and lower yields, than they typically do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic supply-demand situation,'' says Kelly Mainelli,
senior fixed-income trader for Montgomery Asset Management.
``California munis are really expensive right now.''
</P>
<P>
   This is good news for people who invested in individual muni
bonds or muni-bond funds earlier this year. But people who buy now
may be paying top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Year to date, mutual funds that invest exclusively in California
munis have beat all other types of muni-bond funds, and many stock
funds as well.
</P>
<P>
   For example, long-term California muni funds have provided a
total return _ interest payments plus gain in share price _ of 8.8
percent this year, rivaling the 9.3 percent return on technology
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Things could change if the state's municipal bond issuers go on
a borrowing binge.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, California municipal bond issuance is running
about 22 to 24 percent behind last year's pace, according to
various estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy accounts for only part of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Zane Mann of the California Municipal Bond Advisor says
``advance refundings'' have also dried up.
</P>
<P>
   When interest rates fall, municipal-bond issuers often replace
old, higher-rate bonds by issuing new ones at lower rates. It's
just like refinancing a home mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike homeowners, cities can't always repay their old
bonds all at once. They have to do so over time. So they use the
proceeds from their new muni bond offering to buy Treasury bonds,
then use the income from their Treasury bonds to gradually repay
the old municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   This process, known as ``advance refunding'' inflates the supply
of muni bonds on the market and helps feed Californians' insatiable
appetite for tax-free investing.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, refundings accounted for as much as 50 percent of
new bond offerings in California, Mann says. But when interest
rates were up earlier this year, refundings weren't viable. Mann
estimates that a steep drop in refundings accounts for 75 percent
of this year's overall decline in municipal bond issuance.
</P>
<P>
   Most bond experts expect that supply will begin to grow later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the state is expected to issue $850 million in
general obligation bonds on Sept. 13, says Bernard Schroer, manager
of the Franklin California Tax-Free Income Fund. That's a bigger
bond issue than normal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state and/or various counties will probably
issue $500 million in tobacco revenue bonds before year's end,
Schroer says. These bonds will be repaid by money the state
receives from tobacco-suit settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if interest rates continue to fall, refundings could
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Although supply will probably grow modestly this year and early
next, demand will remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   Californians always prefer muni bonds issued in California
because their interest is exempt from state as well as federal
taxes. Income from out-of-state munis is subject to state taxes.
(If investors sell municipal bonds or bond funds, from any state at
a profit, the gain is subject to capital gains tax.)
</P>
<P>
   Because California has so many high-income taxpayers, and state
income taxes are so high _ the top rate is 9.3 percent _ the demand
for municipal bonds is always stronger in California than in most
other states.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, California munis always trade at higher prices _
and lower yields _ than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the yield on California munis is about 10 basis points
(0.1 percentage point) below the national average. Because of the
unusual supply constraints in California, the difference is now
about 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) says Mainelli.
</P>
<P>
   As supply grows, that gap should shrink to more normal levels.
Whether that comes about because California yields rise, or
national yields fall, depends in part on interest rates in general.
</P>
<P>
   If interest rates continue to go down, as they have in recent
months, bond prices will rise and yields will fall across the
board. If interest rates turn around and head up, bond prices will
fall and yields will rise.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our outlook for the rest of the year is that the market will
probably be pretty stable,'' says Schroer. ``You will get more
supply, but on the other hand, there's nothing that would force
interest rates to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainelli is a bit more cautious. ``We've been going up nonstop
for three months,'' he says. ``There might be more room ... but
it's time to take a breather.''

COUPLES SAY THEY NEED INCOME-TAX RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; They call it the ``marriage penalty'' _ as if
marriage isn't penalty enough.
</P>
<P>
   It's a quirk in the federal tax schedules that forces many
married couples to pay more income tax than they would owe if they
were living in sin.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty _ which has become an important
presidential campaign issue this year _ can cost a well-paid couple
more than $1,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be enough to keep people from getting married, but
some couples have acknowledged postponing their nuptials until Jan.
1 to avoid the marriage penalty for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to just repeal it,'' says Larry Rabun, senior
partner and national director of estate, gift and trust services
with Deloitte &AMP; Touche in Washington, D.C. ``It's a dumb provision
and doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty has been around for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It became a campaign issue this year because the federal
government _ inundated with tax revenues from the booming economy _
anticipates trillions of dollars in budget surpluses during the
years just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in Congress, steeped in family values and also
mindful that the marriage penalty applies most harshly to
upper-income families _ the GOP's natural constituency _ passed a
bill last month that would have virtually eliminated it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ which would have increased the standard deduction for
all married couples and lowered the tax brackets for many _ would
have cut federal revenues by an estimated $292 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, no great friend of the well-to-do _ Hollywood
campaign contributors excepted _ vetoed the measure, saying it
would cause too great a drain on the Treasury and benefit people
who didn't really need it.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton did was either statesmanlike or fundamentally
misguided, depending on which political wing you occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank
in Washington, says ``cutting taxes by a large amount now'' would
be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Better to wait until the expected surpluses actually
materialize, he reasons. Otherwise, ``we could be putting
government back into the deficit situation we spent two decades
clawing our way out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Slivinski, a fiscal policy analyst with the libertarian
Cato Institute, also in Washington, counters that the government
should simply spend less.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ask whether the government can afford tax cuts
automatically assumes it's the government's money to begin with,''
Slivinski observes. ``The only reason they might not be able to
afford it is if they commit to spending more money than they
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore _ who is, of course,
blissfully married _ has proposed a modest marriage-penalty reform
of his own. True to Democratic tradition, it stresses benefits for
less-affluent taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   He favors raising the standard deduction for married couples _
which would mainly help people who don't own houses. Mortgage
interest payments usually are large enough to cause taxpayers to
itemize deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to make more lower-income married couples
eligible for the earned-income credit.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, George W. Bush, has proposed a
substitute GOP plan in the wake of Clinton's veto. True to
Republican tradition, it would be most helpful to taxpayers with
above-average incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan would restore a tax rule that was in effect during
part of the Reagan administration. It would give each married
couple an extra tax deduction equal to 10 percent of the salary of
the spouse who earns the least.
</P>
<P>
   The deduction would be capped at $3,000, which means that its
fullest benefits would be enjoyed by households in which each
spouse earns at least $30,000 _ that is, households with incomes of
$60,000 and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Feenberg, a research associate with the National Bureau
of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., says the marriage penalty
developed because of a fundamental change in the tax tables during
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Congress made the tables more favorable to single individuals,
who had complained that, by and large, the old tables forced them
to pay more than married couples with comparable incomes.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; More Working Women
</P>
<P>
   The new tables shifted the balance too far, but this wasn't
generally recognized as a problem until well into the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the marriage penalty has little or no impact on
households in which the spouses file joint returns and have widely
different incomes. In fact, they pay less than they would if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1970s, it was rare for husband and wife to earn
nearly the same amount of money, and many wives earned nothing at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it has become common for spouses to earn roughly the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Under the present setup, if a couple earn a total of $100,000
this year, they won't get hit by the marriage penalty if one of the
spouses earns more than $77,000. At that point, the current
tax-rate schedules reach equilibrium for married and single people.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if each spouse earns $50,000, the marriage
penalty _ assuming the couple are childless and claim the $7,350
standard deduction _ would amount to $1,530.50.
</P>
<P>
   Filing jointly as a married couple, they would pay a tax of
$18,673.50. If they were single, they each would pay a tax of
$8,571.50, for a total of just $17,143.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; A Closer Look
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the tax schedules shows how such quirks arise.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple filing a joint return for 2000 will have to pay
a tax of 15 percent on the first $43,850 of taxable income. Above
that, they enter the 28 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
   If the tax schedule for a single individual were perfectly
aligned with the schedule for a married couple, then the single
individual would cross into the 28 percent bracket when taxable
income exceeded $21,925, or half of $43,850.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, single people don't reach the 28 percent bracket
until their incomes exceed $26,250.
</P>
<P>
   Single people also get a break on the standard deduction. The
standard deduction for a married couple is $7,350, while for a
single person it is $4,400 _ substantially more than half the
married couple's deduction. Feenberg says it is impossible to
devise a rate schedule that would tax married couples and single
people equally, that would ensure that any two married couples with
the same income would pay the same tax, and that would be
progressive _ imposing higher percentage rates on people with
higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All seem like very reasonable principles to uphold,'' Feenberg
observes, ``but no tax system can obey all three. You have to
violate one or more.''
</P>
<P>
   So the balance of favoritism can be expected to swing forever
between the married and unmarried, the rich and not-so-rich,
households with two wage earners and households with trophy spouses
_ depending on how many votes each group commands, how loudly they
voice their views and how the party in power feels about them.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Holding Pattern
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect changes in the marriage penalty soon, Rabun warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of anything passing between now and the election
are probably slim and none,'' he says. And after the election,
``the lame-duck Congress is unlikely to pass any major legislation
that won't get vetoed.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next year will hinge on the makeup of Congress and
which party occupies the White House.
</P>
<P>
   If the same party controls both houses and the presidency, there
probably will be some sort of marriage-penalty reform. If the
leadership is split, then the stalemate seems likely to continue.

 APPLE NAMES EMPLOYEE IN TRADE-SECRETS LAWSUIT  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer has apparently fingered one of
its own as the source of several recent leaks about products it
hadn't announced.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued yesterday, the company said it had added
the name of Juan Gutierrez, ``an individual employed by Apple,'' to
a previously filed lawsuit alleging unauthorized disclosure of
trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In the original complaint, filed Aug. 1 in Superior Court in
Santa Clara County, the Cupertino, Calif., computer-maker had
charged up to 25 ``John Does'' with posting pictures on the Web of
a new dual-processor Mac model and a new mouse before Apple
unveiled the products on July 19.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Apple said it had identified Gutierrez through
subpoenas issued as a result of its suit. On Aug. 3, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge Gregory Ward signed an order allowing
Apple to subpoena records from Yahoo relating to an individual
known online as ``worker bee.'' The pictures in question were
posted on a site maintained by a user of that name in Yahoo's
GeoCities Web community.
</P>
<P>
   Apple spokeswoman Lynn Fox declined to say what job Gutierrez
had held at Apple. Asked if he was still employed by the company,
she laughed and said, ``No comment.'' Gutierrez did not reply to a
voice-mail message left for him at Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Apple would continue to seek the identities of ``Does 2
through 25.'' In its statement, the company said, ``The protection
of Apple trade secrets is incredibly important to our success. We
intend to vigorously pursue legal actions that ensure the
confidentiality of our intellectual property is not compromised.''

EX-CEO PLEADS GUILTY IN TECH FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LAZARUS  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In one of the largest securities fraud cases in
Silicon Valley history, the former chief executive of a Fremont,
Calif., technology company has pleaded guilty to bilking investors
out of millions of dollars, the U.S. attorney's office said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jain of Berkeley, Calif., admits that he and other
executives at Media Vision Technology defrauded investors by
creating bogus inventory and hiding millions of dollars in product
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was certainly one of the dirtiest cases I was ever
involved in,'' said Steve Sidener, a San Francisco lawyer who had
sued Media Vision for more than $30 million on behalf of investors.
``I'm just shocked that it's taken this long to get to this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Jain had been indicted by a federal grand jury in September 1998
on charges of wire, mail and bank fraud, as well as giving false
statements to stock-market regulators. He pleaded guilty to only
two counts of wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Media Vision, a maker of multimedia products, went belly up in
1994 after allegedly falsifying records to inflate its financial
performance. Charges are still pending against the company's former
chief financial officer, Steven Allan.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea comes after a setback last week for the U.S.
attorney's office, which has pledged to crack down on white-collar
crime in the tech industry. On Friday, a federal appeals court
tossed out the convictions of two former executives at California
Micro Devices, the office's first major securities fraud case in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Vision case, first brought to light by The Chronicle,
illustrates the darker side of Silicon Valley, where cases of fraud
and stock manipulation largely have been overlooked by the media
and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Media Vision case sends a terrific message that the
Department of Justice is going to get tougher on these types of
cases,'' said Joe Cotchett, a Burlingame lawyer specializing in
securities-related litigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said Media Vision represents only the tip of the
stock-fraud iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely clear to me that stock fraud and manipulation
has not slowed down,'' Cotchett said. ``Over the past few years,
we've seen a dramatic increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Jain will cooperate with the government in its case against
Allan, said Deborah Husnik, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Jain could not be reached for comment. But his Sacramento
lawyer, Richard Pachter, said Jain finally decided it was time to
get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jain has accepted responsibility for his part in what went
on,'' he said. ``He wants to put this behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jain faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a $500,000
fine and compensating victims of the fraud. Sentencing is scheduled
for Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. attorney's office, Media Vision's senior
executives, after discovering an approximately $6 million shortfall
in 1993 sales, attempted to pressure the firm's business partners
to claim they held millions of dollars in nonexistent inventory.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, a company in India falsely claimed to have purchased $6
million worth of Media Vision's goods, and the sale was
subsequently entered into Media Vision's books.
</P>
<P>
   Jain also admitted that he had provided deliberately inaccurate
information to investors when he and Allan discussed Media Vision's
1993 financial results in a conference call with stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office said the pair had reported revenue of
$241 million and profit of $20 million, even though they knew the
bogus sale accounted for about a third of Media Vision's purported
income.
</P>
<P>
   They also allegedly hid about $10 million in returned products.
</P>
<P>
   Media Vision's stock was trading at $42.50 at the time the
contrived results were reported on Feb. 17, 1994. A month later,
the company said it would report a loss for the first quarter,
causing the firm's stock to plunge to $11.
</P>
<P>
   By May 17, 1994, Media Vision's share price was down to $2.75
after the company revealed that it actually lost almost $100
million in 1993. Bankruptcy followed not long after.
</P>
<P>
   Jain's plea agreement, supplied by his lawyer, suggests that he
sees Allan as the prime mover behind Media Vision's financial
deceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan informed me that it was essential that we find someone
to confirm the nonexistent inventory to the auditors, and Allan
would reverse the entries in a few weeks,'' Jain told the U.S.
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Allan nor his lawyer could be reached for comment.
Allan's trial is scheduled to open on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Three former Media Vision employees already have pleaded guilty
to charges related to the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Former company controller Robert Williams pleaded guilty to one
count of providing false information to the FBI, while former Chief
Operating Officer Russell Faust and former sales director Michael
Humphress pleaded guilty to federal mail fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing of the three has been postponed until the cases
against Jain and Allan are resolved. A related investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission is also on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that it was not just Steve Allan,'' said
Sidener, the lawyer who had sued Media Vision on behalf of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as the result of one man's conduct,'' he
said. ``It was a group collaboration.''

PAC BELL'S BUSY SIGNAL ADS INTRUSIVE, PUC GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD WALLACK  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No one likes to hear the brash, buzzing sound of
a busy signal, unless the alternative is something worse: an ad.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the consumer watchdog arm of the California Public
Utilities Commission filed a formal protest against Pacific Bell
for forcing customers to listen to a recorded sales pitch whenever
the person they are calling is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   For ``only 95 cents,'' the announcement says, Pacific Bell will
automatically keep redialing the number for the next half hour
until a connection is made.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates accuses Pac
Bell of intruding on customers' privacy, violating its pledge to
avoid telemarketing to customers with unlisted phone numbers and
increasing the price of the service by 20 cents without permission.
</P>
<P>
   The ORA complaint also asks the state PUC to order Pac Bell to
immediately halt the ads, roll back the price to 75 cents, give
refunds to customers who paid more than that and make
``restitution'' to customers with unlisted phone numbers who were
forced to listen to the announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers have also complained about the ads, which started
in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was outraged,'' said Joe Stevens, a San Francisco Web
developer. ``I pay for this line and I get phone spam?''
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell spokesman John Britton said the complaints are
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   First, Britton said, the message shouldn't be confused with an
unsolicited sales call. ``You only hear (the message) if you make a
phone call and the line is busy,'' Britton said. ``If you don't
like it, you just hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton also said the message is actually helpful for many
customers who weren't aware of the feature. And several phone
companies in other states use similar announcements to tout the
service, Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Pac Bell said it jumped through all the regulatory
hurdles before raising its price in July. Pacific Bell filed a
notice with the PUC on May 3, indicating it planned to raise the
price for three services, including repeat dialing, three-way
calling and star-69 (which calls back the number of the last
incoming call), to 95 cents. Pac Bell said it actually has
permission to raise the price to $1.42.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one protested the plans, so the PUC signed off
on it as it normally does with noncontroversial changes. (The ORA
belatedly protested last week.)
</P>
<P>
   Britton also said Pac Bell warned customers about the recorded
message in an insert in customers' phone bills in April, though ORA
gripes that the notice didn't say the price was being increased and
omitted other details.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the complaints demonstrate that some customers are
particularly sensitive to being forced to listen to anything
resembling an ad when making a call.
</P>
<P>
   As The Chronicle reported in May, several AT&AMP;T customers were
annoyed after the long-distance giant forced them to listen to ads
touting sweepstakes and other promotions before connecting their
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the Pac Bell customer, said he initially complained
about the recorded messages to Pac Bell, who told him they were
actually ``service availability announcements'' _ not ads. Stevens
called it ``semantic bull_.''

A LITTLE FORGERY AND NO MONEY DOWN GOT SCAM ARTIST SEVERAL HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN FEUER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Long Island man found a new way to make real-estate
deals with no money down, prosecutors in Brooklyn said on Monday.
He stole the properties with the stroke of a pen, transferring the
deeds into his own name by forging the rightful owners' signatures.
</P>
<P>
   He then used the phony deeds to secure more than $900,000 in
mortgage loans and to sell some of the properties to unwitting
buyers for a total of more than $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to 1998, the man, Kevin Walker, 35, of Sayville, N.Y.,
was able to steal 11 small houses or apartment buildings in
Brooklyn. His victims included not only the private lending
companies that gave him the mortgages and the title insurance
companies that guaranteed the real estate deals, but also the
owners who had their properties sold out from under them and the
people who eventually bought them.
</P>
<P>
   Nachum Greenspan, for example, was surprised to find one day two
years ago that his dead mother's home had changed hands. ``We're
very concerned because the house has been sold _ there are other
people living in it now,'' Greenspan said Monday. ``A guy walks up
to you and mugs you on the street. Well, this is a bit more
sophisticated. But really, it's the same kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker is accused of 23 counts of grand larceny in a criminal
complaint filed Monday in connection with the deals. He is being
held on $100,000 bail and would face 5 to 15 years in prison on
each count if convicted, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most of us believe that it is not possible to get
something for nothing, Walker is accused of doing just that,''
Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, said at a news
conference. ``With nothing more than a few pieces of paper _ forged
deeds _ he, in fact, turned nothing into $1.6 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynes called the scheme ``a simple but extremely effective real
estate scam.'' He said that Walker wrote down the addresses of
vacant houses or small apartment buildings, then went to the Office
of the City Register, where he obtained microfilm copies of the
pertinent deeds simply by providing the block and lot numbers. The
deeds contained the names of the rightful owners, the prosecutor
said, and Walker would then execute a new deed, signing as the
buyer and forging the owners' signatures as the sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme worked, Hynes explained, because in New York state,
signatures alone are sufficient to transfer a deed from one party
to another. In these cases, five of the legitimate owners of the
buildings were dead, he said, and the owners of the six remaining
properties had no idea their deeds had been switched to Walker's
name.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hynes, the title companies that guaranteed the
sales of the properties are legally bound to reimburse any buyer
who purchased a building from Walker. Without a change in the law,
the district attorney said, there was really no way to prevent such
a scheme from occurring again, aside from cracking down on people
who did it and got caught. Other states go to greater lengths to
check identification in real estate transfers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Walker. Investigators said he had no prior
arrests and sometimes operated under the name of a business called
Communicare, but the business had no office or staff, only a
telephone number listed in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeared from the mists,'' Hynes said.

MARY T. REYNOLDS, AUTHORITY ON JAMES JOYCE, DIES AT 87 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Reynolds, an authority on James Joyce, died on Friday at
her home in Washington. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds won particular praise for her book ``Joyce and Dante:
The Shaping Imagination'' (Princeton University Press, 1981), about
the influence of Dante's poetry on Joyce's writing.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Joyce and Dante,'' the critic Richard Brown observed in
The Times Literary Supplement, Reynolds ``researched in detail the
history of Joyce's reading of Dante, from unearthing his college
curriculum to acquiring the actual copies of Dante's work which he
possessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' other books included ``Joyce and Nora'' (1964),
``Joyce and D'Annunzio'' (1976), ``Mr. Bloom and the Lost Vermeer''
(1989) and ``James Joyce: New Century Views'' (1993). She was a
trustee of the International James Joyce Foundation and an editor
at both the Joyce Studies Annual and the James Joyce Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spoo, a former professor of English at the University of
Tulsa and the editor of the James Joyce Quarterly, said through a
spokeswoman that ``Joyce and Dante'' was ``definitive in Joyce
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Beja, a professor of English at Ohio State University and
executive secretary of the International James Joyce Foundation,
said ``the importance of Dante was exceptionally profound'' in
Joyce's work, and Reynolds, he said, ``was able to show just how
pervasive it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Staley, a professor of English at the University of Texas
at Austin and the editor of the Joyce Studies Annual, called
Reynolds' scholarship seminal. In ``Joyce and Dante,'' he said,
``what she studies most of all is the rhetorical and linguistic
maneuvers by which Joyce related his work to Dante's. An important
element in the book's success was her revelation of the extent of
Dante's influence on Joyce's creation of allegory in his own
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Staley added that Reynolds had ``traced a myriad of Dante
allusions in Joyce that had not been elaborated on before.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' opinions about Joyce included approval of recipes used
by his wife, Nora.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had ever had the good luck to visit them,'' she wrote in
1985, ``I certainly would not have tried to discuss `Finnegans
Wake' with Joyce. I'd have been out in the kitchen with Nora,
eating her scones and her greengage jam.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice, encouragement and books Reynolds provided helped Jin
Di, a Chinese scholar, finish his 1994 translation of ``Ulysses,''
reported to be the first of Joyce's works published in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Trackett Reynolds was born in Milwaukee and earned
bachelor's and master's degrees in political science from the
University of Wisconsin at Madison, where she was inducted to Phi
Beta Kappa. She received her doctorate in political science from
Columbia University. She taught political science at several
colleges and a seminar on Irish literature and history at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds is survived by her husband, Lloyd Reynolds; two
daughters, Anne Skinner of Williamstown, Mass., and Priscilla
Roosevelt of Washington; a son, Bruce, of Ithaca, N.Y.; seven
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

PRESSURE GROWS ON CORZINE TO RELEASE TAX RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton may have succeeded in
pressuring Rep. Rick Lazio to disclose his tax returns, but the
episode could prove embarrassing to her fellow Democrat running for
the Senate: Jon Corzine of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Corzine was the only Senate candidate on either
side of the Hudson who had yet to release his tax returns, and his
Republican opponent, Rep. Robert Franks, quickly seized the
opportunity created by Lazio's reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton has been an outspoken advocate for full financial
disclosure, and hopefully she will be able to convince her
Democratic colleague, Jon Corzine, to follow her lead,'' Franks
said in a statement Monday afternoon. ``So far, no one in this
state has had much luck in getting Mr. Corzine to tell us where his
money comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has released abbreviated abstracts of his earnings and
taxes paid in three recent years. But he has refused to release his
returns, saying that doing so would violate a confidentiality
agreement he signed with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment bank
he headed until his retirement last year. But Corzine is coming
under increasing pressure from both the local and national news
media to relent. And in a July poll by the Gannett New Jersey
Newspaper Group, 72 percent of respondents said Senate candidates
should disclose the sources of their income, and 64 percent said
Senate candidates should release their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a choice here,'' Franks' campaign manager, Charlie
Smith, said of Corzine. ``He can either run for the United States
Senate and try to earn the trust of the voters, or he can remain a
businessman and continue to have secret business dealings. He's
chosen to run for the U.S. Senate. There's an obligation to be
forthcoming with the residents he hopes to represent. You can't
have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's spokesman, Tom Shea, said the candidate intended to
place his assets in a blind trust if he was elected, rather than
violate the confidentiality agreement, which Corzine considers a
binding contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's released everything he can, and everything that's
required of him by the Senate Ethics Committee,'' Shea said. ``But
he's kept his word on that contract, and he'll keep his word to the
voters of New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, who remains less known and is looking for publicity, has
invoked Clinton's name often recently, but not in such a positive
light. In July, he sent out fund-raising appeals saying Clinton was
one of the liberals ``New Jersey can't afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, dismissed Franks' appeal as a
campaign stunt. ``Where was Bob Franks when Rick Lazio was delaying
releasing his tax returns for three months?'' he said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug. 29: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People who have had sex-change surgery, cross-dressers and
others whose gender identity does not conform to societal norms are
often targets of violence and bias that force them to live in fear
for their safety or the loss of their jobs and shelter. A bill now
before the New York City Council would give this marginalized
population basic protection against discrimination in housing,
employment and public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The city's human rights law has long barred discrimination based
on gender. Since the 1980s, the law has also prohibited
discrimination based on ``sexual orientation.'' But that provision
focuses on issues of heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality.
It does not protect those who identify themselves as transgender.
The new legislation, which has 28 sponsors in the City Council,
would broaden the definition of ``gender'' to include not only a
person's sex, but also a person's expression of gender identity,
self-image and appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Similar anti-bias laws have been enacted in nearly two dozen
cities, including Atlanta, San Francisco and Minneapolis. The
proposed measure has strong support from civil rights groups and
political leaders, including Public Advocate Mark Green and City
Comptroller Alan Hevesi. Council Speaker Peter Vallone, however,
has not taken a position on the measure. Vallone should move
swiftly to get the bill passed, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani should
sign the measure.

EDITORIAL: PRAYERS AT FOOTBALL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug. 29: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along with chanting school cheers, students in some Southern
high schools are now standing up to recite the Lord's Prayer at the
start of football games. Although the stadium prayers seem
spontaneous and undirected, they are in fact part of a movement,
started by Christian ministries and radio talk show hosts, to
promote school prayer. The purpose is to get around a recent
Supreme Court decision that banned as unconstitutional
school-sponsored student-led prayers that are broadcast over the
public address system.
</P>
<P>
   While there may be a legal and constitutional difference between
prayer that is officially sponsored by the school and a more
informal student-initiated pre-game prayer, the impact on the
audience is the same. When a crowd of 4,000 high schoolers rises to
say a prayer, students who are nonbelievers or members of religious
minorities are subjected to the majority's religious worship as the
price of attending a school football game.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutionality of these outbreaks of prayer is heavily
dependent on the facts of each case. Allowing a student to lead a
prayer over the public address system would clearly be
unconstitutional. Less overt forms of support by school officials
may also be prohibited, depending on the degree of their
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   But group prayer may be constitutional if school officials are
truly uninvolved. In those instances, student prayers might well be
considered private speech, protected by the First Amendment
principles of free speech and free exercise of religion. The
difficulty, of course, is determining the specific scenarios in
which prayer on school grounds moves from unconstitutional
government-sponsored religious worship into protected private
religious activity.
</P>
<P>
   In past cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that schools cannot
be hostile to students' religious expression. Students are free to
pray privately at any time during a school day, and after-school
Bible clubs are allowed to operate in most of the nation's school
districts. But the court has stated repeatedly that affirmative
school sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible because
it sends a message to some students ``that they are outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   A prayer initiated by students may pass legal muster. But its
message of religious orthodoxy may be just as socially coercive for
teen-agers as a voice over the public address system. In that
respect, it is no less threatening to religious freedom than
organized school prayer. Mainstream religious leaders should speak
out against a strategy that imposes religious observance on a
captive school audience.

RANGERS NEED TO MAP A COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Five months into the franchise's worst season
in more than a decade, Texas Rangers' management remains strangely
uncertain about what direction it will take in reconstructing the
ballclub this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Three words for you, Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Win or else.
</P>
<P>
   Leave that other trash reeking in the cow pasture, where it
belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries we understand. Mistakes in judgment we may forgive, for
a while. But indecision on philosophy at this stage of the game
won't be tolerated, not here and, it's my guess, not in Tom Hicks'
office either.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the philosophy of the team and what's the goal of our
organization?'' manager Johnny Oates asked before Monday night's
series opener against the Cleveland Indians at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The scary part is that with just 32 games to go in this
miserable dead-end season, only the second half of his question was
actually rhetorical. The goal, Oates said, is still to win the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The map on how they'll get there, however, is suddenly very
muddled. Will Melvin continue to stick with the youth plan he
implemented last winter, or will he spend heavily on the free-agent
market to plug the obvious holes?
</P>
<P>
   Or both?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get through September before we make that
decision,'' Melvin said. ``I thought we did our major
reconstruction last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps wanting us to be where the White Sox and the
A's are, but they're two years ahead of us with younger players. We
go three months and already people are losing patience.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a fairly accurate assessment and one Melvin should keep
in mind. This is not a patient town when it comes to bad baseball,
especially from a team that won three division titles in four years
but faded with barely a whimper in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not very tolerant of night after night of shoddy
defense, poor starting pitching, an underachieving bullpen and a
lineup of banjo hitters.
</P>
<P>
   We're spoiled. So sue us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in baseball is that people overreact all the
time,'' Melvin said. ``A week ago Doug Davis was going to be our
left-handed reliever. Two starts later he's set in our rotation.
Brian Sikorski pitches a good game and he's one of our starters
next year. He comes back with a bad game and he's out of the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change from week to week, from one start to another.
That's why I'd like to continue our evaluations through the end of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable
times. Personally, I don't need another 30 days to figure out what
this team needs, and for the first time in memory, the list of
necessities doesn't have starting pitching at the top.
</P>
<P>
   So in the interest of saving time and for a mere 50 cents
investment, here's what you should do, Doug:
</P>
<P>
   Add a ``monster'' bat to the lineup, preferably an outfielder
who won't mind DH-ing most of the time. Suggestions: Juan Gonzalez,
Manny Ramirez, Ellis Burks. They can all be free agents at the end
of the year. Sign one. Heck, sign two if you can. It's only money.
</P>
<P>
   Find a second baseman who can play defense and run, someone who
can turn a double play once in a while and has a little range. If
we've learned anything this season, it's that you can't get by with
utility infielders playing full time.
</P>
<P>
   Sign or trade for a stop-gap third baseman _ preferably one with
some power _
</P>
<P>
   while Mike Lamb goes back to Triple A and learns two things: How
to make accurate throws to first and how to drive in an occasional
run. It wouldn't hurt if he hit the ball out of the park once in a
while, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sign or trade for a closer. If it's definitely not going to be
John Wetteland, how about auditioning one of the younger guys in
September? What have you got to lose?
</P>
<P>
   ]Finally, sign one veteran starting pitcher. After missing on
Mark Clark and Darren Oliver, you're due to hit on one of those
reclamation projects you love so much.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, unless major changes are made defensively, you're not
going to be able to lure any big-name free-agent pitchers to
Arlington. Who would want to pitch in a hitter's park in front of
the gloves that are out there now?
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a legitimate chance to play with the Yankees, the
Clevelands, the Seattles of the world, we need some more work,''
Oates understated. ``Can we be competitive with minor changes?
Yeah. We can have a decent ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we have a ballclub like the one we had last year? That's
going to take awhile. You're not going to do it over the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad news, guys. A winter may be all you have. Guaranteed
contracts are nice because they provide some financial security.
But as Oates himself has often pointed out, they don't guarantee
him a seat in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with trying to be the next White Sox, or A's, is
that there's no guarantee that the Rangers' young players will be
as good as theirs. Do the Rangers have another Paul Konerko?
Magglio Ordonez? Carlos Lee? Mike Sirotka? Ben Grieve? Miguel
Tejada? Eric Chavez? Tim Hudson?
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Ricky Ledee, Gabe Kapler and Mike Lamb can be
productive players with a good surrounding cast,'' Melvin said.
``Once we felt the injuries weren't going to allow us to contend,
we tried to strip it to a point where we could at least build from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But are those players good enough to build with or around?
</P>
<P>
   Kapler has made progress but there's still reason to wonder if
he'll develop into the 35-homer, 100-RBI center fielder the Rangers
hope he will be.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb has almost as many errors (26) as he does RBI (39). Ledee
is still an enigma and it's difficult to predict what Ruben Mateo
can produce next season, even if he can stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some growth from the people that we have,'' Oates
said. ``Right now, we're asking a lot. We're asking some of our
younger guys to carry a load.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the young guys ``are'' a load.
</P>
<P>
   We know where the Rangers have been. We know where they are now
and why.
</P>
<P>
   The crazy thing is that with only a month left in the season,
they still don't seem to know what to do about it. nn

JUDGE GRANTS DELAY ON NEW EVIDENCE IN NEW JERSEY TROOPER TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Prosecutors investigating the 1998 police
shooting at the center of New Jersey's racial profiling scandal
were granted two more months by a judge on Monday to examine new
eyewitness testimony and determine how it may alter their case.
</P>
<P>
   The state troopers involved in the shooting, James Kenna and
John Hogan, are awaiting trial on attempted murder charges for
firing 11 shots at a van during a traffic stop on the New Jersey
Turnpike in April 1998 and wounding two black men and one Hispanic
man, all unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The case was thrown into turmoil this month when two new
eyewitnesses came forward and gave statements that reportedly
corroborated some elements of the troopers' version of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have argued that the troopers fired in
self-defense, and they filed motions asking that the charges be
dropped. A hearing on the new evidence had been scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A special deputy attorney general, James J. Gerrow, asked
Superior Court Judge Andrew J. Smithson on Monday for two more
months to respond to the defense's motion to dismiss, saying that
the new evidence had forced prosecutors to reconsider their
approach to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more time to continue our investigation and also to
really evaluate what our response is going to be,'' Gerrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Smithson granted a delay until Oct. 26, and is expected to
decide whether to dismiss the charges at a hearing scheduled for
Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Gerrow has refused to discuss what the evidence is or how it may
affect the case against the two troopers.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting sparked a political uproar from civil rights
activists, who had complained for years that troopers were singling
out black and Hispanic drivers for traffic stops. After an
investigation by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office and the
federal Justice Department, the state signed a consent decree in
which it agreed to stop the practice.

LAKERS HOPE GETTING RIDER IS RIGHT MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO _ Only Isaiah Rider knows what secrets of life are
stored in Aruba, St. Thomas, Antigua and Trinidad. Only he knows
what, if anything, a brief banishment from the NBA, and a long
vacation in the tropics, taught Rider about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Only Rider knows for sure whether the months of reflection will
help him end a seven-year string of late arrivals, occasional
arrests and repeated suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday afternoon, as Rider accepted his fourth new lease on
NBA life, he said all the right things, made all the reassuring
vows and sounded genuinely grateful to be a Los Angeles Laker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all the chips are against me,'' Rider said at an
afternoon news conference, ``but I just want to come in and play
hard. And it will be easy to get in and fit in really comfortably
with the players that we have here. So my main thing is just
bettering myself. And I prayed and wished for a lot of things, and
my dreams came true ultimately.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the 29-year-old Rider, equally talented and
troubled, found his market value diminished and found a willing
employer in the Lakers, who obtained him for a low-risk, one-year
contract for $736,000.
</P>
<P>
   After being waived by the Atlanta Hawks in mid-March, after
prior blowouts with Portland and Minnesota, Rider knows this could
be his last chance to save what remains of a promising career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the situation, so it's up to me to respond and
to come out, not really on top, but just come out as a good person
and end my career with credibility, on a positive note,'' Rider
said.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted his troubles have all been of his own making but
said that during his extended offseason, ``I think I've matured.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rider nor general manager Mitch Kupchak addressed
Rider's run-ins with the law _ including an arrest for marijuana
possession _ or his penchant for verbally assaulting fans. But both
seemed certain Rider could solve his vexing habit of tardy
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   And Kupchak said Rider, unlike one-time Laker Dennis Rodman,
would be held to the same rules as everyone else but said there are
no if-then scenarios that would prompt Rider's early termination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone's aware of what's at stake,'' Kupchak said,
``and to sit down and talk about cutting somebody if they're late
once or twice, that doesn't have to be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the Lakers know what they'll get on the court:
a tough, athletic swingman capable of scoring 20 points when needed
and who, at his best, ranks among the top 15 shooting guards in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Rider can easily make up the 16 points per game they'll lose
once Glen Rice departs, and he's younger and more dynamic. Unlike
Rice, Rider can create his own shot and get to the hoop with
regularity, and for his career is a 36 percent 3-point shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of that matters if he's suspended, pouting or
perpetually late, which is why even the Lakers admit this is a
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's not a risky move,'' Rider said. ``Obviously, to the
public it will be. ... But everyone has their opinions, and I have
my beliefs and I have my strengths. And my head is on straight, so
therefore, I don't think it's a risky move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy, I'm confident and I'm not reluctant to be in
this situation. I really look forward to it. It's a lot of pressure
on me, but I look forward to that pressure.''

BRUINS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A sense of urgency returned to UCLA practice
Monday as preparations began for Saturday's season opener against
No. 3 Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   It beat a sense of helplessness, the feeling that a number of
Bruins, those caught in the handicapped parking scandal,
experienced at the start of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no distractions this year,'' said linebacker Ryan
Nece, one of the 11 Bruins who were suspended for at least two
games last season. ``We can really concentrate on football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating to come to practice, work hard and
then I had to be in the stands. It's something I'll never forget
and something I never want to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo said he already senses better chemistry
this season, something that was largely impacted by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some seniors who had some problems and they had a hard
time leading the football team and then we had some underclassmen
who didn't want to follow them,'' Toledo said. ``That's behind us
now.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign that the Bruins have moved on came over the weekend when
the team voted guard Oscar Cabrera, one of the placard possessors,
a game captain for the Alabama game along with defensive end Kenyon
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKS LIKE A MILON: The Bruins won't see a more dynamic player
this season than Bama flanker Freddie Milons. The 5-foot-7,
191-pound junior will return punts and kickoffs and might also line
up at running back, quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He set a school record with 65 receptions last year, and he was
the MVP of the SEC championship game, in which he scored on a
spectacular 77-yard run against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA will try to punt the ball away from him and kick the ball
out of the end zone, but ``we can't do much about him offensively
except tackle him when he gets the ball,'' Toledo said. ``They're
going to get him the football. He's going to make some plays. We've
just got to find him and tackle him.''
</P>
<P>
   CRIMSON TIDE OR RED WAVE: At least 20,000 Alabama fans are
expected for the game, which could draw close to 80,000. Alabama's
ticket allotment of 15,000 is long gone
</P>
<P>
   WAR BABIES: Alabama's last trip to Pasadena was in 1946 when it
beat USC in the Rose Bowl to cap a 10-0 season. It was the last
time a non-Pac 10 or Big Ten team has played in the Rose Bowl game.
Two members of that team, Harry Gilmer and Vaughn Mancha, will
accompany the Crimson Tide on their flight here Thursday.

STATUE FOR ARTHUR ASHE CREATES CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the nude 14-foot bronze statue in front of the
Arthur Ashe Commemorative Garden was unveiled Monday night, some in
the crowd were confused over its meaning, while others remarked of
its power.
</P>
<P>
   The imposing figure, sculptured by Eric Fischl, was designed to
commemorate Arthur Ashe's legacy but not his likeness; this was the
root of the confusion. It is a rough statue of a man serving,
holding the grip of only a tennis racket, the end torn off to
depict a baton to be passed from generation to generation. The
stocky, intentionally out of proportion statue, which also depicted
genitals in an abstract form, emerged from a base in a way intended
to portray growth.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Levering, the president of the U.S. Tennis Association,
prefaced the unveiling by saying that this statue, like Ashe, was
provocative as well as elegant. She said, ``It is meant to
represent all people from all races and backgrounds, Arthur's full
range of impact.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, some spectators at the unveiling were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is disappointing to see,'' said Bee Atwell, 56, from
Brooklyn. ``There's not even a tennis racket in his hand. It's not
very relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Moore, the executive director of the Alliance Junior
Tennis League in Roosevelt, N.Y., kept interrupting the ceremony by
yelling out that the statue should be clothed or carrying books or
children. ``Kids will see that, and what will they think?'' Moore
said. ``Arthur Ashe stood for more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati Moves On, Calmly
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Capriati tried to serve Monday as the wind whipped
around the darkened Louis Armstrong Stadium during the drizzly
first day at the U.S. Open. Planes roared, thunder boomed and the
public address system crackled like gunfire, its startling blasts
causing a delay minutes before the rain began pouring down.
</P>
<P>
   But the 24-year-old Capriati was calm, easing jitters about
playing the first match on the first day, and held a 6-4, 1-0 lead
over Emmanuelle Gagliardi.
</P>
<P>
   Play resumed after about 90 minutes, and Capriati took little
time to dispatch the 82nd-ranked Gagliardi, 6-4, 6-0. Afterward,
the 15th-seeded Capriati was all sunny smiles and waves to the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel totally different coming into this,'' she said. ``I
have no issues I want to discuss or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati's self-aware smiles were a contrast to the tears that
marked her final appearance at last year's Open. After falling to
Monica Seles, 6-4, 6-3, in the fourth round, a composed Capriati
recited a statement discussing her personal problems as a
teen-ager. But she crumbled under questioning and left the room in
tears.
</P>
<P>
   This year things are different. Seeded for the first time since
1993, and more confident, Capriati said she likes the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've established my presence for good, you know, hopefully,''
she said. ``I like it better like this.''

TROJANS VICTORY RAISES QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine being told a week ago that USC's star quarterback would
throw for less than 100 yards, the go-to receiver would catch two
passes and the offense would score one touchdown against Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-point margin of victory? Sounds about right, except
conventional wisdom would have said the Nittany Lions were the
winning team.
</P>
<P>
   That's how utterly strange USC's season-opening victory over
Penn State turned out to be. The Trojans were sloppy offensively,
not to mention predictable, but they also registered the most
impressive victory of the Paul Hackett era.
</P>
<P>
   Players are already talking about winning the national
championship, which sounds downright wacky. But so does destroying
Penn State without a top-flight offensive performance.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this is no vintage Penn State team, but USC still
manhandled a respectable group. The way the Trojans did it,
however, makes it extremely difficult to predict what it means for
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew last year, or hopefully realized, that the
season-opening 55-point drubbing of Hawaii was no barometer of the
Trojans' talent or success.
</P>
<P>
   But this is different. Penn State can't be that bad, can they?
</P>
<P>
   No matter, some things were easy to spot Sunday as major signs
of improvement. The running game is vastly different, as is
Hackett's dedication to run the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan McCullough gained 128 yards in 29 carries, but more
importantly, Hackett was determined to keep taking time off the
clock by running.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, Sultan got the tough, hard yards,'' Hackett said.
``We couldn't do that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A would be last season's Notre Dame game. USC blew a
21-point halftime lead, and afterward, there were complaints within
the program that the Trojans passed too much in the second half and
allowed the Irish back in the game. No such problem this year.
</P>
<P>
   The unity that was so apparent during training camp at UC Irvine
also showed at Giants Stadium. With a 23-3 lead, USC didn't lose
focus in the locker room, as the Trojans did twice last season
while blowing 21-point leads to Notre Dame and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we came in the locker rooms thinking we had won
those games,'' defensive tackle Ennis Davis said. ``So this year,
we came in and kept it calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Added linebacker Zeke Moreno: ``There was no talking. We decided
not to talk, just do what you have to do. It was pretty quiet in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to work, because the Trojans never came close to
squandering the lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if anyone was the most valuable player of the game,
it might have been wide receiver Marcell Allmond. In the second
half, he recovered McCullough's fumble inside the USC 25-yard line.
Later, he recovered Mike MacGillivray's blocked punt in the end
zone, preventing Penn State from getting an early touchdown that
might have completely changed the game's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, those type of plays seemed to go against USC in the
clutch.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when Palmer gets his rhythm back, and Kelly gets
the touches he deserves? How far can the Trojans go, with their
experienced defense expected to be tough against any opponent?
</P>
<P>
   We won't really know until the Colorado game Sept. 9. USC will
be favored in that contest, but how the Trojans bounce back from a
victory that rejuvenated the program will tell a lot about this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we haven't answered all the questions that people
have, but we made a statement that we're here to play,'' offensive
lineman Faaesea Mailo said.
</P>
<P>
   What's really scary is that the passing game might never be
worse this season. Then again, will the special teams and defense
score touchdowns in many more games?
</P>
<P>
   If a game can raise as many questions as answers, the Kickoff
Classic did it.
