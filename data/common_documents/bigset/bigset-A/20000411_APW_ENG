<HEADLINE> Japan Measure of Trade Jumps  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A surge in exports to Asia pushed Japan's broadest
measure of trade 33.3 percent higher in February, the government
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus, measured before adjustment for seasonal factors,
increased to $13.9 billion (1.474 trillion yen) from the same month
last year, the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The larger-than-expected rise followed 12 straight months of
year-on-year declines. A survey of economists by Dow Jones
Newswires had predicted a surplus of $12.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The current account measures trade in merchandise, services,
tourism and investment. It is calculated by determining the
difference between Japan's income from foreign sources against
payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry officials attributed February's jump to an
increase in exports, particularly to Asian countries where strong
demand has kept shipments from Japan on the rise since June.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's exports to Asia rose 32.1 percent in February, compared
to a 18 percent decline a year earlier, when the region had not
completely overcome its currency crisis, said Kenichi Habu, a
ministry official. Asia accounts for nearly 40 percent of Japan's
overall exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   February exports to the United States rose 10.8 percent, while
those to Europe increased 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that more increases in the current account surplus
may be in store. ''Given the strength of exports and stabilization
of oil prices, we may be seeing signs of a bottoming-out process,''
said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities (Japan).
</P>
<P>
   In January, the surplus fell to its lowest level in two years on
a rise in oil prices and the yen's strengthening against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A huge surplus has been a constant source of friction with the
United States and other trading partners. They have been urging
Japan to boost its economy to stimulate imports. Japan is
struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn in 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Official: PetroChina Plans Layoffs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- PetroChina Co. reportedly will cut 7,000 jobs
this year to satisfy investors in its new multibillion-dollar
foreign stock issue.
</P>
<P>
   The state-controlled oil company had cut 1 million jobs in
preparation for the public offering that raised almost $3 billion
last week in Hong Kong and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But investors complained the remaining 480,000-member work force
was still too big, a company official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed to cut jobs gradually, beginning by
eliminating between 5,000 and 7,000 positions this year, the
official said. The person did not say how the jobs would be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Previous cuts involved moving workers to other parts of
PetroChina's parent, state-owned China National Petroleum Co.
</P>
<P>
   Investor concern about the health of PetroChina's operations
forced the company to cut the price of its public offering by
nearly half. The shares, which began trading on the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday, have since fallen below their offer price of
$16.44, closing Monday at $15.18}, unchanged from Friday.

<HEADLINE> Legislative committee votes $550,000 for Attica survivors  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The widows or other surviving relatives of
the 11 state prison employees killed in the 1971 Attica state
prison riot may be in line for one-time benefits of $50,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative conference committee Monday voted unanimously that
$550,000 be included in the 2000-01 state budget for the families
of prison employees who died during the September 1971 Attica riot.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said they are trying to redress an injustice created
following the riot when survivors of dead guards were assured by
state officials that they would be provided for. Those families
said they were not told that by signing death benefit checks, they
were forfeiting their right to sue state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to help the guards' families was heightened in
February when a federal judge approved a $12 million settlement
with inmates who claimed they were brutalized by guards during the
retaking of Attica after the four-day riot. Of that, $4 million
will go to pay legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dale Volker, R-Erie and chairman of the Senate's codes
committee, said the settlement with inmates simplified the question
of whether guards' families should get the special payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until the inmate situation was straightened out, there were
many people who felt that we, in effect, shouldn't do this,''
Volker said. ''I didn't agree with that. We could have done this
some years ago, all we had to do was to agree to give to the
inmates also.''
</P>
<P>
   Volker said he and others objected to paying awards to inmates
because, ''We shouldn't, in my opinion, give money to the people
who started a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two inmates and 11 prison employees were killed at
Attica, most died during the shooting by state police officers
during the retaking of the prison ordered by ex-Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   The $50,000 would amount to a typical death benefit in 1971,
Volker said. State prison guards then made an average of about
$9,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Volker said legislators are also trying to devise a way to make
the payments exempt from state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   G.B. Smith, a guard who survived being an Attica hostage, said
he does not believe the $50,000 is ''enough compensation'' for the
widows of those guards killed at Attica. In fact, he said he also
did not think $90,000, as Republican state Assemblyman Daniel
Burling of Wyoming County has proposed paying families, is
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the widows, they have been living paycheck to
paycheck,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the Attica widows and survivors plan to meet this
weekend to discuss death benefits. The group is also seeking an
official apology from the state and for the official files about
the Attica riot to be unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's aides monitored the work of the budget
committee which approved the special Attica payment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor supports full and fair compensation for the
families of the guards killed at Attica,'' spokesman Charles
Deister said.
</P>
<P>
   Volker and the co-chairman of the budget committee, Assemblyman
Joseph Lentol, D-Brooklyn, did not disagree that $50,000 -- or even
$90,000 -- is not enough to compensate the families of those killed
at Attica.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course they're right ... What is enough?'' Volker said.

<HEADLINE> Leaders say budget process is on track  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Some of the legislative conference
committees may need more time to finish trying to resolve
outstanding issues about the 2000-01 state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The chief committee -- comprised of the top legislative leaders --
is set to expire today, but it can be extended to allow more time
for the resolution of spending questions in the $78 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   That more time would be needed was suggested by activities
Monday, when the general conference committee did not even meet
because eight of the nine subcommittees had failed to conclude
their portions of negotiations over the new state spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   The current state fiscal year began April 1, and this is the
16th straight year New York's budget will be adopted late.
</P>
<P>
   While the most important discussions about the budget were
continuing to be conducted in private, legislative leaders insisted
Monday their ''public'' conference committees were working.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the weekend involving legislative staffers
and, on occasion, Gov. George Pataki's aides, produced agreements
on some of the outstanding issues in the 2000-01 budget.
</P>
<P>
   There were no deals, however, on such major portions of the
spending plan as education, transportation and tax cuts, Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going really well,'' Bruno said, though he cautioned that
there was always a risk of a ''serious glitch'' developing.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was the report of the chairmen of the health conference
committee, who said staffers had been talking since last Thursday
about how to enhance the state's EPIC prescription drug program for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason we don't have much to announce -- that's an
exaggeration, the reason we don't have anything to announce -- is
the EPIC program is still under discussion,'' said Assemblyman
Richard Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Assembly's
Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Without negotiators deciding how much more that program will
cost, Gottfried said it did not make sense for the subcommittee to
discuss in earnest spending on other health-related programs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward if such discussions about the prescription drug
program should be in public among members of the subcommittee,
state Sen. Kemp Hannon said it would not be practical.
</P>
<P>
   ''You say, 'Why can't you do it in public?''' said Hannon, a
Long Island Republican who chairs the Senate Health Committee.
''You can say, 'This is what I'd like, that is what I'd like.' But
then what you have to do is you have to go back to the computers
and run it through a spreadsheet which says, 'Presuming 10 percent
participation in Year One up to 30 percent participation in Year
Two.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is not realistic to hold such technical discussions in the
conference committee setting, Hannon said.
</P>
<P>
   A co-chairman of the higher education subcommittee, Democratic
Assemblyman Edward Sullivan of Manhattan, said legislators on the
committee were waiting for staffers to conclude their talks, but
that agreements were close on outstanding issues. They include an
increase to the state's Tuition Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee on public protection issues, meantime, finished
its work and voted to send the main conference committees its
recommendations. They included a $550,000 payment for a special
one-time benefit payment to the widows of the 11 prison staffers
killed during the 1971 Attica prison riot and no recommendation for
the new maximum-security state prison Gov. George Pataki wanted to
build.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked diligently and tirelessly in an effort to come to an
agreement,'' Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, a Brooklyn Democrat, said.
''It was not in an effort to be contentious and to disagree.''

<HEADLINE> Liberal Party boss says Giuliani to seek Liberal line  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of the state's Liberal Party says
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has told him he will seek the third party's
ballot line to go with the Republican nomination for the Senate
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Party boss Raymond Harding said Monday that Giuliani
told him that more than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The information prompted the chairman of the state Conservative
Party, Michael Long, to say that ''clearly the mayor would be
shutting the door'' to possible Conservative Party backing ''if he
goes to seek the Liberal Party endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   Long also warned that Liberal Party backing for Giuliani could
wind up hurting Texas Gov. George W. Bush's Republican presidential
candidacy in New York. The Conservative Party is expected to back
Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has won statewide office in New York without
Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, no Democrat has won statewide office without Liberal
Party support since the party's founding more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Conservative Party has been considered more
critical in statewide elections. It provided the margin of victory
to Republican George Pataki in the 1994 governor's race against
incumbent Democrat Mario Cuomo, who also ran with Liberal Party
backing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also run on minor party lines and the votes are added together to
determine winners. That makes the third party support particularly
important in close elections. Polls have shown the Giuliani-Clinton
contest to be close.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't news,'' Giuliani maintained Monday when asked about
Harding's comments. The mayor added: ''I've said this a number of
times -- I want everybody's line.'' Giuliani said that included the
Liberal as well as the Conservative and Independence parties'
lines. The Independence Party is the New York arm of the national
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor has expressed a desire in the past to have all
the ballot lines he could get, he has repeatedly refused to be
pinned down when asked about which specific ones he would seek.
Long has consistently said that should Giuliani run with Liberal
Party backing, he could forget about the Conservative Party line.
</P>
<P>
   Harding said Monday that the Liberal Party's policy committee
would meet May 6 to interview prospective Senate candidates. He
said Giuliani and Green Party candidate Mark Dunau have already
asked for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton adviser Harold Ickes said Monday he had just received
the Liberal Party's letter about the interviews. ''It's fair to say
we're going to consider it,'' Ickes said.
</P>
<P>
   Harding, one of Giuliani's main political advisers, said he and
the New York City mayor got together in December and it was at that
time that Giuliani ''said he was requesting me to advise the policy
committee that he would be seeking the Liberal nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party has backed Giuliani in his mayoral
candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Long said that because Harding and Giuliani ''are attached at
the hip,'' the mayor ''will get the Liberal Party endorsement'' for
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Long has maintained for months that unless the mayor rejected
Liberal Party support and came out against what critics call
''partial-birth abortion,'' there was no chance of him winning
Conservative Party backing. An abortion rights supporter, the mayor
has refused to support a ban on the abortion procedure.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican leaders have been working to bring the
Conservative Party and Giuliani together, Long said Monday that the
mayor has been engaging in what ''was clearly a political charade
to keep everyone off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been saying all along that this was nothing but a game,''
Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Long said he is going ahead with plans to field a Conservative
Party candidate other than Giuliani, a move that many Democrats and
Republicans believe could hurt the mayor's chances. Long has
refused to identify the possible contenders for the Conservative
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Long said that with the Liberal Party expected to back Democrat
Al Gore's presidential bid, the combination of Gore and Giuliani on
the Liberal line ''is not going to help George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what happens when you give an endorsement to a person
who's really not a bona fide Republican,'' Long said, an obvious
rebuke to the state's GOP leadership that is backing Giuliani.

<HEADLINE> X-Rated Insider Trading Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors say it was more than just pillow
talk between a married top Wall Street executive and an X-rated
movie star three years ago that led to insider trading charges
against both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Young K. Oh told jurors during
opening statements Monday that she will show them thousands of
pages of documents as well as bank, broker and phone statements to
prove that James McDermott Jr. violated the law repeatedly with
actress Kathryn Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, the porn star at the center of the case, was not in the
federal courtroom as the trial began. And in accordance with the
judge's order, her profession was described only as ''actress'' so
as not to taint the jury's opinion of her.
</P>
<P>
   Oh described Gannon only as a ''28-year-old blonde, an
attractive woman who was also a dancer and model'' and sometimes
performed under the stage name ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is seeking the extradition of Gannon from
Canada, where she is a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on her resume were ordered by U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood, who rejected government arguments that her career
explained why McDermott wanted to impress her with his
stock-knowledge prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of McDermott sat behind him in court as Oh accused the
$4 million-a-year executive of living a dual life between 1997 and
1999 by engaging in the affair while seeming ''to be the master of
his universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh said McDermott supplemented Gannon's annual income of between
$50,000 and $100,000 with $80,000 in checks along with secret
information about six companies that allowed her to make large
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon then allegedly gave inside information to another man
with whom she was having an affair, Anthony P. Pomponio, who made
trades as well. Gannon and Pomponio made $170,000 on the illegal
stock trades over eight months, Oh said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Muller, a lawyer for McDermott, told the jury that the
charges against his client were false while acknowledging the
affair which he said began in 1996 and has ''humiliated him over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is that relationship that has brought him to this courtroom
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client's innocence would be clear if the jury
scrutinized what McDermott said to Gannon and when he said it.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted they would conclude McDermott recommended companies
to Gannon that were well-known merger candidates because 1997 and
1998 were years when bank stocks were undergoing ''merger mania''
after deregulation by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Muller said McDermott made the recommendations to Gannon during
''thousands of opportunities, face to face or on the phone'' before
the stocks joined a list at McDermott's company that must be kept
secret.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer revealed how close McDermott had become to
Gannon when he said there were more than 500 telephone calls
between them and more than 300 beeper pages in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   It would be absurd to think McDermott would risk his lucrative
job, his 26-year marriage and his relationship with his two
teen-age daughters to feed her inside stock tips that she made only
$15,000 on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dunn, a lawyer for Pomponio, said his client did not
belong in court on criminal charges, especially after he revealed
everything he knew to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
volunteered to help investigators.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, Pomponio, 45, of North
Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, who has a home in Miami, Fla., are
all charged with conspiracy and securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and Pomponio remain free on bail.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Mobil Negotiating on Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. said it is negotiating to drop a
lawsuit that threatens the $7 billion sale of Alaskan oil
operations and the pending $30 billion merger between BP Amoco and
Atlantic Richfield.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco had thought it locked up government approval for the
Arco merger when it announced last month that it was selling Arco's
Alaskan interests to Phillips Petroleum. Regulators had wanted more
divsersified ownership of Alaska's North Slope oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   But Exxon Mobil went to court to block the sale, claiming it
held the right of first refusal, which BP Amoco disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cirigliano, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil,
said Monday discussions are underway to resolve the lawsuit. A BP
Amoco spokesman in New York said the London-based company would
have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco operates about half the Prudhoe Bay oil field, with
Arco operating the other half. Exxon Mobil is a partner on both
sides of the field, holding a 23.8 percent stake in oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state regulators are pressuring BP Amoco to sell
Arco's Alaskan operations because, without such a sale, the new
BP-Arco combination would control three-fourths of North Slope oil,
which an important supply of gasoline for the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil is unhappy because it says it doesn't know how the
sale of Arco Alaska to Phillips will affect operations on the North
Slope fields -- rules set by agreements that date to the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We and the state (of Alaska) have not been informed as to the
specifics of the agreement between BP Amoco, Arco and Phillips
relative to the proposed merger and the sale of assets to
Phillips,'' Cirigliano said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry analysts believe Exxon isn't interested in buying
Arco's assets but was alarmed by suggestions from Phillips -- which
has no experience on the North Slope -- that it would be a passive
investor and let BP Amoco run the field.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a scenario, analysts said, Exxon would have virtually
no control over investment and production decisions, despite the
fact it holds a 23.8 percent interest in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Exxon becomes a passenger in the bus. They can't tell the bus
driver whether to go fast or slow,'' said Fadel Gheit, an analyst
with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''Exxon wants to be consulted on operational
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gheit blamed BP Amoco for underestimating Exxon Mobil's resolve
to be consulted about oil field operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Exxon wants to operate the fields,'' said James
Van Alen, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ''They want
to make sure that their interests are taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Gheit, the Fahnestock analyst, said he expects a speedy
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon shares were down $1.31\ to $78.25, BP Amoco shares down 6\
cents to $51.12{, Arco shares were down 31\ cents to $82.25, and
Phillips shares were down 37{ cents to $45.68}. All stocks trade on
the New York Stock Exchange

<HEADLINE> State faces questions over crane accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- Laura Cuthbert was nearly killed by a
falling crane two and a half years ago, and she still doesn't know
how it happened despite several efforts to find out.
</P>
<P>
   In response to her most recent plea for help, the office of
state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said it doesn't have the
expertise or the resources to investigate the accident. And even if
the resources were available, the proper party has not requested an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The accident in front of the SUNY Health Science Center
Institute for Human Performance, Rehabilitation, and Biomedical
Research in Syracuse happened Oct. 1, 1997. A 300-foot steel crane
boom fell on Cuthbert's car, trapping her inside as she waited for
a traffic light to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was trapped for several minutes with power lines draping
her car,'' said her brother, William L. Foster, a Syracuse
attorney. ''Three electricians were awarded Carnegie Medals for
taking the risk of pulling her out through the driver's side
window. They thought the car was going to explode. I think it's an
outrage the state isn't concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said his sister was emotionally traumatized by the
accident. They have since been battling with state officials to
determine exactly what happened. The battle is escalating into a
fight over the state's responsibility to ensure public safety at
its own construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state, as defender of the public safety, should want to
find out who is responsible,'' Foster told the Auburn Citizen in
Monday's editions. ''I'm just asking them to take care of what I
think is an essential part of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea has met with little help. State Sen. Michael Nozzolio
and former Assemblyman Daniel Fessenden have written letters
requesting an investigation. Assemblymen Edward Sullivan and Steven
Sanders have done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Cuthbert and Foster have repeatedly asked the state Labor
Department and attorney general's office to further investigate the
crash. Each letter has met with dead ends.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dopp, spokesman for the attorney general's office, said
in order for Spitzer's team to look into the accident, a request
must come from the Labor Department, the state university system,
or Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never engaged in what we are now being asked to do,''
Dopp said. ''Our difficulty is we have a certain responsibility and
a traditional role. Local authorities could bring a criminal case.
SUNY could take action. The attorney general's office, with a
referral, could intervene and conduct some kind of inquiry.
Everybody has an assigned responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Nozzolio's office has asked the Labor Department to start an
investigation, spokesman Justin McCarthy said. ''The senator has
not been satisfied with reactions of the Labor Department
throughout this process,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been working with Senator Nozzolio's office all along,''
Labor Department spokeswoman Betsy McCormack said Monday. ''We
referred the safety issue to OSHA, and they levied fines. The
safety issue we don't have jurisdiction over. We did everything we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's refusal to investigate does not surprise
Foster. Ten days before the accident, a Labor Department
representative was at the site checking the licenses of crane
operators. He failed to find any problems at the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   But the crane operator, Thomas Phelps, said the job was not
being done correctly and should have been stopped, according to
transcripts from a hearing held before the state Crane Examining
Board. Phelps testified that wood used beneath the crane was
substandard and could have contributed to the crane's fall.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said Phelps' license was revoked in March 1998 after
he was found incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he doesn't understand why Foster is taking his
sister's fight to politicians instead of bringing the issue to
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Damage has occurred, and the people who caused the damage
should pay for the damage,'' Sullivan said. ''I have no ability to
do anything in this matter. I'm not a lawyer. That's what the
courts are for. He should sue. Sue us -- sue the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuthbert cannot file a lawsuit against the state because the
statute of limitations has expired. She has not decided whether to
file a lawsuit against the contractor, Hueber-Breuer, and the crane
operator, Raulli &AMP; Sons, her brother said.
</P>
<P>
   Hueber-Breuer's insurance company, Fidelity &AMP; Deposit Co. of
Maryland, filed a $270,000 lawsuit in December against Raulli and
A.C. Legnetto Construction claiming the two companies breached
their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Legnetto, which provided grading and site
work, and Raulli were negligent in their work, which caused the
crane to tip.

<HEADLINE> Hospital: Hinckley Has Recovered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials at St. Elizabeths Hospital are
recommending that presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. be
released for unsupervised day-long visits with his parents,
according to the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials say their examinations show Hinckley has
''sufficiently recovered from his mental illness'' to justify the
brief releases, said the newspaper in its Tuesday edition.
</P>
<P>
   If the hospital gets its way, Hinckley, 44, could venture off
the grounds unescorted for the first time since he was confined to
the facility in 1982 for shooting President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office, which opposes letting Hinckley out,
has asked Senior U.S. District Judge June L. Green for a hearing.
Green turned down a similar request from Hinckley in 1997, but
Hinckley did not have the hospital's support then.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981
Reagan shooting. Three other people, including White House press
secretary Jim Brady were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors attributed the attack by Hinckley to mental illness.
Officials at St. Elizabeths say the illness is now in remission,
and that Hinckley requires no medication.

<HEADLINE> Mostly vegan recipes for astronauts studied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Eating takeout food is typically not a way
to lose weight, but eating food a research lab prepared for taking
WAY out -- on trips into space -- proved a decent diet plan for 16
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in a Cornell University study funded by NASA lost
between 3 and 7 pounds on a monthlong diet of primarily vegan foods
-- those containing no animal products.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that's because of the low sodium content.
</P>
<P>
   Findings from the space-food diet study not only will help NASA
plan how best to feed an extended space mission team but could
better inform the health care industry, said David Levitsky, a
nutritional sciences professor at Cornell who is collaborating in
the study.
</P>
<P>
   The dishes were plant-based foods that had to be tasty,
nutritious and economical, said Jean Hunter, an associate professor
of agricultural and biological engineering who is heading the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The food also had to be low in salt -- because sodium from
recycled urine in a space colony would be bad for crops. Low in
iron -- for space adaptation. Not labor intensive -- astronauts' time
is at a premium. And sparing in their use of any ingredients
difficult to produce in a space colony.
</P>
<P>
   The menu also had to be derived from a very limited list of
crops, mainly wheat, rice, soybeans and other vegetables that can
be grown hydroponically in artificially lighted,
temperature-controlled space farms, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fare for a typical day might include sweet potato pancakes and
scrambled tofu for breakfast, lentil loaf sandwiches or seitan
tacos for lunch, and carrot drumsticks and tabouli salad for dinner
with chocolate soy candy for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to find out if our space foods wear well and
maintain their appeal if consumed as a complete diet for 30 days,''
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, researchers analyzed acceptability ratings from the
participants and food consumption. Additionally, researchers
studied the physical and psychological side effects of the
low-salt, high-fiber diet by tracking body weight and daily
measures of health, well-being and mood, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have developed about 250 recipes ready for
space.
</P>
<P>
   One volunteer, Elizabeth Babcock Woodring, passed up a taste of
her wedding cake when she got married during the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardest part was not being able to eat what we wanted when
we wanted, like late at night,'' said Woodring, a laboratory
technician in plant science at Cornell. ''In general, the food was
delicious, and I'm trying to make my diet more like theirs.''

<HEADLINE> Opening statements in trial of former Wall Street exec linked toporn star  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors say it was more than just pillow
talk between a married Wall Street executive and an X-rated movie
star three years ago that led to insider trading charges against
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Young K. Oh told jurors during
opening statements Monday that she will show them thousands of
pages of documents as well as bank, broker and telephone statements
to prove that James McDermott Jr. violated the law repeatedly with
sex-peddling actress Kathryn Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon is the star of ''Shades of Blonde,'' ''Sins of the
Flesh,'' ''The Passion Potion'' and ''The Violation of Marylin
Star,'' among other movies.
</P>
<P>
   Oh described Gannon only as a ''28-year-old blonde, an
attractive woman who was also a dancer and model'' and sometimes
performed under the stage name Marylin Star.
</P>
<P>
   The sanitized court version of Gannon's career was ordered by
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, who rejected government arguments
that her porn job explained why McDermott wanted to impress her
with his stock-knowledge prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of McDermott, the former chief executive officer at
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, sat behind him in court as Oh accused the
$4 million-a-year executive of living a dual life between 1997 and
1999 by engaging in the affair while seeming ''to be the master of
his universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh said McDermott supplemented Gannon's annual income of between
$50,000 and $100,000 with $80,000 in checks along with secret
information about six companies that allowed her to make large
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon then allegedly gave inside information to another man
with whom she was having an affair, Anthony Pomponio, who made
trades as well. Gannon and Pomponio made $170,000 on the illegal
stock trades over eight months, Oh said.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio is on trial with McDermott. The United States is
seeking the extradition of Gannon from her Canadian home.
</P>
<P>
   After several references to the affairs the men had with Gannon,
Oh told the jury she was ''not bringing up the extramarital affairs
to humiliate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Muller, a lawyer for McDermott, told the jury in his
opening statement that the charges against his client are false
while acknowledging the affair, which he said began in 1996 and has
''humiliated him over time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is that relationship that has brought him to this courtroom
today,'' Muller said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client's innocence would be clear if the jury
scrutinized what McDermott said to Gannon and when he said it.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the jurors would conclude McDermott recommended to
Gannon companies that were well-known merger candidates because
1997 and 1998 were years when bank stocks were undergoing merger
mania after deregulation by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Muller said McDermott made the recommendations to Gannon during
''thousands of opportunities, face to face or on the phone,''
before the stocks joined a list at McDermott's company that must be
kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer revealed how close McDermott had become to
Gannon when he said there were more than 500 telephone calls
between them and more than 300 beeper pages in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   It would be absurd to think McDermott would risk his $4
million-a-year job, his 26-year marriage and his relationship with
his two teen-age daughters to feed Gannon's inside stock tips, on
which she made only $15,000, Muller said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer noted that McDermott had enough extra cash that he
wrote her checks totaling nearly $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dunn, a lawyer for Pomponio, said his client did not
belong in court on criminal charges, especially after he revealed
everything he knew to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
volunteered to help the agency.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, Pomponio, 45, of North
Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, who has a home in Miami, Fla., are
all charged with conspiracy and securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and Pomponio remain free on bail.

Marines Remains Recovered From Wreckage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MARANA, Ariz. (AP) -- Military investigators prepared to begin removing the
remains of 19 Marines Tuesday from the charred wreckage of an MV-22 Osprey
aircraft that crashed and burst into flames during a training exercise. Removing
the bodies is expected to take several days, and DNA testing may be necessary to
identify the victims, said Marine Lt. Mark Carter, a spokesman for the Marine
Corps Air Station in Yuma, where the flight originated. Military investigators
spent Monday taking measurements and reviewing pieces of the Osprey, which takes
off and lands like a helicopter but flies like a plane.

More Vitamins Should Come From Food
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Americans should have more vitamins C and E in their
diets than currently recommended, huge doses of these vitamins and other
antioxidants have no proven benefit and may even be harmful, government
researchers said Monday. Antioxidants scavenge the body for roaming oxygen
molecules known as ''free radicals'' suspected of triggering cancer and other
disease. Many people routinely take high doses of vitamin C and other
antioxidants in the belief that they will prevent or cure illnesses. But not
enough evidence exists to support claims that massive doses of antioxidants can
improve health, said researchers from the Institute of Medicine.

their children at least four times in the past year about drug use. Sixty-four
percent said they have ''thoroughly'' covered the topic. A study last year by

<HEADLINE> Peach Farmers Expect Bumper Crop  </HEADLINE>
By DAN LEWERENZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- It's a good time to be a peach farmer in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A beneficial cold spell during the winter and the absence of any
damaging weather this fall have combined to give the state one of
its best peach crops in years.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this moment in time, I would say that we have the
best-looking prospects that we've had in 10 years,'' said Bob
McCurry, executive director of the South Carolina Peach Council.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Carolina's peach crop has averaged about 169
million pounds a year for the past five years, recent crops have
not been nearly so good. Hail reduced last year's crop to 160
million pounds, and farmers produced just 140 million pounds in
1998 after a disastrous spring freeze.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't know anymore what a full crop is,'' said
Charles Walker, managing director of the National Peach Council.
''As things look now, the South -- South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama
-- I don't see any reason why they shouldn't have a full crop.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he expected South Carolina farmers to produce 200
million pounds of peaches. He added that the good fortune was not
limited to the South -- the nation's top peach producing state,
California, appears poised for a bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think right now prospects for a good crop, both locally or
nationally, look good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers aren't just producing in high quantities -- the quality
of the fruit appears better than normal. The South Carolina
Agricultural Statistics Service reported last week that more than
half the crop was in excellent condition, with 94 percent in good
condition or better. Scattered frost last week did little or no
damage, the agency said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Washington used to be a white wine state,
but today merlot is the bread-and-butter grape of the $64 million
wine grape crop here.
</P>
<P>
   ''People used to say, 'You can't grow red wine in Washington
state. That's riesling country,''' says Steve Burns, director of
the Seattle-based wine commission.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is toasting the latest state agricultural
statistics on wine grape growing. In the last six years, vineyard
acreage in Washington has more than doubled -- from 11,100 acres to
24,869 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 64 percent of plantings were white wine grapes. In
1999, 56 percent were red wine grapes, the state Agricultural
Statistics Service says.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a greater demand for Washington wines than there is
grape supply, even with the increase in vineyard acreage,'' Burns
says.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,350 acres of new vineyards are expected to be
planted this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what this reflects is the word is out about Washington
state wines in the nation and, frankly, in the world,'' says Keith
Love, a spokesman for state's largest winery company,
Woodinville-based Stimson Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay, a white wine grape, still leads in the state with
6,100 acres in 1999, up from 2,600 acres in 1993. Riesling has
dropped from 2,000 acres in 1993 to 1,900 acres in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Acres in merlot have gone from 1,800 in 1993 to 5,600 in 1999.
Cabernet sauvignon is up from 1,400 acres to 5,000.

<HEADLINE> CENSUS OFFICIALS: Virginia gets to count Connecticut prisoners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- When it comes to the 2000 census,
Connecticut's loss is Virginia's gain.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the 477 Connecticut prisoners transported in
October and November to Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone
Gap, Va, to ease overcrowding are now officially residents of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Connecticut is paying Virginia as much as $11
million per year to house the prisoners, the inmates cannot be
included in Connecticut's census tally.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Census officials, a person is a resident of
the place in which he spends six months or more per year.
</P>
<P>
   When Connecticut's prison count was done last week, the absent
inmates were not added to the rolls. That could cost the state
about $2.8 million a year for the next 10 years, based on per
capita federal payment statistics, The Advocate of Stamford
reported. The federal money goes to schools, road improvements and
social services for disabled, low-income or unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said she's
upset that the state will not be able to count the transferred
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it's very frustrating if our state is paying thousands
of dollars to house to house prisoners out of state and we cannot
count them in our own state. ... Federal funds are critical to
Connecticut,'' Bysiewicz told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''When these prisoners finish paying their debt to society, most
likely they will be back in our state and they will be consumers of
all of the services those federal funds will be used for,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Current preliminary projections show that Connecticut is likely
to lose a Congressional seat, census officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rocks, head of the Census Bureau's Hartford regional
office, said the reason is not that Connecticut's population is
shrinking -- Connecticut's population has been growing since 1997 --
but that other states have grown faster over a longer period.
</P>
<P>
   Bysiewicz noted that the state also appeared in danger of losing
a seat in 1990, but kept it by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am urging people to fill out their census forms and get them
back ... I don't want people in Connecticut to be discouraged by
the fact that we might lose a seat and then not bother to fill them
out. It's very important that we get the most complete and accurate
count possible.''

<HEADLINE> Report shows improvements at Long Lane  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A report on the performance of the
state's juvenile detention center finds improvements in the
treatment and behavior of inmates, but problems with security.
</P>
<P>
   The report, paid for by the U.S. Department of Justice, compares
the Long Lane School in Middletown to 31 other juvenile detention
centers across the country. The facilities volunteered for the
study and were graded on 96 points such as safety, security and
programs for residents. The report compares performances in June
1998 and August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, including the amount of mental health treatment
residents receive, Long Lane performed better than the average of
the other facilities. It fared worse than the average in areas such
as resident misconduct, attacks on staff, and escapes, although the
school's own numbers in that area improved between reporting
periods.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The report) shows some progress at Long Lane,'' Rep. Robert
Farr, R-West Hartford, said Monday. ''But I think there are still
going to be problems until they move into the new facility.
Hopefully the assaults on staff members will be reduced and the
kids and staff will feel more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 2001, Long Lane will be replaced by a new
state-of-the-art complex, also in Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes after the Legislature's Program Review and
Investigations Committee has recommended stripping DCF of juvenile
justice responsibilities. Long Lane has been under political and
public scrutiny since a 15-year-old committed suicide in 1998. The
facility, which currently houses about 200 juveniles, also has been
troubled by recidivism and runaways.
</P>
<P>
   While the report shows major misconduct by juveniles was cut
nearly in half, it does not offer specific numbers. There were more
incidents of misconduct at Long Lane than other facilities,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Doug McAvay, Long Lane's assistant superintendent, estimated
there were 438 incidents of misconduct in June 1998. That number
fell to about 234 in August 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've improved significantly,'' said Kristine Ragaglia,
commissioner of the Department of Children and Families which
oversees Long Lane and the state's juvenile justice system. ''It
looks like we've turned a major corner in terms of programming and
mental health services.''
</P>
<P>
   There were about 20 staff injuries resulting from conflicts with
juveniles during August 1999, compared to one a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The number of escapes from Long Lane was down in 1999, but still
above the national average. Ragaglia blames that number on the lack
of solid security systems at the 129-year-old Long Lane School.

   ''The new facility will make a big difference for safety and
security,'' Ragaglia said ''We've had more walkaways, but we're one
of few programs that doesn't have multiple locking systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven percent of the 30 Long Lane staff members surveyed
said last August that they fear for their safety. Only 20 percent
said they were afraid in June 1998. An average of 20 percent of
staff members at the other juvenile detention facilities said they
fear for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   David Crowley, a consultant who worked on the report, said the
fear factor has increased because staff members are more engaged
with the residents. New programs require the staff to interact more
with the juveniles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As that continues, and they get more education and training,
they'll feel more comfortable and less afraid,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Services trying to track down 12,000 recipients  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state is trying to find some 12,000
people who were sent $50 sales tax rebate checks that were returned
by the post office as undeliverable.
</P>
<P>
   The undelivered check total is nearly three times the amount
from the state's first rebate program two years ago, and it
primarily involves Social Security recipients, Department of
Revenue Services spokeswoman Ellen Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Some outdated addresses are expected in any program of this
size, Schneider said, noting that about 4,000 of the 1.5 million
income tax rebate checks were returned in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 of the undelivered checks from last year's program
this time involve Social Security recipients. The names and
addresses of those recipients were given to the state by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The undelivered checks are one of a number of problems in the
1999 rebate program, which also has struggled with faulty
projections of eligible recipients, a funding shortfall, and delays
in receiving address information from federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 rebate originally was budgeted to return $108 million
in state surplus funds to 2.16 million taxpayers: 1.86 million
people who filed state income tax returns, 200,000 Connecticut
residents who filed only federal returns, and 100,000 Social
Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Checks to most state return filers went out in September, with
the rest due out in late December after address lists were obtained
from the U.S. Social Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   State tax officials announced the first delay in December,
blaming faulty electronic tape from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, before taking administrative leave, tax
Commissioner Eugene Gavin said rebate recipient projections were
way off, and another 220,000 federal filers and Social Security
recipients needed checks, meaning the program required an infusion
of another $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, new federal mailing data was obtained and all of the
remaining checks have been sent out, Schneider said. But many have
come back.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers are researching the returned checks, comparing them
with departmental records to see if errors can be cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Revenue Services is asking anyone who believes
they should have received a rebate check to call the agency. In the
Hartford area, residents can call (860) 297-5962. Elsewhere in the
state, the call is toll free at (800) 382-9463.

<HEADLINE> Weapons still going to youth programs, newspaper says  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Since the tragedy at Columbine High School almost a
year ago,
the Clinton administration has zealously pursued efforts to keep
guns away from children. But the administration has also continued
to support junior marksmanship programs through the sale of surplus
U.S. Army rifles, according to a published report.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of affiliated gun clubs have been able to purchase
surplus weapons at discount prices through the Corporation for the
Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised through the sales is used to sponsor
marksmanship programs and shooting contests around the nation, the
Connecticut Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1998, the U.S. Army turned over more than
56,000 rifles -- mostly World War II-era M-1 Garands -- with an
estimated value of $19 million to the nonprofit organization, the
Bridgeport, Conn., newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bad policy. It really is an insult for the
government to make these guns available,'' said Kim Harrison,
coordinator for the Connecticut Collaborative for Education Against
Gun Violence.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established the nonprofit corporation in 1996 to take
over the Civilian Marksmanship Program from the U.S. Army. The
program started in 1903 as a way to encourage individuals to
develop marksmanship skill to prepare them in the event they were
called to serve during wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Army no longer administers the program, it has not
ended its involvement. The Army and other defense agencies had
provided more than $19 million in support as of Sept. 30, 1998,
according to a General Accounting Office report.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Army had transferred more than 56,000 firearms
to the corporation and was storing more than 230,000 M-1s, over
35,000 .22-caliber rifles and more than 4,000 other firearms for
potential transfer to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation said it sold 22,584 firearms between Oct. 1,
1996, and Sept. 30, 1998. Of those, 74 percent were sold to
individuals and 26 percent to some of its 1,033 affiliated clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Over 72 percent of all firearms sold were M-1s, a semiautomatic
rifle. The corporation charged between $400 and $750 for each
rifle, depending on its condition.
</P>
<P>
   James Scheibeler, youth director for the Civilian Marksmanship
Program in Connecticut, said that the program promotes safety,
which is at the heart of recent calls to end gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Scheibeler said the students he coaches learn discipline and
self-control, and gain self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt in my mind that it has saved lives,''
Scheibeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Crook, director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen,
said that when surplus guns are sold, buyers must pass a federal
background check, be U.S. citizens and belong to an affiliated
club. He also said the surplus rifles are not the kind used in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Criminals don't use expensive guns. They can buy
semiautomatics for a couple of hundred dollars,'' he said. ''Plus,
these are 3 feet long and heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   The program came under attack two years ago in the Senate, where
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., tried to block the transfer of
surplus rifles to the program. He said the transfers went against a
federal policy that states surplus firearms may be sold only for
scrap.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level of gun violence in America is already high enough
without putting a couple hundred thousand M-1 rifles into general
circulation,'' Lautenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 71 to 29 against Lautenberg's proposal, which
would have repealed the federal charter for the nonprofit
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said she would encourage the federal government to
adopt a similar policy as Connecticut, which does not sell state
surplus weapons to private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison also rejected the argument that selling the surplus
guns promotes safety since anyone purchasing a gun in Connecticut
is already required to go through a training program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Promoting safety through discounts to teens is really
ridiculous,'' she said.

	   WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) -- America's domestic goddess says she's
moving from her country home.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece written for The New York Times Sunday magazine,
Martha Stewart said she's leaving this posh suburb of because she's
fed up with an ''unfriendly neighborhood atmosphere,'' a difficult
commute to New York City and the loss of the small-town feeling
Westport once had.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said she is sad to think about leaving the town she has
lived in for the last 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart, who has sometimes clashed with her neighbors over
filming her television show at her home, said Westport ''just
doesn't work'' for her any more.
</P>
<P>
   She laments the change from a small town where butchers knew
their customers' names to a place with a ''more elitist, and much
less charming, retail scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart says that although she used to be on personal terms with
her neighbors, today she knows very few of them. She talks of
offering fresh eggs or garden produce to newcomers, but being
rebuffed twice -- ''once with a slammed door!''
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it will be to leave my Westport home, I no longer
feel connected to the neighborhood, the neighbors or even the
town,'' Stewart wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Westport has been a celebrity enclave for years. Paul Newman and
Joanne Woodward live in town; so does singer Michael Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart says she will probably live in Manhattan full-time,
although she says she may end up moving to another town that is
closer to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''But wherever I end up, I'm sure that my current feelings of
frustration about Westport will eventually mellow to a fond liking.
After all, things change,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is chief executive officer of Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia, a publisher of books and magazines, and producer of a
syndicated column and a TV program that gives homemaking and
entertaining tips.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Magrino, a spokeswoman for Stewart, said she will continue
to film her television show at her studio in Westport. Stewart
filmed the show at her home until 1998, when she opened a new
studio across town.
</P>
<P>
   Magrino also said Stewart has no immediate plans to sell her
house in Westport.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris lobbyist banned from Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Tobacco giant Philip Morris has been
fined $20,000 and one of their lobbyists has been banned from doing
business in Connecticut for one year for lying about how much money
she spent wining and dining state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement with the state's Ethics Commission, Sharon
Portnoy also must pay a $4,000 fine. She is the first lobbyist ever
prohibited from working in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy has also been fined and barred from lobbying in New York
for three years for similar offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy failed to register as a lobbyist in Connecticut, said
Alan Plofsky, executive director of the Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''She came often enough to Connecticut to deal with lawmakers,''
Plofsky said. ''She should have registered, but she had a disregard
for the basic requirement of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris is being fined for failing to report all of the
company's lobbying efforts in Connecticut, Plofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers lobbied by Portnoy were not identified in the
settlement, but Plofsky said they did not violate state ethics
codes because they were being misled.
</P>
<P>
   Under Connecticut law, lobbyists must report each time they
spend more than $10 entertaining a lawmaker. After three meals in
1997 and 1998, Portnoy lied about how many people were at the
dinners in order to reduce the per person cost of the meals,
Plofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Portnoy spent more than $186 on a single public
official. Under state law at the time, she could only spend up to
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy's lawyer, Linda Imes, refused to comment on the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement, Philip Morris and Portnoy denied
that the violations alleged in the Ethics Commission complaint were
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy has been on paid administrative leave since October,
when she admitted to lying on reports to hide money she had spent
entertaining New York lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris was fined $75,000 in that case. Portnoy was also
fined, banned from lobbying in New York for three years and faces a
possible criminal investigation.

<HEADLINE> AP series on Korea killings earns Pulitzer; Washington Post, WallStreet Journal multiple winners  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stories and photos about mass killings -- from
Korea to Colorado to Kosovo -- have earned Pulitzer Prizes in
journalism, among them an investigative reporting award to The
Associated Press for its series on a bloody incident involving U.S.
soldiers early in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In the honors announced Monday at Columbia University, the
Washington Post won three Pulitzers, for public service, criticism
and feature photography; the Wall Street Journal won two, for
national reporting on U.S. defense spending and deployment in the
post-Cold War era and for columnist Paul Gigot's commentary on
public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Denver daily newspapers were honored for coverage of the
Columbine High School massacre. The Denver Post staff won for
breaking news reporting, and the Denver Rocky Mountain News photo
staff won for spot news photography.
</P>
<P>
   The international reporting prize went to The Village Voice, a
New York City weekly, for Mark Schoofs' series on the AIDS crisis
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I'm thrilled, and this is an incredible moment for
The Village Voice,'' Schoofs said, ''but for the people that I
reported on, unfortunately nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer for explanatory journalism went to Eric Newhouse of
the Great Falls (Mont.) Tribune for stories on alcohol abuse and
its impact on the community. George Dohrmann of the St. Paul
(Minn.) Pioneer Press won the beat reporting award for revelations
of academic fraud in the University of Minnesota men's basketball
program.
</P>
<P>
   The award for feature writing went to a portrait of Gee's Bend,
a remote Alabama settlement inhabited by many descendants of
slaves, by J.R. Moehringer, the Los Angeles Times' bureau chief in
New Orleans. The Pulitzer for editorial writing went to John C.
Bersia of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel for his criticism of
predatory lending practices, and Joel Pett of the Lexington (Ky.)
Herald-Leader won for editorial cartooning.
</P>
<P>
   In the arts categories, Donald Margulies' off-Broadway play
''Dinner With Friends'' won the drama prize, David M. Kennedy's
book, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and
War, 1929-45,'' won for history, and the general nonfiction prize
went to John W. Dower's ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is astonishing. I'm going to dance around with my wife
for a few moments,'' said Dower, a professor of history at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he had given up wine for Lent but might ''give
myself a dispensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Schiff's ''Vera (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)'' won for
biography, and Jhumpa Lahiri's ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' a
collection of short stories, was named for fiction. ''Repair,'' by
C.K. Williams, won for poetry, and composer Lewis Spratlan's ''Life
is a Dream, Opera in Three Acts: Act Two, Concert Version'' got the
music Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm going to get outside and take a walk,'' said
Schiff, who is nine months pregnant and on bed rest.
</P>
<P>
   The AP series, describing the alleged mass killing by U.S.
soldiers of hundreds of Korean civilians at No Gun Ri, a railroad
bridge in South Korea, was reported by a team of three reporters,
Charles Hanley, Sang-hun Choe and Martha Mendoza, with research
assistance by Randy Herschaft.
</P>
<P>
   The July 1950 incident occurred as American forces fought
rearguard actions against North Korean invaders who were thought to
be infiltrating fleeing refugees. The previously undisclosed
details have prompted investigations by Congress and the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The AP team thanked the Pulitzer board and jurors but said the
victory was ''tempered by the nature of what we confirmed ... the
greater tributes today belong to the U.S. Army veterans, men of
conscience, who helped us, and most of all to the Korean survivors
who would not let their quest for truth die.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post's gold medal for the public service was for
stories by Katherine Boo about neglect and abuse in city-run homes
for the mentally retarded. The Post also won last year; it was the
first time any paper won public service two years running.
</P>
<P>
   The other Post winners were Henry Allen, for his criticism on
photography, and photographers Carol Guzy, Michael Williamson and
Lucian Perkins for feature photographs of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Guzy said Kosovo was ''one time where photos were indeed an
eloquent voice for the powerless and clearly influenced world
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gigot, The Wall Street Journal columnist who won for
commentary, said: ''I guess I want to thank President Clinton for
doing so much for the cause of political journalism. Had I known
what he would do for columnists in 1992, I might have voted for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Each winning entry receives $5,000, except for the newspaper
public service award, which brings a gold medal to the newspaper
winner.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 18 Months For Kidnapping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A man who became the subject of a
nationwide manhunt when he and his wife kidnapped their
malnourished son from a hospital has been sentenced to 18 months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher and Kyndra Fink were accused of starving their son,
David, for religious reasons. Authorities said the pair believed
the child was the ''Christ child'' and fed him only watermelon and
lettuce to keep him pure.
</P>
<P>
   The Finks -- now divorced -- sparked a nationwide manhunt in 1998
when they took their 21-month-old boy from a Utah hospital, where
he had been taken by relatives for treatment of severe
malnutrition. Police found the couple 16 days later, living in a
tent in the mountains of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Fink pleaded guilty to child abuse and attempted aggravated
assault for his part in his son's malnourishment and kidnapping. He
was given credit for 404 days already served, so his remaining
sentence will be about five months.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Roger Bean also ordered Fink to take any necessary
medication to deal with a possible ''major thought disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Fink's former wife is scheduled for sentencing April 24.
Prosecutors have agreed to recommend no more than 90 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's two children remain in foster care.

   Last month, the high court upheld the law, which gives adoptees
21 and older access to their original birth records. Those records
usually contain birth parents' names.

<P>
   A petition could prompt the high court to reconsider its ruling.

<HEADLINE> Was Sending Elian's Father a Risk?  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro appeared to be taking a huge risk
when he sent Juan Miguel Gonzalez to the United States to retrieve
his 6-year-old son Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's Miami relatives said Elian's father had once talked
of moving to the United States. Gonzalez himself had said Cuban
exiles in Miami had offered him money to defect and raise his boy
in America.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba experts say Castro's risks were minimal. Even if
Gonzalez once considered emigrating to the States, he obviously now
feels beholden to Castro and a nation of 11 million that made Elian
a boy hero by rallying thousands of people daily chanting for his
return.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Castro was running any particular risk,'' said
Wayne Smith, a Cuba scholar who served as chief U.S. diplomat in
Havana during the Reagan and Carter administrations. ''I think that
Castro is absolutely confident that the father wants his son and
wants to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was probably some risk involved, said Susan
Eckstein, a sociology professor from Boston University who
specializes in the study of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know what the father could be promised,'' said
Eckstein. ''If the Cuban American community worked so hard on
Elian, it could work just as hard on the father.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of defecting when he arrived in Washington on
Thursday, Gonzalez thanked the Cuban people and its leader for
unflagging support.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, said Gonzalez, ''has been like a brother giving me
advice and support through our long days of pain and uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's Miami relatives and their supporters for months
claimed that Elian's father would not go to the United States to
reclaim his boy because Castro's government feared he would stay.
</P>
<P>
   The father said he merely wanted assurances that his boy would
be returned to him quickly. ''Miami Cubans would just entangle me
in their political games,'' Gonzalez said in mid-January, refusing
to travel to the United States until he felt sure he would get his
son.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government provided Gonzalez with those assurances
several days before he left.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he wishes that Gonzalez had come to the United States
months ago, thinking that an earlier trip may have helped wrap up
the international custody dispute earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And he was glad that someone, apparently American attorney
Gregory Craig, persuaded Cuban officials to drop their insistence
that Gonzalez travel only if accompanied by an entourage of 27
other people, including a dozen first-graders from Elian's school
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Castro often does not have a good sense of appealing to the
American public,'' said Smith. ''The idea of bringing all of those
people was not playing out well here.''
</P>
<P>
   What has played out well, Smith said, are the images of
Gonzalez, his wife and his photogenic 6-month-old son -- a young,
attractive family on a mission to retrieve a beloved son.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is interesting about all this is that it shows that the
Cuban revolution has not done away with the importance of family,''
said Eckstein. ''And that sometimes family is more important than
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez probably has less reason to defect than many average
Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Cuba's Communist Party, he and his family are
longtime supporters of Castro -- even more so since the Cuban leader
has made Elian's return a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And because Gonzalez works in the tourism industry in the resort
of Varadero, just outside his hometown of Cardenas, he has access
to much coveted U.S. dollars, allowing him to live more comfortably
than many here.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also has seemed disgusted by what he says is the
commercialization of his boy, and the capitalist excesses poured on
Elian just days after his rescue at sea. There was a
well-publicized trip to Disney World, and televised images of the
child surrounded by expensive toys such as a motorized dune buggy
and a giant Mickey Mouse doll.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after Elian was rescued off the Florida
coast, Gonzalez denounced the ''extremist Cuban-American Mafia,''
accusing exile groups of offering him $2 million to move to Miami
and stay with Elian there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gonzalez's Miami relatives insinuated that he didn't
care about Elian because he didn't hop on a U.S.-bound plane
immediately to reclaim the boy. In recent weeks, attorneys for the
relatives in Miami even put forward the idea that Gonzalez was an
unfit father.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been stabbing him in the back,'' Smith said. ''The
whole idea of them inviting him to have dinner at the house in
Miami is absurd.''

<HEADLINE> South Korea To Hold Elections Thur.  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- One candidate with a sword beheaded a
crude effigy symbolizing corrupt politics. One has held mock
funerals, with a coffin as a prop, for government sleaze. Another
collects garbage in Seoul to show his record is clean.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of parliamentary elections on Thursday, candidates from
rival parties snipe at each other and trumpet reformist
credentials, false or not. The cacophony obscures basic questions:
what do the parties stand for and what are their differences?
</P>
<P>
   Fresh debate emerged Monday with the announcement that President
Kim Dae-jung will hold a historic summit in June with Kim Jong Il,
the leader of communist North Korea. Opposition leaders accused the
government of trying to time the announcement to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans are proud of their turbulent break with
authoritarianism a decade ago, and some even smile fondly when they
recall street protests and wafting tear gas. But their young
democracy, while firmly entrenched, is still growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a civic campaign against old voting patterns, many
people are expected to choose candidates from their regions,
regardless of their resumes or policies. Supporters still line up
for meal coupons and other gifts at some campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of South Koreans will sit out the vote, weary of
graft and other scandals in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sick of politicians, all corrupt and divisive. Even if I
were to vote, I don't think it would help change anything,'' said
Park Sung-joo, a 20-year-old real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are 227 parliamentary seats chosen by direct vote and
another 46 to be filled by a proportional representation system
counting the total number of votes to each party.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean leadership remains fractured and chameleon-like
more than two years after the election of President Kim, a former
opposition leader and democracy champion who first ran for the
nation's top office in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's victory, based largely on support from his southwestern
home region of Honam, was so slim that he was forced to form a
ruling coalition with a conservative rival, Kim Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance collapsed in February, and the president's
minority Millennium Democratic Party, or MDP, will likely try to
make a deal with its old partners after the vote. None of the four
big parties is expected to win a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The office of president holds enormous power in South Korea, a
legacy of the hierarchical Confucian system that shaped political
culture here hundreds of years ago. But a weak showing by Kim's
party would undermine his clout in the remaining three years of his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   His signature policies are economic reforms mandated by the
International Monetary Fund in the wake of the Asian currency
crisis, and the encouragement of business and other contacts to
ease tension with North Korea. The two Koreas fought a war 50 years
ago and today share a heavily militarized border.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kim's popularity has not surged in tandem with the rapid
economic recovery that South Korea has enjoyed on his watch,
probably because voters remain wedded to old political loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition Grand National Party commands a majority in
the outgoing chamber and was in power during South Korea's
authoritarian days. It survived the transition to democracy,
largely because of its traditional power base in the southeastern
region, Youngnam.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by its own fissures, the opposition has seized on any
issue that might help at the polls, including the recent spread of
the deadly foot-and-mouth disease among pigs and cows in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a GNP official demanded the resignation of the
agriculture minister, saying he was spending too much time on the
campaign trail and not enough dealing with the livestock crisis.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of Poor Nations in Havana  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Leaders from the world's developing countries
meeting in Cuba plan to focus on winning debt relief and finding
ways to increase their involvement in the world's knowledge-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering is the first time that the 133-nation ''Group of
77,'' founded in 1964, is holding a summit at the level of heads of
state. Until now, the organization has been a bloc within the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's chairman, Arthur Mbanefo of Nigeria, told a
news conference Monday that the summit would look for ways to help
poorer nations fit into an increasingly wired world -- despite
problems such as power and telephone shortfalls that make Internet
connections difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Mbanefo, his country's ambassador to the United Nations, also
indicated the group may urge developed countries to relieve poorer
nations' heavy debt burden. ''We would like to see a situation
where some of this debt is canceled,'' he said, noting that some
countries spend twice as much servicing their debts as they do on
social services.
</P>
<P>
   Working meetings of lower-level officials began Monday. Talks by
heads of state were to take place Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is ''unmistakable proof that our countries want our
voice to be heard, that the interest of our countries, which are
the majority, be taken into account,'' Cuban Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque told a news conference. He said the G-77
countries represent 80 percent of the earth's population.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and summit officials estimated that more than 60 heads of
state or government would appear, along with scores of foreign
ministers and other senior officials. By Monday, 122 member
countries had sent delegations, as had 34 nonmember countries and
35 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Already in Havana on Monday were Nigerian President Olusegun
Obansanjo, Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong, and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was greeted at the airport by
Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Also expected were leaders of Indonesia,
South Africa, Cambodia, Venezuela, Pakistan and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The G-77 was created in 1964 by 77 developing nations and has
grown to 133 members as new countries have emerged with the end of
the colonial era.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Perez Roque said, the ratio of wealth between
the richest and poorest 20 percent of the world's people has grown
from 30-1 to 82-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''The developed countries have to recognize their
responsibility'' in alleviating poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Roque said the resolutions could form the basis for a
common front at a ''Millennium Summit'' of world leaders at the
United Nations in September.
</P>
<P>
   Within Cuba itself, the summit has been overshadowed by a
6-year-old boy: Elian Gonzalez and the Cuban government's battle to
win his repatriation from the United States.

<HEADLINE> AP Wins Pulitzer For No Gun Ri  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For nearly 50 years, the story of No Gun Ri went
unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Koreans who said American soldiers had killed hundreds of
civilians in the tiny hamlet in the early days of the Korean War
were rebuffed in Washington and Seoul, their story ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1998, newsman Sang-hun Choe of The Associated Press
reported the survivors' allegations and the U.S. military's denial
that the Army unit they blamed was anywhere near No Gun Ri.
Investigative researcher Randy Herschaft quickly found records
discrediting the denial, and AP launched a broader investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the project won the Pulitzer Prize, the news
cooperative's first in the investigative reporting category. Choe,
reporter Martha Mendoza, AP Special Correspondent Charles J. Hanley
and Herschaft spent months digging in U.S. military archives and
interviewing veterans and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   They produced a mountain of evidence to support the Koreans'
charges -- that U.S. soldiers machine-gunned hundreds of civilian
refugees at No Gun Ri in July 1950, including many cowering under a
railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne corks popped and cheers rang out at AP headquarters as
reporters, editors and executives celebrated the prize.
</P>
<P>
   The winners were thrilled, but said their excitement was
tempered by sorrow over the tragedy they discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great news,'' said Mendoza, 33, speaking by telephone
from Phoenix. But, she added, ''This was a story about people dying
and people's lives being ruined, so that's on my mind at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korean villagers said about 400 people were killed at No Gun
Ri, including 100 machine-gunned by U.S. warplanes. The AP cited a
dozen American veterans who confirmed the Koreans' charges,
although their recollections of the number killed varied.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very proud of the story and of the people whose talent
made it possible,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president and CEO.
''It was powerful and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, which led to stories uncovering other fatal
attacks, would make the Korean killings only the second known case
of large-scale slayings of noncombatants by U.S. ground troops in
the 20th century's major wars. The other was Vietnam's My Lai
massacre, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley, 52, who has reported for the AP from more than 70
countries, is on leave writing a book about No Gun Ri. He said he
and his collaborators were grateful their story was recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very proud,'' he said. ''But our celebration has to be
tempered by the nature of what we confirmed. The greater tributes
today really belong to the U.S. veterans who helped us ... and most
of all to the Korean survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was a national writer with the AP Special Assignment
Team in 1997 and '98 and is now correspondent in San Jose, Calif.
She was recently named a national investigative reporter.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Ahearn, AP vice president and executive editor, said
the prize was a tribute to the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, since it's the first Pulitzer for investigative reporting
won by AP, it's a tribute to the efforts of so many in the last
decade in particular to instill hard-edged journalism throughout
the ranks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herschaft, 39, who joined AP in 1985, said seeing the story win
was ''an exhilarating feeling.'' Choe, 36, speaking by phone from
Korea, said it was great news for the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank them for telling their stories to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the first AP story, a follow-up piece reported
that hundreds of other refugees were killed by U.S. forces in other
incidents in the war's first weeks, many when two bridges were
blown up as civilians streamed across.
</P>
<P>
   A later report said American jets repeatedly attacked groups of
Koreans in civilian clothes in 1950 and '51, in some cases killing
hundreds of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Korean survivors had been telling their story for years, but
their accounts were dismissed by officials in Washington and Seoul.
After the AP report was published and broadcast -- on the news
cooperative's print, television, radio and Internet services -- both
the Pentagon and South Korea opened investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors are seeking payment and an apology from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   Managing Editor Jonathan Wolman said the award highlighted AP's
investigative reporting and its ability to disseminate stories in
many media. The award was the 46th Pulitzer Prize the AP has won.
</P>
<P>
   ''The work came from across 10,000 miles, and it's a proud day
for all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The No Gun Ri story has won a number of other prizes: The George
Polk Award for international reporting, the SAIS-Novartis
International Journalism award, a first place National Headliner
Award for coverage of a major news event, a special award for
excellence from the Samsung Press Foundation and a journalist's
award from the Korea Journalists Association.

<HEADLINE> Criteria Set for Ethiopian Jews  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Thousands of displaced Ethiopians
sang Israel's national anthem and spoke broken Hebrew, trying to
persuade Israel's interior minister to grant them entry to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Minister Natan Sharansky compared their plight to his own
struggle to reach Israel from Soviet Russia, but said in a visit
Monday to a dusty transit camp that he would not grant visas to all
26,000 because many were simply wanted a free ticket to the
relatively prosperous Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for the community, however, accused him of
discriminating against the Falash Mura while approving the
immigration of hundreds of thousands of non-Jews from the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Falash Mura are Ethiopian Jews who converted to Christianity and
their descendants. In recent years, 18,000 have left homes in
anticipation of moving to Israel and have rented small mud huts
near two compounds run by immigration activists in Addis Ababa, the
capital, and in the northern city of Gondar.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of their displacement prompted a promise Monday from
Sharansky, who spent nine years in Soviet prisons for trying to
help Jews emigrate, to end a bureaucratic stalemate and process
their applications within months. He said approval would be granted
on the basis of a law that grants citizenship to Jews and their
children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Criteria for reunifying families would also be established,
Sharansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the compound in Addis Ababa showed Sharansky their
commitment to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Women baked matzah, unleavened bread used for the Jewish holiday
of Passover, over an open fire, while children sang Hebrew songs
and knitted ritual prayer fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, wearing his trademark khaki cap and sneakers, visited
rickety shacks where children sat on wooden benches, studying
Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why did you come here?'' he asked 15-year-old Fakato Tarke.
</P>
<P>
   ''To join my father in Israel,'' Tarke replied, telling
Sharansky in broken Hebrew that he has been waiting for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky promised to speed the process by sending officials to
Ethiopia to check applications.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in jail in Russia for nine years because I wanted to
reach Israel,'' he reminded them.
</P>
<P>
   However, accepting all who wanted to come, he said, would set a
precedent that would flood Israel with immigration requests on
hardship grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suffering doesn't make someone Jewish,'' Sharansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Goldman, one of the compound organizers, said Israel was
deliberately stonewalling the Falash Mura because they are ''poor
and black.''
</P>
<P>
   Their absorption costs Israel a lot of money in stipends and
social services, and many Israelis oppose the immigration of a
group they consider to be non-Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Mula, an immigration official responsible for settling
Ethiopian Jews in Israel, said that race had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Falash Mura decided to be Jewish 10 years ago, when they
saw Ethiopian Jews coming to Israel,'' said Mula, who made the
dangerous trek from Ethiopia to the Sudan 15 years ago to reach
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations of reaching Israel have created irreversible
migration.
</P>
<P>
   Yenesewbeza Bitewa left her house and farmland in northern
Ethiopia two years ago, at the request of her married daughter, who
immigrated to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't go back, because our land has been taken by the
people in the village,'' she said.

   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- A drug called Uprima is poised to give the
famous blue impotence pill Viagra its first competition: Government
advisers say it works well enough that it should be allowed to sell
as long as men are warned that it has some dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Viagra, which eases impotence by increasing blood flow to
the penis, Uprima works in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration recommended on a
9-3 vote Monday that it helps enough men regain erections that it
should be sold -- as long as patients and their doctors understand
it causes worrisome problems and isn't for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   One in every 30 men who tested Uprima's optimal dose fainted or
suffered seriously low blood pressure. A few fell and hit their
heads, one fracturing his skull. Another crashed his car.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be some people who will probably lose their lives
because they pass out at the top of stairs or are operating a car''
when they faint, warned FDA adviser and Philadelphia cardiologist
Dr. Peter Kowey.
</P>
<P>
   ''This drug is clearly going to kill some people,'' agreed Dr.
Robert Califf of Duke University, worried about heart patients
taking other medicines that lower blood pressure. He also advised
FDA to label Uprima with warnings against drinking alcohol while
taking Uprima, saying even a few drinks may increase the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kowey and Califf joined the majority in recommending the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is not bound by its advisers' decisions but typically
follows them.
</P>
<P>
   Uprima manufacturer TAP Pharmaceuticals said men desperately
need alternative treatments. Uprima is not an aphrodisiac but seems
to increase levels of an important neurochemical called dopamine in
a brain region thought important for causing erections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your brain is your most important sexual organ,'' said Dr.
Timothy Fagan of the University of Arizona, who helped test the
drug for TAP, a joint venture between Abbott Laboratories and
Takeda Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike Viagra, Uprima is not swallowed but dissolved under
the tongue, where it seeps into the bloodstream through mouth
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra became a huge seller when it hit the market in 1998 as
the only oral impotence treatment -- and Viagra has killed some men.
Viagra's big risk is a deadly interaction when taken by men using
nitrate-containing heart medicine.
</P>
<P>
   TAP said that in studies of 3,000 patients, mostly lasting a
month, no Uprima user died or had a heart attack. Still, FDA's
advisers couldn't say Uprima would be any safer for nitrate-using
heart patients.
</P>
<P>
   In studies, the optimal dose seemed to be 4 milligrams of
Uprima, which allows men to have an erection capable of intercourse
56 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But a sugar pill worked for these same men a third of the time,
the FDA cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Taking doses of Uprima higher than 4 mg was a little more
effective, but TAP decided the higher doses caused too many side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   But even the optimal 4-mg dose caused either low blood pressure
or a brief fainting spell in one of every 30 men, FDA officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 5 percent of men suffered nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, sweating or sleepiness.
</P>
<P>
   But the most serious side effects included:
</P>
<P>
   --A 33-year-old man took 4 mg of Uprima in his doctor's office
but, while driving home 30 minutes later, became nauseous, sweaty,
tired and flushed. He attempted to stop his car but fainted and
crashed into a fence.
</P>
<P>
   --A 56-year-old who took 4 mg of Uprima fainted for 15 to 20
minutes and was hospitalized with severely low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   --A 42-year-old took a little higher dose, 5 mg, and passed out
in his doctor's office. Falling, he hit his head and fractured his
skull.
</P>
<P>
   TAP Pharmaceuticals says fainting should be preventible. Some 85
percent of men who faint have nausea, vomiting or sweating first,
signs they should sit or lie down, Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Blood pressure is usually higher while lying down than standing.
In addition, if Uprima is sold, most men will take it at home and
then fairly quickly lie down -- Uprima's instructions say to take it
about half an hour before sex.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's advisers also want men to understand that Uprima won't
help all types of impotence. It wasn't even studied in men with the
most severe forms.

<HEADLINE> AP expose of Korean War killings wins investigative Pulitzer  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For nearly 50 years, the story of No Gun Ri went
unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Koreans who said American soldiers had killed hundreds of
civilians in the tiny hamlet in the early days of the Korean War
were rebuffed in Washington and Seoul, their story ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1998, Associated Press newsman Sang-hun Choe reported
the survivors' allegations and the U.S. military's denial that the
Army unit they blamed was anywhere near No Gun Ri. Investigative
researcher Randy Herschaft quickly found records discrediting the
denial, and the AP launched a broader investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the project won the Pulitzer Prize, the news
cooperative's first in the investigative reporting category. Choe,
reporter Martha Mendoza, AP Special Correspondent Charles J. Hanley
and Herschaft spent months digging in U.S. military archives and
interviewing veterans and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   They produced a mountain of evidence to support the Koreans'
charges -- that U.S. soldiers machine-gunned hundreds of civilian
refugees at No Gun Ri in July 1950, including many cowering under a
railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne corks popped and cheers rang out at AP headquarters as
reporters, editors and executives celebrated the prize.
</P>
<P>
   The winners were thrilled but said their excitement was tempered
by sorrow over the tragedy they discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great news,'' said Mendoza, 33, speaking by telephone
from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ''This was a story about people dying and
people's lives being ruined, so that's on my mind at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korean villagers said about 400 people were killed at No Gun
Ri, including 100 machine-gunned by U.S. warplanes. The AP cited a
dozen American veterans who confirmed the Koreans' charges,
although their recollections of the number killed varied.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very proud of the story and of the people whose talent
made it possible,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, the AP's president and
CEO. ''It was powerful and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, which led to stories uncovering other fatal
attacks, would make the Korean killings only the second known case
of large-scale slayings of noncombatants by U.S. ground troops in
the 20th century's major wars. The other was Vietnam's 1968 My Lai
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley, 52, who has reported for the AP from more than 70
countries, is on leave writing a book about No Gun Ri. He said he
and his collaborators were grateful their story was recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very proud,'' he said. ''But our celebration has to be
tempered by the nature of what we confirmed. The greater tributes
today really belong to the U.S. veterans who helped us ... and most
of all to the Korean survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was a national writer with the AP Special Assignment
Team in 1997 and '98 and is now a correspondent in San Jose, Calif.
She was recently named a national investigative reporter.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Ahearn, AP vice president and executive editor, said
the prize was a tribute to the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, since it's the first Pulitzer for investigative reporting
won by AP, it's a tribute to the efforts of so many in the last
decade in particular to instill hard-edged journalism throughout
the ranks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herschaft, 39, who joined AP in 1985, said seeing the story win
was ''an exhilarating feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Choe, 36, speaking by telephone from Korea, said it was great
news for the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank them for telling their stories to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the first AP story, a follow-up piece reported
that hundreds of other refugees were killed by U.S. forces in other
incidents in the war's first weeks, many when two bridges were
blown up as civilians streamed across.
</P>
<P>
   A later report said American jets repeatedly attacked groups of
Koreans in civilian clothes in 1950 and '51, in some cases killing
hundreds of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Korean survivors had been telling their story for years, but
their accounts were dismissed by officials in Washington and Seoul.
After the AP report was published and broadcast -- on the news
cooperative's print, television, radio and Internet services -- both
the Pentagon and South Korea opened investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors are seeking payment and an apology from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   AP Managing Editor Jonathan Wolman said the award highlights
AP's investigative reporting and its ability to disseminate stories
in many media. The award was the 46th Pulitzer Prize the AP has
won.
</P>
<P>
   ''The work came from across 10,000 miles, and it's a proud day
for all of us,'' Wolman said.
</P>
<P>
   The No Gun Ri story has won a number of other prizes: The George
Polk Award for international reporting, the SAIS-Novartis
International Journalism award, a first place National Headliner
Award for coverage of a major news event, a special award for
excellence from the Samsung Press Foundation and a journalist's
award from the Korea Journalists Association.

<HEADLINE> Details of Marine Crash Expected  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The deadly crash of a Marine Corps MV-22
Osprey aircraft in Arizona last weekend was recorded on infrared
tape by a fighter jet that was overhead at the time, Marine Corps
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That recording, combined with extensive technical details
expected to be revealed on the Osprey's flight data recorder,
should enable the Marines to determine the accident's cause fairly
quickly, Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, head of Marine Corps aviation,
told reporters Monday at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think within a week we'll have a pretty good idea'' of the
cause, McCorkle said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday afternoon, the flight data recorder had not been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The crash Saturday night was the deadliest air disaster for the
Marines since 22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
The last crash of an Osprey was in 1992, when a prototype version
crashed into the Potomac River near Quantico, Va., and killed seven
people.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's incident, the crew chief of a second Osprey,
landing at the same airfield just ahead of the crash, saw the
Osprey nose into the ground, McCorkle said. There was no distress
signal from the plane and no other sign of trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the weather did not appear a factor. Winds were
calm at the time, and visibility was 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Four Ospreys were involved in the mission, plus the F-18
circling overhead. The F-18 was equipped with a Forward Looking
Infrared system that enables the pilot to ''see'' targets through
darkness. The infrared camera system was operating as a matter of
course, McCorkle said. The film has not been examined.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Osprey's co-pilots had extensive flying experience.
Maj. John A. Brow had logged 97 hours in the Osprey, Maj. Brooks S.
Gruber 86 hours. Brow had 3,777 total flight hours in various
aircraft; Gruber had 2,117 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey is unique in its ability to take off like a
helicopter, rotate its propellers 95 degrees and fly like an
airplane. It was attempting to land at an airfield in Marana,
Ariz., about 30 miles northwest of Tucson, when it crashed, burned
and killed the four crew members and 15 others on board. They were
participating in a test of how the aircraft would perform in a
simulated ''noncombatant evacuation,'' a carefully choreographed
rescue of civilians from a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said it was unclear whether the Osprey had completed
the transition from airplane mode to helicopter mode for landing.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Dave LaPan said it was possible but
unlikely the crash could disrupt the timetable for moving the
Osprey from its final testing phase into actual deployment with
Marine squadrons. He said no firm judgment could be made until the
crash investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   The current phase of ''operational evaluation,'' in which
Marines fly four production-model Ospreys in realistic training
missions, began last October and is to be finished in June.
McCorkle stressed the purpose of this training is to evaluate, not
test, the aircraft and to adjust tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps commandant, Gen. James Jones, called a
temporary halt to flying Ospreys. ''More than anything else it's
out of respect for the families'' of the victims, rather than a
need to reinspect the remaining planes, McCorkle said. He said it
was likely that flying would resume ''in the next couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle, who has flown the Osprey and is proficient in both
helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, described the MV-22 as ''the
most stable and easiest aircraft I've flown.'' He said the plane
has been flown for 3,600 hours since testing began.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're confident in the program because of the amount of
testing we've done and the number of hours we've flown it,''
spokesman LaPan said. ''We've really put this aircraft through its
paces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey, named for a diving bird of prey, is manufactured by
Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron. A decision is due in
October on moving from ''operational evaluation,'' or field
testing, to full-scale production. The current plan is for the
Marines to buy 360 Ospreys, the Navy 48 and the Air Force 50.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines are counting on the Osprey to replace its aging
fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters for troop transport and
sea-to-shore insertion of assault troops.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian Govt Backs Off Water Hikes  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Tensions eased and thousands of
protesters headed home after the government agreed to the
withdrawal of an international water company whose demand for
higher water prices had sparked a week of violent protests.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, which have virtually shut down Cochabamba,
Bolivia's third-largest city and left six dead, prompted a security
crackdown and a ''state of siege'' decree giving police and
military extraordinary powers.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters began disbanding Monday evening after the government
agreed to reconsider an expensive water project in Cochabamba and a
broadly despised new water law. Aguas del Tunari, which won a bid
last year to administer the city's water and sewage system, said
Sunday it will pull out of Cochabamba because of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that this will end this conflict that has so divided
our people,'' Vice Minister of the Interior Jose Orias said at a
meeting with protest organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cochabamba protests were sparked by a 20 percent increase in
city water rates needed to finance the badly needed expansion of
water and sewage systems in this city at the foot of the Andes.
Demonstrations quickly spread to rural areas, with peasants also
protesting unemployment, rising fuel prices and other economic
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Information Minister Ronald MacLean accused drug
traffickers of backing the demonstrations in an attempt to stop a
government program to eradicate production of coca leaf, a raw
ingredient in the production of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ''These protests are a conspiracy financed by cocaine
trafficking looking for pretexts to carry out subversive
activities,'' MacLean said. ''It is impossible for so many peasants
to spontaneously move on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of coca leaf production has deprived thousands
of peasants of their sole means of income, particularly around
Cochabamba, a city of 500,000 located 350 miles east of the capital
of La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   Since protests began April 3, Cochabamba has been paralyzed and
isolated by road blocks, marches and violent clashes between
protesters and security forces. Clashes spread nationwide as the
government sent thousands of army soldiers into the street to try
put down the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on Saturday suspended many constitutional guarantees,
allowing police to detain protest leaders without a warrant,
restrict travel and political activity, and establish a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, protesters manned roadblocks near the Andean towns of
Achacachi and Batallas, where one army officer and two peasants
were killed and dozens injured Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Gas Tax Rollback  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate vote on whether to temporarily roll
back federal gas taxes is among many issues Republicans are raising
in this week's income tax finale on Capitol Hill to shine a
spotlight for voters on the GOP's tax cut and tax reform
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-led Congress traditionally uses the week before the
annual income tax filing deadline for tax votes, anti-tax rallies
and committee hearings on issues both substantive and symbolic.
This year's deadline is midnight April 17, because April 15 is a
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   First up was the Senate vote scheduled today on a bill sponsored
by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to roll back 4.3 cents of
the federal gas tax for the rest of the year and suspend the entire
18.4-cent tax if average prices exceed $2 a gallon. Lott needs 60
votes to end debate on the bill and move toward final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Republican backers say the measure is a modest but important
response to spiraling gas prices, but it also serves a political
purpose as a way to criticize Vice President Al Gore, the
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who cast a
tie-breaking vote in the Senate in 1993 to approve the 4.3-cent tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're a blue-collar worker, a few dollars more a week in
the price of gas does make a difference,'' Lott said Monday.
''Maybe prices will come down and maybe stay down. But I'm
concerned they could go back up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nonbinding test vote last week, 66 senators voted against
Lott's rollback, primarily out of the fear that it would take $6
billion a year out of highway, bridge and mass transit projects.
Lott insists the money would be replaced from the budget surplus,
but Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the
bill is unlikely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, Daschle said, has ''indicated that he's not really looking
for a victory. He just wanted to have a debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later today, the House was expected easily to pass bipartisan
legislation intended to improve protection of tax information
against computer hackers, give taxpayers several new rights in
dealings with the Internal Revenue Service and enact new breaks on
IRS penalties and interest.
</P>
<P>
   Other tax highlights on tap in Congress this week:
</P>
<P>
   --Votes in the Senate on legislation cutting income taxes by $248
billion over 10 years for millions of married couples, including
the 25 million who now pay more than they would if single. The bill
also would ensure that taxpayers could claim personal credits such
as the $500-a-child tax credit permanently without running up
against the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   --Symbolic House votes on a measure that would scrap the tax code
after five years and a proposed constitutional amendment requiring
a two-thirds vote of Congress to enact most tax increases. Another
planned vote would put the House on record against the package of
tax increases in President Clinton's fiscal 2001 budget, including
a 25-cent cigarette tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   --Three days of hearings at the House Ways and Means Committee on
alternatives to the income tax, including a flat tax and a national
sales tax. The panel's chairman, Texas Republican Bill Archer, has
long advocated scrapping the income tax but is retiring this year
without making the change.
</P>
<P>
   --Consideration of the Senate Commerce Committee of a bill to
extend by five years a moratorium on new Internet taxes, sponsored
by the panel's chairman, Arizona Republican John McCain. A federal
commission chaired by Gov. Jim Glimmer, R-Va., also will formally
present its majority report that recommends the extension as well
as repeal of the 3 percent telephone tax and a permanent ban on
Internet access taxes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Press Congress on Bills  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With deadlines that won't be met, President
Clinton is making an issue of what he can't get done in Congress,
seeking to stir action on measures like gun control or, lacking
that, to use complaints of Republican inaction against them in the
2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there are pressing priorities ''languishing in
Congress,'' and that delaying them is easy for the Republican
majority but hard on other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is a variation on the do-nothing Congress argument. The
Democrats are sure to be raising that one later, when an
election-year session that is probably not going to produce much
yields to the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline strategy is one Clinton has used before, most
effectively on budget issues, when they're real deadlines. He made
it part of his push for campaign finance reform in 1997, amid
disclosures of Democratic excesses in raising funds for his 1996
campaign, saying Congress should rewrite the law by the Fourth of
July.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know and I know that delay will mean the death of reform,
so let's set our own deadline,'' he said. Campaign reform hasn't
passed yet, and won't this year. Senate Republicans have blocked
it, but neither party is willing to accept terms that might work to
the advantage of the other.
</P>
<P>
   In budget struggles dating from 1995, the first year of
Republican rule in Congress, Clinton has used deadlines to effect,
as opposition presidents, Ronald Reagan and George Bush among them,
did against Democratic majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for bills to finance the government is Sept. 30
each year, and Congress rarely meets it. So interim resolutions
finance federal agencies while disputed spending measures are
settled, and that gives any president the upper, veto, hand. He can
demand that Congress tailor a budget acceptable to him, threatening
vetoes and potential government shutdowns unless he gets it close
to his way.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did that in 1995, when Republicans got the political
blame for the partial federal shutdowns that followed. The episode
was the beginning of his political revival after the Democratic
defeats of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has used the same pressure points to score budget
points the Republicans wouldn't otherwise have yielded to him.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest round, Clinton accused Congress of delays on
''the people's business,'' and urged action on gun control
legislation, a minimum wage increase, a patients' bill of rights in
managed health care and an emergency spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   He said those measures are stalled and shouldn't be, with
Congress due to take its spring recess after this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, let's get back on track,'' Clinton said. But there's more
than timing involved; there are disputes between and within the
parties on those measures. All but the spending bill have passed
both the House and the Senate, but in different versions, which are
stalled awaiting negotiations on final terms.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a patients' bill Clinton said he would sign,
but the version the Senate passed includes lawsuit limits he warned
he would veto.
</P>
<P>
   Both branches of Congress passed a $1 increase in the $5.15
hourly minimum wage, but tied it to tax cuts Clinton said would
lead him to veto the whole thing. He asked for a simple, clear
minimum wage bill, and will probably get one in the end, but the
Republicans don't want to yield their tax leverage at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The gun legislation also is snagged in differences between the
Senate bill Clinton wants and a less stringent version passed by
the House.
</P>
<P>
   House-Senate negotiators met once, last August, and have done
nothing since, a standstill the White House blames on pressure from
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most specific deadline is his call for final action on
the gun bill by April 20, the first anniversary of the Columbine
High School shootings in Littleton, Colo. ''That's the very least
we can do,'' he said, although he had earlier conceded it probably
wouldn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Monday that
''given the woeful lack of progress'' by the Republicans, there
won't be action before the recess coming up next week.
</P>
<P>
   That much was obvious. Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader,
had said that the conference committee on the gun bills may not
meet before Congress recesses. But he said they would get to that
point in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said on CBS that Republicans will insist on ''a common
sense answer,'' by which he means the less stringent Senate bill.
''And the question for the president is ... do you want to get the
thing done or do you want a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is obvious. Both.

<HEADLINE> Judge rules city, Del-Debbio must have trial on how much they payRobinson  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Almost six years ago, undercover transit Officer
Desmond Robinson was shot in the back by a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Now a judge has ruled that the police officer, along with the
city, must go to trial to determine how much they will pay
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Both officers have since left their enforcement jobs.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Kibbie Payne denied a motion by
former police Officer Peter Del-Debbio to reargue whether he is
liable for shooting Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Del-Debbio, now 40, shot Robinson four times in the back on Aug.
22, 1994, on the E and F subway platform at 53rd Street and
Lexington Avenue. At the time, Robinson had his gun drawn because
he was searching for a gunman in the Manhattan station.
</P>
<P>
   Del-Debbio was convicted in 1996 of second-degree assault and
was sentenced to time served plus five years' probation and 200
hours of community service. He was dismissed from the police
department.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, now 37, is retired on disability. He sued the city and
Del-Debbio for $50 million and asked the court to declare the city
and the former police officer liable for his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Del-Debbio asked the court to let him relitigate his defense
that Robinson's own conduct caused his injuries. Del-Debbio said
Robinson did not show a police badge or the undercover officers'
color of the day to identify himself nor did he wear a bulletproof
vest.
</P>
<P>
   The city argued that it should not be held automatically liable
because a question exists about whether Del-Debbio was acting
within the scope of his employment and doing his duty as a police
officer when he fired at Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-page decision released Monday, the judge wrote that
the question of whether Del-Debbio properly used his gun was
decided by the jury that convicted him. The jurors were told to
consider whether Del-Debbio had been justified in firing.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that the city is responsible for the
consequences of Del-Debbio's acts because he, though off duty, was
''engaged in the execution of a function specifically prescribed by
his employer, defendant city, when he shot Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Goodman, a lawyer for the city, said city officials were
studying the judge's decision and had not decided whether to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Del-Debbio's lawyer, Stephen Worth, said he had not seen the
judge's decision and could not comment.

Details of Marine Plane Crash Expected
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The deadly crash of a Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey aircraft
in Arizona last weekend was recorded on infrared tape by a fighter jet that was
overhead at the time, Marine Corps officials said. That recording, combined with
extensive technical details expected to be revealed on the Osprey's flight data
recorder, should enable the Marines to determine the accident's cause fairly
quickly, Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, head of Marine Corps aviation, told reporters
Monday at the Pentagon. The crash Saturday night was the deadliest air disaster
for the Marines since 22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.

More Vitamins Should Come From Food
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Americans should have more vitamins C and E in their
diets than currently recommended, huge doses of these vitamins and other
antioxidants have no proven benefit and may even be harmful, government
researchers said Monday. Antioxidants scavenge the body for roaming oxygen
molecules known as ''free radicals'' suspected of triggering cancer and other
disease. Many people routinely take high doses of vitamin C and other
antioxidants in the belief that they will prevent or cure illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Cycle of Famine Continues  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GODE, Ethiopia (AP) -- Sakorey Faday and Adan Mohammed are young
women from two different African countries, but they share
experiences as similar as they are tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Adan spent 10 days walking 60 miles with her three children to a
feeding center in Gode, 360 miles southeast of the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa. The trek proved too much for her 4-year-old
daughter and 1-year-old son. Both died along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Faday walked to Baidoa in neighboring Somalia in search of help
after drought ended her farm work. Faday's husband died a year ago;
the twin to the tiny, malnourished baby wrapped in her arms died at
birth. Now, she says, she has nothing.
</P>
<P>
   These women's odysseys took place in February and March, as
severe food shortages brought on by drought began to threaten
millions of lives. Similar tales have been told over and over again
in Ethiopia and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not seen rain for 18 months,'' said Adan, whose
family's herd of 200 cattle and sheep died months ago. ''I just
have to wait for something from God.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Adan, looking sad yet dignified in her dusty
traditional veils, her remaining child tucked under her arm, now
lives in a tiny hut of dried grass and bits of cloth. Faday has no
place of her own and is forced to rely on charity.
</P>
<P>
   But nature is not solely responsible for the desperate
situations of people like Adan and Faday. Politics, war and
centuries of nomadic culture all have played roles.
</P>
<P>
   The entire region has a history of conflict and perennial food
shortages. Of the countries bordering Ethiopia -- Kenya, Sudan,
Eritrea and Somalia -- only Kenya can claim any meaningful
stability.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Ethiopia has perhaps suffered the most from
drought, worsened by on-and-off warfare since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, televised images of skeletal, starving Ethiopians
pulled on the world's conscience, and as many as 1 million died.
But famine also came in 1972, 1974 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Gode, which is home to ethnic Somalis and one of
the worst-affected areas, say the drought comes in 10-year-cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 11 years after the last severe food shortage, the message
is being repeated. This time, aid groups say 7.7 million are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are really on the edge,'' said Ben Foot, country
director for the British branch of the international charity Save
the Children.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is exacerbated, local officials say, by the
nomadic lifestyle of the people who live in the region. The nomads
rely on livestock for food and income. When the rains fail, cattle,
goats, camels and sheep die -- leaving the people with nothing. They
then migrate to feeding centers, stretching local resources and
increasing the risk of disease. Some 70 percent of the 3.5 million
people in Ethiopia's Somali region, are nomads, government figures
say.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Abdi, chairman of the regional emergency task force,
said the key is to persuade nomads to settle and diversify into
farming.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is people do not adapt so quickly because
agriculture is very laborious work,'' he said. ''If they get a
harvest for two or three years, they will then go and buy cattle
and go back to where they started.''
</P>
<P>
   Teshome Emanek, head of the government's disaster preparedness
and prevention committee, said regional authorities in Ethiopia --
where regions have some autonomy -- lack the means to end the cycle
of famine.
</P>
<P>
   In Gode, the Wabe Shebelle River still flows strongly, but it
has not been used efficiently for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is being done at this time to bring them (the nomads)
off the land,'' Teshome said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates it would take at least 10 years to change local
habits.
</P>
<P>
   The Somali people on both sides of the border have been nomads
for centuries, and their allegiance is to the land and their clans,
not to any state. Most would resist changes.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say political attitudes and trade regulations need
to change throughout the region so that the nomads can take their
herds to the closest market without being blocked by national
borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the government is asking donors for more than
800,000 tons of food to keep famine at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But for Adan and Faday, the misery seems guaranteed to continue
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a beggar,'' Faday said. ''I have nothing for the
future.''

<HEADLINE> Man May Have Known Brother Had Raped  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- When Clyde and Marlo Charles left a house 19
years ago, they said they hitchhiked in different directions down a
road in the heart of south Louisiana's bayou country.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives -- like their paths -- went in opposite directions
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Charles was accused of raping a nurse whose car had broken
down a short distance away. He was convicted and spent most of the
next two decades in prison. Marlo Charles was not charged in the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Charles consistently protested his innocence and pushed
for DNA testing once the technology became available. He got help
from New York-based lawyers and PBS' ''Frontline'' investigative TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Clyde, now 47, was released from the Louisiana
State Penitentiary at Angola after DNA tests showed he could not
have committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months later, the brothers' paths have crossed
again: Authorities say the same DNA tests that Clyde Charles had
requested have now implicated Marlo.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, three days after Marlo Charles' arrest in
Virginia for the rape, the sheriff of Terrebonne Parish accused
Clyde Charles of knowing his brother committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Charles ''may be innocent of the rape, but I feel he knew
about his brother raping that woman,'' said Sheriff Jerry
Larpenter. ''This thing could have been resolved 20 years ago if he
would have stepped forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Former O.J. Simpson defense attorney Barry Scheck, whose New
York-based Innocence Project at Cardozo Law School helped free
Clyde Charles, ridiculed Larpenter's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way in the world he was covering up for his
brother,'' Scheck said in a telephone interview. ''You don't go
about saying your brother did it if you can't prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Larpenter said there is enough evidence to have Clyde Charles
booked with obstruction of justice, but added that it might not be
productive to pursue a charge on a crime carrying a six-month
maximum jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clyde has served his time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Charles was age 28 when he was sentenced to life in prison
for raping a woman near a house where the Charles brothers had been
drinking in Houma, La., about 40 miles southwest of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A flat tire had stranded the 26-year nurse nearby, and she said
a man came up behind her, punched her in the face and raped her. A
deputy who found her lying on the ground had seen Clyde Charles
about a mile away. The nurse identified him as her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you put Clyde Charles next to his brother, you couldn't
pick out either one of them,'' Larpenter said Monday. ''They look
very similar.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing wasn't available at Clyde Charles' trial and he was
convicted. He later spent nine years trying to persuade authorities
to compare his DNA with the preserved semen evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After he was released, authorities focused on Marlo Charles, 44.
The younger brother's DNA was on file in Virginia due to a 1992
felony conviction for maiming.
</P>
<P>
   Marlo Charles was arrested after a test showed the samples
matched. He was flown back to Louisiana Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck said he never brought up Marlo Charles' name to
authorities as a possible suspect in the March 21, 1981, rape, but
that it was obvious the DNA test might implicate him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told them from the beginning 'If you do the DNA testing not
only can you exonerate an innocent person, but you can use the DNA
to identify the person who did this crime.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Charles filed a federal lawsuit March 29 against
Terrebonne Parish prosecutors who blocked the DNA testing, alleging
civil rights violations and wrongful imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   He is seeking unspecified damages: ''No amount of damages could
ever repay what has been taken away from me,'' Charles said after
filing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Charles also testified at a legislative hearing in Baton
Rouge in support of a state law allowing DNA testing at the request
-- and cost -- of inmates convicted of sex crimes and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Larpenter said he has talked with the rape victim since Marlo
Charles was arrested. ''I think she's finally going to have closure
for her life. She has been fearing 'If it's not Clyde Charles, who
is it?'''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Gun Bill-Signing  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants something that
Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening has: a gun safety bill. And he
wants it before his presidency runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to express that desire today in Annapolis, where
he was participating in a signing ceremony for a bill that made
Maryland the first state in the nation to require by law built-in
locks on handguns and other stringent gun-control rules.
</P>
<P>
   The event also kicks off Clinton's outside-the-Beltway bid to
push Congress to pass his stalled gun safety proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't be the only signing ceremony going on this
year. We should have one,'' said White House legislative adviser
Joel Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is taking a similar message Wednesday to Colorado, to
help push a ballot initiative asking voters to approve a
requirement that all gun-show gun sales, including those by
unlicensed dealers, be subject to background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the White House had hoped Congress would pass gun
legislation before April 20, the one-year anniversary of the
Columbine High School massacre. Now, aides have resigned themselves
to missing that deadline and are aiming for passage before year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland bill, passed April 3, requires built-in locks on
new handguns sold as of Jan. 1, 2003, and external locks on all
handguns sold in the state as of Oct. 1 of this year. It sets a
mandatory minimum sentence of five years for illegal firearms
possession by felons convicted of a violent or drug crime, and bars
those convicted of a violent crime as a juvenile from possessing a
handgun until age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Also, police agencies would not be able to sell confiscated
guns, gun makers would have to provide a ballistic fingerprint of
shell casings of every new gun, and gun buyers would have to pass a
two-hour safety course.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to use Maryland's bill, and recent moves by a
handful of other states, to illustrate the need for national gun
safety legislation. As he has consistently, he was blaming
Congress' delay on pressure from the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had plans of its own today: a House vote on Project
Exile, a program that sends $100 million in block grants to states
that impose mandatory sentences for gun crimes. The legislation
emerged as a rallying point for critics of Clinton's gun proposals,
who say his administration should be focused more on the type of
enforcement Project Exile represents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the Clinton-Gore administration refuses to prosecute,
it's time Congress takes it upon itself to start protecting
Americans from gun violence,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has an opportunity to accomplish a rare feat, and I
hope that it's a unanimous vote for what most Americans want, and
that is tough enforcement,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ''Our
members are looking forward to a great vote in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House disputed the lax enforcement argument, calling
the Project Exile vote ''purely political'' and saying Congress has
sat on Clinton's $280 million proposal to hire 1,000 new gun
prosecutors and 500 new Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents.
</P>
<P>
   Aides did not dismiss Project Exile out of hand, saying only
that it should not be used to supplant further funding of
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's anything in there we find objectionable
or offensive. It's just too little,'' Johnson said. ''We shouldn't
be talking about how little we can get away with doing.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Water Alliance  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- With more than a billion people lacking access
to safe water, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proposed a
worldwide water alliance to curtail fighting over the use and
management of one of the planet's most precious resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''The need for greater cooperation exists in many regions,''
Albright said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''More Africans lack access to safe water now than a decade
ago,'' she said, pointing to problems in the Nile River Basin in
Africa. ''Almost half the people on the continent suffer from
water-related disease. The result is economically crippling, and
from a humanitarian standpoint, flat out unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a formal structure that would be limited only to
certain countries and governments, Albright suggested the proposed
water alliance be open to anyone who understands ''the urgency of
working together to conserve transboundary water, manage it wisely
and use it well.''
</P>
<P>
   In early Earth Day remarks at the National War College at Fort
McNair in Washington, Albright said crucial countries will be
invited to send representatives to Washington this summer to talk
about water management. The State Department plans to donate $2
million to start a new fund at the United Nations to improve
regional water management, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would benefit from an alliance through the
easing of regional tensions around the world and improvement in the
world environment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goals of our alliance must be to dramatically improve the
management of transboundary water resources, eliminate water as a
source of region instability and use cooperation on water as a
basis for bringing nations together on other issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earth Day is April 22. Albright said she gave her speech now
because she will be in central Asia during most of the Clinton
administration's Earth Day observations.

<HEADLINE> Angels 6, Blue Jays 0  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Scott Schoeneweis, making his second
major league start, pitched a three-hitter and Troy Glaus hit a
three-homer to lead the Anaheim Angels over the Toronto Blue Jays
6-0 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson hit a two-run double in the third inning and a
sacrifice fly in the seventh. Glaus' homer also came in the
seventh, against reliever Paul Quantrill.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis (2-0), who pitched six innings to beat the New York
Yankees 12-6 last Wednesday, struck out four and walked four. He
allowed Marty Cordova's leadoff single in the fifth, Homer Bush's
two-out double in the sixth and Alex Gonzalez's leadoff single in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   A rookie reliever with Anaheim last year, Schoeneweis was 1-1
with a 5.49 ERA in 31 appearances spanning 39 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carpenter (0-2) gave up two runs and three hits in six
innings, but had trouble getting the ball over the plate and walked
eight. Of his 92 pitches, 47 were balls.
</P>
<P>
   The eight walks were one shy of the club record shared by five
pitchers. Carpenter was the last Blue Jays pitcher to walk nine --
last Aug. 16 in a 7-5 loss to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn had a two-out single in the third, Tim Salmon walked
and Anderson doubled over the head of left fielder Shannon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy's one-out single began a four-run seventh. Vaughn
doubled, Salmon was intentionally walked and Anderson's sacrifice
fly chased Pedro Borbon. Glaus drove Quantrill's first pitch over
the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anaheim's Ramon Ortiz will make his first start of the
season despite having a slight tear of the labrum muscle in his
right (pitching) shoulder. Ortiz faces Toronto's Kelvim Escobar on
Tuesday night. ... The Blue Jays were 9-3 against the Angels last
season, going 6-0 at Toronto. ... Anaheim SS Gary DiSarcina, who
bruised his left thumb making a diving catch on Saturday, missed
his second straight game and is day to day.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Keyshawn May Talk to Bucs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Jets have given wide receiver
Keyshawn Johnson's agent permission to talk with the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers regarding a new contract, The Star-Ledger of Newark
reported Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Jerome Stanley and the Bucs can reach an agreement, it is
believed a trade can be worked out by this weekend's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the situation told the newspaper this is
the first time the Jets have given Stanley permission to try to
work out a deal with another team.
</P>
<P>
   No team would trade for Johnson unless first reaching a deal
with him on a contract extension. Johnson, who has two years left
on his original contract, is paid far less than the top receivers
in football. Johnson has asked the Jets to renegotiate, but thus
far, they have refused.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bucs can reach an agreement with Johnson, it is believed
they would send the 13th and 27th picks in Saturday's draft and
either wideout Bert Emanuel or Reidel Anthony to the Jets for the
Pro Bowl wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would give the Jets four first-round selections as
they currently own the 16th and 18th picks. The Jets could then
decide to keep all four or try to trade some in an attempt to move
up in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets could not be reached for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has two years remaining on a contract that will pay him
$2.2 million this season counting incentives. He isn't
participating in the team's offseason conditioning program and is
threatening to be a training camp holdout.

<HEADLINE> Swim Team Head Joins Swimsuit Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- Put Dennis Pursley in the ''against''
column when talking about the new high-tech swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Pursley, US Swimming's national team director, on Saturday
joined the condemnation of the new swimsuits, saying he was not in
favor of the suits even though the sport's world governing body
(FINA) had approved them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the technology improvements that reduce or eliminate
obstacles to performance are a good thing, but to me we have
rounded the corner and we are now looking at a suit which enhances
performance,'' Pursley told ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Under FINA rules, no swimmer is permitted to ''use or wear any
device that may aid his speed, buoyancy or endurance during a
competition''.
</P>
<P>
   ''The irony is that FINA has a rule that says that you cannot
wear any suits or equipment that is performance enhancing, the
manufacturers claim that these suits are performance enhancing, and
FINA'S approved it,'' Pursley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it looks pretty clear that either FINA approved the use
of these suits in violation of their own rules or the manufacturers
are guilty of false advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates has asked the
Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a ruling on the legality
of the suits.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has divided the Australian swimming fraternity and put
Coates at loggerheads with Australia's national head swimming coach
Don Talbot.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Rose, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, said there would
be a ''technological war'' in the sport if the suits are not
banned.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only the beginning of a technological war between all the
major swimsuit manufacturers that are going to come out with bigger
and better suits,'' Rose told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the nice things about swimming is that it's always been
a real simple sport. It doesn't involve technology in the way that
cycling or skiing or some of the other sports that are so
technologically driven.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never quite know if it's the best technology or the person
that has the greatest talent that's going to win. Whereas in
swimming, you always know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursley said he was concerned that all swimmers be given access
to the swimsuits within plenty of time to ensure they could be
properly fitted and had time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not know that all the swimmers that are Olympic hopefuls
will have those opportunities,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Yarnall Pitches Six Strong Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ed Yarnall pitched six strong innings for
the Columbus Clippers on Monday but got a no-decision at the start
of his bid to return to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall, 1-0 with a 3.71 ERA in 17 innings with the Yankees last
season, allowed two runs on three hits in the Clippers' 3-2 victory
over the Charlotte Knights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I threw more balls than strikes which is never good
for any pitcher,'' Yarnall said. ''Luckily, they didn't get the big
hit, the big inning. I was able to work my way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall was sent to Columbus, the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate,
after allowing 25 runs and 28 hits in 9 1-3 innings during four
spring training appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old left-hander thought he lost a little command on
his pitches Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mechanically I'm not very sound right now. I'm a little
erratic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall was acquired from Florida after the Marlins got him from
the New York Mets in the Mike Piazza trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big thing for me is to not let guys get on base,'' Yarnall
said. ''I'm not a guy who's going to punch out a lot of guys. I
have to work my breaking ball and spot my fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall was 13-4 with a 3.47 ERA with Columbus last season and
was named International League pitcher of the year.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 90, Jazz 86  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Greg Anthony's 3-pointer with 21.8 seconds
remaining lifted the Portland Trail Blazers to a 90-86 victory over
the Utah Jazz on Monday night in a possible Western Conference
playoff preview.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith hit another big 3-pointer for Portland, with 51.9
seconds to play, as the Blazers, who blew a 16-point lead early in
the second half, survived Utah's fourth-quarter charge.
</P>
<P>
   After Bryon Russell pulled the Jazz within 86-83 on two free
throws with 13.8 seconds on the clock, John Stockton immediately
fouled Damon Stoudamire on the ensuing inbounds play.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire hit both shots to seal the victory, giving the
Blazers three wins in the four-game season series against the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Blazers have that tiebreaker wrapped up, the Jazz
need to close Portland's four-game lead in the Western Conference
standings.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jazz hold off San Antonio for the Midwest Division title
-- Utah's lead slid to three games with the loss -- they will be the
No. 2 seed in the West. But they need to make up the margin in the
loss column to seize home-court advantage from the Blazers, should
the teams meet.
</P>
<P>
   Portland eliminated Utah 4-2 in the second round last year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Brian Grant each scored 16 points to lead Portland,
while Stoudamire had 12, Rasheed Wallace scored 11 and Arvydas
Sabonis added 10. Sabonis was activated from the injured list
Monday after sitting out with a right foot sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone led the Jazz with 29 points while Russell scored 14
of his 18 in the second half. Stockton had 18 and Howard Eisley 10
for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Portland seemed ready to roll away after opening the second half
with a 9-2 run. Scottie Pippen's three-point play just over two
minutes into the third quarter gave the Blazers a 54-38 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Utah never made a big run. Instead, the Jazz picked at the
deficit by tightening their defense -- holding the Blazers to one
field goal through the first six minutes of the fourth quarter --
and taking advantage of turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Utah went ahead 76-74 on Eisley's 19-footer with 3:25 to play.
The teams dueled from the free-throw line from there, and neither
side had the advantage until Smith's two foul shots gave the
Blazers an 80-78 lead with 1:24 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Russell couldn't match the effort, hitting one of two with 1:08
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made the Jazz pay, extending the lead to 83-79 on his
3-pointer with 51.9 seconds remaining. After Stockton added another
two foul shots, Anthony iced the victory with his shot.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Malone needs nine assists to reach 4,000 for his career. He
will be the fourth NBA player, after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt
Chamberlain and Charles Barkley, to have at least 20,000 points,
10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists. ... The Jazz, hurt by 16
turnovers, couldn't capitalize on a 38-30 rebounding advantage. ...
Portland's playoff appearance later this month will be its 18th
straight, the NBA's longest active streak and third-longest in
league history. The Jazz rank second currently with 17 straight
trips.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 106, SuperSonics 103, OT  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant scored five of his 33 points in
overtime Monday night as the Los Angeles Lakers, again playing
without Shaquille O'Neal, beat the Seattle SuperSonics 106-103.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who also had 10 rebounds and six assists, made a short
bank shot with 1:36 remaining to snap a 100-all tie and put the
Lakers ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, who had 28 points and nine rebounds, made two free
throws with 10.4 seconds left to give the Lakers a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Shammond Williams, who scored 17 of his career-high 28 points in
the fourth quarter, made a 3-point shot to draw the Sonics within
one, but A.C. Green scored on a breakaway dunk with 4.7 seconds
left to complete the scoring. Seattle's Vernon Maxwell missed a
3-pointer in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Rice forced overtime by making a 20-foot jumper from the right
baseline as time expired in the fourth quarter. Williams gave the
Sonics a 94-92 lead by making two free throws with 12.1 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer and second-leading rebounder,
sat out his second game because of a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton had 22 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists for the
Sonics, who trailed 73-60 entering the fourth quarter before
Williams led their comeback. Lazaro Borrell, another reserve,
scored all 10 of his points in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the 31st in 33 games for the Lakers, who already
secured the NBA's best record and homecourt advantage throughout
the playoffs. The Sonics, who have clinched a playoff berth, lost
for the ninth time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who made only 2-of-12 shots in the first half and scored
eight points, went 7-of-9 in the third quarter and scored 16 points
as the Lakers outscored the Sonics 34-20.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said before the game his ankle was improving, and he
hoped to play when the Lakers return to action Friday night against
Sacramento, like Seattle a possible first-round playoff opponent.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who sprained his ankle while scoring 49 points against
Golden State last Wednesday night, sat out Saturday's 98-80 loss to
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker, Seattle's second-leading scorer, drew his third foul
6{ minutes into the game and sat out the rest of the first half.
Baker had only three points and nine rebounds before fouling out
with 3:27 left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers paid tribute to Wilt Chamberlain, the
second-leading scorer in NBA history, in a brief ceremony before
the game. Chamberlain, a member of the Lakers' 1971-72 championship
team, died six months ago at age 63. ... The Sonics handed the
Lakers one of their five losses at Staples Center on Jan. 17,
winning an 82-81 decision on a 3-point shot by Payton with 16
seconds left, capping a 36-point performance. The Lakers won both
games between the teams in Seattle. ... Payton has scored 20 or
more points in 15 straight games. ... Seattle's Horace Grant
recorded the 1,000th blocked shot of his career in the fourth
quarter. ... The Lakers made 26-of-30 free throws while the Sonics
were just 16-of-28.

<HEADLINE> Indians 9, Athletics 4  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Travis Fryman had four hits and four RBIs
and Chuck Finley and three relievers combined to strike out 16
Oakland batters as the Cleveland Indians beat the Athletics 9-4
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who signed with Cleveland as a free agent after spending
the first 14 years of his big league career with Anaheim, struck
out 10 for the 28th time in his career. However, he couldn't hold a
4-2 lead in the sixth and left with his second straight
no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Cruz broke a 4-4 tie by doubling home two runs in the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kamieniecki (1-1) got the win with 1 1-3 innings of
hitless relief, Paul Shuey pitched a scoreless eighth and Steve
Karsay struck out two in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman had two-run singles in the first and ninth innings and
Manny Ramirez tripled and singled to drive in a pair of runs for
the Indians, who beat the A's for the 11th time in 13 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   After Oakland rallied to even the score, David Justice and
Fryman singled off Jeff Tam (0-1) to start the seventh. Cruz lined
a double down the left-field line to score them before he came home
on Omar Vizquel's RBI double off Mike Magnante.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Menechino singled to start the sixth but after fanning
Jason Giambi for his 10th strikeout, Finley walked John Jaha. One
out later, Ramon Hernandez hit a two-run double to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Finley issued a two-out walk to Ben Grieve before Kamieniecki
relieved and struck out Miguel Tejada to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson, who took a no-hitter into the seventh inning in
beating Detroit 3-1 last week, allowed four runs on five hits in
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was down 3-0 by the end of the first inning and struggled
with his control throughout, walking six and hitting a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez tripled home Vizquel, aboard with a double. Jim Thome
and David Justice walked ahead of Fryman's two-run single in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland closed within a run when Eric Chavez homered off Finley
after Tejada singled to lead off the third.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland scored its fourth run in the fourth when Einar Diaz
was hit by Hudson, reached third on a pair of groundouts and came
home on Ramirez's infield single.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sabres Aim for First Round Upset  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Buffalo Sabres tiptoed into the playoffs. Now they're ready
to make some noise.
</P>
<P>
   With a 1-1 tie at Washington on the season's final day, the
Sabres captured the eighth and final berth in the Eastern
Conference. Buffalo will take on the Flyers in the first round,
with Game 1 Thursday night at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres ended the season on a 7-2-1-1 run, earning 16 of 20
points to secure a playoff spot for the fourth straight year. They
are a popular pick to pull off a first-round upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you have the record we had in the last 10 games
with not being an extremely hard-working club,'' coach Lindy Ruff
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-team NHL playoffs begin Wednesday. Ottawa plays at
Toronto; the Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars open against
Edmonton; and St. Louis, winner of the Presidents' Trophy with a
league-best 114 points, entertains San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia rallied from a 15-point February deficit to finish
first in the East. Their reward -- Dominik Hasek and the Sabres, the
defending conference champs.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he's on his game, he's tough to beat,'' Ruff said of
Hasek, who has won the last three Vezina Trophies as the league's
top goalie. ''That's the X factor in the whole equation. Teams that
get that great goaltending always have a chance to go a long way in
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers went 3-1 against the Sabres, but didn't face Hasek,
who missed the first half of the season with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo has gotten production from trade deadline acquisitions
Doug Gilmour and Chris Gratton, formerly of the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's talking about Hasek,'' captain Eric Desjardins
said, ''but Gilmour and (Michael) Peca are playing good too.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Neilson, the Flyers' coach, left the team late in February
to receive treatment for cancer. The past few weeks, the Flyers
were faced with turmoil surrounding former captain Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros missed the final 14 games with a concussion, but the
Flyers went 9-4-1. Lindros questioned the Flyers' medical staff for
not correctly diagnosing his condition -- opening a rift between
management and some teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The captaincy was transferred from Lindros to Desjardins late
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The adversity that this club has faced off the ice hasn't made
a difference in the preparation and the way the guys have handled
it on the ice,'' center Keith Primeau said.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson and Lindros will miss at least the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boucher will be in goal for Philadelphia, getting the
start over veteran John Vanbiesbrouck. Boucher led the league with
a 1.91 goals-against average and became the first rookie to have an
average under 2.00 in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a different team from when we last played them,''
Boucher said. ''Hasek is very good and we're going to have our work
cut out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers will have a different goalie in the first game of the
playoffs for the fifth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday night, it's Pittsburgh at Washington, Florida at
New Jersey, Los Angeles at Detroit and Phoenix at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   A look at Wednesday's openers:
</P>
<P>
Ottawa at Toronto
</P>
<P>
   The Senators return to the playoffs for the fourth straight
year, despite being without star center Alexei Yashin, who sat out
in a season-long holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto won the Northeast Division with its first 100-point
season and tied a franchise record for most victories (45).
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa will be without fifth-leading scorer Shawn McEachern
(broken left thumb).
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Joseph had a strong season in goal for the Leafs, winning
a team-record 36 games.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton at Dallas
</P>
<P>
   The defending champions were 3-0-1 against the Oilers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas might struggle on the power play if defenseman Sergei
Zubov can't play because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars swept the Oilers en route to their first Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
San Jose at St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   Blues goalie Roman Turek has been on two straight Jennings
Trophy winners, awarded to the team that allows the fewest goals.
Turek was Ed Belfour's backup last season with Dallas, but didn't
play in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Turek, who won 42 games with a 1.94 GAA, leads the
top-seeded Blues.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was 4-0-1 against San Jose this season.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday matchups:
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh at Washington
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals had the NHL's best record since Jan. 1, but went
2-3-1 to close out the season and are seeded second in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Olaf Kolzig brought the Capitals back to the playoffs after a
one-year absence, winning 41 games.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Penguins will be keeping Jaromir Jagr on the
ice. The league's scoring champion managed 96 points, despite
missing 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps and Pens met in the postseason in 1991, '92, '94, '95
and '96. The Penguins won four of the five series, although
Washington won the opening game each time.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh won the season series 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Florida at New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   The Devils finished 9-13-2, and lost the Atlantic Division. In
turn, New Jersey got a better first-round matchup. The pressure
will be on coach Larry Robinson, who went 4-3 after replacing the
fired Robbie Ftorek.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils lost opening-round series the past two seasons,
despite having the East's best record.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Pavel Bure was the NHL's top goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils went 2-1-1 against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles at Detroit
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings, who finished second to St. Louis, are seeded
fourth despite owning the NHL's second-best record. Detroit has
lots of firepower, leading the league with 278 goals. Steve
Yzerman, Brendan Shanahan and Nicklas Lidstrom all reached the
70-point mark.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles improved 25 points from last season to reach the
postseason for the second time since 1993. Luc Robitaille led with
a team-best 36 goals and 74 points.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit won the season series 3-1-1.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix at Colorado
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg, who had 51 points despite missing the first 23
games with a separated left shoulder, is out at least this series
after separating his right shoulder last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche defenseman Ray Bourque had eight goals and seven
assists in 13 games after being acquired from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have not won a first-round series since 1987 when
the franchise was in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   The teams split four games this season.

<HEADLINE> Report Says USDA Inspection Lax  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline passengers caught sneaking fruit or
other prohibited food into the United States have little to fear
from federal authorities. Fewer than one in every 100 passengers
caught with contraband at Miami's busy airport is fined,
investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, scientists and government officials are becoming
increasingly alarmed about insects, bacteria and other agricultural
pests that are getting into the country as a result of booming
international trade and travel.
</P>
<P>
   But a report by the Agriculture Department's inspector general
is critical USDA inspectors' efforts to curb the problem in
Florida, which handles 70 percent of all perishable commodities,
fresh-cut flowers and plants that enter the country by air.
</P>
<P>
   Because violators are fined infrequently, ''there is little
deterrent to prevent individuals arriving at Florida ports from
bringing prohibited agricultural items into the country,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also said that cargo ships often were not
inspected for a full day after their arrival at Florida ports,
giving time for flies and other hitchhiking insects to leave the
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
declined comment Monday. The agency is still preparing a formal
response to the inspector general's report, which was completed
last month, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In comments that accompanied the inspector general's report,
USDA officials said they were considering a number of ways to
improve the program's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   USDA tried, but then dropped, a pilot program in Miami in which
all airline passengers caught with contraband were given a choice
of paying a fine or watching a video about the potential harm of
imported pests. The inspection service found that it took too much
staff time, said Sue McAuley, a spokeswoman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Airline arrivals represent the highest risk for pests getting
into the country, yet more than 80 percent of the passengers
estimated to be carrying prohibited food items are never caught,
according to the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say the fines are too low to be much of a
deterrent -- $50 for failing to declare an item and $100 for
subsequent offenses. Even so, inspectors are reluctant to impose
them even for passengers who won't confess to carrying contraband,
the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 budget year, an estimated 84,910 passengers
arriving in Miami were caught with prohibited food items that they
had not declared, and 672 were assessed fines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7.2 million airline passengers and 1.7 million tons of
cargo arrived in Miami from overseas during that period.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized the department from failing to assess
fines on cruise-ship passengers. The department said it didn't have
the authority to do so.

<HEADLINE> More Vitamins Should Come From Food  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many people take massive doses of antioxidant
supplements like vitamins C and E seeking to improve their health,
but government researchers say there isn't enough proof to support
using such large amounts, and that they may even be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Too few studies have tested the effects of dietary antioxidants
in people, and some of the testing that has been done has produced
unclear results, Institute of Medicine researchers said in a report
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Antioxidants are substances that cleanse the body of damaging
oxygen molecules known as ''free radicals,'' which are suspected of
triggering diseases. Many people routinely take high doses of
vitamin C and other antioxidants in the belief that they will
prevent or cure everything from the common cold to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although a large number of population studies reveal a link
between a diet rich in foods containing antioxidants, such as
fruits and vegetables, and a lower incidence of certain chronic
diseases, we cannot conclude at this time that the antioxidants are
the reason,'' said Norman I. Krinsky, chair of the institute's
antioxidant panel.
</P>
<P>
   Krinsky said other nutrients or factors could be causing the
results.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, a private, nonprofit organization that advises
the federal government, is part of the National Academy of
Sciences, which has set the nation's Recommended Dietary
Allowances, or RDAs, for nutrients since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The new report raises the RDAs for vitamins C and E, and set
upper limits for those vitamins and the nutrient selenium. The
recommendations will update other federal nutrition guidelines and
eventually may influence government food programs and the labels on
foods and supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Women should consume 75 milligrams of vitamin C each day, and
men should consume 90 milligrams, both up from 60 milligrams, the
report said. Smokers, who are more likely to suffer from damaged
cells and depleted vitamin C, need an additional 35 milligrams
daily.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said these levels can easily be met without
taking supplements, and people can get vitamin C by eating citrus
fruits, potatoes, strawberries, broccoli and leafy green
vegetables. An 8-ounce glass of orange juice provides about 100
milligrams of vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Any amount of the vitamin above the RDA is likely to be excreted
by the body unused, Krinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   For vitamin E, both women and men should consume 15 milligrams
or 22 International Units, or I.U., each day from foods such as
vegetable oil, nuts, seeds and liver. The vitamin E consumed should
be ''alpha-tocopherol,'' the only type that human blood can
maintain and transfer to cells when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Women and men should also get 55 micrograms of the nutrient
selenium each day from foods including seafood, liver, meat, and
grains, according to the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Most North America adults already get enough of these three
nutrients in their diets and those who don't can meet the new
recommendations simply by eating more fruits and vegetables,
Krinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also recommended upper limits for the nutrients:
</P>
<P>
   -- Adults should keep their daily vitamin C intake from both food
and supplements below 2,000 milligrams because anything higher may
cause diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   -- The upper level for vitamin E, based only on vitamin
supplements, is 1,000 milligrams. That's roughly equivalent to
1,500 I.U. of ''d-alpha-tocopherol,'' sometimes labeled as
''natural source'' vitamin E. People consuming more than the upper
limit face a greater risk of stroke and uncontrolled bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   --The maximum intake level for selenium from both food and
supplements is 400 micrograms daily. More than this amount could
cause selenosis, a toxic reaction marked by hair loss and brittle
nails.

<HEADLINE> Michael Ross says he accepts death sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- In an interview with The Day of New
London, serial killer Michael Ross says he accepts his latest death
sentence and will work to speed up the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 16 years,'' Ross told The Day in a telephone
interview from death row. ''You know, it's got to end. I can't let
this go another 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court jury last week recommended six death sentences
for Ross, 40, in the killing of four teen-age girls in rural
eastern Connecticut during the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was originally convicted and sentenced to death in 1987.
But in 1994, the state Supreme Court ordered a new penalty hearing,
ruling the prosecution had withheld some psychiatric evidence from
the defense.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview conducted for The Day by Martha Elliott, a
freelance writer who is working on a book about the case, Ross said
he will not allow his lawyers to file any non-mandatory appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will do everything in my power to accept this verdict of the
jury and to see that there is not a Ross Three,'' he said. ''Of
course, no one will believe that. They'll say its just manipulation
again.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ross is sentenced, there will be an automatic appeal to
the state Supreme Court. The appeal can be limited to sentence
review or can be broader and include allegations of error and
mistakes made during the death-penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he is looking for a new attorney because he does not
trust the state's public defenders to represent him at that
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll file an appeal of error over my objections,'' he said.
''I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he was disappointed in the jury's verdict, especially
after their deliberations took nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were concerned with the issues of mitigation,
but -- so I was a little surprised,'' he said. ''But when I sat down
and reflected it was like, you know, hey, I sort of respected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross also praised his lawyers, Public Defenders Karen Goodrow
and Barry Butler, for their efforts, and thanked the prosecutor,
New London State's Attorney Kevin T. Kane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he did a very good and gentlemanly job,'' Ross said.
''I appreciate the sensitivity he showed to the families by not
sensationalizing the aggravation, and I think he should be
commended for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross also told The Day that it was difficult each day of the
hearing to face the mother of one of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard, and in fact at some points during the trial I was
unable to look at her,'' he said. ''I am very ashamed of my actions
and what I did to her daughter. I just wish there was something I
could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross is due back in court Thursday, when the judge will review
several post-verdict motions and set a sentencing date.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Homers in 35th Ballpark  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Mark McGwire has a chance to set a different kind of
home-run
record this year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The single-season record holder with 70 two years ago, McGwire
is still 230 short of Hank Aaron's career record. But he can set a
record for major league ballparks homered in.
</P>
<P>
   After homering Monday night in the St. Louis Cardinals' 8-7 win
over the Houston Astros at Enron Field, McGwire had connected in 35
big league ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   That's one short of the record held by Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff,
and McGwire has visits to the two ballparks that were to open today
-- Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco and Comerica Park in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff goes to Detroit this weekend, but the Devil Rays don't
play at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't want to talk about his homer, saying ''too many
other guys on this team had great games tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Edgar Renteria and Ray Lankford hit consecutive
homers off Jose Lima (1-1), and J.D. Drew also homered. In Enron
Field's fourth game, the teams combined for eight home runs, two
more than the previous record for a major league game in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my opinion, this is a beautiful field, but it's worse than
Coors Field for pitchers,'' Lima said. ''You can see the smiles on
the hitters faces when they come up to the plate. A lot of those
home runs, in other major league stadiums would be routine fly
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games, Colorado beat Cincinnati 7-5, Milwaukee edged
Florida 4-3, Chicago defeated Atlanta 4-3, Arizona beat San Diego
8-4 and Philadelphia defeated New York 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward had his first career multihomer game for Houston,
and Craig Biggio and Richard Hidalgo also homered.
</P>
<P>
   Before 36,234, about 6,000 short of capacity, Jim Edmonds went
4-for-4 for the Cardinals, matching his career high for hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hitter's park. What can you say?'' Edmonds said. ''I
got some pitches to hit today and they fell in. This is a great
team. With this lineup, you'll see some pitches. It's a good win,
but we've got 150-something left.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen (2-0) allowed three runs and four hits in six
innings, and Dave Veres got three outs for his second save.
Rockies 7, Reds 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Coors Field, Ken Griffey Jr. became the youngest player to
hit 400 career homers. At 30 years, 141 days, Griffey beat the
previous mark, set by Foxx, who was 30 years, 248 days old.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansing and Todd Helton hit two-run homers in the home
opener for the Rockies, who have just 10 players remaining on the
roster from last year's opener. Rolando Arrojo (1-0) pitched six
innings, becoming the first Rockies starter to win this season.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (0-2) lost and Stan Belinda got the final out for
his first save.
Brewers 4, Marlins 3:
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins homered and Milwaukee's bullpen had another strong
outing in County Stadium's second final opener.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 53,509 braved game-time temperatures in the 40s and
biting winds. Miller Park, rapidly approaching completion 100 feet
behind the current field, will open in 2001, a year behind schedule
following a crane accident last July 14 that killed three iron
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Haynes (2-0) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and seven
hits in six innings, and Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his
second save. Vladimir Nunez (0-1) gave up four runs and three hits
in 4 2-3 innings.
Cubs 4, Braves 3:
</P>
<P>
   Shane Andrews hit a game-tying three-run homer off Kerry
Ligtenberg (0-1) in the ninth inning of the Wrigley Field opener
and pinch-hitter Jeff Reed singled in Damon Buford.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guthrie (1-1) got the victory in Don Baylor's debut as Cubs
manager at Wrigley. Andres Galarraga hit his fourth homer, and
Chipper Jones also connected.
Diamondbacks 8, Padres 4:
</P>
<P>
   Erubiel Durazo hit two home runs, including a three-run shot,
and Jay Bell, Steve Finley and Kelly Stinnett also connected to
match the club record of five.
</P>
<P>
   In the Padres' home opener, Todd Stottlemyre (2-0) was bruised
on the right knee by Ryan Klesko's liner in the first but stayed in
the game, holding San Diego to three runs and seven hits in six
innings. Mike Morgan finished for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Williams (1-1) allowed six runs and seven hits -- including
four homers -- in 4 1-3 innings.
Phillies 9, Mets 7:
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal broke a 7-all tie with a two-run homer off Rich
Rodriguez (0-1) in the fifth as Philadelphia overcame a 4-0 deficit
in its home opener. New York wasted a four-run lead for the second
straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Amaury Telemaco (1-0) pitched 1 2-3 hitless innings for the
victory. Kirk Bullinger also retired all five batters he faced, and
Wayne Gomes got his third save.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Youngest To Hit 400 Homers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. has a way of giving inexpensive,
but meaningful birthday presents to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago on his father's birthday, Griffey hit his first
major league home run. On Monday, he helped celebrate his father's
50th birthday with another homer, a historic 400th.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds star became the youngest player in history
to hit 400, doing it at 30 years and 141 days, beating Jimmie Foxx,
who was 30 years, 248 days old when he did it.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning at Coors Field, Griffey sent a 2-0 pitch
from Colorado's Rolando Arrojo into the left-field seats. It was
his second homer of the season and second in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   He was cheered by the Coors Field crowd as he rounded the bases,
then was high-fived by teammates and hugged by his father, Reds
coach Ken Griffey Sr., in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it marked the fourth time Griffey homered on his
father's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is fifth on the career homer list among active players,
trailing Mark McGwire (525), Barry Bonds (447), Jose Canseco (431)
and Cal Ripken Jr. (403).
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't really had a chance to think about it,'' Griffey
said of No. 400. ''The biggest thing is, I tell my dad it's a cheap
way of not buying him a gift on his birthday. So he'll get this
ball. My mom got 399, and he's got 400.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's on his birthday, so it's a special moment for both of
us, especially that I can do it in front of him. I don't think I
started smiling until I got to the dugout and looked at all the
guys sitting there waiting for me to come in. That was pretty
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked where his 400th homer puts him in baseball history,
Griffey said, ''I don't know. Over my last 12 years of playing
baseball, I think the No. 1 thing is that I played with my father.
I got to call him a teammate. He got to take me out to lunch and
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his career, Griffey said, ''I started when I was
19, which is not normal in this time and age. And I've stayed
pretty healthy and somewhat consistent over the years and that
helps. But I don't really think about the numbers. I just think
about helping the ballclub. If I hit a home run, I hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only numbers I really want to see are the ones in the win
column.''
</P>
<P>
   During lengthy postgame interviews, Griffey yelled to his son,
''Hurry up, I don't want you to be late for my birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's homer was caught by Rockies season ticket holder Jay
Wissot, who attended the game with his wife, Alyn Park, of Denver.
They requested an autographed hat, glove and warmup top, all of
which they promised to donate to charity. They also requested a
$1,000 donation in the name of Junior's mother, Alberta, to the
Conflict Center of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like the fourth glove I've lost this year,'' Griffey
said. ''I'll have to call and have a glove sent in. It was my game
glove.''

<HEADLINE> Barak To Meet Clinton in Washington  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Denounced by Yasser Arafat as an extremist,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is making a 19-hour visit here to
plan for an orderly retreat from Lebanon and to talk about more
territorial concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He also faces grim news about Syria. A Syrian response to
Clinton overtures to reopen peace talks are being dismissed by the
State Department as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was now something for the Clinton administration
to work with, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a reporter
Monday, 'there isn't so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not much give,'' she said of the Syrian position on a
land-for-peace deal with Israel. ''But I do think it's important
that they responded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said ''we
have not heard anything ... that we believe could address seriously
the remaining gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barak is saying he remains ready to make tough decisions
for peace -- a signal to the Israeli people he would surrender land
to the Arabs -- and negotiations continue here with the Palestinians
despite Arafat's assertion they were a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to pick up the pace though, and is on the record
as supporting what he calls Palestinian ''aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sour send-off, Arafat called Barak ''the leader of
extremists'' in Israel. That is the sort of rhetoric aimed at the
last prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for taking rigid stands on
Arafat's demands.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin said the talks at Bolling Air Force Base in southeast
Washington -- where midlevel negotiators for Israel and the
Palestine Authority have been meeting recently -- were not a waste
of time. He also suggested, without criticizing Arafat directly,
that a lid be placed on name-calling on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   With mid-September as a deadline, the Palestinians want
virtually all of the West Bank for a state, and they want part of
Jerusalem for a capital. They already control 40 percent of the
land held by Jordan from 1948 to 1967 and most of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is due to surrender another chunk of the West Bank in
June. The details are among the topics under discussion in the
current round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked here by Clinton, Barak had talks scheduled in succession
at Blair House with senior U.S. negotiator Dennis Ross, Albright
and national security adviser Sandy Berger. He then crosses
Pennsylvania Avenue for an hour with Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy shift based on circumstances, the administration is
beginning to help Israel arrange withdrawal of its troops from
southern Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by a friendly Lebanese militia, the troops have
shielded villages in northern Israel from rocket attack by
Hezbollah guerrillas backed by Iran and Syria. The United States
was unable to negotiate an agreement to curb increasingly deadly
guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers, however, and Barak, mindful
of the toll's impact on the Israeli public, has decided to abandon
the strip.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel had hoped the retreat could be part
of an overall agreement with Syria and Lebanon, one that presumably
would have guaranteed the border's safety.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S.-hosted talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va., broke down in
mid-January, and the Clinton administration decided only recently
to go along with and to facilitate a unilateral Israeli retreat.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Critics Launch Boycott  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates of human rights in Myanmar, peace in
Colombia and economic justice here in the nation's capital are
pressing their concerns, taking advantage of daily protests against
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is awash in demonstrations, teach-ins, concerts and
news conferences, including a planned religious procession today
that was to end at World Bank headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The economic ''Stations of the Cross'' protest is sponsored by
The Religious Working Group on the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. The coalition of about 40 church-affiliated groups
normally conducts its procession on Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ''we're taking advantage'' of the weeklong protests
against the two institutions that lend money to poor nations, said
the coalition's Judy Coode. But with an office in Washington and a
regular dialogue with economic policy-makers, ''we're always
here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters believe that the bank and IMF, which lend money to
poor countries, impose crushing austerity and debt repayment
conditions that make it impossible for those nations to spend money
on social programs.
</P>
<P>
   The religious protesters are not alone in taking advantage of a
week when demonstrators are pouring into Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dinner to promote democracy in Myanmar, also known as
Burma. A rally will oppose military aid to help Colombia fight drug
lords, a protest coinciding with the U.S. visit of Colombian
President Andres Pastrana. And a forum in a poor section of
Washington will explore poverty, health care, racism and employment
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, World Bank critics launched a global campaign to boycott
the institution's bonds. Boycott organizers announced their plans
just as environmental demonstrators blocked a street and triggered
a confrontation with police. Seven were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators against policies of the bank and the IMF are
building toward a large rally Sunday, when world finance ministers
are scheduled to meet in downtown Washington. Protesters said they
would try to stop the ministers from entering the bank's
headquarters only a few blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-bank groups want to persuade labor unions, churches,
brokerage houses, commercial banks, universities, municipalities
and average investors not to buy the bank's bonds, which now enjoy
the highest rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to chip away at their AAA rating,'' said Dr. Kevin
Danaher, director of public education for Global Exchange, a San
Francisco human rights group. He said that while some boycott
organizers want to reform the bank, others want it abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Added Pratap Chatterjee, an environmental commissioner of
Berkeley, Calif: ''We want to break the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   World Bank President James Wolfensohn called the bond boycott
''a misguided effort aimed at the wrong target.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors ... are unlikely to be swayed by this campaign,''
Wolfensohn said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to the World Bank staff, he said they should be
proud of the work they do. ''We are leading in many of the areas
people are complaining about, such as the fight against poverty,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hoping to counter criticism of its operations, the
International Monetary Fund decided Monday to establish an
independent watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers welcomed the IMF's action,
saying it ''demonstrates important progress in making the IMF a
more accountable and transparent institution...''
</P>
<P>
   In the past the IMF has relied on self evaluation by its own
departments supplemented by reports commissioned from outside
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank supplies loans to fund development projects in
poor countries, and the IMF, its sister institution, responds to
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Margulies Wins Drama Pulitzer  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Academy Award winners know weeks ahead of time
that they might get the big prize. When this year's Pulitzer Prizes
were announced, some winners didn't even realize they were in
serious contention for an award.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea,'' said author Jhumpa Lahiri, who received the
fiction prize Monday for her story collection ''Interpreter of
Maladies.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few unexpecting -- and unexpected -- winners this
year as voters went mostly for lesser-known artists, including
playwright Donald Margulies. He received the drama prize for his
off-Broadway play ''Dinner With Friends,'' the story of two married
couples and what happens when one decides to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old Margulies, in Seattle for rehearsals of a new
play, called the drama prize ''a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The play emerged out of a particular time in my life, a
mid-life reflection on the pains of fidelity, friendship and sexual
passion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His competition included past Pulitzer winner August Wilson's
''King Hedley II'' and Suzan-Lori Parks' ''In the Blood.''
</P>
<P>
   With the fiction Pulitzers usually given to veteran novelists,
Lahiri had three good reasons not to expect the prize: She's young
(age 32), a short story writer and ''Interpreter of Maladies'' is
her first book.
</P>
<P>
   A New York resident, Lahiri had spent the weekend in Boston,
where she received the PEN/Hemingway prize for best first fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were actually joking about the Pulitzer Prize yesterday,''
she said, referring to the awards dinner for the PEN/Hemingway. ''A
friend of the family said, 'The Nobel is next.' Ha, ha. And
somebody else said, 'No, no, the Pulitzers come before that.' We
were just laughing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorite for fiction was Ha Jin, who had already gotten the
National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner prize for his novel
''Waiting.'' Jin and Annie Proulx, winner of the fiction Pulitzer
in 1994, were finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The biography winner, Stacy Schiff, had been thinking more about
the Oscars lately than the Pulitzers. Schiff, cited for ''Vera
(Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov),'' is nine months pregnant and had rooted
for the equally expectant Annette Bening to win for best actress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to see what her dress looked like, if it looked any
better than what I've been wearing lately,'' said Schiff, whose
book depicts the rare happy literary marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Historian David M. Kennedy and poet C.K. Williams were among the
other winners in arts categories. The Pulitzer for general
nonfiction was awarded to John W. Dower for ''Embracing Defeat:
Japan in the Wake of World War II.'' He earlier won the National
Book Award for the same work and also won the Bancroft prize, an
award for historians.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is astonishing,'' said Dower, 65, a professor of history
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''I'm going to dance
around with my wife for a few moments.''
</P>
<P>
   The music award went to Lewis Spratlan for his composition,
''Life Is a Dream, Opera in Three Acts: Act II, Concert Version.''
Spratlan composed the opera on a commission from the New Haven
Opera Theater in the 1970s, but the company went out of business
and the opera has never been performed.
</P>
<P>
   He received a commission for a chamber piece for a music group
in Boston, Dinosaur Annex Music Ensemble, and wrote ''Life Is a
Dream'' for a concert version.
</P>
<P>
   ''If, on the strength of the Pulitzer, I'm able to have a
successful production of 'Life Is a Dream,' I would love to write
another opera,'' he said. ''I wouldn't do it on speculation. That's
too much of a heartbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy won the history award for ''Freedom From Fear: The
American People in Depression and War, 1929-45.'' The history
teacher also has written books on the life of Planned Parenthood
founder Margaret Sanger and World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave up wine for Lent, but I think I'm going to give myself
a dispensation,'' said the 58-year-old Kennedy after receiving word
of his win.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry winner Williams, 63, was teaching a class at Princeton
when he received word of his Pulitzer. The students applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very happy,'' Williams said. ''I'm a little
speechless. It feels nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented May 22.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Leader: Summit a Big Step  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's president said today
that a summit with North Korea represents a ''big step forward'' in
peace efforts, although he warned his people not to expect too much
from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung said South Korea would broach substantive issues at
the leaders summit in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang on June
12-14. But he said the meeting would be unlikely to resolve any of
the major issues dividing the sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national issues, which have been divisive for a half
century, cannot be resolved overnight,'' Kim told a Cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The June summit, announced jointly Monday by the two sides,
would be the first between the two Koreas since the division of
their peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South
in 1945. They share the world's most heavily armed border.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, Kim said, is ''one big step forward in our national
history and in the move toward peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim said economic assistance and cooperation, reunions of
millions of separated family members and tension-easing measures
will top the agenda in his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il.
</P>
<P>
   The North's agreement on the summit is the most important
evidence yet that the reclusive country may be shifting its
long-standing policy of shunning dialogue with the Seoul
government, which it officially regards as a U.S. ''puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic benefits are the lure. With its economy in tatters,
North Korea has relied on outside aid since 1995 to feed its 22
million people. By the North's own admission, 220,000 people have
died of hunger-related diseases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials have already indicated the summit could
spur their country to invest billion of dollars in building roads,
ports, railroads, power plants and other infrastructure in North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible South Korean assistance includes shipments of
fuel coal and fertilizer, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Seoul officials worry the summit could be scrapped if North
Korea persists in its long-running demand for the withdrawal of the
37,000 U.S. troops from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Another contentious issue is North Korea's insistence that the
armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War be replaced by a peace
treaty to be signed between it and the United States, without the
participation of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are something we cannot accept,'' national security
adviser Hwang Won-tak said of those possible demands.
</P>
<P>
   Culture and Tourism Minister Park Jie-won, who acted as South
Korean emissary in secret talks with North Korea, said that those
issues were not discussed in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were more interested in economic aid and assistance,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Committee Probes Funeral Industry  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burgeoning funeral industry has increased
competition and provoked aggressive sales practices that could be
cheating grieving survivors, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Special Committee on Aging, after receiving
complaints about unscrupulous practices, opened hearings Monday on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers should not fear being defrauded by a dishonest
funeral provider who sells them more than they need, or who does
not provide itemized prices to comparison shop,'' said Sen. John
Breaux of Louisiana, the ranking Democrat on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups pointed to last year's annual industry survey
which said 80 percent of consumers were satisfied with their
funeral services experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumer problems are low in volume and are efficiently
resolved,'' Paul Elvig of the International Cemetery and Funeral
Association said in testimony prepared today, the second round of
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the funeral industry has evolved into a
multibillion dollar industry with about 22,152 funeral homes
nationwide. The industry has expanded to allow consumers to buy
caskets and other items online, at coffin retailers or directly
from cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, funeral and burial expenses have risen faster
than inflation since 1990, Grassley noted.
</P>
<P>
   An average funeral cost $5,020 in 1998, up 5 percent from the
previous year. Burial costs can drive the price as high as $7,520.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups have expressed concern that in the midst of an
increasingly competitive industry, companies are targeting
consumers for huge sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern are what are known as ''pre-need
services,'' advance funeral and burial arrangements purchased by a
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Many witnesses testified about aggressive sales tactics that
lure elderly consumers into buying unnecessary items. They also
complained about inadequate contracts that don't cover a variety of
expenses, such as embalming after autopsies or tissue donation,
unexpected refrigeration costs or cemetery charges for setup of
chairs and awning.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all these and more extra charges, there is little 'peace
of mind' for survivors,'' said Lamar Hankins, president of
FAMSA-Funeral Consumers Alliance, a group which monitors the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hankins told the committee of an 80-year-old Florida widow who
was persuaded just months after the death of her husband to
purchase more than $125,000 in unneeded funeral goods and services,
including a $40,000 casket and a family mausoleum even though she
had no family left.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of people age 50 and older reported being
solicited about purchasing pre-need funeral arrangements, according
to a recent AARP study. About 36 percent paid in advance for either
funeral or burial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has been considering whether to
expand the 15-year-old rule that requires funeral homes to disclose
prices for goods and services and prohibits them from forcing
consumers to buy bundles of services. Funeral directors also cannot
misrepresent local cemetery requirements, such as telling people
they must have a body embalmed.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates as well as the funeral home industry have
urged expanding the FTC regulations to cover cemeteries, casket
stores and other providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Jacobson of the National Funeral Directors Association said
because the federal rule covers sellers of funeral goods and
services, it has created a loophole for cemeteries and others who
can escape coverage by selling either funeral goods or funeral
services, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loophole ... has become immense and left tens of thousands
of funeral consumers without safeguards and protection,'' Jacobson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP has pushed for minimum standards for pre-need contracts
to help deal with a patchwork of state regulatory laws. And
Grassley has indicated he will look into what can be done
legislatively.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed moderately lower Tuesday, with
high-technology issues pulling down the market. The U.S. dollar was
higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 96.54 points,
or 0.47 percent, to close at 20,522.52 points on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. On Monday, the average closed up 366.25 points, or 1.81
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 106.70 yen on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) Tuesday, up 0.64 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 106.47 yen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, technology stocks pulled the market down
after sharp losses on the U.S. Nasdaq market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Nasdaq composite index fell 258.25 to 4,188.20,
its second largest point drop. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 75.08 to 11,186.56 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 15.65 points, or 0.92 percent, to close at
1,701.09. The TOPIX closed up 39.12 points, or 2.33 percent, on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved slightly higher in light
trading as investors grew cautious ahead of a weekend meeting of
Group of Seven finance officials.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday he will tell G-7
counterparts that Japan's stance on foreign exchange is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have seen for yourselves what we do when we feel that a
rapid strengthening of the yen is problematic,'' Miyazawa said at a
regular news conference, referring to dollar-buying intervention in
currency markets by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said the yen's rapid rise against the
greenback could hurt Japan's unstable economic recovery by making
exports more expensive abroad, and cutting into the earnings of
export-led companies.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 -- the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Germany -- will
gather in Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.76 yen, up from
101.50 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7400 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its price
fell 0.04 point to 101.38.

<HEADLINE> Psychiatrists Meet With Elian Family  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN FARRINGTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Nearly five months after Elian Gonzalez was rescued
at sea, his Miami relatives are finally taking tentative, reluctant
steps toward returning the 6-year-old boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez met for an hour Monday with
two psychiatrists and a psychologist sent by the government to
arrange Elian's smooth transfer to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, who met with Elian's father in Washington, D.C., on
Sunday, were expected to discuss the situation again today with
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although the family still hopes for a reprieve from a federal
appeals court, many in Miami's Cuban exile community acknowledge
that the chances are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Ninoska Perez, a spokeswoman for the Cuban American National
Foundation, said of Elian: ''People feel that his time is probably
running out, and a lot of people are desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people in Little Havana wistfully marched to Lazaro
Gonzalez's house Monday night, carrying Cuban flags, singing the
Cuban national anthem and praying for Elian. At its peak, police
estimated, the crowd reached 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed about 30 city blocks and reported no problems. The
atmosphere at times resembled a street fair: Many people brought
children in strollers; some ate food bought from vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all we have left, is to do these peaceful
demonstrations,'' said Carlos Rodriguez, 36. ''We're not the
aggressive Mafia that they're portraying us as.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, demonstrators still promise to form a human chain
around the house if necessary to prevent immigration agents from
removing the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they take him, Miami is going to be hot,'' said Mary
Riverson, 38. ''Everybody will be on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno had described Monday's meeting as an
important step toward reuniting Elian and his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez. The elder Gonzalez remained in Bethesda, Md., where he
has been staying with Cuban diplomats since coming to America on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the family nor the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which was represented at the talks, would comment on what
happened during the meeting. Ed Rosasco, president of Mercy
Hospital, where the meeting took place, said it was cordial.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives had made it clear they were unhappy that the
psychiatrists would not evaluate Elian. The relatives said such an
examination would conclude he should not be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The government did make one accommodation to the Miami family,
moving the meeting to the hospital after Lazaro Gonzalez said he
could not leave his 21-year-old daughter, Marisleysis. She is
admitted there.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another instance of the government bending over
backwards ... for Elian's well-being,'' INS spokeswoman Maria
Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis, who has been hospitalized several times for stress
and exhaustion, has styled herself as a mother figure to Elian. She
did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said they would settle on a
transfer plan for when and how the Miami relatives would relinquish
custody after their meeting today with the psychiatrists and
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options under consideration, according to a Justice
Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity: bringing
Elian to a neutral site in Florida to be turned over to Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, if he will go there, or to a third party who would bring
the boy to his father in Maryland. The Miami relatives could also
bring Elian to Maryland, a more remote possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also planned to meet today with Miami-Dade Mayor Alex
Penelas, Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and possibly Lazaro or Delfin
Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles, the Justice official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the family filed a brief in their appeal of a
federal judge's ruling that the INS acted properly in ordering
Elian returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The family argued that since children Elian's age are allowed to
testify in criminal trials, the INS should take his desires into
account in an asylum hearing rather than assert, as it has, that
only his father can speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Monday evening, Lazaro Gonzalez walked Elian around
so he could be seen by the crowd. Carrying two balloons, he ran
into the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian, my friend, the people are with you,'' the crowd
chanted.

<HEADLINE> Republicans To Honor House Chaplain  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The national Republican Party's events today
honoring the House's first Catholic chaplain are raising some
eyebrows on Capitol Hill, particularly among Democrats who say the
party appears to be seeking to score points with an influential,
but bruised block of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel P. Coughlin's appointment as chaplain last month
came after a protracted battle during which some Democrats accused
GOP leaders of being anti-Catholic because they first chose a
Presbyterian minister for the post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're glad that Republican leaders finally welcomed a Catholic
chaplain into the United States Congress,'' Jenny Backus,
spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said Monday.
''However, the best way for Republicans to try and woo the Catholic
vote is to abandon what appears to be a patently obvious political
ploy and start passing programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee invited members of Congress
and the media to a late afternoon Mass at a church near the Capitol
at which the Chicago priest will be one of the celebrants and will
deliver the homily. The RNC also is hosting a reception afterward,
and is billing the appearances as Coughlin's first since taking the
job.
</P>
<P>
   RNC spokesman Chris Paulitz insisted the event was only intended
to introduce Coughlin to those he will be counseling, with all
House members -- both Democratic and Republican -- invited.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a completely apolitical event. ... There is not going
to be any effort to score political points with anyone,'' Paulitz
said. ''If some people want to play games with this, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the Illinois
Republican is planning his own reception for Coughlin to meet
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Father Coughlin is someone who is going to serve the House in
a non-partisan way,'' John Feehery said. ''Partisan politics should
be taken out of this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other Republican leaders came under fire late last
year when they announced the selection of the Rev. Charles Wright
for the chaplain job. Democrats insisted that a Catholic priest,
the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, was the top choice of a bipartisan
selection committee and accused the GOP leadership of anti-Catholic
bias.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker vehemently denied the characterization.
</P>
<P>
   But as the controversy lingered through the winter, Republicans
worried they were losing ground with Catholic voters, who account
for 25 percent or more of the turnout in national elections and a
higher percentage in some key states.
</P>
<P>
   Wright eventually withdrew and Hastert unexpectedly appointed
Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually pointed speech at the time, Hastert blamed
Democrats for ''maliciously seeking political advantage by making
these accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the RNC has issued a steady stream of statements
suggesting Democrats favor revoking the Vatican's permanent
observer status at the United Nations. RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson
and former Vatican Ambassador Thomas P. Melady, both Catholic
Republicans involved in that effort, are listed as hosts for the
Coughlin event.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin, a 40-year veteran of the Chicago Archdiocese, was most
recently a vicar to its parish priests. His duties in the
$138,000-a-year chaplain job include opening each day's House
session with prayer and ministering to House members and their
families.

<HEADLINE> Law Clearly on Elian's Dad Side  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The four-month dispute over Elian Gonzalez is
should be considered a ''no-brainer'' under U.S. laws, legal and
immigration experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way under our legal tradition the father should be deprived
of his ability to care for his son,'' says Bernard Perlmutter,
director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth Law
Clinic. A decision in favor of the boy's Miami relatives would
''wreak havoc with the whole concept of the parent-child
relationship as a sacred one,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter and other legal observers say it's clear that federal
courts -- and not state courts -- have the authority to decide the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very straightforward, simple immigration law matter,''
George Washington University law professor Alberto Benitez said
Monday. ''If Elian were Mexican or Haitian he probably would be
back in Mexico or Haiti already. He's Cuban and that makes all the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Politics appears to be the only explanation why this wasn't
settled a while ago,'' added Columbia University law professor
Gerald Neuman.
</P>
<P>
   Miami relatives of the 6-year-old boy are waging their battle to
keep him in the United States on two fronts: a federal court appeal
arguing that he should be allowed to seek asylum against his
father's wishes, and a custody bid in state court.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge last month upheld Attorney General Janet Reno's
decision to return Elian to Cuba to live with his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who came to the United States last week and said
he wants to take his son home.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore said a provision of federal
law allowing ''any alien'' to seek asylum was ambiguous and did not
necessarily allow applications by children over parental
objections.
</P>
<P>
   And Florida Circuit Judge Jennifer D. Bailey asked the Miami
family to explain why she should hear the state case, noting that
state courts cannot interfere with federal matters such as
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's fate has been debated since he was found clinging to an
inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10
other Cubans drowned when their boat capsized during an attempt to
reach the United States. Since then Elian has lived with his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   If the boy ultimately is returned to Cuba, ''We're not returning
Elian to Juan Miguel, we're returning him to Fidel Castro,''
attorney Linda Osberg-Braun, representing the Miami relatives, said
in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives told a federal appeals court that since children
as young as Elian are allowed to testify in serious criminal
trials, the INS should take his desires into account in an asylum
hearing instead of asserting that only his father can speak for
him.
</P>
<P>
   In state court, Osberg-Braun said, the family seeks a hearing on
whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez is a fit parent, and whether
''returning a global symbol to Cuba is abusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the boy is an alien, Perlmutter said, the case is a
federal court matter under immigration law, not an issue for state
family court. The Constitution invalidates state laws that conflict
with federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a no-brainer by all accounts,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles B. Keely, a Georgetown University professor of
international migration, predicted courts would not buy the
argument that living in communist Cuba is persecution enough to
warrant keeping the boy here.
</P>
<P>
   If an American child were in another country where officials
said, '''Nobody should be sent to the U.S., it's a horrible place,'
we'd say 'twaddle,''' Keely said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said last week a failure
to return Elian to Cuba would complicate U.S. efforts to have about
1,100 American children in other countries brought home.
</P>
<P>
   Keely and Perlmutter said it might be a different matter if a
child feared specific persecution in another country, such as
female genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter contended that even if the case were decided in
family court, the result likely would be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, custody can be taken away from a child's sole
surviving parent only if the parent were proven unfit by ''clear
and convincing evidence.'' The child's best interests are
considered when the dispute is between two parents -- not between a
parent and a non-parent, Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents' rights ''are so far superior, so paramount to other
relatives,'' Perlmutter said. ''That is the heart of our family
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Keely said that if the Miami relatives won custody of Elian,
''it would open up enormous problems in this country for family
law. You'd start expanding the basis for taking custody away from
parents.''

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Nears Victory  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Fraud was on the lips of Peruvians in the
capital streets after election officials said President Alberto
Fujimori was just shy of the majority of votes needed to win an
unprecedented third term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government was manipulating it all from the start, sending
us out to vote as if we were marionettes when they had it all
planned, a giant fraud,'' said Carolina Herrera, a special
education teacher in a poor Lima neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said after counting more than half the ballots that
Fujimori had 49.6 percent, compared to Alejandro Toledo's 40.6.
That defied exit polls and unofficial vote tallies by independent
monitors that indicated he would not reach the 50 percent plus one
vote needed to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The first results were made public at midday, more than 12 hours
later than election officials had promised, prompting suspicion of
dirty play.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took too long to count the ballots,'' said Renzo Lopez, a
28-year-old manager of a food wholesale company. ''That delay gave
them the time to manipulate the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those suspicions exploded in a violent protest by some 4,000
people outside the presidential palace early Monday. Later in the
day, Peruvians huddled in large groups in the main plaza across
from the palace debating whether the fix was already in.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori rejected the findings of the exit polls and election
monitors, but Toledo said that the electoral process had lost all
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said his political group would refuse to recognize the
election board's final count ''no matter what the outcome.'' The
vote was expected to continue filtering in during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls had showed a majority of Peruvians believed fraud
would play a part in the election going into Sunday's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that Peruvian election authorities helped oversee
the forgery of more than 1 million signatures to register his
candidacy have already drawn calls from the U.S. State Department
for an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For months, opposition candidates accused Fujimori and his
military intelligence service of disrupting rallies with
rock-throwing thugs, sponsoring lurid tabloid newspaper attacks and
blocking access to television and radio. International monitors
also said Fujimori used government funds and food aid programs to
rally support -- charges he denied.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial vote counts Sunday night by Transparencia, an
independent citizens group, and by three private polling firms had
given Fujimori at the most 48.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a second round is ruled out, we have every right to believe
that there was a well-thought-out fraud,'' Transparencia director
Rafael Roncagliolo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Roncagliolo said monitors had discovered pre-filled ballots
favoring Fujimori during Sunday's vote and that Transparencia's
electricity and phone lines were cut and that its computer system
was attacked by a mysterious virus.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador John Hamilton said he has ''a great deal of
trust'' in Transparencia's count and expects a second round.
Eduardo Stein, head of an Organization of American States
monitoring mission, also said a second round should take place
according to its own independent figures.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Giovanna Penaflor cautioned that early returns were
most likely from Lima, Fujimori's stronghold, and that later
returns from other cities could show a decline in the president's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the early results did not include isolated rural areas, also
considered pro-Fujimori because of his government's heavy
investment in schools, health clinics and market roads.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in power, the 61-year-old leader still has
support from a wide segment of Peruvians grateful to him for
defeating the Maoist Shining Path insurgency and halting
hyperinflation and the economic chaos of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't think that Colombia wouldn't love to have a Fujimori
to take care of its guerrilla problem?'' said Juan Carlos Cardenas,
a 49-year-old fish vendor who rejected the fraud allegations. ''He
made Peru livable again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo, who battled his way out of poverty in an Andean
village to become an international economist, has cut into
Fujimori's bedrock support among the poor, capitalizing on a deep
two-year recession. The 54-year-old former World Bank official has
promised to create at least 400,000 jobs by lowering taxes to spur
business investment.

<HEADLINE> 'Satanic' T-Shirt Case Continues  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) -- A so-called satanic T-shirt has caused a
devil of a time in this seaside town.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over a high school student's right to wear his $5
''White Zombie'' T-shirt to school has dragged on for two years and
has created $60,000 in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parker was a sophomore when Westerly High School
officials said his rock band T-shirt with the number 666 on the
back was disruptive and violated the dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Parker is now 18 and weeks away from graduating.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has gotten way out of hand,'' said Parker's mother,
Marianne Almeida. ''It's just a $5 T-shirt. They've spent thousands
of dollars fighting it.''
</P>
<P>
   A state hearing, pitting the School Committee against the
American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, has taken some odd
twists.
</P>
<P>
   The town asked a Roman Catholic priest to testify why the shirt
could be viewed as satanic, while the ACLU asked a local radio
personality, Rudy Cheeks, to say that there was nothing to fear
from heavy metal music.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're concerned about people rioting in the streets, that
didn't start with rock 'n roll,'' Cheeks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Grady, the town's lawyer, refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was sent home in 1998 for wearing the black shirt for the
now-defunct band and was ordered not to wear it again.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the ACLU filed a challenge with the state Education
Department, claiming the school's dress code was vague and violated
free speech rights. The ACLU is not charging Parker's family; but
the town has run up at least $60,000 in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't done anything really wrong,'' Parker said. ''It's
all I can think about. It's always on my mind. I can't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU pointed to a workshop the school held months before the
T-shirt incident, led by the Rev. Paul DesMarais, the same priest
who testified at Parker's hearing, on recognizing signs of gang or
cult activity among students.
</P>
<P>
   ''The workshop may have encouraged teachers to be on the lookout
for nonexistent signs of Satanism,'' said Steven Brown, executive
director of the state ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   DesMarais testified the T-shirt appeared ''demonic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''On the back, 666, has a long reference to the anti-Christ as
being so evil,'' he said. ''It's been clearly referenced as
something that pertains to evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing has dragged on partly because Grady and the ACLU
have been haggling over what testimony -- on issues ranging from the
occult to rock music -- is relevant to the case.
</P>
<P>
   School Committee member Joseph Terranova, elected several months
after Parker's T-shirt run-in, acknowledged the legal fees are
high.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is kind of sad we've had to spend this kind of money, which
could have been used for books and computers,'' Terranova said.

town.

<HEADLINE> Group Seeks Inquiry of First Lady  </HEADLINE>
By PEGGY HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's
actions in the Whitewater venture have now come under scrutiny of
the Arkansas Supreme Court's disciplinary arm, which is already
considering a complaint seeking to disbar President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a conservative group last week, the executive
director of the court's committee on professional conduct said the
panel is reviewing the group's allegation that Mrs. Clinton may
have violated the Arkansas code of conduct requiring lawyers to act
with honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Executive director James Neal said he would evaluate information
from federal regulators that Mrs. Clinton, as a lawyer in Little
Rock, created a real estate document later used by her Whitewater
partners' savings and loan to deceive federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The document helped enable the payment of $300,000 in real
estate commissions to the father-in-law of Mrs. Clinton's former
law partner, Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton says she recalls nothing about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, her lawyer, David Kendall, called the Landmark Legal
Foundation's complaint ridiculous and ''partisan nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone with a 33-cent stamp can file a complaint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group filed the complaint against Mrs. Clinton in 1996, but
said it never got a response.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Neal said he thought he had reviewed the matter
earlier but he was unable to find a copy of his response.
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore, this office will again review and evaluate the
information provided in your earlier correspondence,'' Neal wrote.
</P>
<P>
   All complaints to Neal's office are handled with an initial
review by the executive director, who has the authority to reject
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Landmark Legal Foundation's complaint was based on a report
by the inspector general of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
focusing on the actions of Mrs. Clinton for the S&AMP;L owned by her
Whitewater partners, Jim and Susan McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the committee is giving the president until April 21
to respond to a request that he be disbarred for allegedly lying in
the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court in January ordered the committee to
take up long-standing complaints against the president, including
one arising from a federal judge holding Clinton in civil contempt
of court for giving misleading testimony regarding Lewinsky in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Marines To Be Removed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARANA, Ariz. (AP) -- Military investigators prepared for the
painstaking process of removing the remains of 19 Marines who died
in a fiery crash of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Officials spent Monday taking measurements, examining pieces of
the charred wreck and trying to ensure that investigators could
remove the remains safely, said Lt. Mark Carter, a spokesman for
the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, where the flight originated.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery of the remains was expected to begin today.
Investigators said identification will likely take several days and
involve DNA, fingerprints and other records.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process is a slow process because it's a detailed
operation,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey crashed Saturday during an evacuation training
exercise at Marana Northwest Regional Airport, about 30 miles
northwest of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included four crew members from Quantico, Va., 14
Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and one from Marine Corps Air
Station-Miramar in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Aisha Bakkar-Poe, a spokeswoman at the Pentagon Marine
Corps headquarters, said Monday a preliminary cause for the crash
could be released in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   She said the corps remains confident the innovative Osprey,
which Marines are evaluating under war-type conditions, is safe. It
is expected to replace an aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Ospreys, designed for cargo and personnel transport, take off
and land like helicopters and fly like planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines are not flying their other four MV-22 Ospreys, but
Bakkar-Poe said that mostly was out of respect for the victims'
families and the other Osprey crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't feel there's a design flaw,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Osprey that crashed had flown more than 135 hours
since it was delivered to the corps on Jan. 17. The aircraft had
been averaging 40 hours a month in the air -- about twice as much as
most Marine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The extra flight time should not have been a factor in the
crash, however, Bakkar-Poe said.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey was introduced in September. The Marines have ordered
360 of them to be delivered by 2014 at a cost of $44 million each,
said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Rob Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of the victims, Keoki Santos, 24, of Grand
Ronde, Ore., said her son had concerns about riding in the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really, really nervous about the whole thing,''
Christina Mercier said. ''He was a beautiful, high-spirited, true
Marine. He didn't want to just go into the service for four years.
He enlisted to be a career man. And they killed him. They wanted
him to be a guinea pig for these new airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps lists two other crashes during the Osprey's
development: A 1991 Delaware accident blamed on gyro wiring
problems, and a 1992 Virginia crash that killed all seven people on
board after an engine caught fire.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian General Denies Charges  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARTINKUS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The general who led the withdrawal of
Indonesian forces from East Timor denied today that his troops were
training militiamen to return to the former Indonesian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to say categorically that the training of
(militiamen) does not exist,'' Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian troops and their militia auxiliaries in East Timor
went on a bloody rampage following a U.N.-sponsored independence
vote last August. The violence, in which most of the half-island
province was devastated, ended after the arrival of international
peacekeepers on Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been a spate of border incidents involving
incursions by small gangs of heavily armed militiamen into East
Timor. The United Nations, which is administering East Timor in its
transition to independence, has repeatedly urged Indonesia to clamp
down on the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Syahnakri, who now commands a military district that includes
the western half of Timor island, acknowledged the existence in
West Timor of clandestine bands of pro-integration extremists. But
he said the Indonesian government did not support the use of
violence by these groups.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had proposed to open Atambua, the border town in West
Timor where the training is allegedly taking place, to U.N. liaison
officers. In his first trip back to East Timor, Syahnakri said he
also had recommended the establishment of joint border posts and
patrols to prevent further incursions.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. negotiator Peter Galbraith said Syahnakri's recommendations
were not acceptable because ''the problem is not a problem with the
Indonesian army, not a problem with the border, the problem is
infiltration from inside West Timor to inside East Timor.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer League Launched  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Women's World Cup champions are in total
support of the Women's United Soccer Association.
</P>
<P>
   All 20 members of the U.S. national team that captivated the
country in winning the world title last year have signed letters of
intent to play in the WUSA.
</P>
<P>
   The league plans to begin next April with eight teams and a
total of 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know they are committed to women in the WUSA,'' team
co-captain Carla Overbeck said Monday. ''If we are with another
league, which we are hoping will not happen, that would not be the
focus. This group of investors was excited about the World Cup and
the success we had, and jumped in very quickly when approached
about starting a women's professional league. We are looking
forward, and we're excited about their excitement for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The WUSA approved eight cities: Atlanta, Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Orlando-Tampa, San Diego, San Francisco and
Washington. Listed as alternates were Chicago, Columbus, Detroit,
Los Angeles, Miami, Portland, Raleigh-Durham and St. Louis. Any of
those cities might be selected if one of the original eight drops
out. Also under consideration are Milwaukee, Denver and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to success are signing the best players and hooking up
with television.
</P>
<P>
   The WUSA has letters of intent from the top Americans, plus such
international stars as Sissi of Brazil, Charmaine Hooper of Canada,
Julie Murray of Australia and Patience Avre of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Star players would be spread among the eight teams, meaning at
least a half-dozen would be on the field for each game.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting reached a four-year agreement with the WUSA
to televise games on TNT and CNN/SI, mostly on weekend afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   With such major communications outfits as Time-Warner, Comcast
and Cox owning teams, the WUSA has deep pockets, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key is this group is passionate about soccer and they will
benefit soccer,'' said Tony DiCicco, who coached the U.S. World Cup
squad and is now a consultant to the new league. ''We are going to
enhance soccer. The truth is, the resources of this investor group
are something I have been waiting for my entire life and it only
makes sense for the growth of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation set a May 1 deadline to submit
business plans. The WUSA already has done so, and Major League
Soccer also will submit a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The official U.S. Soccer standards require each team with a
minimum salary level of $400,000,'' said John Hendricks, chairman
of the board for the WUSA and chairman and CEO of Discovery
Communications. ''From the investor side, to get the absolute top
players involved, we needed to double that budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soccer federation has a standard for guaranteed funding
for a minimum of three years. We wanted to go longer and we have
lined up funding for a full six years: a development year as well
as five years of league play.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the initial eight markets required a $5 million
investment.
</P>
<P>
   MLS contacted last December about combining efforts. In turn,
WUSA has given a cooperation proposal to the men's league, now in
its fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we can achieve far more working together than
alone,'' MLS commissioner Don Garber said. ''A combined effort
would help us position ourselves vs. the other sports as opposed to
cannibalizing on the support of either leagues. Collectively, we
would ensure the women's viability, which is important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither side envisions the other as the controlling entity
in such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need an investment group solely behind the women's game as
its main priority,'' Hendricks said. ''The MLS focus is on the men,
the WUSA on the women and it provides a chance to build the sport
of soccer throughout the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   WUSA envisions stadiums with capacities of 6,500 to 10,000, far
smaller than MLS sites. It might not find those venues immediately,
and could temporarily emulate the MLS, which has many teams playing
in NFL stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where they play, the U.S. women believe the
phenomenon that was the 1999 World Cup has a carryover effect. That
carryover is manifested in the creation of the WUSA.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the resources these companies have and all the
promotion you can have, we feel you need that directed focus and
energy that is solely behind the women's game,'' said Julie Foudy,
the other co-captain of the '99 U.S. team. ''We are totally
committed to playing for just the WUSA and hoping that is the
league that gets sanctioned.''

<HEADLINE> Packers' Mark Chmura Is Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By TODD RICHMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTLAND, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers tight end Mark Chmura
posted bond after being arrested when his 17-year-old babysitter
accused him of sexually assaulting her at a party.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura and a friend, Robert Gessert, were both arrested early
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old girl told authorities Chmura had sex with her on
a bathroom floor at the post-prom party early Sunday. An
18-year-old woman accused Gessert of sexual misconduct in a hot tub
at the same party.
</P>
<P>
   Hartland Police Chief Morton Hetznecker recommended charges of
third-degree sexual assault, a felony punishable by up to 10 years
in prison and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, 31, and Gessert, 42, were not formally charged when they
appeared in Circuit Court on Monday, but Court Commissioner Martin
Binn found probable cause that a crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue reviewing the case,'' District Attorney Paul
Bucher said. ''We will need to gather more information.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, a married father of two, helped Green Bay to consecutive
Super Bowl appearances in 1997 and in '98, when he started his
first Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, Chmura appeared in court in a jail jumpsuit
with his hands bound in chains.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura and Gessert were released on $5,000 bond, and are due
back in court May 15. Hetznecker said police were questioning other
teen-agers who were at the party.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was arrested and handcuffed early Monday at his home,
where his wife was present, Hetznecker said. Later in the day, John
Drana, a lawyer who has represented Chmura in business affairs,
answered the door at the player's home and said Chmura would have
no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say the mood is serious,'' Drana said.
</P>
<P>
   Hetznecker said 15 to 20 people were at Gessert's home for the
party for students from Waukesha Catholic Memorial High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was some indication of alcohol,'' Hetznecker said. ''The
majority was underage.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, Gessert and an unidentified third man arrived about 3:30
a.m. and began playing drinking games with the girls, a search
warrant stated. The 17-year-old girl said she became ''very
intoxicated'' after Gessert gave her vodka, the warrant stated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the warrant, Chmura, dressed in white boxers and a
dark-colored towel, led the girl into a bathroom, locked the door,
removed her jeans and underwear and had sexual intercourse with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura said nothing to the girl, according to a probable cause
review form prepared by Bucher. She told police she had known
Chmura and his family for two years as a babysitter of his two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old woman accused Gessert of indecently touching her
while the two sat in the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   Hetznecker said the 17-year-old girl and her mother reported the
incident to police Sunday night. The girl underwent a medical
examination at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators arrested Chmura at his home about 2 a.m. Monday,
Hetznecker said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife was present, he said. He described Chmura's demeanor as
''cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Police had arrested Gessert a few minutes earlier at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Police confiscated underwear at Chmura's house and towels at
Gessert's home. They also found vacuum filters containing hair and
other debris from the bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura gave police hair and blood samples, the warrant stated.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an allegation of some inappropriate sexual
misconduct,'' said Gerald Boyle, Chmura's lawyer. ''He is
cooperating in the investigation. We will wait and see what the
facts show.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-degree sexual assault involves sexual intercourse with
someone without consent, under Wisconsin law. First- and
second-degree sexual assault include having intercourse with
someone without consent and using or threatening to use force.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura joined the Packers in 1992 out of Boston College. An avid
supporter of family charities and conservative politics, Chmura
refused to meet with President Clinton after the Packers' 1997
Super Bowl victory and made disparaging remarks about Clinton's
moral character.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura sat out most of last season after suffering a
career-threatening neck injury in the second game, but said he felt
good after participating in the team's first minicamp under new
coach Mike Sherman last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an organization, we are disappointed that Mark Chmura is
involved in the type of situation that has been reported,'' the
Packers said in a statement. The team said it will monitor the case
and had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Packers reserve running back De'Mond Parker was
charged in Richton Park, Ill., with possession of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In February, wide receiver Antonio Freeman was sentenced to a
year of probation for obstructing police in a Green Bay traffic
accident. Former Packers wide receiver Charles Jordan was fined
$5,000 for lying about the accident.

<HEADLINE> Museum IDs Allegedly Stolen Art  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE IVEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- ''Portrait of a Man and Woman in an Interior,'' a
centuries-old painting by Dutch artist Eglon van der Neer, has hung
in the Museum of Fine Arts for nearly six decades.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Boston museum said that the painting, along with
six other European pieces of art it owns, may have been plundered
from their rightful owners by the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has posted photographs of the paintings on its Web
site in hopes the public will help fill in the blanks of their
ownership history to help determine if they indeed represent looted
art.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are offering worldwide access to these paintings and hope
that others with information on their histories will come
forward,'' said Malcolm Rogers, the museum's director. ''Filling
the gaps in the provenance of these paintings could assist in the
identification and restitution of works that may have been looted
during the Holocaust and World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is the latest to publicly identify art possibly
stolen by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The National Museum Directors' Conference in Britain placed 350
questionable paintings on the Internet last month. On Monday, the
German government posted online its Lost Art Internet Database -- a
listing of 2,200 objects that may have been taken during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Three other major museums -- the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los
Angeles, the Chicago Art Institute and the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York City -- soon are expected to follow suit and
identify questionable paintings in their collections.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs of the paintings are accompanied on the museum's
Web site by the most recent research on their past. Museum
officials said although gaps in a piece's history are common, these
particular paintings raised questions because of when or where they
were obtained, or because of their previous owners were implicated
in looting art.
</P>
<P>
   The van der Neer work, for example, was in Paris until 1845 when
it was sold to a Brussels collector. In 1861 it returned to France
through its sale to a Parisian.
</P>
<P>
   After that, its history becomes murky.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Museum of Fine Arts say a man named Robert
Lebel reported selling the painting to German collector Walter
Westfeld around 1937. Lebel said the German government arrested
Westfeld in 1938 and that his property was seized and sold through
the government.
</P>
<P>
   From there, records show only that it was owned by an American,
A. Silberman, in 1941. Silberman told the museum it was brought to
the United States by ''a refugee some time ago,'' but gave no
further information. The museum purchased the painting from
Silberman that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials said they could not be certain it wasn't seized
and sold by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress, which has worked for the return of
Holocaust victims' assets from banks, insurers and art museums,
welcomed the posting of the paintings on the Web. But the group
said that was only a first step.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that the museum is taking its responsibility
seriously,'' said Elan Steinberg, the group's executive director.
''Now I think it is a matter of public obligation of the museum to
determine if the art belongs to someone else or to demonstrate
unequivocally that the museum has clear title.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress estimates that of the country's 750
art museums, 200 might hold questionable art.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Milwaukee Bucks gained the tiebreaker edge
against the
Orlando Magic, and a serious dose of confidence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Allen hit the baskets and Sam Cassell provided the bravado
Monday night as the Bucks played an unusually physical style and
handled the Magic 104-87 to pull within one game of eighth-place
Orlando in the Eastern Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, who guaranteed the Bucks would win, loudly goaded the
Magic all game on a night when shoves, stares and technical fouls
were in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was something that we had to do,'' said Cassell, who had 18
points and eight assists. ''It wasn't a bold statement that I made.
I was just saying that we can't have any slip-ups now.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen scored 33 points on a string of jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight we just came out hitting,'' Allen said. ''We know the
hype that has been around Orlando, and we wanted people to take
notice of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee (38-39) has won all three games against Orlando
(39-38) this season, and they square off again next Monday at
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic shot just 35 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared repeatedly. Cassell and referee Bennett Salvatore
engaged in a shouting match, and both coaches worked the officials
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   John Amaechi and Ervin Johnson exchanged angry words in the
third quarter, as did Ben Wallace and Scott Williams. Cassell,
Williams and Tim Thomas, who shoved Pat Garrity after the two
tangled under the basket, all received technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only NBA game Monday with referees in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Patrick Ewing redirected Larry Johnson's off-target
3-pointer into the basket with 21.7 seconds left on a play
officials later admitted should have been ruled offensive
goaltending as the Knicks beat the Eastern Conference-leading
Indiana Pacers 83-81.
</P>
<P>
   ''I screwed the play up,'' lead official Joey Crawford said.
''We just watched it. The tape doesn't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   And Minnesota's 102-100 victory over Detroit featured 60 fouls,
three foul-outs, five technicals, one ejection -- and a blocked free
throw, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Monday, Philadelphia beat Miami 96-80, Toronto downed
Cleveland 112-103, Charlotte edged Washington 107-105, Portland
held off Utah 90-86, the Los Angeles Lakers got past Seattle
106-103 in overtime, and Boston beat Atlanta 99-94.
</P>
<P>
   At Milwaukee, the contentious atmosphere seemed to bring out the
best in the Bucks, who shot 54 percent in the first half and had
seven players with at least seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have the tiebreaker now, but we're still in good shape,''
Garrity said. ''Now is not the time to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando closes the season with games against Boston, New Jersey,
Miami and Toronto in addition to the meeting with Milwaukee. The
Bucks play Cleveland, Charlotte and have two games with
Washington.
Knicks 83, Pacers 81:
</P>
<P>
   After the Johnson-Ewing 3-pointer, Indiana's Reggie Miller tied
it 81-81 on two foul shots with 15.7 seconds left. Ewing then hit a
fadeaway with two seconds left to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're cheating us now,'' Miller said. ''I don't know if it's
being a small-market (team), but we'll never get the benefit of the
doubt like the big-market teams like New York and Los Angeles.
That's just the league being the league. Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing and Latrell Sprewell both finished with 20 points.
Timberwolves 102, Pistons 100:
</P>
<P>
   Host Minnesota lost its cool, its coach and a cushy lead, but
recovered to win on Kevin Garnett's 10-foot jumper at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett scored 25 points, and Terrell Brandon added 16.
</P>
<P>
   When Minnesota coach Flip Saunders was ejected in the third
quarter, he tossed his jacket into the seats, ran onto the court
and unleashed a profanity-filled tirade.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon said he smacked away a free throw by Detroit's Terry
Mills because Minnesota forward Joe Smith hadn't left the court
after picking up his sixth foul.
76ers 96, Heat 80:
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson's 33 points helped end visiting Miami's seven-game
winning streak.
Raptors 112, Cavaliers 103:
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter's first career triple-double -- 31 points, 11
rebounds, 10 assists -- helped Toronto end a four-game home losing
streak and move within a win of its first playoff berth.
Hornets 107, Wizards 105:
</P>
<P>
   Elden Campbell's 18-foot turnaround jumper as time expired
lifted visiting Charlotte to its ninth win in 11 games.
Trail Blazers 90, Jazz 86:
</P>
<P>
   At Salt Lake City, Greg Anthony's 3-pointer with 21.8 seconds
remaining gave Portland a 3-1 season-series win.
Lakers 106, SuperSonics 103, OT:
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant scored five of his 33 points in overtime as host Los
Angeles won without Shaquille O'Neal, who sat out a second game
with a sprained left ankle.
Celtics 99, Hawks 94
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker scored 26 of his 34 points in the second half and
Boston scored the last 11 points to end a 10-game losing slide.
Atlanta has lost 12 straight road games.

<HEADLINE> Denny's Agrees To Retrain Managers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Denny's Inc. has agreed to retrain its
restaurant managers nationwide in response to allegations it
requested excessive documentation from aliens applying for work.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said Monday the company also agreed to
pay $89,400 in civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of all 1,700 company-owned Denny's restaurants will
be trained how to verify that aliens are eligible to work under the
Immigration and Reform and Control Act of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   John Trasvina, Justice's special counsel for immigration-related
unfair employment practices, praised the company's ''cooperative
spirit in resolving the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the investigation focused solely on San Diego-area
restaurants, Denny's is taking steps to ensure that managers at
every one of its company-owned restaurants across the country do
not make the same mistake,'' Trasvina said.
</P>
<P>
   Trasvina's office conducted an 18-month investigation of
allegations that San Diego Denny's restaurants requested specific
documents from newly hired noncitizen workers to prove they could
legally work in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits employers from demanding specific
identification documents and allows new employees to choose which
of several documents to produce to establish work eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 act prohibits job discrimination based on national
origin and citizenship status.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Denny's settled a $46 million discrimination suit filed
by black Secret Service agents who said they were denied service at
a restaurant. The complaints were among a series of discrimination
claims by black customers at Denny's restaurants around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an agreement with the Justice Department in those
cases, the chain agreed to retrain employees in requirements of
federal civil rights law covering public accommodations, feature
minorities in its ads and hire an outside lawyer to monitor
compliance.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Sharansky Visits Ethiopia  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Dressed in his finest -- a shiny
gray suit and tie -- 8-year-old Mulukan Alemu today proudly shook
hands with Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharanky.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in an Addis Ababa transit camp, the boy and 21
relatives were given permission to move to Israel because his
grandfather has completed the lengthy process of converting to
Judaism, making the entire family eligible for Israeli citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now you are an Israeli citizen,'' Sharansky told Mulukan
during a meeting in a small briefing room at the Israeli embassy in
the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Alemus, who were set to fly to Israel, are Falash Mura,
Ethiopian Jews who converted to Christianity. In all, about 26,000
Falash Mura are waiting to immigrate to Israel, including 18,000
who left their homes and are living in small mud huts surrounding
transit compounds in Addis Ababa and the northern city of Gondar.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky toured the camps this week, but has told the Falash
Mura that not everyone would be brought to Israel to avoid setting
a precedent that would flood Israel with immigration requests on
hardship grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suffering doesn't make someone Jewish,'' Sharansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for the community accused Sharansky of discriminating
against the Falash Mura while approving the immigration of hundreds
of thousands of non-Jews from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the Addis Ababa compound Monday, Falash Mura
showed Sharansky their commitment to Judaism. Women, who have
crosses tattooed on their foreheads as is customary in Ethiopian
villages, baked matzah, unleavened bread used for the Jewish
holiday of Passover, over an open fire, while children sang Hebrew
songs and knitted ritual prayer fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, wearing his trademark khaki cap and sneakers, visited
rickety shacks where children sat on wooden benches, studying
Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why did you come here?'' he asked 15-year-old Fakato Tarke.
</P>
<P>
   ''To join my father in Israel,'' Tarke replied, telling
Sharansky in broken Hebrew that he has been waiting for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Goldman, one of the compound organizers, said Israel was
deliberately stonewalling the Falash Mura because they are ''poor
and black.''
</P>
<P>
   Their absorption costs Israel a lot of money in stipends and
social services, and many Israelis oppose the immigration of a
group they consider to be non-Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Mula, an immigration official responsible for settling
Ethiopian Jews in Israel, said that race had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Falash Mura decided to be Jewish 10 years ago, when they
saw Ethiopian Jews coming to Israel,'' said Mula, who made the
dangerous trek from Ethiopia to the Sudan 15 years ago to reach
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations of reaching Israel have created irreversible
migration.
</P>
<P>
   Yenesewbeza Bitewa left her house and farmland in northern
Ethiopia two years ago, at the request of her married daughter, who
immigrated to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't go back, because our land has been taken by the
people in the village,'' she said.

SO YOUNG:
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr. became the youngest player to hit

to Colorado. At 30 years, 141 days, Griffey beat the previous mark
set by Jimmie Foxx, who was 30 years, 248 days old. Griffey's homer
came on the 50th birthday of his father, Reds coach Ken Griffey. It
its the fourth time Griffey has homered on his father's birthday.
SWAT MAN:
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Mark McGwire homered for the third straight game in
Monday night's 8-7 victory at Houston. McGwire raised his career
total to 525 -- nine behind Jimmie Foxx for ninth on the career
list. His first homer at Enron Field gave McGwire home runs in 35
major league ballparks, one behind the record held by Tampa Bay's
Fred McGriff.
SCHILLING'S REHAB:

topped out at 94 mph.
STRONG START:

<P>
   Anaheim's Scott Schoeneweis, making his second major league
start, pitched a three-hitter as the Angels beat Toronto 6-0 Monday
night. It was the Angels' first complete-game shutout in almost two
years. Chuck Finley was the last Anaheim pitcher to accomplish the
feat, with a 5-0 win over Tampa Bay on April 17, 1998.
SOON GONE:
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee played its final opening-day game at County Stadium on
Monday, beating Florida 4-3. Miller Park, scheduled to open this

STRONG IN DEFEAT:
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Kevin Millwood allowed six hits in seven scoreless
innings Monday, but the Braves lost to the Chicago Cubs 4-3.
SECOND HEAVEN:
</P>
<P>
   Colorado third baseman Jeff Cirillo had two doubles in a 7-5
victory over Cincinnati on Monday. Cirillo has five hits this
season, all doubles.
SERVING UP HOMERS:
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has given up an AL-high 18 homers this season,
including a two-run shot in its 6-5 victory over Minnesota on
Monday.

</P>
<P>
   Minnesota turned inning-ending double plays in the second,
third, fourth and eighth innings of its 6-5 loss to Kansas City on
Monday.
SLUGFEST:
</P>
<P>

club record.
SQUANDERED:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets wasted a four-run lead for the second straight
game in Monday night's 9-7 loss to Philadelphia.
STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Four of Andres Galarraga's six hits for Atlanta this season have

<HEADLINE> Prison Guards Head To Trial  </HEADLINE>
BY KILEY RUSSELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Prison guards are expected to prevent
violence between inmates.
</P>
<P>
   But eight guards are due to go on trial today in federal court
for allegedly inciting violence, staging gladiator-like fights
among inmates in one of California's toughest prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Corcoran State Prison guards face possible life
sentences for the shooting of an inmate during one of the 1994
brawls, moments after a guard allegedly said: ''It's going to be
duck hunting season.''
</P>
<P>
   The guards were indicted in 1998 after years of internal
investigations, legislative hearings and a state grand jury probe
produced no charges. The FBI accused the state of trying to block
its investigation -- a charge corrections officials denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real subject of this trial will not be the individual
officers, but will be the Department of Corrections,'' said
Catherine Campbell, president of the watchdog group California
Prison Focus.
</P>
<P>
   The guards at Corcoran, about 40 miles south of Fresno,
allegedly conspired to brutalize the prisoners by setting up two
fights between rival gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys say the guards were just following the state's
since-rescinded ''integrated yard'' policy, which forced inmates of
different ethnic and geographic backgrounds to exercise together.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to prove that our clients intended to violate
inmates' constitutional rights. We don't believe that's the case,''
attorney Curtis Sisk said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent James Maddock has said that ''it appears the fights
were staged, even provoked, for the amusement of correctional
officers or retribution against inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   To get convictions, federal prosecutors must persuade the jurors
to trust the word of violent criminals over law officers who
routinely risk their lives to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a hard task. Jurors in California's Central Valley
tend to be sympathetic to guards, because prisons provide much of
the region's non-farm employment -- as many as 10,000 jobs. In
November, four Corcoran guards were acquitted of setting up the
rape of an inmate by a prisoner known for sexually attacking other
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Truman Jennings and officers Michael Gipson, Timothy
Dickerson, and Raul Tavarez face up to 10 years in connection with
a fight. Lt. Douglas Martin, Sgt. John Vaughn, officer Jerry Arvizu
and officer Christopher Bethea face life sentences plus 10 years in
the death of Preston Tate, who was shot in the head by Bethea
during another brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Tate's death, which led to an $825,000 settlement for his
family, has already led to key policy changes in California's
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners who feel endangered can now choose not to exercise
with rival inmates, and guards try to keep gangs separate.
Misconduct accusations now get investigated by the state inspector
general. And prison officials are seeking the advice of inmates on
reducing violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administrative and management responses to these kinds of
problems are enormously more important than the criminal trials
that may ensue,'' said Franklin Zimring, professor of law and
director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of
California at Berkeley.

violators and give the public more information about pipeline
safety and accidents.
</P>
<P>
   An initiative being unveiled today by Vice President Gore also

and investigating pipeline accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The improvements in this bill assure that pipeline operators
are more accountable to the public for the risks they impose,''
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said in a letter
accompanying a draft of the proposal that was previewed by
administration officials on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would create new requirements for pipeline
operators in densely populated regions and in environmentally
sensitive areas. Operators would have to conduct internal
inspections or ''another equally protective method'' to
periodically determine the strength of lines, and then act to
address any flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Operators would need to share maps, manuals and emergency
response plans with local communities to better prepare for
emergencies. Information about pipeline accidents and
safety-related issues would be made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties would be increased. Companies that overpressurize a
pipeline, causing the line to fail, could face a fine of $500,000,
rather than the $25,000 fine under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of additional pipeline safety requirements said
Monday that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.,
are the best hope for safety improvements in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers said the bill's passage will not be easy. Metcalf
said he is having a hard time getting colleagues interested in
buried pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The phrase out of sight, out of mind, certainly applies when
pipelines are concerned,'' Metcalf cautioned allies at a conference
on pipeline safety.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Jerome Earnest, a former sports editor
at The News Herald who became a nationally recognized advocate on
slow-pitch softball, died Sunday of heart failure at age 58.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Earnest published, edited and wrote his Supreme
Softball, a publication he put out 18 times a year and that some
consider as important to slow-pitch softball as Baseball Weekly and
Baseball Digest are to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was known far and wide for organizing and (promoting)
slow-pitch softball events,'' said Wayne Boyd, a high school
teammate and longtime friend. ''The last 20-25 years, he traveled
with various high-profile softball teams ... doing promotions and
marketing. He probably stayed on the highway three-fourths of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnest began his journalism career while still a Bay High
baseball player and was promoted to sports editor at The News
Herald, serving in that capacity until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   During his journalism career, he managed local softball teams
and started the Southeastern Invitational, a prominent tournament
still held in Panama City Beach, in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   His passion took him to North Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Georgia, Ohio and California, where he worked for various softball
organizations.
Jack Gardner:
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jack Gardner, former basketball coach of
Utah and Kansas State, died Sunday after a long illness and
complications stemming from a broken hip last fall. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame since 1984
and a former coach of the Utah and Kansas State college basketball
programs.
</P>
<P>
   He coached Utah from 1953-71 and Kansas State from 1939-42 and
1946-53.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's best years were from 1959-62, when his teams went
51-5. His Utah squads reached the national semifinals twice, losing
in 1961 to Cincinnati and in 1966 to Texas Western.
</P>
<P>
   At Kansas State, Gardner won the Big Seven three times and went
147-81. His team lost to Kentucky in the 1951 NCAA championship
game and in 1948 to Baylor in the West regional final, the
equivalent of today's national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   He developed a revolutionary fast-break style of play during an
era when many teams relied on set shots. Gardner's Utah teams
routinely scored in the 70s or higher, capitalizing on the talents
of players like All-America Billy McGill, who led the nation in
scoring in 1961-62 at 38.8 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ''The Fox,'' Gardner was the driving force behind
construction of Utah's Huntsman Center. At Kansas State, he helped
design Ahearn Field House. Both schools award basketball
scholarships in Gardner's name.
</P>
<P>
   In 28 seasons overall, Gardner compiled a 486-235 record. At
Utah he went 339-154 and won seven titles in the Skyline and
Western Athletic conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring in 1971, he ranked third among active coaches
for career victories, trailing Kentucky's Adolph Rupp and UCLA's
John Wooden.
Larry Linville:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry Linville, best known for his portrayal of
the power-hungry and neurotic Maj. Frank Burns on the CBS
television show ''M A
</P>
<P>
   S H,'' died Monday of complications of pneumonia. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Linville suffered from cancer and had a lung removed in 1998
after a malignant tumor was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Linville was a native of Ojai, Calif., and had been living in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Linville was part of a breakout cast that made ''M A S H'' one
of the longest-running shows on television. He starred with Alan
Alda, Gary Burghoff, Wayne Rogers and Loretta Swit as part of an
ensemble that launched the show in 1972, on the heels of the hit
movie of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The show, at times with comedy, at times with stark political
commentary, detailed life at the 4077th Mobil Army Surgical
Hospital, where Linville was a whiny, military stickler smitten
with the head nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the show's early action revolved around the antics of
tent-mates Burns, Hawkeye Pierce (played by Alda) and Trapper John
McIntyre (Rogers). But the show also took on serious topics of war
and bloodshed, often seemingly more relevant to the Vietnam War
than the conflict in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Linville left ''M A S H'' after the fifth season. He went on to
guest star on numerous television series and had roles in ''Grandpa
Goes to Washington,'' ''Checking In'' and ''Paper Dolls.''
William C. Stokoe Jr.:
</P>
<P>
   CHEVY CHASE, Md. (AP) -- William C. Stokoe Jr., a linguistics
professor whose work brought worldwide acceptance to sign language
for deaf students, died April 4. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Stokoe, who taught at Gallaudet University in Washington, is
credited with winning recognition of American Sign Language as a
genuine language, overcoming the contentions of linguists that it
was little more than a rudimentary imitation of the spoken word.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, when Stokoe (pronounced STOH-key) arrived at Gallaudet,
the only university for the hearing-impaired in the United States,
he knew little about sign language or even about deafness.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to instruct without using sign language,
teaching deaf students by insisting that they communicate orally
and read lips. But deaf students signed freely among themselves,
and Stokoe became fascinated with the language.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after he arrived at Gallaudet, Stokoe published the
groundbreaking ''Sign Language Structure.'' Four years later, he
was the co-author of ''A Dictionary of American Sign Language on
Linguistic Principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The books helped prove that sign language met the definition of
a language. Stokoe's beliefs gradually drew wide acceptance and
persuaded schools for the deaf to re-evaluate their approaches.
</P>
<P>
   His work won him a hero's status among many deaf students.

<HEADLINE> Chinese To Lend Zoo Two New Pandas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Zoo is sprucing up its empty
Panda House to get ready for a couple of new tenants from China.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials scheduled a news conference today for what they
termed a ''major'' announcement on negotiations between the Chinese
government and zoo officials on obtaining new pandas.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that zoo
officials returned from China on Sunday with a signed letter of
intent under which Chine would lend two pandas to the zoo for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence M. Small was poised to make the
announcement, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Small told The Associated Press last week that details were
being worked out to obtain new pandas and that it probably would
cost an estimated $8 million to rent a couple from China for 10
years. He said any offspring could be kept though they would still
belong to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   It could be more than a year before the pandas arrive in
Washington because the zoo must renovate the panda quarters, choose
the animals and obtain an import permit, the Post quoted unnamed
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials have agreed to pay China hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year in exchange for the endangered animals. Zoo
scientists will also provide extensive help toward saving giant
pandas in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, China gave the United States two pandas, Ling-Ling and
Hsing-Hsing, who became the Zoo's most popular attraction.
Ling-Ling died in 1992. Hsing-Hsing was euthanized last year after
suffering from terminal kidney disease.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Detective: Mrs. Ramsey Wrote Note  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's parents lashed out at a former
police detective who investigated their daughter's slaying, saying
his theory that the mother killed the girl in a fit of rage is ''a
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey called former investigator Steve Thomas
''an inexperienced moron'' in a Denver Post interview published
today. It was the Ramseys' first public response to Thomas' new
book, ''JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is the first person officially connected to the case to
write about it in detail, and the first to name a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   According to published summaries of the book, Thomas theorizes
that Patsy Ramsey accidentally killed JonBenet because of
bed-wetting, and then wrote a ransom note to make the death look
like a botched kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas claims John Ramsey knew his wife was involved when he
read the ransom note but immediately began covering for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so insane it would be laughable if it weren't so
tragic,'' John Ramsey said during an interview at his suburban
Atlanta home.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not have covered up for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your love for your child is unconditional. Your love for your
spouse is conditional; you murder my child, I don't love you
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her
family's upscale Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996. John Ramsey found
his daughter's body several hours after Patsy Ramsey called police
and said she found the ransom note demanding money for JonBenet's
safe return.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wrote that he thought it was strange the Ramseys never
asked exactly how JonBenet died.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said if Thomas had children of his own, he would not
have found it so odd. ''I don't ever really want to know those
details,'' Patsy Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   John Ramsey was less charitable. ''That's the word of an
inexperienced moron without children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has accused prosecutors and police of bungling the
investigation, but the Ramseys blamed Thomas for detectives'
failure to arrest anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is ''one of the single biggest reasons this whole
investigation failed,'' John Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas quit the Boulder Police Department in 1998, accusing
District Attorney Alex Hunter of kowtowing to the Ramseys and
saying police weren't aggressive enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has denounced Thomas for ''pecking at the bones of a poor
little dead girl'' for money and for publicly discussing an ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas countered Monday that Hunter ''doesn't want the truth out
there because it shows him for what he is: the underzealous,
small-town politician who's been impersonating a prosecutor all
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have not named a suspect in JonBenet's death, although
authorities have maintained the parents are under an ''umbrella of
suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys say in their recently released book ''The Death of
Innocence'' that an intruder, perhaps a pedophile, likely killed
JonBenet.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules in Holocaust Suit  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Historian David Irving, who has outraged survivors
of Nazi death camps by challenging the scope of the Holocaust,
today lost the libel suit that he launched to save his academic
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sued American scholar Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher,
Penguin Books, in Britain's High Court. He said their 1994 book
branded him a ''Holocaust denier'' and accused him of distorting
the truth of what happened in Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, whose books include ''Hitler's War,'' said he does not
deny Jews were killed by the Nazis, but challenges the number and
manner of Jewish concentration camp deaths.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that after the publication of Lipstadt's book,
''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,''
his academic work was increasingly shunned by publishers and
agents.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Charles Gray said he failed to prove his reputation
had been damaged. Under British law, Lipstadt and Penguin were not
able to rely solely on truth as a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the ruling, Irving said that whatever the outcome
''my reputation is bound to be enhanced because of my ability to
stand up to the experts ... to take them all on single-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will not appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who represented himself during the nine-week, non-jury
trial, is not new to controversy. His comments -- some made while
addressing neo-Nazi groups -- have drawn fire from Jewish
organizations around the world, and he has been banned from
Germany, Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Irving told the court he had been the victim of a 30-year
international campaign to destroy his reputation ''as a human
being, as an historian of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rampton, the lawyer representing Penguin and Lipstadt,
who holds the Dorot Chair in Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at
Emory University in Atlanta, said during the trial that Irving
perpetuated falsifications ''for the sake of a bogus rehabilitation
of Hitler and dissemination of virulent anti-Semitic propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving conceded he had made some ''mistakes of copying, mistakes
of omission,'' but said he corrected those errors. He claimed that
rather than deny the Holocaust, he drew attention to major aspects
of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Irving questioned the use of large-scale gas chambers to
exterminate the Jews, and claimed that the numbers of those who
perished are far lower than those generally accepted. He said most
Jews who died at Auschwitz did so from diseases such as typhus, not
gas poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the international outrage directed at Irving,
Israel even agreed to release the previously secret memoirs of Nazi
war criminal Adolf Eichmann for use by Lipstadt and Penguin's legal
team, saying it was morally obliged to help them.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1,300 handwritten pages penned in an Israeli prison,
Eichmann plays down his own role in the mass killing but also
provides methodical descriptions of the genocide, including
timetables of death transports.

<HEADLINE> Gore Addresses Elian Situation  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES HANNAH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDALIA, Ohio (AP) -- In a bid to win the hearts of a roomful of
undecided voters, Vice President Al Gore shared his views on the
custody dispute over a 6-year-old Cuban refugee, a controversial
incinerator in eastern Ohio and a host of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 people crowded into the library at Vandalia-Butler
High School on Monday night for the two-hour town meeting. The vice
president appeared relaxed and at ease with the audience, which
came armed with questions of every sort.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the relatives of 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian
Gonzalez should be allowed to try to work out among themselves the
escalating custody dispute over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''With tensions as high as they are and with both sides trying
to figure out a way to come to a resolution, I think that we need
to encourage the talks between the family members themselves,''
said Gore. ''Let the entire family, including the Florida
relatives, talk with one another without people from the U.S.
government or the Cuban government or lawyers on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was visiting Avondale Elementary School in Columbus today
while his Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, was
unveiling poverty initiatives in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign said he would deliver a speech emphasizing ways
to help those on the outskirts of poverty move up into the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was scheduled to tour El Barrio, an agency that
provides social services, including job training, high school
diploma classes and youth summer camp, to a mostly Hispanic
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance Monday evening, Gore addressed President
Clinton's sex scandal involving Monica Lewinsky when asked what he
would do to bring respect to the office of the presidency. Gore
said he would bring his ''values of faith and family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is my friend,'' said Gore. ''I explained my
disapproval of his personal mistakes. I'm running for president on
my own, on the basis of my own vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he has made no decision on a vice presidential
candidate or any other appointments should he be elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not drawing up a list, short or long, for a running mate,
Cabinet members or the Supreme Court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked what he would do about the WTI hazardous-waste
incinerator near East Liverpool, Ohio. He said the administration
of former President Bush -- the current putative GOP nominee's
father -- granted an operating permit to the incinerator just before
Clinton assumed the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the options available to us were taken away from us by
a last-minute decision by the Bush-Quayle administration,'' he
said. ''But I have asked EPA, and they have agreed, to do a
full-scale review of this.''

pieces of the charred wreck and trying to ensure that investigators could remove
the remains safely, said Lt. Mark Carter, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Air

Russia Considering Start II Treaty

START II nuclear arms reduction treaty. The Duma's agenda council set the debate
for Friday, and lawmakers said chances were good for quick approval of the
treaty, which would halve each side's U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to about
3,000-3,5000 warheads. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996. The treaty's
prospects have jumped since a new Russian parliament was elected in December.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Fraud was on the lips of Peruvians in the capital streets
after election officials said President Alberto Fujimori was just shy of the
majority of votes needed to win an unprecedented third term. Officials said
after counting more than half the ballots that Fujimori had 49.6 percent,
compared to Alejandro Toledo's 40.6. That defied exit polls and unofficial vote
tallies by independent monitors that indicated he would not reach the 50 percent
plus one vote needed to avoid a runoff. The first results were made public at
midday, more than 12 hours later than election officials had promised, prompting
suspicion of dirty play.

Law Clearly on Side of Elian's Dad

''No way under our legal tradition the father should be deprived of his ability
to care for his son,'' says Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of
Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic. A decision in favor of the boy's Miami
relatives would ''wreak havoc with the whole concept of the parent-child

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today in Tokyo on
speculation that leading finance ministers will express concern
about the yen's strength at a meeting this weekend. Tokyo stocks
closed moderately lower on selling of Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.96 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange
market in late trading today, up 0.90 yen from Monday and above its
late New York level Monday of 106.47 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 96.54 points,
or 0.47 percent, to close at 20,522.52 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
On Monday, the average rose 366.25 points, or 1.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, overseas investors bought dollars on
sentiment that the greenback would rise further if finance
ministers attending the Group of Seven meeting release a statement
saying that the yen has risen too high.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today he will
tell G-7 counterparts that Japan will not tolerate a strengthening
of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have seen for yourselves what we do when we feel that a
rapid strengthening of the yen is problematic,'' Miyazawa said at a
regular news conference, referring to dollar buying intervention in
currency markets by the Bank of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Talks Continue in Janitors Strike  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Striking janitors and the cleaning
contractors who employ them worked toward a compromise with the
help of Los Angeles' political leaders as the walkout entered its
second week.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of janitors walked off the job in Pasadena,
parts of Hollywood and the Wilshire corridor Monday night, bringing
those on strike to an estimated 8,500 since the walkout began April
3.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 janitors marched and chanted slogans in downtown
Pasadena late Monday, clad in the red ''Justice for Janitors''
shirts that have become ubiquitous in local business districts.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said he foresaw an end to the strike
''within 24 hours'' and predicted workers would receive ''somewhat
near what they are asking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it was going to be that simple,'' said Service
Employees International Union Local 1877 President Mike Garcia.
''We're still apart on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia conformed that both sides were getting closer.
Building owners, union officials and political leaders met
throughout the weekend and more talks were underway Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 cleaning contractors that handle 70 percent of the
county's office space have scrambled to hire replacement workers.
Workers in San Diego, Chicago and New York have offered support to
the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of the Los Angeles Diocese,
celebrated Mass that culminated in a march by workers from the Arco
Towers in downtown to Our Lady Queen of Angels Church.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the church Monday, he called the janitors the
''invisible workforce'' and said they deserved a share of ''the
wonderful fruitfulness of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They come in at night after the offices are closed,'' Mahony
said as he awaited the marching workers outside the church. ''They
are faceless, nameless, voiceless. Now they are visible, thanks be
to God.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 workers carrying white carnations marched into the
church, some singing in Spanish a hymn of the labor movement, ''We
Shall Not Be Moved,'' and other singing more traditional church
hymns.
</P>
<P>
   The janitors earn $6.80 to $7.90 per hour with health benefits
and are seeking a $1 per hour raise for each of the next three
years. The cleaning contractors have offered a raise of 80 cents to
$1.30 over the same period.

<HEADLINE> Russia Considering Start II Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At the urging of President Vladimir Putin, the
lower house of Russia's parliament decided today to debate the
long-delayed ratification of the START II nuclear arms reduction
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's agenda council set the debate for Friday, and
lawmakers said chances were good for quick approval of the treaty,
which would halve each side's U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to
about 3,000-3,5000 warheads. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty's prospects have jumped since a new Russian
parliament was elected in December. Communists and nationalists who
had blocked ratification lost their dominance in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has urged lawmakers to ratify the treaty, saying that
reducing nuclear arsenals does not mean becoming weaker. Government
officials said that aging missiles must be soon dismantled anyway,
and the treaty would allow Russia to preserve a nuclear balance
while freeing substantial sums of money now spent on maintaining
the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is to travel to the United States
at the end of April to discuss arms control issues, and the
government hopes to have the treaty ratified before his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky opposes the treaty, but
predicted it would be quickly endorsed by lawmakers. ''Many will
vote on command without thinking of their historical
responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification could help clear the way for a compromise with the
United States over the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Washington
wants to amend the treaty to allow for the construction of a
limited missile-defense system to protect against nuclear attacks
by so-called ''rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has strongly objected, saying that such a defense could
unravel all nuclear arms control treaties with Washington.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Ha Jin  </HEADLINE>
By AUDRA ANG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ha Jin is fatigued. Worn out. Dog tired.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the National Book Award in November for his novel,
''Waiting,'' the author's quiet life has been pumped up by fame and
pummeled by interviews, readings and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Fans approach him at airports, his home phone number is no
longer listed, e-mails deluge his inbox.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I'm tired of it,'' Jin says. ''On the other hand, I
can't be rude.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's not.
</P>
<P>
   Jin, an immigrant from China, is gracious and patient, a
soft-spoken man who weighs the nuances of his second language
carefully, often pausing for a moment before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a little overwhelmed. ... People are treating me like a
celebrity. I don't think I'm a celebrity,'' he says. ''It's not
comfortable for me. When I go to a place, I would like to be
treated like a regular person.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, it's a small price to pay for winning the $10,000
award, one of the literary world's most coveted. In recent days,
Jin has picked up another jewel for his literary crown, the
Pen/Faulkner prize, and there was much buzz that he was a strong
contender for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Jin, who came to the United States in 1985, stresses that the
road to success has been paved by countless hours of financial
worries and littered with numerous rejections from publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is easy,'' the author says from Boston, where he was
scheduled to give a lecture. ''It has been difficult all the time.
I think any good work has to be earned with some kind of effort and
sacrifice. That is the price we have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a low-ranking army officer, the 44-year-old author,
whose given name is Jin Xuefei -- meaning golden flying snow -- was
born in northeast China's Liaoning province. When he was 10,
bonfires of books burned across the country and schools were shut
down in the wake of the anti-intellectual Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, at age 14, he joined the People's Liberation Army where
he volunteered for the artillery and to work as a telegraph
operator near the Russian border for the next five years. His
military experiences provided much inspiration for future works,
especially ''Ocean of Words,'' his first collection of short
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically it was very hard. In the first few months, we
didn't have enough food ... and it was very cold. Mentally, it
wasn't too bad. I knew there might be a war and so we were ready
and knew if we had to die, we'd die,'' Jin says.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not sad. We were quite happy ... because everything
was new: big guns and trucks. And I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Jin had his first, brief taste of Western literature --
a translation of ''Don Quixote'' passed around the barracks -- after
years of reading Mandarin versions of Marx, Lenin and Engels.
</P>
<P>
   When colleges were reopened five years later, Jin began
half-hour English lessons with the goal of reading the original of
Engels' ''The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.''
</P>
<P>
   He passed entrance exams to the Heilongjiang University in
Harbin (which inspired the first half of his pen-name) and
eventually earned his master's degree at Shandong University, and
his doctorate in English at Brandeis University in Boston in 1993.
He now teaches creative writing at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The National Book Award came only 12 years after Jin began
writing in English, and it was not his first accolade. He already
had the Flannery O'Connor and PEN/Hemingway awards -- one for each
of his anthologies of short stories -- and three Pushcart Prizes for
poetry under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ''success is only the byproduct of the writing, the
effort. It's almost accidental. It's not the goal,'' he notes. ''As
a writer, I think I'm no more than an instrument ... to make a book
as good as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have likened Jin's work to that of Isaac Babel and Anton
Chekov. His prose is clear, but brilliantly detailed, sparkling
within his vignettes of life in rural Red China.
</P>
<P>
   An example: ''The air was still warm though the crimson sun was
approaching the indigo peak of the Great Emperor Mountain. Grass
had pierced the soil here and there, and the cornfields, sown a few
days before, looked like huge gray ribs stretching towards the end
of the green sky. Everything seemed sluggish and even the air made
one feel languid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is always to transform the story into literature from
history so that it can be shared by people emotionally,
psychologically,'' Jin says.
</P>
<P>
   The novel ''Waiting'' is based on a story he heard from his
wife's parents almost 20 years ago. ''Intuitively, at that moment,
I knew it could be a novel,'' he says. ''It's about three people's
whole lives and, besides, a love story is always a great subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The book follows the 18-year relationship between a married army
doctor and a nurse as each summer the doctor tries to divorce his
peasant wife. The characters, while constrained by the rules of the
Communist party, eventually get what they want -- but at a price far
higher than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ''My interpretation of the story is that this is a good man, a
decent man, a good-natured man. But emotionally, he's crippled and
because of the harsh situation, he never has the opportunity to
develop, to grow up emotionally,'' Jin says.
</P>
<P>
   While at Brandeis, Jin had planned to return to China to do
research and teach after getting his doctorate. But he changed his
mind in 1989, after hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators -- many
of whom were students -- were killed by the military in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tiananmen massacre was beyond my imagination,'' Jin says.
''I didn't imagine that the government could do such a terrible
thing. ... It was a senseless, wasteful tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He is currently working on another novel and a short story
collection; a book of poems is scheduled to be released next fall.
While speaking engagements and family life don't leave much time
for writing, he has to write every day, he said. ''Otherwise I'd be
bad-tempered,'' Jin admits with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started, I didn't realize there was a lot of isolation,
frustration. Before, I could write academic papers but creative
writing required a different kind of ability, different levels of
diction, nuances, dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   And the more he writes in English, the more he appreciates the
language.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very unique in many ways. It ... has embraced authors
whose mother tongues are not English and their works have become
mainstream,'' he says. ''By comparison, most other languages don't
open themselves and offer that kind of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''English is the language of the common people.''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'East is East'  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spirit of screwball comedy, ''East is East'' begins with
a wedding gone wrong. An arranged Pakistani marriage is to take
place in London. We see the procession, the primping, the costumes,
the last-minute snags and unsnags. It's a long, nervous buildup to
a classic snap of wedding nerves: The groom turns and runs for his
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, the escapee would have hurried into the arms of
his true love. But ''East is East,'' its title borrowed from the
Kipling poem about East-West conflict, tends to more practical
affairs. It's interested in the people left behind, a large,
rebellious mixed-raced family for whom life often feels like an
altar worth bolting from.
</P>
<P>
   Om Puri stars as George Khan, a patriarch soured by his own
double standards. Married for 25 years to a white woman (Linda
Bassett), he tries to bully their sons into marrying Pakistanis. He
demands their daughter wear a sari on Sundays, but sends her
weekdays to a Western school. He has the airs of a self-made man,
but depends on money from his wife's family.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1971, a bad time for those accustomed to giving
orders. The Khan kids (seven in all) talk back, let their hair grow
and don't care much about Pakistani culture. The chants of the
Koran have been displaced by the beat of British pop.
</P>
<P>
   The film itself has a slacker's rhythm: informal, disorganized,
likable. It runs 96 minutes and takes half that time to present an
actual story: a double arranged marriage. Until then, it's an
assortment of vignettes about the family's life: a boy's tender
surgery, a girl's jokey dance with a broom, a young man's kisses
with his pretty white neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Damien O'Donnell, and adapted by Ayub Khan-Din from
his own play, ''East is East'' has had great success in the United
Kingdom. It was nominated for six BAFTA awards, Britain's version
of the Oscars, and was named best British picture by the London
Film Critics Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, however, doesn't quite translate. The script could
have used another draft. The subplots aren't developed and the
father's character especially feels underwritten, abruptly changing
from amiable grouch to hateful tyrant. Puri, playing a confused,
desperate man, did far better with a similar role in last year's
''My Son the Fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   But weddings -- even the idea of them -- seem to inspire the
filmmakers. ''East is East'' peaks in the penultimate scene when
George and family are visited by a snobbish Pakistani clan, the two
daughters intended as brides for two younger Khan sons.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a disaster of manners worthy of old Hollywood --
the dinner party in ''Alice Adams,'' the clash of the two families
in ''You Can't Take it With You.'' The Khans couldn't behave for
all the money in England, thank goodness. They may be freaks in
their own world, but in movies they're part of a great comic
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   A Miramax Films release, ''East is East'' was produced by Leslee
Udwin. It's rated R, with violence, profanity and adult situations.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Stops Doctor Reward System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Aetna U.S. Healthcare has agreed to stop rewarding
or fining doctors over whether they limit patients' health care,
settling a lawsuit filed by the state of Texas with a deal that
could become a model for other HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn and Aetna were to announce
details of the settlement today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is this settlement places medical
decision-making in the hands of doctors and their patients, and
Texans can rest assured that doctors won't be penalized for
elevating patient needs above HMOs,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a draft of a letter to state lawmakers that Aetna has
agreed to settle the lawsuit and take steps that will end any
financial incentives to limit needed care to HMO members.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Cornyn's Democratic predecessor, Dan Morales, sued
Aetna and five other HMOs in 1998, accusing them of illegally
compensating doctors who limited patients' medical care and
penalizing those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, under the settlement, is prohibited from fining doctors
who exceed medical budgets or giving them bonuses for staying
within limits. The state's largest HMO also will have to report if
doctors' groups in its plan do give financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of what is embodied in the agreement is not new business
practices,'' Arthur Leibowitz, Aetna's chief medical officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was expected to quickly become a role model in
other states, said Rocky Wilcox, chief counsel of the Texas Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll get all over the country real fast,'' said Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement contains no finding of fault, fines or penalties.
And Aetna denies any wrongdoing in the agreement that ends its
involvement in the 1998 lawsuit. Morales had sought to fine Aetna
$10,000 per violation for offering financial incentives for the
medical care that physicians provide their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said he would use the agreement as a model. If the other
HMOs named in the lawsuit do not agree to the terms, the attorney
general said, he will try them in state district court. The HMOs
are Humana Health Plans of Texas, PacifiCare of Texas, NYLCare
Health Plans of the Southwest and NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it decided to settle the lawsuit and accept state
regulatory oversight because it will help restore the public's
trust in managed care, said David Simon, the company's chief legal
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 960,000 Texans in its HMO and 2.4 million
members enrolled in all of its health-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like if we could achieve this landmark settlement with
Aetna, then Aetna's competitors would then know this would set the
standard for them as well,'' said Cornyn.

<HEADLINE> AP expose of Korean War killings wins investigative Pulitzer  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For nearly 50 years, the story of No Gun Ri went
unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Koreans who said American soldiers had killed hundreds of
civilians in the tiny hamlet in the early days of the Korean War
were rebuffed in Washington and Seoul, their story ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1998, newsman Sang-hun Choe of The Associated Press
reported the survivors' allegations and the U.S. military's denial
that the Army unit they blamed was anywhere near No Gun Ri.
Investigative researcher Randy Herschaft quickly found records
discrediting the denial, and AP launched a broader investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the project won the Pulitzer Prize, the news
cooperative's first in the investigative reporting category. Choe,
reporter Martha Mendoza, AP Special Correspondent Charles J. Hanley
and Herschaft spent months digging in U.S. military archives and
interviewing veterans and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   They produced a mountain of evidence to support the Koreans'
charges -- that U.S. soldiers machine-gunned hundreds of civilian
refugees at No Gun Ri in July 1950, including many cowering under a
railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The prize winners said winning the award was tempered by the
tragedy of what they discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great news,'' said Mendoza, 33, speaking by telephone
from Phoenix. But, she added, ''This was a story about people dying
and people's lives being ruined, so that's on my mind at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korean villagers said about 400 people were killed at No Gun
Ri, including 100 machine-gunned by U.S. warplanes. The AP cited a
dozen American veterans who confirmed the Koreans' charges,
although their recollections of the number killed varied.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very proud of the story and of the people whose talent
made it possible,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president and CEO.
''It was powerful and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, which led to stories uncovering other fatal
attacks, would make the Korean killings only the second known case
of large-scale slayings of noncombatants by U.S. ground troops in
the 20th century's major wars. The other was Vietnam's My Lai
massacre in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley, 52, who has reported for the AP from more than 70
countries, is on leave writing a book about No Gun Ri. He said he
and his collaborators were grateful their story was recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very proud,'' he said. ''But our celebration has to be
tempered by the nature of what we confirmed. The greater tributes
today really belong to the U.S. veterans who helped us ... and most
of all to the Korean survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was a national writer with the AP Special Assignment
Team in 1997 and '98 and is now correspondent in San Jose, Calif.
She was recently named a national investigative reporter.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Ahearn, AP vice president and executive editor, said
the prize was a tribute to the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, since it's the first Pulitzer for investigative reporting
won by AP, it's a tribute to the efforts of so many in the last
decade in particular to instill hard-edged journalism throughout
the ranks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herschaft, 39, who joined AP in 1985, said seeing the story win
was ''an exhilarating feeling.'' Choe, 36, speaking by phone from
Korea, said it was great news for the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank them for telling their stories to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the first AP story, a follow-up piece reported
that hundreds of other refugees were killed by U.S. forces in other
incidents in the war's first weeks, many when two bridges were
blown up as civilians streamed across.
</P>
<P>
   A later report said American jets repeatedly attacked groups of
Koreans in civilian clothes in 1950 and '51, in some cases killing
hundreds of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Korean survivors had been telling their story for years, but
their accounts were dismissed by officials in Washington and Seoul.
After the AP report was published and broadcast -- on the news
cooperative's print, television, radio and Internet services -- both
the Pentagon and South Korea opened investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors are seeking payment and an apology from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   Managing Editor Jonathan Wolman said the award highlighted AP's
investigative reporting and its ability to disseminate stories in
many media. The award was the 46th Pulitzer Prize the AP has won.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> IBF founder goes to trial, accused of taking bribes to rigrankings  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Never a sport with a savory reputation,
boxing can expect to have more of its dirty laundry aired over the
next three months during the racketeering trial of IBF founder
Robert W. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is expected to touch on some of the biggest names in
the sport, including promoter Don King and former heavyweight
champion George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and others in the International Boxing Federation are
accused of taking $338,000 in bribes to rig its boxer rankings,
which play a big role in determining who a boxer fights and how
much he earns.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that King was a prime beneficiary of Lee's
manipulations and call him and other promoters unindicted
coconspirators. Foreman and 22 other boxers caught up in schemes
outlined in a November indictment also face no charges.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement today, federal prosecutor Jose Sierra
said Lee dashed the dreams of young boxers by taking no less than
32 bribes to rig the IBF rankings.
</P>
<P>
   He told the jury the case is about men who make ''hundreds of
thousands of dollars, or millions, without ever throwing a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial was to start last week, but U.S. District Judge John
W. Bissell put it on hold for a hearing on defense objections to
undercover videotapes of three meetings between Lee and the FBI's
key informant, C. Douglas Beavers, the IBF's longtime rankings
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell was initially inclined to bar videos from two of the
meetings, agreeing with defense contentions that since Lee was to
sleep in the suite where those meetings took place, his Fourth
Amendment privacy rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors convinced him that Lee could not expect privacy
in the sitting area of a hotel suite, where the camera had been
concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell on Monday ruled that all of the videos were admissible.
He said the FBI took ''reasonable safeguards'' to avoid taping Lee
when Beavers was not in the parlor, and although ''there were
instances in which perfection was not achieved'' they were not
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's schemes began shortly after starting the East Orange-based
IBF in 1983, prosecutors say. As one of the world's three major
sanctioning groups, its rankings have been the basis for many
important fights.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell has barred Lee, 66, of Fanwood, from any participation
in the IBF, pending outcome of the trial. At the request of
prosecutors, Bissell in January appointed a monitor to oversee the
group.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes stem from meetings on rankings Lee had with Beavers, a
Virginia boxing commissioner, at the Holiday Inn in Portsmouth,
Va., on June 9, 1997; Dec. 18, 1997; and Oct. 21, 1998. The first
two were in a suite that included a bedroom; the third was in a
conference room that adjoined a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers wore a body wire during those meetings, but those
recordings failed, prosecutors said. He also recorded dozens of
telephone conversations with Lee, and is expected to testify for
several weeks. The U.S. attorney's office has granted Beavers
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, Gerald Krovatin, said the hotel rooms were ''the
functional equivalent of your home'' and asserted that prosecutors
should have gotten a judicial order before videotaping.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that since they already had a wired informant,
a judge would not have been likely to grant such a request.
</P>
<P>
   The audiotapes of phone calls with Beavers did not need such an
order because agents had the consent of one party -- Beavers -- so
Krovatin did not challenge those tapes.
</P>
<P>
   During the June 1997 meeting, Beavers and Lee discuss demanding
$25,000 to move heavyweight Joe Hipp up to the No. 6 contender
slot, according to a sworn statement from an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   In a tape from December 1997, Beavers is seen removing a package
of $5,000 from his ankle and giving it to Lee, according to the
statement. Investigators say the money is a payoff from a promoter.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, 1998, Beavers takes money from his ankle and gives
some to Lee and some to a former IBF official, Don Brennan, and Lee
puts an envelope on a table and says it is ''turkey'' from
''Fuzzy,'' the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Beavers said that ''turkey'' was a payoff and
''Fuzzy'' was King.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee was indicted with three other IBF officials, only
he and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of Scotch Plains, are on trial.
They face multiyear prison terms if convicted on conspiracy,
racketeering, fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Fernandez of Colombia, the South American
representative of the IBF, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 86, of Warsaw, Va., past president of the U.S. Boxing
Association, a group that became the IBF, was severed from the
trial due to ill health.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 91; Dow Up 24  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply in early trading
today as the volatile biotech sector declined in response to a
disappointing earnings report from Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was down 91.44 at 4,096.76.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 24.90 at 11,211.46, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 6.78 at 1,497.68.
</P>
<P>
   Two downbeat earnings reports derailed stocks today. Biogen, a
leading biotechnology company, reported first-quarter earnings of
41 cents a share, below Wall Street expectations of 43 cents.
Biogen cited a slowdown in demand for its multiple sclerosis
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen fell 10 15/16 to 54 1/16. Investors sold off other
biotech firms, and Genentech fell 5{ to 151.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector declined after Motorola said it
expects second-quarter and full-year 2000 earnings to fall short of
analysts' views.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which makes cellular phones and semiconductors, said
it expects profit margins to shrink in the coming quarters. Late
Monday, Motorola released first-quarter earnings that had more than
doubled from the first quarter of 1999 yhanks to robust demand for
cellular phones and strong growth in its chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola shares plummeted 23[ to 126~.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate earnings reporting season begins in earnest this
week, and while profit growth for most companies is expected to be
quite strong, investors in a nervous market are proving unwilling
to tolerate any disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 142.28 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.12 to
508.47.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.5 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 2.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Missing rafters presumed dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HANOVER, N.Y. (AP) -- Divers have recovered the body of one of
two whitewater rafters whose craft capsized Saturday on Cattaraugus
Creek, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of John Tenz, 57, of Blasdell was recovered about 11:30
p.m. Monday from an island in the middle of the creek. Tenz's body
had been spotted earlier in the day by a pair of bird watchers
walking along the creek in Hanover on the Cattaraugus Indian
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   State police said turbulent waters and the location of the
island, about 100 yards from the closest accessible point, made
recovery difficult. Tenz was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Still missing and presumed drowned was 48-year-old Daniel
Zelasko of Cheektowaga.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were among a group of eight on a whitewater rafting
trip Saturday when their 10-foot rubber raft hit rough waters at
the juncture of Cattaraugus and Zoar creeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people thrown from the capsized craft were rescued
when one grabbed on to a protruding tree limb and another managed
to stay afloat and hang on to the capsized raft.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said both Zelasko, a Buffalo high school teacher,
and Tenz, a volunteer firefighter, did not wear life jackets or
protective clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department used a helicopter and high-tech
infrared equipment in scouring the area over the weekend. The
searchers failed to find anything even though creek water levels
have dropped from 10 feet to under four feet.

   VALDOSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Critics of using statistical sampling for
the Census are objecting to a city program offering people $5 for
filling out their forms.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council approved the program, in effect this week, in
hopes of improving the response, but the payments may violate the
state constitution's ban on ''gratuities'' to induce economic
activity for the general welfare, said Matthew Glavin, president of
the Southeastern Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I strongly suggest before handing out any money that the city
get a formal opinion from the attorney general's office,'' Glavin
said in a letter Monday to Mayor Jimmy Rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Larry Hanson said the proposal was approved by
regional Census Bureau officials. He said a number of other cities
around the country have provided financial incentives, including
utility credits, for returned census forms.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin was a plaintiff in a case last year in which the Supreme
Court ruled the federal government cannot use sampled data from the
Census Bureau as a basis of reapportioning House seats. Census
officials favor using statistical sampling, contending it accounts
for populations that are traditionally undercounted, such as
inner-city residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it absolutely astonishing any city would go forward
with a program like this without review by legal counsel. It
suggests irresponsibility on the part of the City Council,'' Glavin
said of Valdosta's program.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson said the state constitution seems to be referring to
grants and payments to a private individual who, for example,
receives a large sum to bring an industry to town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of anybody, by any stretch of the imagination,
who would think of $5 as a grant,'' Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 residents took advantage of the $5 offer Monday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The southern Georgia city hopes to be named a Metropolitan
Statistical Area -- a designation that makes a city attractive to
new business and clears the way for more government grants.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be metro areas must have populations of 50,000 in the main
city or 100,000 in the main county. Surrounding counties can be
included if cities can prove dramatic commuting patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's 1998 population estimates showed Valdosta
with 41,390 residents and surrounding Lowndes County with 85,231.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants More Pipeline Safety  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants to boost
safety requirements for fuel pipeline operators, stiffen penalties
for violators and give the public more information about pipeline
safety and accidents.
</P>
<P>
   An initiative unveiled today by Vice President Al Gore also
would give states a larger role in regulating pipeline construction
and investigating pipeline accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''These pipelines are vital to our economy, but without adequate
safeguards, they can pose a serious threat to our families and to
our environment,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, submitted to Congress for consideration, would
create new requirements for pipeline operators in densely populated
regions and in environmentally sensitive areas. Operators would
have to conduct internal inspections or ''another equally
protective method'' to periodically determine the strength of
lines, and then act to address any flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Operators would need to share maps, manuals and emergency
response plans with local communities to better prepare for
emergencies. Information about pipeline accidents and
safety-related issues would be made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties would be increased. Companies that overpressurize a
pipeline, causing the line to fail, could face a fine of $500,000,
rather than the $25,000 fine under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Congress this year has been expected to reauthorize the Pipeline
Safety Act, a 1990 law that regulates the pipeline industry through
the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of additional pipeline safety requirements said
Monday that bills similar to the administration's proposal, by Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., are the best
hope for safety improvements in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers said passage will not be easy. Metcalf said he is
having a hard time getting colleagues interested in buried
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The phrase out of sight, out of mind, certainly applies when
pipelines are concerned,'' Metcalf cautioned allies at a conference
on pipeline safety.

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Rep. James Moran said today he has
nothing but affection for an 8-year-old boy who tried to steal his
car by claiming to have a gun and wishes he could adopt the
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with the boy, ''I just wanted to hug him,'' Moran,
D-Va., said on NBC's ''Today.''
</P>

   Police said Moran was picking up his two sons from an
after-school recreation center Friday when the boy approached him
in the parking lot, said he had a gun in his pocket and demanded
Moran's keys.
</P>
<P>
   Moran held out the keys but then grabbed the boy, police said.
The youngster had no weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said the boy told him he learned to act like a thief from
his stepfather. Then the boy's mother arrived and yelled
obscenities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the boy's parents and said he would love to adopt
the child, although he did not expect that to happen. He has a
daughter about the same age as the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he did not want the boy charged. Police had said they
would not press charges without the congressman's cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Promising Virus Drug Disappoints  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug that developers hoped would cure the common cold and
viral meningitis has showed disappointing results in three new
studies released today. The developer's stock price fell sharply on
the news.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, called pleconaril, failed to significantly shorten
bouts of illness when tested on adults with severe colds and on
adults and children with viral meningitis. However, it did appear
to reduce the severity of people's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is being developed by ViroPharma in Exon, Pa., and is
intended to block a broad family of viruses, known as the
picornoaviruses. This family includes such common viral enemies as
the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses.
</P>
<P>
   Early studies suggested the drug could reduce the duration of a
bout of viral meningitis by about two days and a bad cold by about
three. However, the latest studies did not produce clear-cut
evidence of this.
</P>
<P>
   The results were released in a statement from ViroPharma. The
company's stock price fell $45 this morning from Tuesday's closing
price of $71.75.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest common cold study, runny nose and other symptoms
completely cleared up by 7.7 days among pleconaril users, compared
with 9.4 days in those getting dummy pills. The difference was not
statistically meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company noted that objective measures of cold
severity, such as the number of facial tissues used, were
significantly better in pleconaril users.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, company officials said they hoped to have a pleconaril
pill for cold treatment on the market in 2001. Today, Claude Nash,
the company's chief executive, said in a statement that ViroPharma
will sponsor more large studies in cold victims this year, and its
timeline for seeking approval of the drug is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Headaches are the chief symptom of viral meningitis. The company
said that in the other two new studies, the drug did not
significantly improve the time for headaches to go away in either
adults or children.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company said the drug did seem to help adults with
the most severe cases. The duration of their headaches declined
from 10 days to seven.
</P>
<P>
   The company had hoped to submit the drug to the Food and Drug
Administration this spring for approval in treating viral
meningitis but said it may have to revise its plans.

cellular phones and strong growth in its chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola shares plummeted 25 1/16 to 124 15/16. Rival Texas
Instruments fell 8{ to 147~ and chip-industry leader Intel lost 2\
to 128~.

<P>
   ''There's some concern that what's hurting Motorola could affect
the rest of the techs,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst
at Cantor Fitzgerald.

<P>
   The corporate earnings reporting season begins in earnest this
week, and while profit growth for most companies is expected to be
quite strong, investors in a nervous market are proving unwilling
to tolerate any disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, Wall Street strategists have been reminding
investors that many old-line companies in the energy, financial and

<HEADLINE> Report Charts Student Progress  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A record number of children with disabilities
are being educated in classrooms alongside their nondisabled peers,
often without teachers specially qualified to instruct them, the
Education Department said today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, 46 percent of the nation's 5.9 million special
education students spent most of their time in a regular classroom,
up slightly from the previous year's 45.9 percent, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The days of turning away the students with disabilities at the
schoolhouse door have ended,'' said Judith Heumann, assistant
secretary of the office of special education and rehabilitative
service. She said the record is a victory for disabled children's
inclusion in the nation's educational system, a goal of federal
education laws and many advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report to Congress also detailed some trouble spots:
Besides a shortage of teachers for students who need extra help,
there is a lack of state-provided services for youth in prison,
special-education preschoolers and blind children.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's 330,000 special education teachers, once
isolated in small classrooms, now work daily with regular classroom
teachers, but 8 percent of the special-education teaching force is
improperly certified to work with disabled students, the report
said. Among general teachers, preparedness is worse: Four out of
five teachers with special education students in their classes feel
ill-prepared to teach them, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers must be increasingly prepared to meet all children's
needs,'' said Paula Gardner, an associate professor at California
State University, Sacramento, which combines special
education-regular education training. Graduates usually go on to
teach in special education classrooms, but they are trained to
teach special education students in regular classes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''District administrations are seeing the value of this as a way
of educating future teachers,'' she said. ''We can't graduate them
fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1975 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,
states receive money to help end discrimination against disabled
children, who previously were often put in institutions or separate
programs that provided little or no learning. The law requires that
disabled children be schooled with other students whenever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The report considered children as included in a regular
classroom atmosphere if they spent at least 80 percent of their
time in regular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It also said more young prisoners are qualifying for special
education, but that jailed youth -- many with learning disabilities
or emotional disturbances -- are less likely to be helped if they
are treated as adults.
</P>
<P>
   All schools and 92 percent of juvenile halls and detention
centers instruct special-needs schoolchildren, the report said, yet
just a third of states report providing the same services in adult
prisons. A 1997 change in the special education law allows adult
prisons to limit special education services if they conflict with
security.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said:
</P>
<P>
   --The youngest special education children -- those age 2 and below
-- must receive services at home. Toddlers 3 to 5 years old have
programs they can attend at some schools.
</P>
<P>
   --Fewer college instructors are preparing teaching candidates to
work with blind students.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gas Tax Rollback Before Congress  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today debated whether to
temporarily roll back federal gas taxes, part of a Republican
effort to shine a spotlight for voters on GOP tax priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-led Congress traditionally uses the week before the
annual income tax filing deadline for tax votes, anti-tax rallies
and committee hearings on issues both substantive and symbolic.
This year's deadline is midnight April 17, because April 15 is a
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   First up was the Senate vote today on a bill sponsored by
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to roll back 4.3 cents of the
federal gas tax for the rest of the year and suspend the entire
18.4-cent tax if average prices exceed $2 a gallon. Lott needed 60
votes to end debate on the bill and move toward final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Republican backers portrayed the measure as a modest but
important response to higher gas prices, which are predicted to
fall as international oil production increases, although not
significantly before the summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are we going to do for Memorial Day? What will we do for
the Fourth of July?'' asked Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. ''The
crunch is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the rollback, including most Democrats and some
Republicans, said the relief would amount to little for the average
motorist, even if it were passed along by the oil companies. And it
would do nothing to improve U.S. oil production or the search for
energy alternatives and could jeopardize $6 billion a year for
transportation projects, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, there's anger at the pump. But there's also anger behind
the wheel,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. ''We cannot have
instability in the highway modernization program.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also serves a political purpose as a way to
criticize Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee, who cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate in
1993 to approve the 4.3-cent tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're a blue-collar worker, a few dollars more a week in
the price of gas does make a difference,'' Lott said Monday.
''Maybe prices will come down and maybe stay down. But I'm
concerned they could go back up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nonbinding test vote last week, 66 senators voted against
Lott's rollback. Lott insists the transportation money would be
replaced from the budget surplus, but Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota said the bill was unlikely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, Daschle said, has ''indicated that he's not really looking
for a victory. He just wanted to have a debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later today, the House was expected easily to pass bipartisan
legislation intended to improve protection of tax information
against computer hackers, give taxpayers several new rights in
dealings with the Internal Revenue Service and enact new breaks on
IRS penalties and interest.
</P>
<P>
   Other tax highlights on tap in Congress this week:
</P>
<P>
   --Votes in the Senate on legislation cutting income taxes by $248
billion over 10 years for millions of married couples, including
the 25 million who now pay more than they would if single. The bill
also would ensure that taxpayers could claim personal credits such
as the $500-a-child tax credit permanently without running up
against the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   --Symbolic House votes on a measure that would scrap the income
tax after five years and a proposed constitutional amendment
requiring a two-thirds vote of Congress to enact most tax
increases. Another planned vote would put the House on record
against the package of tax increases in President Clinton's fiscal
2001 budget, including a 25-cent cigarette tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   --Three days of hearings by the House Ways and Means Committee on
alternatives to the income tax, including a flat tax and a national
sales tax. The panel's chairman, Texas Republican Bill Archer, has
long advocated scrapping the income tax but is retiring this year
without making the change.
</P>
<P>
   --Consideration of the Senate Commerce Committee of a bill to
extend by five years a moratorium on new Internet taxes, sponsored
by the panel's chairman, Arizona Republican John McCain. A federal
commission chaired by Gov. Jim Glimmer, R-Va., also will formally
present its majority report that recommends the extension as well
as repeal of the 3 percent telephone tax and a permanent ban on
Internet access taxes.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 55.02; Dow Up 119.76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell today as the volatile
biotech sector declined in response to a disappointing earnings
report from Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 55.02 at 4,133.18. The index had bounced back from an earlier
decline of 178 points, which wiped out the Nasdaq's gain for the
year. After weeks of tumultuous selling, the Nasdaq is now up only
during 2000 and is 18 percent below its peak of 5,048.62, which it
reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 119.76 at 11,306.32, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 3.27 at 1,507.73.
</P>
<P>
   Two downbeat earnings reports bothered stocks today. Biogen, a
leading biotechnology company, reported first-quarter earnings of
41 cents a share, below Wall Street expectations of 43 cents.
Biogen cited a slowdown in demand for its multiple sclerosis
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen fell 10~ to 54[. Investors sold off other biotech firms,
with Genentech tumbling 16{ to 140.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector declined after Motorola said it
expects second-quarter and full-year 2000 earnings to fall short of
analysts' views.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which makes cellular phones and semiconductors, said
it expects profit margins to shrink in the coming quarters. Late
Monday, Motorola released first-quarter earnings that had more than
doubled from the first quarter of 1999 due to robust demand for
cellular phones and strong growth in its chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola shares plummeted 24 7/16 to 125 9/16. Rival Texas
Instruments fell 3 15/16 to 152 7/16 and chip-industry leader Intel
lost 2 to 128|.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some concern that what's hurting Motorola could affect

ahead by a 3-to-1 margin.

<HEADLINE> New York's top court upholds state's Internet porn law  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's highest court today unanimously
upheld the constitutionality of a law designed to prevent adults
from using the Internet to induce or invite minors into having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Foley, a 51-year-old radio engineer from Grand Island who
was one of the first people convicted under the 1996 state law, had
argued it was overbroad, vague and unconstitutional because it
restricted free speech and interstate trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals disagreed in today's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The law ''is a pre-emptive strike against sexual abuse of
children,'' wrote Judge Richard Wesley for the seven-member court.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he wrote, ''We are hard pressed to ascertain any
legitimate commerce that is derived from the intentional
transmission of sexually graphic images to minors for the purpose
of luring them into sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The law took effect Nov. 1, 1996 and state police conducted a
sting operation beginning Oct. 28 and continuing through November
during which an officer posed as a 15-year-old Utica girl named
''Aimee.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley began a sexual conversation with the officer in a chat
room called ''Kids of Family Sex.'' Foley then sent the officer
several pictures of preteen girls engaged in sexual acts with men.
He also told ''Aimee'' that he wanted to have sex with her and the
two made preliminary plans to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was arrested during his fifth and final chat with
''Aimee'' on Nov. 22, when police executed a search warrant and
found him typing on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of two counts each of attempting to disseminate
indecent materials to minors and promoting a sexual performance by
a child and sentenced to two to six years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Plan Procurement Exchange  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A group of 14 of the largest oil and petrochemical
companies plan to launch an electronic exchange to link buyers and
suppliers of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 companies spend more than $125 billion each year on
procurement, they said in a joint announcement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other industries, including transportation, have recently
announced similar procurement exchanges, designed to improve
efficiency and supply-chain management.
</P>
<P>
   An independent company would be created to own and operate the
exchange. The founding oil companies said they would own at least
three-fourths of the exchange operator but would eventually prepare
to sell its stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The founding members of the exchange would be Royal Dutch-Shell
Group of Cos., BP Amoco PLC, Conoco Inc., The Dow Chemical Co.,
Equilon Enterprises LLC, Mitsubishi Corp., Motiva Enterprises LLC,
Occidental Petroleum Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., Repsol YPF,
Statoil SA, Tosco Corp., TotalFinaElf and Unocal Corp..
</P>
<P>
   The companies said about 40 percent of their procurement
spending occurs in North and South America, another 40 percent in
Europe and Africa, and about 20 percent in Asia Pacific and the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Worker Training Is Vital  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today that even with the strong economy and low unemployment, rapid
technological changes mean American businesses and workers will
continue to face insecurities unless there are improvements in job
training.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapidity of innovation and the unpredictability of the
directions it may take imply a need for considerable investment in
human capital,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan spoke at an all-day conference on job skills, hosted
by the Labor Department on the campus of Howard University, a
historically black college in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank chairman said fears that workers would be
displaced by new technology have proven largely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather, the recent period of technological innovation has
created a vibrant economy in which opportunities for new jobs and
businesses have blossomed,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it has been difficult to predict what kind of labor
needs new discoveries will create, he added. Greenspan noted that
government employment projections in the early 1980s overestimated
the need for computer operators and data-entry workers, not
anticipating that computers would become so easy to use that these
specialized job categories would fade.
</P>
<P>
   For workers, ''a rapidly evolving work environment in which the
skill demands of their jobs are changing can lead to very real
anxiety and insecurity about losing their jobs,'' said Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses should not expect academic institutions alone to
create the pool of skilled workers they will need, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to foster a flexible education system -- one that
integrates work and training and that serves the needs both of
experienced workers at different stages in their careers and of
students embarking on their initial course of study,'' Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Business partnerships with community colleges and public
agencies, ''distance learning'' over the Internet and corporate
universities will play an increasingly important role, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's job skills conference also included panel and
round-table discussions among business, labor and academic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment the lowest in three decades, U.S. jobs are
plentiful and some companies report having trouble finding
qualified workers to fill positions. However, many unskilled
workers are still encountering barriers to finding jobs with good
wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have often said that we do not have a worker shortage in
this country, but a skills shortage,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Among topics discussed at the conference: innovative strategies
for recruiting and training workers and overcoming other hiring
obstacles, such as lack of transportation and child care.

<HEADLINE> 'Corner' Focuses on Baltimore Family  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GAMBRELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Gary McCullough pushed carts of copper pipes
and aluminum screen doors that were stripped from abandoned houses
to the United Iron and Metal Company, where he got a few dollars
for his next heroin fix.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the $50,000-a-year job he once held, from
the two Mercedes and the home he once owned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Corner,'' HBO's six-part mini-series that will air Sundays
at 10 p.m. EDT beginning April 16, chronicles the story of
McCullough, his ex-wife Fran Boyd, and their son DeAndre McCullough
as they became caught in the grip of drug addiction and street
corner sales.
</P>
<P>
   The project is based on the David Simon and Edward Burns book,
''The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner City Neighborhood,'' a
gritty, critically acclaimed view of how drug addicts live.
</P>
<P>
   Fran and Gary were a classic middle-class couple. Gary owned
investment properties and was a partner in a development and
drafting company. Fran worked for the phone company. They
considered moving to the Baltimore suburbs. Then, as Fran was
grieving at her sister's wake, a family member offered her some
drugs. That's when their lives began spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gary's Blues,'' the first segment of the series, opens with
Gary and a girlfriend shooting heroin in a boarded-up flophouse.
They spend their days shuffling from one side of the street to the
other in a desperate search for quick cash for their next fix, or
for a generous soul willing to give up a stash for free.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, the force behind the defunct ''Homicide: Life on the
Street,'' and Burns, a former Baltimore police officer, spent six
days a week in 1993 on a west Baltimore corner observing the drug
culture and its effects on the McCullough family.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was filmed in west Baltimore row houses, crack houses,
and on corners a few blocks from where the story actually unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Charles ''Roc'' Dutton, who won a Golden Globe for his
performance in August Wilson's ''The Piano Lesson,'' was chosen as
the director for his introspectiveness and his Baltimore roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a white director, some of the nuances would be lost,''
said Simon, who served as co-producer with David Mills (''ER,''
''NYPD Blue'') and Robert Colesberry (''Mississippi Burning'').
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an actor's actor,'' Simon said. ''He grew up in East
Baltimore. We knew if we could get him working on performances, we
knew it would be something electric.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast members agreed. Comedian T.K. Carter (''A Rage in
Harlem''), who portrays Gary, said Dutton did not want the typical
movie caricature of a drug addict, but rather a portrait of a
person who has fallen into a situation he can't escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Corner'' is important, Dutton said, because viewers should
understand that drug addiction is a disease that needs to be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see it as a health problem,'' Dutton said. ''I've had a lot
of family and friends afflicted with this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dutton, who starred in the Fox comedy series ''Roc,'' had to
be persuaded to take on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was first approached, I hadn't read the book. I thought
it was another urban documentary -- written badly and acted badly,''
said Dutton. ''But I was impressed with the script and the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton says the mini-series tells the story of a neighborhood
from the point of view of the addict.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members spent time with their real-life counterparts to
better understand their journey.
</P>
<P>
   When actress Khandi Alexander (''ER'') met with Fran Boyd to
talk about the role or just to hang out, she never asked Boyd about
her choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure she had reasons for some of the things she had to
do, but I never asked her about them. It wasn't my place,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Although self-destructive, Fran had boundaries when it came to
her 15-year-old dropout son, who mastered the intricacies of
peddling drugs. She would not hold DeAndre's drugs, or hide his
guns, or teach him how to cut dope or stretch a package for higher
profit.
</P>
<P>
   She eventually became a drug counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people mentioned in the book appear in the film,
Simon said. He cast the real DeAndre, who has not made the same
transformation as his mother, as a police officer arresting his
screen self, played by Sean Nelson (''The Wood'').
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of it was amusing, but it was also my way of making a
point to DeAndre,'' Simon said. ''I wanted to make a point.''

black-humored comedy starring Woody Allen, has been acquired by
Cinemax, the cable network announced. It will premiere May 26 as

Sutherland and Sharon Stone. It was shot by three-time Academy
Award-winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Md. Gun Bill-Signing  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton said today Congress does
not have to look far for a model for gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton traveled the short distance to Maryland's state Capitol
to preside as Gov. Parris Glendening signed a bill making Maryland
the first state to require built-in locks on handguns while
imposing other stringent gun-control rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress should follow Maryland's lead,'' Clinton said to
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Annapolis, the closest state capital to Washington, has often
been in the forefront on gun control, Clinton said. And the state,
with large rural areas that are traditionally leery of new gun
laws, has demonstrated the power of public will to reduce gun
violence, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the U.S. Congress is paying attention to this
event today, because every child in America deserves the same
protection you have given Maryland children, and only Congress can
do that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Glendening encouraged the National Rifle
Association to join in what Clinton calls ''commonsense gun
legislation,'' including trigger locks and other safety devices the
White House says will reduce crimes and accidental shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland law was hard-fought, Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents only a beginning -- a beginning of an era when
the voice of the people and their desire to end gun violence is no
longer undercut by the voice of the gun lobby,'' the governor said.
''Maryland has shown it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance in Annapolis also kicks off his
outside-Washington bid to push Congress to pass his stalled
gun-safety proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't be the only signing ceremony going on this
year. We should have one,'' said White House legislative adviser
Joel Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is taking a similar message Wednesday to Colorado, to
help push a ballot initiative asking voters to approve a
requirement that all gun-show gun sales, including those by
unlicensed dealers, be subject to background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the White House had hoped Congress would pass gun
legislation before April 20, the one-year anniversary of the
Columbine High School massacre. Now, aides have resigned themselves
to missing that deadline and are aiming for passage before year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland bill, passed April 3, requires built-in locks on
new handguns sold as of Jan. 1, 2003, and external locks on all
handguns sold in the state as of Oct. 1 of this year. It sets a
mandatory minimum sentence of five years for illegal firearms
possession by felons convicted of a violent or drug crime, and bars
those convicted of a violent crime as a juvenile from possessing a
handgun until age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Also, police agencies would not be able to sell confiscated
guns, gun makers would have to provide a ballistic fingerprint of
shell casings of every new gun, and gun buyers would have to pass a
two-hour safety course.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was moving in its own direction today: a House vote on
Project Exile, a program that sends $100 million in block grants to
states that impose mandatory sentences for gun crimes. The
legislation emerged as a rallying point for critics of Clinton's
gun proposals, who say his administration should be focused more on
the type of enforcement Project Exile represents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the Clinton-Gore administration refuses to prosecute,
it's time Congress takes it upon itself to start protecting
Americans from gun violence,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has an opportunity to accomplish a rare feat, and I
hope that it's a unanimous vote for what most Americans want, and
that is tough enforcement,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ''Our
members are looking forward to a great vote in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House disputed the lax enforcement argument, calling
the Project Exile vote ''purely political'' and saying Congress has
sat on Clinton's $280 million proposal to hire 1,000 new gun
prosecutors and 500 new Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents.
</P>
<P>
   Aides did not dismiss Project Exile out of hand, saying only
that it should not be used to supplant further funding of
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's anything in there we find objectionable
or offensive. It's just too little,'' Johnson said. ''We shouldn't
be talking about how little we can get away with doing.''

Review of Lincoln Center Presentation   
An AP Arts and Entertainment Review   
By MARY CAMPBELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The surprise at ''The World of Shirley Horn''
concert in Alice Tully Hall is that Horn shown brighter singing
with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra than with her own trio.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz at Lincoln Center chose to showcase the jazz diva, who
released her first record album in 1960, in a concert Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half she played piano and sang, with her excellent
drummer Steve Williams and self-effacing bassist Charles Ables.
</P>
<P>
   Her most effective mood was conveyed in a tremulous voice and
pianism, in ''A Time for Love'' and ''Where Do You Start?''. This
would be more effective in an intimate club than a concert hall;
it's a little wispy for a concert hall. The brightest spot in the
first half was Wynton Marsalis joining on trumpet on ''I've Got the
World on a String.''
</P>
<P>
   After the orchestra's first two numbers, Cole Porter's ''All
Through the Night,'' arranged by Wycliffe Gordon to feature himself
on tuba, and Benny Carter's ''Miss Missouri,'' which has enough
going on to be interesting and is melodic enough to be comfortable,
Horn came on to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Farber conducted his own arrangements for Horn and big
band. She was featured as the jewel in a setting in which each
instrumentalist also was a gem. In orchestral passages, the band
has seldom sounded this good. When Horn's singing came in, their
virtuosity pulled back and all attention was focused on her.
</P>
<P>
   Farber had arranged some of her favorite songs. Horn's singing
is straightforward, without gimmicks. She doesn't scat but she
definitely swings, singing jazz. Her last four numbers were ''I Got
Plenty of Nuttin','' ''Wild Is Love,'' ''Basin Street Blues'' and a
sensitive ''Just in Time.'' The audience could happily have stayed
for many, many more.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco To Resolve Royalties Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- BP Amoco has agreed to pay $32 million to
settle court and administrative claims that it underpaid royalties
on oil it took from leased federal and Indian land since 1988, the
Justice Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement brings to more than $205 million the government
has recovered from five oil companies as a result of a private
whistleblower lawsuit originally filed under the False Claims Act.
More cases are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to press forward with the prosecution of this
False Claims Act lawsuit against other companies that have
underpaid their royalty obligations,'' said Mike Bradford, U.S.
attorney for the eastern district of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He commended the companies which have already settled for
avoiding further litigation and noted that the BP Amoco settlement
''brings us one step closer to restoring to the taxpayers and
Indian tribes of the United States the money due for production of
oil on public lands.''
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco settlement also was signed by several Indian
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Two private whistleblowers, J. Benjamin Johnson Jr. and John
Martinek, had filed the original complaint in U.S. District Court
in Lufkin, Texas, against Amoco Corp. and British Petroleum Co.,
which merged in 1998 to form BP Amoco. Under the False Claims Act,
they will share more than $5.4 million of the BP Amoco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Justice Department joined lawsuits accusing
Exxon-Mobil, Shell Oil Co., and Burlington Resources Inc., of
intentionally underpaying royalties on oil and gas they took from
leased federal and Indian land.
</P>
<P>
   Previously the government reached settlements with Mobil Oil,
for $45 million; Oxy USA, Inc., for $7.3 million; Chevron, for $95
million; and Conoco, for $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Private oil and gas companies obtain mineral leases from the
Interior Department giving them the right to extract oil and gas
from federal and Indian land in return for paying royalties. The
False Claims Act allows the government to collect three times the
account of unpaid royalties plus $5,000 to $10,000 for each
underpayment. The act allows private whistleblowers to sue over
these underpayments and to receive a portion, based on the value of
their legal work, of whatever the government recovers.

<HEADLINE> Michael Ross says he accepts death sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Serial killer Michael Ross accepts his
latest death sentence and will oppose more drawn-out appeals to
stop his execution, he said in an interview for The Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 16 years,'' Ross said in a telephone interview from
death row. ''You know, it's got to end. I can't let this go another
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court jury last week recommended six death sentences
for Ross, 40, in the killing of four teen-age girls in rural New
London County during the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing has not been scheduled. On Thursday, Judge Thomas P.
Miano will hear post-verdict defense motions to grant Ross a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Ross already is serving two life sentences for the killings of
two other young women in Windham County.
</P>
<P>
   Ross originally was convicted of the New London killings and
sentenced to death in 1987. But in 1994, the state Supreme Court
ordered a new penalty hearing, ruling the prosecution had withheld
some psychiatric evidence from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview conducted for The Day by Martha Elliott, a
free-lance writer who is working on a book about the case, Ross
said he will not allow his lawyers to file any non-mandatory
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will do everything in my power to accept this verdict of the
jury and to see that there is not a Ross Three,'' he said. ''Of
course, no one will believe that. They'll say it's just
manipulation again.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ross is sentenced, there will be an automatic appeal to
the state Supreme Court. The appeal can be limited to sentence
review or can be broader and include allegations of error and
mistakes made during the death-penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he is looking for a new attorney because he does not
trust the state's public defenders to represent him at that
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll file an appeal of error over my objections,'' he said.
''I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he was disappointed in the jury's verdict, especially
after their deliberations took nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were concerned with the issues of mitigation,
but -- so I was a little surprised,'' he said. ''But when I sat down
and reflected it was like, you know, hey, I sort of respected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross also praised his lawyers, Public Defenders Karen Goodrow
and Barry Butler, for their efforts, and thanked the prosecutor,
New London State's Attorney Kevin T. Kane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he did a very good and gentlemanly job,'' Ross said.
''I appreciate the sensitivity he showed to the families by not
sensationalizing the aggravation, and I think he should be
commended for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross also told The Day that it was difficult each day of the
hearing to face the mother of one of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard, and in fact at some points during the trial I was
unable to look at her,'' he said. ''I am very ashamed of my actions
and what I did to her daughter. I just wish there was something I
could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents of some of Ross' victims said after last week's verdict
that they hope his execution is not delayed much longer.

<HEADLINE> Strike Shuts Finnish Paper Industry  </HEADLINE>
By MATTI HUUHTANEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finland's pulp and paper industry
ground to a halt Tuesday when 30,000 workers went on strike after
all-night contract talks with employers broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement about wages and working hours was so great that the
government-appointed mediator, Juhani Salonius, said he was unable
to offer a compromise proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish Paper Workers Union demanded a two-year labor
agreement with wage hikes of 4.6 percent during this year and 4.1
percent in 2001. It also wanted a decrease in working hours
amounting to seven days per year.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish Forest Industries Federation offered a three-year
agreement with a 3.1 percent raise this year, and rejected any
shortening of working hours.
</P>
<P>
   No timetable for a resumption of talks was given.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time a strike closed down the whole pulp
industry in Europe's third-largest paper producer behind Germany
and Sweden. Industry estimates are that it will cost an estimated
$32 million per day in lost export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on Monday began to shut down machines at plants in
anticipation of the strike that began Tuesday afternoon and
involves some 100 machines at 30 plants.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was unlikely to affect consumers immediately as
stockpiles of newsprint and other paper were expected to last
several weeks. But the chemicals industry was likely to suffer as
demand stalls for chemicals used in paper and pulp production.
Also, the transport sector would be affected when cargos of raw
materials and paper cease.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Ends Doctor Incentive System  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Health insurer Aetna U.S. Healthcare settled a
lawsuit with Texas today, promising to give doctors more power over
medical treatments and removing financial incentives for doctors to
limit care. Officials said they hoped the deal would become a
national precedent, helping settle other suits around the country
against managed care companies alleging that they harm patients in
the name of profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement puts medical decisions precisely where they
belong, and that is in the hands of patients and their
physicians,'' Texas Attorney General John Cornyn said at a news
conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brown, Aetna regional manager, said the agreement would not
force the HMO to increase costs. ''We believe we can do this
without significantly adding to the cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's predecessor, Dan Morales, sued Aetna and five other
HMOs two years ago, accusing them of illegally compensating doctors
who limited patients' medical care and penalizing those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, under the settlement, is prohibited from fining doctors
who exceed medical budgets or giving them bonuses for staying
within limits. The state's largest HMO also will have to report if
doctors' groups in its plan do give such financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this agreement sets the industry standard, not just
to our state borders but to a national level,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll get all over the country real fast,'' said Rocky Wilcox,
chief counsel of the Texas Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement contains no finding of fault, fines or penalties.
And Aetna denies any wrongdoing in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of what is embodied in the agreement is not new business
practices,'' Arthur Leibowitz, Aetna's chief medical officer, said.
''This is partially the attorney general's desire to solicit other
plans to fit within this business model.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement didn't please everyone. A consumer group, Texans
for Public Justice, said the deal ''appears to be a sweetheart
agreement for the state's biggest HMO,'' because it doesn't impose
any penalties on Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   If the other HMOs named in the lawsuit do not agree to the same
terms, the attorney general said, he will bring them to trial. The
HMOs are Humana Health Plans of Texas, PacifiCare of Texas, NYLCare
Health Plans of the Southwest and NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it decided to settle the lawsuit and accept state
regulatory oversight because it will help restore the public's
trust in managed care, said David Simon, the company's chief legal
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 960,000 Texans in its HMO and 2.4 million
members enrolled in all of its health-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like if we could achieve this landmark settlement with
Aetna, then Aetna's competitors would then know this would set the
standard for them as well,'' Cornyn said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 143.02; Nasdaq Down 59.85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell today as the volatile
biotech sector declined in response to a disappointing earnings
report from Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 59.85 at 4,128.35, having bounced back from an earlier
decline of 178 points that wiped out the Nasdaq's gain for the
year. After weeks of tumultuous selling, the Nasdaq is now up only
slightly during 2000 and is 18 percent below its peak of 5,048.62,
which it reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 143.02 at 11,329.58, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.27 at 1,505.73.
</P>
<P>
   Two downbeat earnings reports derailed stocks today. Biogen, a
leading biotechnology company, reported first-quarter earnings of
41 cents a share, below Wall Street expectations of 43 cents.
Biogen cited a slowdown in demand for its multiple sclerosis
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen fell 12{ to 52{. Investors sold off other biotech firms,
with Genentech tumbling 13{ to 143.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector declined after Motorola said it
expects second-quarter and full-year 2000 earnings to fall short of
analysts' views.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which makes cellular phones and semiconductors, said
it expects profit margins to shrink in the coming quarters. Late
Monday, Motorola released first-quarter earnings that had more than
doubled from the first quarter of 1999 due to robust demand for
cellular phones and strong growth in its chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola shares plummeted 25 1/16 to 124 15/16. Rival Texas
Instruments fell 2| to 153} and Advanced Micro Devices fell 3 11/16
to 70 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some concern that what's hurting Motorola could affect
the rest of the techs,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst
at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   But by midday, investors began returning to technology stocks in
search of issues that have been driven down to more affordable
levels, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 1 15/16 to 133 1/16 and Applied Materials rose 3
25/64 to 106 49/64.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate earnings reporting season begins in earnest this
week, and while profit growth for most companies is expected to be
quite strong, investors in a nervous market are proving unwilling
to tolerate any disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, Wall Street strategists have been reminding
investors that many old-line companies in the energy, financial and
consumer sectors may reward investors seeking stable, growing
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're definitely seeing continued rotation into more
reasonably priced stocks, many of which will also show strong
earnings,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 3| to 163 1/16 and 3M rose 3{ to 96\.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 678.21 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners were
ahead by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.53 to 516.13.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Visa Waiver Program  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tourists and business people from 29 foreign
countries that allow Americans visa-free entry will not need
visitors' visas in the United States under legislation passed
Tuesday by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed by voice vote, made permanent a pilot program
under way since 1986 among the United States and the other
countries, mostly European. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service says 17 million travelers used the program in 1998, and the
travel and tourism industry has actively sought to make the program
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Participating countries must extend visa-free entry privileges
to American citizens, have a nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of less
than 3 percent and commit to fully developing a machine-readable
passport by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of
the Judiciary immigration subcommittee, also would tighten controls
over visitors by requiring the INS to develop a fully automated
system for tracking the entry and departure of visa waiver
travelers entering by air or sea.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most industrialized nations, the United States does not
keep extensive records of departures, which makes more difficult
identification of foreign travelers who overstay their visits.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said it supports a permanent visa
waiver program but has cautioned that the time frame for automating
databases might be overly ambitious. The Senate still must act on
the bill before it goes to President Clinton for signature.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee endorsed the bill

   DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- ''I Love Lucy'' fans will soon be able to
buy sweet reminders of the famed episode in which Lucille Ball gets
a new job at a chocolate factory and can't quite keep up with the
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Durango-based Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory is introducing a
line of candies next month called Lucy's Chocolate Factory Candy.
</P>
<P>
   It's based on the episode in which Ball tries to box chocolates
on an assembly line but can't keep up, so she shoves the candy in
her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal announced Monday with Rocky Mountain, the
estates of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, and CBS Worldwide Inc. were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''To put Lucy together with chocolates and create a lasting

   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas says
he doesn't socialize with fellow members of the court, spending

<HEADLINE> Mass. Hospital Sells Used Scrubs  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- Intent on confining cuts to the operating
room, Holyoke Hospital will sell you the very shirt off its
doctors' backs.
</P>
<P>
   The little hospital is selling its used -- but sanitized -- scrubs
as leisure wear to those who crave comfort or more surgical swank
than they can soak up just by watching ''E.R.'' on television.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Buckley, the hospital's vice president of marketing,
concedes that some have reacted with squeamishness at the thought
of wearing pajamas that once assisted in setting a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley acknowledged that some people say, ''Oh, my God, that's
so disgusting, because they had blood on them!''
</P>
<P>
   ''But that's the cool part,'' she added. ''Don't you get it?''
</P>
<P>
   Scrubs, the loose V-neck tops and drawstring pants worn by
medical personnel, have long packed an appeal outside the
profession. New scrubs, often in bright colors and floral patterns,
are sold by hospital gift shops, uniform stores in shopping malls,
and even department stores. They are worn for comfort during home
and yard projects, or even double as pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ''Chicago Hopes'' and ''E.R.s'' potentially could have
made it a little more cool than it had been,'' said Craig
Freebersyser, a manager at scrub manufacturer Angelica Image
Apparel in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at several national hospital associations said it
is very unusual to resell scrubs actually worn in surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the waste from hospitals you wouldn't want to sell,''
said Steve Goetz, director of the Health Care Resource Management
Society in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-bed independent hospital in Holyoke began selling its
scrubs last fall to staff who wanted comfortable togs to wear away
from work. Earlier this year, it launched a Web site dedicated to
selling its surgical scrubs to ordinary consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The unisex scrubs come in a range of sizes, blue or green, and
cost $24.95 for either shirt or pants. They are more expensive than
some new scrubs sold elsewhere, but those have ''never seen real
action,'' said Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Once worn in surgery by a doctor, nurse or technician, the
scrubs are laundered at a high temperature with chlorine bleach to
clean and disinfect, just as when they are reissued to medical
staff. They are sent to an outside shop where the trademarked
Realscrubs logo is applied with silk screen.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, which skirted layoffs but reduced hours of some
personnel last summer, hopes Realscrubs will supply a continuing
source of cash to help cover expenses. Buckley says some other
hospitals have asked about licensing a similar business at their
sites.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Returns to Capitol After Rehab  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Illinois Rep. Phil Crane has returned to his
congressional duties after completing a 21-day treatment program
for alcoholism, receiving warm applause from colleagues on the
House floor Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Crane, the most senior House Republican and a former
presidential candidate, declared he is back and ''in good health.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel better, mentally and physically,'' said Crane, a
16-term congressman from Chicago's northwest suburbs. ''I look
forward to the hard work. ... This has been a deeply humbling
experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane returned to the House in time for a series of votes Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old conservative announced last month he was taking
a leave of absence to enter a treatment program in Maryland. At the
time, he said his growing dependance on alcohol ''has taken a toll
on my health and other aspects of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believed the death of his daughter, Rachel, more than a
year ago contributed to his decline.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's wife, Arlene, said her husband's decision to undergo
treatment was made in large part to help his bid to become chairman
of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Crane now holds the second-ranking slot on the tax-writing
committee and heads its trade subcommittee. His seniority places
him in line to take over the panel next year after the current
chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, retires. But he faces a stiff
challenge from Rep. Bill Thomas of California, the third-ranking
Republican and chairman of its health subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Crane has fervently promoted freer trade and is a longtime
supporter of a flat tax. In recent months, Crane has spent more
time raising money for colleagues in an attempt to cement his
chances for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers have split over whether Crane's disclosure
of alcoholism will help or hurt his chances.

<HEADLINE> Bodies of Marines Being Recovered  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARANA, Ariz. (AP) -- Military investigators began the slow and
gruesome task today of removing the remains of 19 Marines who died
in the fiery crash of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery of the remains was expected to take several days with
identification likely to involve DNA, fingerprints and other
records, said Lt. Mark Carter, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Air
Station in Yuma, where the flight originated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process is a slow process because it's a detailed
operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in white jumpsuits and wearing masks could be seen
loading what appeared to be a body bag into a semitrailer this
morning. Their movements were largely masked by the trailer and
tarps suspended in front of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Officials spent Monday taking measurements, examining pieces of
the charred wreck and trying to ensure that investigators could
remove the remains safely, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   All 19 Marines aboard the Osprey were killed Saturday when it
crashed during an evacuation training exercise at Marana Northwest
Regional Airport, about 30 miles north of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were four crew members from Quantico, Va., 14
Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and one from Marine Corps Air
Station-Miramar in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. James Jones, commandant of the Marine Corps, said today
that the blast from the crash of the Osprey rocked a second Osprey
hovering nearby, causing it to experience a hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said the crash was witnessed by the crew chief of the
surviving Osprey. He said this witness' description of what he saw
was likely to play an important role in the accident investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators still hadn't determined the cause of the wreck as
of early today, but Capt. Aisha Bakkar-Poe, a spokeswoman at the
Pentagon Marine Corps headquarters, said a preliminary cause could
be released in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Marines remain confident of the safety of the
innovative Osprey, which is intended as a replacement for the
corps' aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   By tilting their large rotors, Ospreys can take off like
helicopters and then fly like airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines' other four Ospreys were not flying after the crash,
but Bakkar-Poe said that mostly was out of respect for the victims'
families and the other Osprey crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't feel there's a design flaw,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Osprey that crashed had flown more than 135 hours
since it was delivered on Jan. 17. It averaged 40 hours a month in
the air, about twice as much as most Marine aircraft, but the extra
flight time should not have been a factor in the crash, Bakkar-Poe
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey was introduced in September. The Marines have ordered
360 at a cost of $44 million each, said Pentagon spokesman Capt.
Rob Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of the victims, Keoki Santos, 24, of Grand
Ronde, Ore., said her son had concerns about riding in the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really, really nervous about the whole thing,''
Christina Mercier said. ''He was a beautiful, high-spirited, true
Marine. He didn't want to just go into the service for four years.
He enlisted to be a career man. And they killed him. They wanted
him to be a guinea pig for these new airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps lists two other crashes during the Osprey's
development: A 1991 Delaware accident blamed on gyro wiring
problems and a 1992 Virginia crash that killed all seven people on
board after an engine caught fire.

<HEADLINE> Ex-drug Agent on Trial Kills Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A retired federal drug agent accused of
taking part in a smuggling ring left his trial, drove to Interstate
75 and committed suicide by stepping into the path of a
tractor-trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Michael Swanson's trial had reached closing arguments
when he borrowed a van during a lunch break Thursday and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year Drug Enforcement Administration veteran faced 10
years to life in federal prison if found guilty, and his lawyer
suggested that he killed himself out of concern for his
cancer-stricken wife. If convicted, Swanson would have lost medical
benefits she needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to eliminate that possibility,'' defense attorney
Bill DeCarlis said. ''He's a fallen hero as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, 56, of Incline Village, Nev., was free on bail, so he
was able to borrow the keys to the van from a member of DeCarlis'
staff. He parked on the shoulder of the highway and stepped into
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson was charged with racketeering and money laundering in
connection with a ring that smuggled hashish and marijuana into the
United States. Swanson, who retired from the DEA in 1984, claimed
that he was working for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that our defense had a realistic shot at
succeeding,'' his lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 136.74; Nasdaq Down 59.85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell today as the volatile
biotech sector declined in response to a disappointing earnings
report from Biogen. Blue-chip issues once again drew money away
from the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 59.85 at 4,128.35. The choppy
trading that has characterized the market in the past two weeks
returned again, with the Nasdaq paring an earlier loss of 178
points to fewer than 10 before heading lower again.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of tumultuous selling, the Nasdaq is now up only
slightly during 2000 and is 19 percent below its peak of 5,048.62,
which it reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 136.74 at 11,323.30, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 1.18 at 1,503.28.
</P>
<P>
   Two downbeat earnings reports hurt stocks today. Biogen, a
leading biotechnology company, reported first-quarter earnings of
41 cents a share, below Wall Street expectations of 43 cents.
Biogen cited a slowdown in demand for its multiple sclerosis
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen fell 13\ to 51}. Investors sold off other biotech firms,
with Genentech tumbling 16 to 140{.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector declined after Motorola said it
expects second-quarter and full-year 2000 earnings to fall short of
analysts' views.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which makes cellular phones and semiconductors, said
it expects profit margins to shrink in the coming quarters. Late
Monday, Motorola released first-quarter earnings that had more than
doubled from the first quarter of 1999 due to robust demand for
cellular phones and strong growth in its chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola shares plummeted 26 9/16 to 123 7/16. Rival Texas
Instruments fell 3~ to 152{ and Advanced Micro Devices fell 4| to
69|.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some concern that what's hurting Motorola could affect
the rest of the techs,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst
at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said nervous investors are continuing to shed technology
stocks that may not be worthy of their valuations, which are
generally much higher relative to earnings than the industrial
stocks that dominate the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than a few portfolio managers found themselves
overexposed to technology last quarter,'' he said. ''Some are
getting out, and some are just sitting on their hands waiting for
the market to settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate earnings reporting season begins in earnest this
week, and while profit growth for most companies is expected to be
quite strong, investors in a nervous market are proving unwilling
to tolerate any disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, Wall Street strategists have been reminding
investors that many old-line companies in the energy, financial and
consumer sectors may reward investors seeking stable, growing
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're definitely seeing continued rotation into more
reasonably priced stocks, many of which will also show strong
earnings,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 3] to 162 13/16 and 3M rose 3| to 96].
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues and decliners were even on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 786.72 million shares, ahead of
Monday's quiet pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners were ahead by a
3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.22 to 511.44.

<HEADLINE> UN's Holbrooke Talks To Congress  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Getting the United Nations to agree to reduce
the assessment it charges the United States will be tough, U.N.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And, while there is some sentiment in the world organization to
go along with lowering the U.S. general assessment, getting a
reduction in peacekeeping costs will be even more difficult,
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year linked payment of back dues to the United
Nations to a variety of structural changes, including reducing the
U.S. share of general U.N. operations from the present 25 percent
to 22 percent; and the peacekeeping budget from 31 percent to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nation's peacekeeping operations are already
''stretched way too thin for the problems they face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the General Assembly to go along with any reductions in
the U.S. share may be more trouble than its worth, suggested
Holbrooke, even though he said he would continue to work hard to
follow the terms of the U.S. law
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee, Holbrooke
said that of the 189 nations in the world body, ''not everyone in
New York is equally committed'' to reform -- or lower U.S. payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be tough,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations puts back U.S. dues at $1.7 billion -- a
figure the United States disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year voted to pay $926 million of the arrears over
three years, with a $100 million first installment.
</P>
<P>
   But to get the balance, the United Nations must meet about a
dozen conditions drafted by Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,
the panel's senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Those terms generally have not been well received in New York,
although Holbrooke said one of them -- no inflation-adjusted
increase in the U.N.'s budget -- is being met.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the discrepancy between the $1.7 billion the United
Nations claims the United States owes and the roughly $1 billion
the United States calculates it owes will continue, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are neither going to take it off the books -- nor are we
going to pay it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's appearance comes 1{ weeks after he and other members
of the U.N. Security Council visited Washington at the invitation
of Helms and Biden, including an appearance before Helms'
committee.

   KIDS IN CHARGE: Planning to go on a business trip? You might
want to check with your child first.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Sheraton Hotels &AMP; Resorts found that more than
two-thirds of the parents who took part have refused to go on a
business trip because of conflicts with their children's
activities. Forty-one percent of the 300 men and women who
responded to the online survey said they would cut a trip short
because of a birthday or child's illness. Nearly a third wouldn't
travel if there's a school event. And 5 percent said they would
cancel altogether if their children were upset about their leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ''The playroom wins over the boardroom,'' said John Greenleaf a
vice president at Sheraton parent Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts
Worldwide. ''This study showed us just how far a business traveler
will go to preserve the delicate balance between work and family
life.''

   GIFT ALERT: Want to make your secretary or assistant feel
appreciated? Give them a day at the spa but please, pass on the
Chia Pet.
</P>
<P>
   With Secretaries Day set for April 26, OfficeClick.com polled
more than 1,500 office managers, administrative assistants and
secretaries to see what gifts they'd most like to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top choices: a gift certificate to a day spa, a day
off and a gift certificate for two to a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 percent of the respondents said not being recognized
was the worst possibility. Almost as bad were skimpy gifts such as
Chia Pets or a ''bouquet of dying flowers at 4:30 p.m,'' as one
respondent put it.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Fox, author of ''Office Etiquette for Dummies,'' advises
bosses, ''Your gift celebration needs to speak for itself. It needs
to say 'I recognize, and truly appreciate the hard work you do to
help make our business successful.'''

   SHOW ME THE MONEY: As CEO pay points toward a record-breaking
year, shareholders are urging companies to share profits with
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Responsible Wealth, a network of business people and
investors, have requested shareholder votes at several big U.S.
companies seeking a link between CEO and worker compensation. Scott
Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth, said ''companies that
make CEOs megamillionaires and billionaires while shortchanging
most employees on quicksand.''
</P>
<P>
   The group noted that even at companies where thousands of
employees have lost their jobs, CEOs continued to earn in the tens
of millions of dollars.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Commission Speaks Out  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights denounced
policies in California, Texas and Florida that replace affirmative
action in public universities with guaranteed admission for top
high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are ''no substitute for strong race-conscious
affirmative action,'' the commission said in a 10-page statement
approved last week and made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other states should move ''warily'' to adopt similar plans, and
then preferably only as a complement to existing affirmative action
programs, commission Chairwoman Mary Frances Berry said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a state has affirmative action, the commission believes
that if it can ... keep it, it ought to,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, dismissed the
Democrat-dominated commission's finding as a ''purely political
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas and California crafted new admissions policies after
affirmative action in public university admissions was outlawed in
1996 -- in Texas by a federal court and in California by voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida plan, pushed by Bush, has yet to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was the first state to embrace a percentage plan, enacting
a law that guarantees admission at state colleges and universities
to Texas students in the top 10 percent of their high school
graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   While minority enrollment systemwide has rebounded from the lows
that resulted when affirmative action was ended, the commission
found the admittance rate for black and Hispanic students at the
University of Texas at Austin is down.
</P>
<P>
   California promises admission to the top 4 percent of its high
school students. But since that plan was implemented, the minority
enrollment at its flagship state universities -- UCLA and Berkeley --
has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Minority enrollment in graduate and professional programs, in
particular, has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major problem with the percentage plans is their
inattention to law schools, medical schools and other graduate and
professional schools, where ending affirmative action is
devastating,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Bush moved earlier this year to end affirmative
action in admissions and state contracting, offering the One
Florida plan that promises admission to students graduating in the
top 20 percent of their class. The plan drew protests and a sit-in
in the lieutenant governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the One Florida plan, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
accused the commission of engaging in a ''partisan attack'' and
said its members are ''fixated'' on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ''They prefer a system that uses race-conscious measures even to
a system that will provide more benefits to members of
minorities,'' Canady said. ''That is an ideological position that's
indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry denied any political calculus in criticizing plans in
states led by two high-profile Republicans: Jeb Bush and his
brother George, the governor of Texas and GOP presidential
nominee-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was approved by the commission's six Democrats,
who include a campaign adviser to Vice President Al Gore but was
rejected by its two Republican members. The GOP commissioners
issued a written dissent, saying the statement was ''littered with
inaccuracies and half-truths.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission issued the statement because other states
weighing percentage plans asked the panel for its views, Berry
said. The panel, created in 1957, has no regulatory power.

<HEADLINE> Award-Winning Film To Be Altered  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Several graphic pictures showing the bodies of
slain Israeli athletes will be blurred in an Academy Award-winning
documentary on the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics, a producer
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers agreed to the changes at the request of the
families of the athletes who were upset by the pictures, said
Arthur Cohen, who produced the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   It is fairly unusual to change a film after it has been
released, but Cohen said that despite misgivings, the filmmakers
owed it to the families to make the alterations in ''One Day in
September.'' The film won the Academy Award last month for best
feature documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The film documents the raid on September 5, 1972, when
Palestinian militants took over a dormitory housing Israeli
athletes. Following a 20-hour standoff, nine Israelis died in a
bungled rescue attempt after the Palestinians killed two others. A
German policeman and five Palestinian militants also were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made a film against terror,'' Cohn told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview, ''It is very difficult to make a
document of terror if the photos are softened. We were reluctant
but agreed to it out of respect for the families.''
</P>
<P>
   Ankie Spitzer, whose husband Andre, the fencing coach for the
Israeli team, was among those killed, said she was horrified to see
the unaltered forensic pictures used in the original film.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said her daughter, who was 5 weeks old when her father
was killed, has not been able to sleep since seeing the movie at a
private screening.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said there are enough other pictures even of the room
itself where they (the athletes) were kept hostage which are so
horrifying that they should be enough,'' Spitzer said. ''The story
is shocking enough that we don't need to see the dead mutilated
bodies of our husbands and fathers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer last saw her husband on television, when he appeared at
the window of the dormitory room where the Israeli athletes were
held hostage, acting as a go-between for the gunmen and German
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hands bound behind his back, he reported in German that all the
hostages were fine except for one -- and was promptly hit on the
head with a rifle butt and whisked from sight.
</P>
<P>
   After the ordeal, Spitzer visited the blood-drenched room where
her husband and the others were tied to furniture while they
watched weightlifter Yossi Romano die.
</P>
<P>
   Romano had tried to overpower his well-armed captors with a
kitchen knife. They shot the weightlifter four times and left him
to slowly bleed to death on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The militants, members of the terror group Black September,
demanded the release of 200 prisoners jailed in Israel and safe
passage for themselves out of Germany. Israel refused to negotiate.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan To Buy Fleming  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp. is paying $7.6 billion in
cash and stock for Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd., a British
investment bank and asset management group, in a bid to help it
become a bigger player in global investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, the third-largest U.S. bank with $406.1 billion in assets
as of the end of 1999, has agreed to pay $4.1 billion in cash and
$3.5 billion in common stock for Robert Fleming, one of Britain's
last independent financial companies. The deal requires regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Lyonnais Securities analyst Julian Bird attributed the
value of the deal to Chase's eagerness to expand into the
high-growth field of asset management and to the reluctance of the
Fleming family to sell its majority of shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite a full price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase chief executive William Harrison said the buyout would
benefit clients of both firms through the delivery of a wider range
of investment banking products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Chase would obtain one of the ''premier asset management
brands'' in Asia and Europe, Harrison told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are two markets we think are significant growth markets
that we want to be larger in.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison added that Robert Fleming is also strong in the
securities business in Asia, particularly in the state-owned
sector, where Chase has been weak.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming chief executive William Garrett said the decision to
forgo the British bank's independence was driven by its need for
greater size in order to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ''The emergence of a number of powerful global houses has
changed the competitive landscape over the last few years,''
Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we have responded successfully to this and have just
completed a record year for the Flemings Group, we recognize that
global markets require global reach.''
</P>
<P>
   By linking up with Chase, Robert Fleming could expand its reach
in North America and other regions.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout marks the latest step in Chase's evolution away from
pure commercial banking. Last year, Chase purchased the investment
bank of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist for $1.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Fleming, New York-based Chase follows in the tracks
of rival Citigroup Inc. Earlier this year, Citigroup purchased the
investment banking business of Schroders, another independent
British financial company.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fleming dates to 1873, when its founder set up a trust to
invest in the booming U.S. railroad industry. Among the railroads
he helped finance were the Union Pacific, Pennsylvania, and
Atchison, Topeka &AMP; Santa Fe lines.
</P>
<P>
   Another Fleming family member was the creator of secret agent
James Bond, author Ian Fleming, who was groomed for a career at the
bank but never worked there.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was initially valued at $7.7 billion, but shares of
Chase dipped $2.75 to $85.37{ in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Uproar Over Aid to India's Tigers  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Wildlife experts have recommended that
financial support be cut off to tiger conservation programs in
India, sparking warnings Tuesday that halting aid would further
endanger the world's shrinking tiger population.
</P>
<P>
   Despite millions of dollars in help, India's wild tiger
population -- the world's largest -- is being heavily poached,
apparently by gangs of organized and well-funded hunters, according
to a report prepared for the U.N. Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species, or CITES.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be presented in Nairobi in the next few days to
the 11th CITES conference, recommends that financial support be cut
off until India shows it is efficiently spending the money already
set aside to protect the cats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to save tigers before it is too late,'' said Willem
Wijnstekers, the CITES secretary general. ''There is a lot of hurry
in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Suresh Sharma, the head of the Indian delegation to the
CITES conference, warned that if financial aid is blocked, the
mission that prepared the report ''will be responsible for killing
tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild tiger population, under severe threat from habitat loss
and poaching, has plummeted from over 100,000 in the 19th century
to just 5,000 to 7,000 today, ranging from India and Russia to
China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   While tiger hunting is now illegal everywhere and international
trade in tigers and tiger products is banned under CITES, tigers
and tiger parts used for decorations or traditional medicines are
available on black markets.
</P>
<P>
   India's tiger program, among the most high-profile in the world,
is riddled with problems, the report said, including funds not
reaching desperately ill-equipped and underpaid field workers and
poorly coordinated anti-poaching programs.
</P>
<P>
   Forest guards in parts of India patrol without radios, modern
weapons and decent vehicles, the report said, and some guards have
not been paid in 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   It said that while some officials were dedicated to saving the
tigers, ''varying levels of apathy, complacency and bureaucracy
seem to stifle or frustrate good work and good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharma, however, felt the report painted an unfairly bleak
picture of tiger conservation in India. ''Our country has generally
gone beyond what CITES has recommended,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 delegates from 151 countries and scores of
non-governmental conservation and environmental organizations are
participating in the Nairobi conference, which began Monday and
ends April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Country delegations often include members of non-governmental
organizations lobbying for adding or removing certain species from
the CITES listing, which regulates trade in endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 132; Dow Up 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply today, wiping out
the Nasdaq composite index's gains for the year. The volatile
biotechnology sector was the latest catalyst for the steady decline
of the index that just recently seemed unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip issues once again drew money away from the technology
sector, pulling the Dow Jones industrials to their highest levels
since January.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 132.32 to close at 4,055.88. The
choppy trading that has characterized the market in the past two
weeks returned, with the Nasdaq paring an early loss of 178 points
to fewer than 10 before heading lower again.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of tumultuous selling, the Nasdaq is now
fractionally lower for the year and is nearly 20 percent below its
peak of 5,048.62, which it reached March 10. Still, the index is up
a stunning 56 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The resurgent Dow Jones
industrial average rose 100.52 to close at 11,287.08, its highest
level since Jan. 20, when it closed at 11,351.30.
</P>
<P>
   the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.88 to 1,500.58.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,530 up, 1,456 down and 481
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 967.15 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
850.19 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.95 to 509.71.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rotation continues,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment
officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co., referring to investors' turn away from
high-tech and back to old reliable stocks like the Dow issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fast and it's volatile, but it's really becoming the
norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Two downbeat earnings reports derailed the technology sector
today. Biogen, a leading biotechnology company, reported
first-quarter earnings of 41 cents a share, below Wall Street
expectations of 43 cents. Biogen cited a slowdown in demand for its
multiple sclerosis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen fell steeply. Investors sold off other biotech firms,
with Genentech tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector declined after Motorola said it
expects second-quarter and full-year 2000 earnings to fall short of
analysts' views.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which makes cellular phones and semiconductors, said
it expects profit margins to shrink in the coming quarters. Late
Monday, Motorola released first-quarter earnings that had more than
doubled from the first quarter of 1999 due to robust demand for
cellular phones and strong growth in its chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola shares plummeted. Rivals Texas Instruments and Advanced
Micro Devices also fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some concern that what's hurting Motorola could affect
the rest of the techs,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst
at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said nervous investors are continuing to shed technology
stocks that may not be worthy of their valuations, which are
generally much higher relative to earnings than the industrial
stocks that dominate the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than a few portfolio managers found themselves
overexposed to technology last quarter,'' he said. ''Some are
getting out, and some are just sitting on their hands waiting for
the market to settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate earnings reporting season begins in earnest this
week, and while profit growth for most companies is expected to be
quite strong, investors in a nervous market are proving unwilling
to tolerate any disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, Wall Street strategists have been reminding
investors that many old-line companies in the energy, financial and
consumer sectors may reward investors seeking stable, growing
profits. Today, General Electric and 3M rose.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice pointed out that breadth, the difference between rising
and falling stocks, remains very narrow, with just a handful of Dow
issues driving the index higher today. Most investors are
continuing to shift money from sector to sector on a daily basis,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The narrowness of the rally in blue-chips is disconcerting,''
he said. ''It shows you just how nervous the market is.''

<HEADLINE> Houston Shows Up for Arista Bash  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Whitney Houston took the stage to a standing
ovation at Arista Records' 25th anniversary tribute to her mentor
Clive Davis in a heavily scrutinized six-song performance.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Houston have swirled in the wake of drug abuse
allegations, a much-discussed absence at last month's Academy
Awards telecast and a disjointed magazine interview.

<P>
   Houston tripped walking onstage Monday night and sometimes she
spoke rather than sang the words to her hits while four backup
singers, including her brother, Gary, sang them.
</P>
<P>
   She stopped abruptly before the final dramatic notes of ''I Will
Always Love You'' to signal for a drink of water. Husband Bobby
Brown walked on stage with the water. She took a sip and kissed
Brown, who patted her sweaty forehead before walking off.
</P>
<P>
   The singer's publicist, Nancy Seltzer, said Tuesday that Houston
always pauses at that point in the song and chats with the audience
or gets a drink.
</P>
<P>
   ''She does everything for dramatic effect,'' Seltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's interplay with the backup singers was an intentional
variation on her customary delivery, and the slip was because there
was water on the stage, Seltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The girl went out there and she gave them a rip-roaring
performance,'' Seltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown injected himself into another song, cavorting wildly back
and forth on stage before grabbing his wife's microphone and
letting loose with a chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The record's not over yet, remember,'' Houston said
cryptically at the end of her 20-minute performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a shimmering long gown, Houston wore her hair in a
flip.
</P>
<P>
   ''She looks fabulous,'' Dionne Warwick, a cousin of Houston's,
said backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Houston didn't appear backstage to talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   She joined some of the biggest names in Arista's history to
perform for label founder Davis, who signed Houston when she was
19. The two-hour special will air May 15 on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ask anybody in the industry who is the great singer in the
world today, it is she,'' Davis said backstage. ''When you see her,
you'll see an artist at the top of her form.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before the Oscars, the singer failed to appear at
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner where she was scheduled to
help induct Davis.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Davis is fighting Arista's owner, BMG Entertainment and
German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, to keep his job. Bertelsmann
traditionally enforces a retirement age of 60 on its top
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Before she performed, Houston sat smiling in the audience with
her arm resting on Brown during a medley by Barry Manilow. Seated
next to Davis, Houston sang along as Manilow performed ''I Write
the Songs.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Brown later rose to their feet in the front row at the
Shrine Auditorium to dance to ''Supernatural'' by Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Warwick denied a report in this week's People
magazine that she and Natalie Cole were going to talk to Houston
about her alleged drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read it like you did. I don't know where that came from,''
Warwick said. ''There's no reason for intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, airport security officers in Hawaii said they found
a half-ounce of marijuana in Houston's bag. Rather than wait for
police to arrive, the 36-year-old Houston boarded her flight and
left the islands. Houston has not been charged in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's publicist blamed a sore throat for the Oscar show
absence and ''voice problems'' for the Hall of Fame absence.

<HEADLINE> Marines: Osprey Will Fly Again Soon  </HEADLINE>
AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps intends to resume flying its
Osprey aircraft ''in the very near future,'' before completing the
investigation of last weekend's fatal crash in Arizona, the
Marines' top aviation official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle told a Pentagon news conference that
flying would resume unless the initial investigation reveals a
major mechanical or design flaw, in which case the Osprey fleet
would be grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to a lot of people on this particular accident ...
and I've had nothing so far to lead me to believe that we would
have to (ground) them,'' McCorkle said. Flights of the four
remaining production-model Ospreys were temporarily halted
immediately after last Saturday's accident at Marana, Ariz., as a
gesture of sympathy for the families of the 19 Marines killed in
the unexplained accident.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, McCorkle said, ''We have no indication what caused the
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said that on Tuesday the remaining Ospreys resumed
taxiing and other ground operations. ''I think that we will return
to the air in the very near future,'' he said without mentioning a
specific date.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Marines' plan to resume flying Ospreys before
the crash investigation is completed, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm.
Craig Quigley said, ''We are confident that the Marine Corps will
do the right thing and make the right decision as to when and under
what conditions flights will resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. James Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, said Tuesday he
is concerned that some families of the victims have formed the
mistaken view that the Osprey aircraft was an experimental
aircraft. He said he had seen family members quoted in news reports
as believing the victims had been ''guinea pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These are certified airworthy aircraft,'' Jones said, noting
that all testing of the planes has been completed. The Osprey that
crashed was one of four such aircraft participating in an exercise
meant to evaluate how they would coordinate with other Marine
aircraft during a real-life mission such as a hostage rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't put people at risk,'' Jones said. ''There is no such
thing as human guinea pigs in this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu interview with The Associated Press, Jones also
said that blast from the explosion of the Osprey that crashed
Saturday rocked another Osprey that had arrived at the airfield
first and was hovering nearby about 30 feet off the runway. The
jolt caused the Osprey to make a hard landing but it was not
damaged, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the crash was witnessed by the crew chief of the
first Osprey. He said this eyewitness's description of what he saw
was likely to play an important role in the accident investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what a senior Marine Corps aviation official told
reporters Monday, Jones said the crash was not recorded on infrared
tape by a Marine Corps F-18 fighter flying overhead. The F-18's
infrared tape was not running at the time, Jones said, and the
pilot apparently did not see the Osprey crash.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the tape, extensive technical information is
expected to be to be revealed on the Osprey's flight data recorder.
McCorkle said that should enable the Marines to determine the
accident's cause fairly quickly. He said the flight data recorder
likely could be recovered as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think within a week we'll have a pretty good idea'' of the
cause, McCorkle said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The crash Saturday night was the deadliest air disaster for the
Marines since 22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
The last crash of an Osprey was in 1992, when a prototype version
crashed into the Potomac River near Quantico, Va., and killed seven
people.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Osprey's co-pilots had extensive flying experience.
Maj. John A. Brow had logged 97 hours in the Osprey, Maj. Brooks S.
Gruber 86 hours. Brow had 3,777 total flight hours in various
aircraft; Gruber had 2,117 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey is unique in its ability to take off like a
helicopter, rotate its propellers 95 degrees and fly like an
airplane. McCorkle said the ill-fated Osprey was in helicopter mode
when it nose-dived into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers -- Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron -- are
due to deliver 11 Ospreys to the Marines this year. McCorkle said
those 11 will cost an average of about $57 million apiece.
Eventually the Marines are to field 360 of them to replace aging
CH-46 helicopters. The Navy plans to buy 48 and the Air Force will
get 50.

<HEADLINE> Official Accused in Campaign Case  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The director of an Environmental Protection
Agency regional office broke election laws by soliciting money for
a Montana congressional candidate, prosecutors told a federal
employment board Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Yellowtail, director of the region covering Colorado, Utah,
Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, is the
highest-ranking federal official to face such a charge since at
least 1995, said Jane McFarland, spokeswoman for the U.S. Office of
Special Counsel that is prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege Yellowtail broke the law by allowing his name
to be attached to a 1998 letter seeking campaign donations for
Robert ''Dusty'' Deschamps, a Democrat running for Montana's lone
U.S. House seat. ''Contributing now to Dusty's campaign is
absolutely critical,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowtail, a former Montana state senator, resigned from his
EPA post to make an unsuccessful run for the Montana House seat in
1996. He was reappointed to the EPA job in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Lathrop, a spokesman for the regional EPA office, said the
agency has not decided whether to take any action against
Yellowtail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know anything more than is in the (Office of Special
Counsel) press release. ... These are serious charges,'' Lathrop
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowtail did not return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The petition with the federal Merit Systems Protection Board
accuses Yellowtail of violating the Hatch Act, a federal law
banning campaign activity by government workers.
</P>
<P>
   If the board agrees Yellowtail broke the law, it could order his
firing, McFarland said. The minimum penalty for a Hatch Act
violation is a 30-day suspension, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency of federal
prosecutors, brings about four Hatch Act cases a year, McFarland
said.

<HEADLINE> Baker Cuts Short North Africa Trip  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
III cut short his tour of North Africa for health reasons Tuesday
after talks aimed at finding a way to resolve the dispute over the
Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, personal envoy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, flew
to Spain on a military plane on Tuesday afternoon rather than head
to Mauritania as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   At Rabat airport, Baker said he was leaving ''on doctor's
orders.'' U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Baker was suffering from
bronchitis, sinisitis and a high fever.
</P>
<P>
   Haq said Baker was to see Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes
before flying to Paris on Wednesday for a meeting with President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Baker told reporters that he had telephoned President Mouaouya
Ould Taya of Mauritania. William Eagleton, the special
representative for the Western Sahara, will go to Mauritania soon,
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's trip, which started in Algeria on Saturday, was designed
to clear the way for a U.N. referendum to resolve whether the
Western Sahara will gain independence or be integrated with
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria, Baker met with government leaders and members of the
Polisario Front, the guerrilla movement that battled Morocco for
more than 15 years for the Western Sahara's independence. Baker
then met with King Mohammed VI in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Sahara independence referendum has been stalled for
years, chiefly over disagreement on how to count potential voters.
In a report in February, Annan expressed doubts about whether the
referendum would proceed and how the results could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Sahara is a stretch of desert along Africa's
Atlantic coast. Morocco claims the territory. The Polisario Front,
traditionally backed by Algeria, seeks independence.
</P>
<P>
   War broke out in 1976 after Spain abandoned the territory and
Morocco annexed it and moved in settlers. The war ended in 1991
with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Group Targets Heartburn Medication  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A consumer advocacy group urged the government
Tuesday to move faster to stop sales of Propulsid, a popular
heartburn drug scheduled to be pulled off the market this summer
because it may cause deadly irregular heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration last month announced that
Propulsid was too dangerous for continued routine prescription, and
worked with manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceutica to create an unusual
program allowing Propulsid to be taken only by a limited number of
patients with serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, will
quit marketing Propulsid on July 14 and remove it from pharmacies
in mid-August. But certain patients -- adults and infants -- with
serious medical conditions can apply for the special program to get
the drug after general sales end.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, the FDA cited 80 deaths and 341 other heartbeat
abnormalities linked to Propulsid.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the consumer group Public Citizen announced it had
counted an additional 23 Propulsid-related deaths reported to the
FDA this year, bringing the toll to 103.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting until summer to end Propulsid sales is too long, Public
Citizen said in petitioning the FDA to order Propulsid off the
market within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA will evaluate the request, said gastrointestinal drugs
chief Dr. Florence Houn.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency agreed to let Propulsid continue selling through
summer because it will take Janssen some time to establish the
special-access program -- and then take doctors a while to enroll
eligible patients, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Janssen will mail letters to 800,000 physicians
explaining the program, said spokesman Greg Panico. Eligible
patients include adults with severe gastroesophagul reflux disease,
or heartburn, not helped by other drugs, and a few other conditions
including gastroparesis, a sometimes lifethreatening inability to
properly digest food. Babies with reflux or another serious feeding
problem also may be enrolled.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: More Job Training Needed  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan joined
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman on Tuesday in a call for better job
training and recruitment programs to satisfy a shortage of skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have a lot of untapped potential in this labor market,''
said Herman, who hosted a conference on job skills on the campus of
Howard University, a historically black college in the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment near 4 percent, the lowest in three decades,
U.S. jobs are plentiful and some companies report having trouble
finding qualified workers to fill positions. However, many
unskilled workers are still encountering barriers to finding a job
-- or one with good wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not enough to create a job market that has enabled those
with few skills to finally be able to grasp the first rung of the
ladder of achievement,'' said Greenspan, the keynote speaker at the
gathering. ''We must ensure that our whole population receives an
education that will allow full and continuing participation in this
dynamic period of economic history.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite prosperous times, about 6 million Americans remain
unemployed, 3 million part-time workers would prefer full-time
jobs, and another 4 million people say they would seek jobs if not
for impediments such as lack of transportation and childcare,
according to the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we need to do is to dig deeper into the wells of all
three of these groups,'' Herman said in an interview. ''This
economy needs their talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Among industries most desperate for workers are health care,
high tech, construction, finance and manufacturing. Representatives
from companies, unions and training programs in those fields
attended Tuesday's conference to brainstorm solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Among ideas already being tried:
</P>
<P>
   --A Maine organization called Women Unlimited is among several
groups recruiting and training women for jobs in which they are
underrepresented, including construction trades, auto repair and
truck driving.
</P>
<P>
   --Home Care Associates of Philadelphia increased its pool of
applicants by purchasing 10 cars for employees to use to get to and
from job assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that even with the strong economy and low
unemployment, swift technological changes mean American businesses
and workers will continue to face insecurity unless worker training
opportunities keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapidity of innovation and the unpredictability of the
directions it may take imply a need for considerable investment in
human capital,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses should not expect academic institutions alone to
create the pool of skilled workers they need, he said. Business
partnerships with community colleges and public agencies,
''distance learning'' over the Internet and corporate universities
play an increasingly important role, he said.

   Nasdaq Ends Down 132; Dow Up 100
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply today, wiping out
the last of the Nasdaq composite index's gains for the year. The
volatile biotechnology sector was the latest catalyst for the
steady decline of the index that just recently seemed unstoppable.
Blue-chip issues once again drew money away from the technology
sector, pulling the Dow Jones industrials to their highest levels
since January. The Nasdaq composite index fell 132.32 to close at
4,055.88. The choppy trading that has characterized the market in
the past two weeks returned, with the Nasdaq paring an early loss
of 178 points to fewer than 10 before heading lower again. Broader
stock indicators were mixed. The resurgent Dow Jones industrial
average rose 100.52 to close at 11,287.08, its highest level since
Jan. 20, when it closed at 11,351.30.

   Motorola Shares Sink

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Investors dismissed a strong first-quarter
performance by Motorola Inc. and sent shares tumbling almost 18
percent today after the company warned that lower prices for mobile
phones were squeezing profits and would cause it to miss
second-quarter earnings expectations. Shares in the world's No. 2
maker of cellular phones were down 27 to 124. Motorola said profits
for the three months ending March 31 were up 144 percent on booming
sales of both cellular phones and semiconductor products. The

   Greenspan: More Job Training Needed

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said

   Study Finds Oil Prices Will Fall
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Increased OPEC oil production and a mild winter
that eased consumer demand for heating oil are contributing to at
least temporary relief from painfully high crude prices, a
respected industry study said today. Oil prices have fallen since
OPEC members agreed last month to open the spigots on exports,
adding 500,000 new barrels per day and giving refineries an
incentive to buy more of the oil they need to make gasoline, the
International Energy Agency reported. However, any relief at the
pump for motorists in oil-importing nations could be brief, the
study said, noting that even more oil will be needed during the
peak driving season in industrialized nations.

$125 billion each year on procurement, they said in a joint
announcement today. Other industries, including transportation,
have recently announced similar procurement exchanges, designed to
improve efficiency and supply-chain management. An independent
company would be created to own and operate the exchange. The
founding members range from Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos., to BP
Amoco PLC, to The Dow Chemical Co.,

head of the Web Standards Project, said that Internet Explorer
version 5.5, which will be bundled with Microsoft's upcoming

new, proprietary technologies, but has yet to properly implement
the standards that developers use when creating Web-based

   Scripps' 1Q Earnings Rise
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The E.W. Scripps Co.'s first-quarter earnings
increased by 5 percent to $33.6 million, propelled by fast-growing
revenues at Home &AMP; Garden Television and the Food Network. The
earnings were equivalent to 43 cents per share and included
expenses from the company's venture capital funds and gains from
sold-off operations. Without those one-time factors, earnings would
have been 45 cents a share. In the same quarter a year ago, Scripps
earned $32 million, or 40 cents per share. Revenues increased 9
percent to $410.9 million from $376.3 million a year earlier.

had earlier been denied jobs after the company refused to accept
their valid documentation. It also agreed to pay them $4,996 in
back pay, correct hiring policies, receive training from the
Justice Department and pay $76,925 in civil penalties. John

with the Justice Department when the situation was brought to its

<HEADLINE> Burger King Says It's Not for Sale  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Under pressure from restaurant owners, Burger King
said Tuesday it's not for sale and believes that most franchisees
are confident about a $500 million plan to help revitalize the
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The National Franchisee Association Inc., an organization of
Burger King franchise holders, said Monday it is exploring the idea
of spinning the company off from British parent Diageo PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The group denied it was seeking to buy Burger King, however.
''The franchisee group has not made an offer to purchase Burger
King Corp. from Diageo nor does it plan to,'' the association said
in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King Corp. responded Tuesday with a statement from chief
executive officer Dennis Malamatinas, who said, ''Diageo is
completely confident in BKC's vision for reshaping the brand and
believes that the majority of franchisees are as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchisees have complained of slim profit margins, ineffective
marketing campaigns and lack of leadership at a time of slow U.S.
sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 26 letter to the company that was obtained by Dow
Jones Newswires, franchisee association president Steven M. Lewis
alluded to ''the weakened state of the Burger King brand and
inadequate franchisee support by Burger King Corp.''
</P>
<P>
   To franchisees, Burger King's subsidiary status in Diageo is a
predicament, especially compared with McDonald's Corp.'s standalone
position atop the fast-food industry, said Brian Eisenharth, a
Diageo stock analyst with Collins &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is that Burger King is only a piece of what
Diageo's doing, and to the Burger King franchisees that's all that
they're concerned about,'' Eisenharth said. ''Diageo has got a lot
of oars in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Malamatinas pointed to the four-year, $500 million plan to
''re-image'' restaurants and an 18-month program to install new
logos and enhance 2,000 restaurants as indications of confidence by
Diageo and franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the cusp of a major breakthrough for our system with
rapid payback expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be rapid enough for some.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise group has hired consultant Arthur Andersen, the
Wall Street law firm of Weil Gotshal &AMP; Manges and public relations
specialists Hill &AMP; Knowlton to research options, including Diageo's
divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King plans to offer details of its ''transformation
initiatives'' Wednesday at a franchise meeting in Orlando, and
Diageo plans to meet with franchise officials May 26.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo is primarily a liquor and beer company whose brands
include Guinness beer and Johnnie Walker scotch. It also owns
Pillsbury baked goods, Green Giant vegetables and Haagen-Dazs ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King is the world's second-largest hamburger chain,
behind McDonald's Corp., with some 10,900 Burger King restaurants
worldwide. Of Burger King's 8,160 U.S. restaurants, 94 percent of
them are franchise-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-based Burger King Corp. contributed $1.4 billion in sales
to Diageo's $18.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Scripps' 1st Q Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The E.W. Scripps Co.'s first-quarter earnings
increased by 5 percent to $33.6 million, propelled by fast-growing
revenues at Home &AMP; Garden Television and the Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings were equivalent to 43 cents per share and included
expenses from the company's venture capital funds and gains from
sold-off operations. Without those one-time factors, earnings would
have been 45 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In the same quarter a year ago, Scripps earned $32 million, or
40 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues increased 9 percent to $410.9 million from $376.3
million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Television earnings were strong, led by a 54 percent growth in
revenues from Home &AMP; Garden Television to $51 million and 60
percent growth at Food Network to $22.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps increased Internet investments in its newspapers by
$800,000 from the first quarter of 1999. The 31 Scripps Internet
sites generated $4.9 million in revenue against costs of $8.1
million during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati-based company operates 20 daily newspapers, 10
broadcast television stations and the Home &AMP; Garden Television,
Food Network and Do It Yourself cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Its operations also include Scripps Productions, a TV
programmer; United Media, which syndicates and licenses news
features and comics, and the Scripps Howard News Service.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Gun Bill-Signing  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Bemoaning America's ''sad history'' of gun
violence, President Clinton on Tuesday urged Congress to join
Maryland in passing gun safety legislation. ''Every child in
America deserves the protection you have given Maryland's
children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew by helicopter to Maryland's capital to watch Gov.
Parris Glendening sign a hard-fought law requiring built-in locks
and other strict rules for handguns. It was Clinton's first stop in
his two-day national bid to focus attention on gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The president stood on stage with Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend, shaking hands with several children, as Glendening signed
the bill. Afterward, he happily tucked a souvenir pen into his suit
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is, we're all here because too many children got
killed,'' Clinton said. ''Every single day Congress waits, we lose
12 children, nearly 90 people overall, to gun violence. Congress
should follow Maryland's lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, meanwhile, concentrated on the Project Exile Act, a
$100 million package for states that set mandatory sentences of
five years without parole for criminals who use or carry guns. The
House approved the bill on a 358-60 vote -- to the delight of the
National Rifle Association, which says the Clinton administration
is too lax in enforcing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have Gov. Glendening and President Clinton basically
engaging in political theater for the cameras while the House of
Representatives was about the business of (serious) public
policy,'' said NRA chief lobbyist James J. Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not acknowledge the Project Exile vote. He said he
hoped Congress would approve trigger locks, waiting periods for gun
show purchases and other measures to assuage a public anxious to
halt tragedies like the spate of school shootings last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people are ahead of most of the politicians,'' Clinton
said. ''We think the NRA ought to join us in this.''
</P>
<P>
   He even said if the NRA would no longer resist his proposals,
''I'd be happy for them to attack me for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the NRA has been willing to compromise, but
congressional Democrats would balk ''because the legislation did
not contain the exact language they wanted'' on gun show waiting
periods. ''I think they're more interested in having this issue for
the upcoming election than they are in resolving it,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said gun show waiting periods are crucial because of a
high rejection rate for people whose backgrounds can't be checked
within 24 hours. The extra time, he said, is worth it if it saves
one child's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the history of the United States to bring sanity to
our gun laws has been a sad history, littered with the lost lives
of people we could ill afford to lose,'' Clinton said. ''Whether
all these kids here live to have their children standing on these
steps someday fighting for some other issue, that's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Maryland, with large rural areas that are leery of
new gun laws, has demonstrated the power of public will to reduce
gun violence. Glendening predicted that in coming months, more
states will act on gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents only a beginning -- a beginning of an era when
the voice of the people and their desire to end gun violence is no
longer undercut by the voice of the gun lobby,'' the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Search Resumes for Massacre Remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- For the first time in seven
years, forensic anthropologists will resume the search for bodies
Wednesday at the site of one of the worst massacres in El
Salvador's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents and human rights groups believe that more than
1,000 people were killed by soldiers in the Dec. 11, 1981 massacre
in El Mozote, 80 miles east of San Salvador. The bodies were buried
in mass graves by residents of neighboring communities.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1992 to early 1993, the bodies of 147 villagers, mostly
children and the elderly, were uncovered in El Mozote. But the
digging stopped because of a lack of funding, said Maria Julia
Hernandez, human rights director for the San Salvador Roman
Catholic archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by a group of Argentinian forensic scientists plan to
arrive Wednesday in El Mozote to begin preliminary work. The
digging is expected to begin in about two weeks and last two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the dig will be ''a scientific action with
humanitarian goals,'' and said it could serve to gather evidence
for future legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   An amnesty approved in 1992, two months after peace accords were
signed, prevents the prosecution of soldiers, guerrillas and
civilians for any atrocities committed from 1980 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Settlement May Be Landmark  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- In a deal that could set a national precedent, the
health insurer Aetna Inc. has settled a lawsuit with Texas,
promising to give doctors more power over medical treatments and
agreeing to prohibit financial incentives for doctors to limit
care.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn said the settlement could be
a model for other suits around the country against HMOs and other
managed care companies, which allege that the health plans harm
patients in the name of profits. Aetna said it would consider
implementing the deal's provisions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement puts medical decisions precisely where they
belong, and that is in the hands of patients and their
physicians,'' Cornyn said at a news conference Tuesday. ''We
believe this agreement sets the industry standard, not just to our
state borders, but to a national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Aetna will also broaden patient rights to appeal
its decisions to deny coverage for medical care, and will establish
an ombudsman's office to advocate for patients and assist in
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna Inc. is the nation's biggest health
insurer, covering 21 million Americans, including 2.4 million in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas case is part of a national backlash against HMO care
restrictions that includes dozens of suits, along with patient
rights legislation in Congress and in state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against Aetna's U.S. Healthcare unit and several other
insurers was filed in 1998 by Cornyn's predecessor, Dan Morales.
Among other things, Morales alleged the companies illegally
compensated doctors who limited patients' medical care and
penalized those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have long argued that such compensation plans are legal,
and are designed to stop doctors from ordering unnecessary tests
and procedures that drive up the cost of heath insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Aetna wasn't assessed any penalties or required
to admit anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna spokeswomen Joyce Oberdorf said the company is considering
voluntarily extending some provisions of the deal to other states,
even those in which it hasn't been sued.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are revising our entire healthcare model. We are in an area
of increased consumer empowerment. We want to have better
relationships with physicians. We would be doing this to achieve
those goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the pact's other major provisions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Aetna will expand its definition of medically necessary care,
which is often the subject of disputes. Texas physicians will gain
authority in determining what care is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   -- Aetna will provide more information to consumers about how it
pays doctors and how it determines what care is medically
necessary. It also will broaden the circumstances under which Aetna
members can appeal denial of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   -- Aetna will allow individual doctors to choose whether to
participate in some or all of the company's health plans operating
in Texas. Previously it required doctors to participate in all of
them, even though doctors complained they were woefully underpaid
under some plans.
</P>
<P>
   -- Aetna will waive protection under the federal Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa. That law exempts
health plans doing business with self-insured employers from having
to comply with state health insurance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes at a time of great uncertainty for Aetna.
Rising health care costs and its deteriorating relations with
doctors have helped pummel the company's profits and stock price.
</P>
<P>
   In February, company chairman Richard Huber resigned and the
company has since said it plans to split its health insurance
division and financial services division into separate companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brown, Aetna regional manager, said the agreement would not
force the company or doctors to increase costs.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street viewed the deal as mildly positive for the company.
Bear Stearns analyst John Rex said the terms will potentially have
''positive implications'' for Aetna as it tries to soften its image
with consumers and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna shares gained 19 cents to $15.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mayo, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas, praised the deal. ''It takes the most direct and
potentially abusive financial incentives away so that physicians
aren't financially coerced into making decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other HMOs sued in Texas were Humana Health Plans of Texas,
PacifiCare of Texas, NYLCare Health Plans of the Southwest and
NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf Coast. Cornyn said that if the
others don't agree to a similar settlement, he'll seek to bring the
cases against them to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it looks like Aetna's new practice will benefit
consumers, but Aetna is being left off the hook for past practices
that harmed consumers,'' said Craig McDonald, director of Texans
for Public Justice, an Austin-based watchdog group. ''Aetna should
have at least paid the costs of the investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Pardon Himself  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton would not pardon himself to
avoid prosecution in the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky
investigations, his spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart was asked whether
Clinton might pardon himself before he leaves office on January 20.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater Independent Counsel Robert Ray's continuing
investigation has lent credence to an idea that once seemed
far-fetched: That an independent counsel might try to indict
Clinton for perjury or another alleged crime after the president's
term is over. Ray, who took over from Kenneth Starr last year, has
not ruled this out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you assure us the president will not pardon himself on or
before January the 20th?'' a reporter asked during Tuesday's
regular White House press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Lockhart replied.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also said he knows of no discussion between Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore about a possible presidential pardon should
Gore succeed his boss as president.
</P>
<P>
   A Little Rock, Ark., federal judge fined Clinton $90,000 after
concluding a year ago that he gave ''false, misleading and evasive
answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process''
during a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
That suit, later dismissed, led to the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton in contempt of court,
citing 10 specific instances in which Clinton denied that he had
sexual relations with Lewinsky and said he could not recall being
alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   Wright specified civil, not criminal, contempt in order to
preserve the independent counsel's option of prosecuting Clinton
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The only president ever pardoned was Richard Nixon. President
Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon in office, said he never had a
deal with Nixon about granting a pardon.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Historian a Holocaust Denier  </HEADLINE>
BY MARA D. BELLABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A judge branded historian David Irving as an
anti-Semite racist and an apologist for Hitler in a strongly worded
decision Tuesday, ruling that an American scholar was justified in
calling him a Holocaust denier.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups hailed the verdict against Irving, who sued
Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Books, over a 1994 book
that he said damaged his academic reputation and accused him of
playing down the horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had argued that David Irving was partisan and an apologist
for the Nazis and anti-Semitic,'' Lipstadt said after the verdict.
''The judge went further than I did in his ruling -- and called him
a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, issued a statement
saying the judge sent a message to the world ''that the arguments
used by Irving and others to deny and diminish the events of the
Holocaust are not within the realm of acceptable or reasonable
discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   In his two-hour judgment delivered to a packed courtroom, High
Court Judge Charles Gray found that Irving ''misrepresented and
distorted'' historical evidence and that he is ''anti-Semitic and
racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who
promote neo-Nazism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Irving has for his own ideological reasons persistently and
deliberately misrepresented and manipulated'' history to paint
Adolf Hitler in a favorable light, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, the author of nearly 30 books, including ''Hitler's
War,'' said he does not deny that Jews were killed by the Nazis,
but challenges the number and manner of Jewish concentration camp
deaths. He called Tuesday's ruling ''perverse'' and said he would
seek to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Briton represented himself during the nine-week,
nonjury hearing, but as the loser must pay the huge legal costs,
estimated at $3.2 million, for Lipstadt and her publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who has been banned from Germany, Canada and Australia,
maintained during the trial that he had been the victim of a
30-year international campaign to destroy his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that after publication of Lipstadt's book, ''Denying
the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,'' his
academic work was increasingly shunned by publishers and agents.
</P>
<P>
   Under British libel law, Lipstadt and Penguin had to prove not
only that Irving distorted the historical record, but that the
distortion was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt, who holds the Dorot Chair in Modern Jewish and
Holocaust Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, briefly hugged
supporters after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sent his congratulations to
Lipstadt ''in the name of Israel and the entire Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Her struggle and victory is the victory of the free world
against the forces of darkness that would wish to obliterate from
memory the (depths) humanity reached,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Sky TV on Tuesday, Irving denied being a
racist and repeated his claim that Jewish deaths during the
Holocaust have been exaggerated. Gassings of Jews occurred, he
said, ''but on nothing like the scale that's talked about now.''
</P>
<P>
   And shortly before the verdict, Irving said he had reviewed some
of his theories during the trial, but his basic position remained
that ''the Holocaust has been grossly inflated and there has been a
hell of a lot of lying by the eyewitnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups expressed relief at the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's decision definitely places Irving where he belongs --
not as a historian, but as a leading apologist for those who seek
to whitewash the most heinous crime in human history,'' said the
Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Los Angeles-based movement dedicated to
victims of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here is a man who carried out a serious attempt to debunk the
Holocaust,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, the center's founder. ''But it
is not the Holocaust that has been debunked, it is David Irving
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Israel gave Lipstadt and Penguin's lawyers the
previously secret memoirs of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann,
which contained methodical descriptions of the genocide, including
timetables of death transports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a victory for 6 million voices that cannot speak for
themselves,'' said Rabbi Jonathan Romain, son of a Holocaust
survivor and a spokesman for Reform Synagogues in Britain. ''It is
a defeat for the Holocaust denial industry and the bigotry that
lies behind it.''

<HEADLINE> Allegations Prompt Bush Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A church-run home for troubled teen-agers
has been accused of abuse, prompting criticism of Gov. George W.
Bush's push to exempt such religious child care centers from some
state oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has encouraged faith-based groups to provide alternatives
to social services traditionally provided by the government. He
pushed for a law in 1997 that gave church child care centers a
separate licensing procedure from other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Two people have been arrested in connection with abuse
allegations at the Roloff Homes, run by People's Baptist Church in
Corpus Christi. The center is one of six religious youth facilities
approved under the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that church-run centers may not face as many
inspections as government programs would and say their records are
not open to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is that there are no accountability measures,''
said Samantha Smoot, executive director of the Texas Freedom
Network, which monitors the religious right. ''They feel they are
protected from regulator oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is calling for a full investigation of the abuse
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Roloff Homes superintendent Allen Smith, 42, was arrested on
Friday on charges of unlawfully restraining and injuring two men,
ages 18 and 17, last month. He is free on a $10,000 bond. His
lawyer, Grant Jones, said he would be cleared because state law
gives custodial care facilities the right to use force in some
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Wiley Cameron Sr., pastor of People's Baptist and chief
executive of the Roloff Homes, was arrested on charges of failing
to provide records requested by a grand jury. His lawyers provided
the records shortly afterward and Cameron was released. No charges
were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were not sure if the 17-year-old man allegedly
injured was staying in one of the adult homes on the 500-acre
property, or one of the homes reserved for minors.
</P>
<P>
   Only the homes for juvenile boys and girls received the
alternative accreditation. Nueces County Sheriff Larry Olivarez
said deputies are investigating seven other allegations of abuse in
the adult homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services is
investigating the allegations regarding the two men, said agency
spokeswoman Marla Sheely. The Roloff Homes are also appealing a
previous negative finding against its operation, she said,
declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1997 law, the state approves private, faith-based
accrediting bodies that can then license individual child-care
providers. Only one accrediting body, the Texas Association of
Christian Child-Care Agencies Inc., has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   David Blaser, president of the association, said it forces the
six child-care groups its regulates to follow the same standards as
those licensed by the state, including submitting to periodic
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   However, several child-care advocates said the directors of most
child care centers do not also sit on the boards of their
regulators, as Cameron does with Blaser's association.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Noble, an attorney for Texans Care for Children, a
nonprofit group, said the arrangement looked like a conflict of
interest. ''I think that is sort of obvious,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 112,000 Honda lawnmowers were recalled
Tuesday because of the danger of fire from leaky fuel tanks, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   America Honda Motor Co. reported 25 cases of the tanks' seams
cracking or splitting, but no fires or injuries. The commission
said Honda voluntarily recalled the mowers.

<HEADLINE> ABC Pulls 'Wonderland' Off the Air  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC has dropped its controversial drama
''Wonderland'' after just two airings.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving six episodes unaired, ''Wonderland'' will be off at
least through the May sweeps, according to ABC, with any future
after that undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the psychiatric ward of a fictional Manhattan hospital,
the gritty drama won almost universal critical praise, but,
scheduled against NBC's ''ER,'' it failed to win many viewers. Last
Thursday, its audience combined with that of CBS' faltering new
series ''Falcone'' added up to roughly half of the ''ER''
viewership in that time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its troubles, ''Wonderland'' drew criticism from
mental health professionals who said the series demonstrated
''reckless indifference'' to the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Peter Berg responded that the show's purpose was
''to provide a catalyst for honest dialogue about the often
misunderstood and inaccurately represented world of the mentally
ill.''
</P>
<P>
   This Thursday, ABC will air a Peter Jennings-anchored news
special, ''Vanished,'' in the 10-to-11 p.m. EDT hour.
</P>
<P>
   Newsmagazine ''20/20 Downtown'' returns to that slot next week.

<HEADLINE> FBI Moves on Stewart Investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- The FBI executed search warrants at Sunjet
Aviation Inc. on Tuesday as part of its investigation into the
Learjet crash in October that killed golfer Payne Stewart and five
others.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was in connection with an ongoing investigation into
possible violations of federal laws pertaining to maintenance and
record keeping,'' said agent Brian Kensel.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI served the warrants on three buildings and four aircraft
at SunJet's facilities at Orlando Sanford Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Kensel said authorities confiscated a number of Sunjet records,
though he could not say how many.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 25, 1999, Stewart's plane crashed into a South Dakota
pasture four hours after it left Orlando on a flight to Texas,
flying 1,400 miles apparently on autopilot before it ran out of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials suspect the jet lost cabin pressure soon
after taking off, causing all six on board to die or lose
consciousness from lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Sunjet answered phone calls early Tuesday evening
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Former female ABC sportscaster alleges discrimination  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A 52-year-old, two-time Olympic gold medalist
who set 18 world swimming records before setting out on a 30-year
broadcasting career has sued ABC Sports, saying she was
discriminated against because of her age.
</P>
<P>
   Donna deVarona filed the $50 million lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan late Monday, saying ABC terminated her most
recent employment with ABC Sports because of her age and gender.
</P>
<P>
   ABC responded to the lawsuit with a statement, saying: ''As a
result of the change in events covered by ABC Sports, including the
loss of the Olympics, deVarona's role had diminished greatly over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. deVarona and her representatives were advised of this fact
over the years and she was encouraged to look for work elsewhere.
We believe Ms. deVarona was treated fairly and that this suit has
no merit,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, deVarona alleged ABC signed her to a free-lance
agreement as a sportscaster in 1991 and then treated her in an
''intentional, calculated, callous and opportunistic'' way to
appeal to a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said she was frequently frustrated by discriminatory
conduct during her initial broadcasting stint from 1965 through
1976, when she quit because she was ''unable to break the
discriminatory barriers facing a pioneering female sports
broadcaster.''
</P>
<P>
   She later returned to ABC, serving in 1980 as the first female
host of Olympic coverage at the games in Moscow and in 1983 as a
sportcaster and as an assistant to then-President of ABC Sports and
News Roone Arledge, a job she said she was reluctant to take
because of past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the 1991 contract, deVarona began receiving fewer
assignments, often of inferior quality, and was paid less as ABC
Sports tried to reach younger television viewers with younger
sportscasters, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   She was advised by ABC executives that her age was detrimental
to her career advancement, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it added, ABC Sports executives told her as she
pitched one of her programming ideas that the sports department was
focusing ''on younger demographics for all sports.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a woman who was a former vice president of ABC Sports
programming told her ABC Sports was eager to recapture the ''young
18 to 39 male market'' and that she should consider looking for
work elsewhere because her age was catching up to her.
</P>
<P>
   DeVarona began her sportscasting career at age 17 when she
agreed after the 1964 Tokyo Olympics to participate in a live
telecast at the Senior Men's National Swimming and Diving
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, she covered ABC's Summer Olympic telecasts in
1968, 1972, 1976 and 1984 as well as Winter Olympic telecasts in
1984, 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, deVarona was working as an on-air host, writer and
producer and in 1991 won her first Emmy as a producer for a Special
Olympics presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she was the lead reporter covering the Winter Olympics
ice skating battle between Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Other assignments sometimes included the Indy 500, the Super
Bowl, figure skating, gymnastics, track and field and the New York
City Marathon.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Historian Lost Libel Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Historian David Irving, the author of nearly 30
books, disputes that the systematic slaughter of millions of Jews
in gas chambers at Nazi concentration camps ever took place.
</P>
<P>
   Irving argues that killing 6 million Jews during World War II
would have been logistically impossible and claims more people died
in Allied bombing raids than in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Briton, who lost a libel suit Tuesday, also
argued that most fatalities in concentration camps were due to
disease and starvation, not poison gas, and that the British made
up the accounts of the gas chambers as anti-German propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements, Irving claimed there were no gas chambers
at Auschwitz. But during a hearing on his libel suit, which a
British judge dismissed Tuesday, Irving conceded that gassing of
Jews had taken place ''on some scale.''
</P>
<P>
   But he continued to cast doubt on many pieces of evidence of the
Holocaust, including the diary of Anne Frank. He also claimed that
Adolf Hitler opposed the liquidation of the Jews and did not know
about the ''Final Solution'' until 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Irving was born in the southern English county of Essex in 1938,
the son of a naval commander and writer. He developed a fascination
with Germany and as a young man spent a year laboring in the Ruhr
steelworks in West Germany before returning to England to write
historical articles.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sued U.S. scholar Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher,
Penguin Books, over a 1994 book that he said damaged his academic
reputation and accused him of playing down the horrors of the
Holocaust. He seemed to revel in the controversy that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My views are independent and sometimes unorthodox, but never
antidemocratic,'' he told the High Court. ''I am not
anti-Semitic.''

<HEADLINE> Sens. Push Transplant Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of senators hinted Tuesday
they would block any legislation that allows the nation's limited
supply of donated organs to continue to be distributed to the
closest transplant patients rather than the sickest.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by Sens. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., unveiled a proposal that would base organ
distribution on medical need and require broader sharing of organs
among geographic areas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would strengthen the Department of Health and
Human Services' authority over the private company, United Network
for Organ Sharing, it hired to run the distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal largely mirrors changes the Clinton administration
has sought.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, patients who live in the same area as
donors get the first crack at organs, even if a sicker patient
lives just outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your zip code has a lot more to do with your receiving an
organ than your state of health,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.,
who joined Fitzgerald, Schumer and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.
''That's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   United Network and many transplant centers -- particularly
smaller hospitals -- fear eliminating geographic barriers would
siphon away locally donated organs to other centers and jeopardize
their programs.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is which side should have the power to write rules
governing the distribution of organs, and what those rules should
be. Rather than a partisan issue, it generally pits lawmakers from
major recipient states that have large transplant centers against
those from high-donor states where patients now get transplants
fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzgerald-Schumer measure is meant as an alternative to a
bipartisan effort led by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a former heart
and lung transplant surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Frist's still-evolving proposal, scheduled for committee action
on Wednesday, would allow the transplant network to write
allocation policy. But if Health and Human Services and the private
contractor cannot agree, an expert committee would make the final
policy decisions, based on a set of guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   HHS has not signed on to the proposal because it wants those
guidelines to explicitly call for broader sharing of organs over
larger geographic areas -- as the Fitzgerald-Schumer bill would do.
</P>
<P>
   Frist met Tuesday with HHS Secretary Donna Shalala and Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to try and work out the final details of a
compromise. No deal was reached, although Senate staff planned to
continue talking Tuesday night. On Wednesday, the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee was set to consider Frist's
bill, with or without a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House has backed United Network, passing
legislation that would strip HHS of its authority to set policy and
overturn its proposed new rules. The Clinton administration has
promised a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said they would wait to see what Frist's final bill
looks like before deciding on a strategy. But they said that
anything that does not increase public accountability is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will pass a good bill in the United States Senate, or we
will pass no bill,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,800 people die each year -- about 13 per day --
waiting for organ transplants. There currently are 68,530 people
waiting for transplants.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall on Blue-Chip Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bonds tumbled Tuesday as money flowed
into corporate and other categories of bonds as well as into
blue-chip stocks. Yields rose sharply from Monday's 11-month lows.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond plunged 1 15/32
points, or $14.69 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, shot up to 5.76 percent from 5.66
percent late Monday, which had been the lowest level since May 3,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Wall Street strategists have been reminding
investors that many old-line companies in the energy, financial and
consumer sectors may reward investors seeking stable, growing
profits. The Dow industrials rose more than 100 points Tuesday to
its highest close since Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with long-term Treasury yields sinking, traders
sought higher returns from other categories of bonds, including
corporate debt and agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader bond market, short-term notes fell 5/32 point to
7/32 point, while intermediate notes fell ] point to } point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.84 percent as the
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Monday's auction to 5.67
percent. Six-month yields were 6.10 percent, as the discount fell
0.03 percentage point from the weekly auction to 5.83 percent.
One-year yields were 6.12 percent as the discount rose 0.02
percentage point from late Monday to 5.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell to 5.75 percent from 6.06 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 at 95 29/32. The average yield to
maturity was 5.91 percent, up from 5.90 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 132.30; Dow Up 100.52  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply Tuesday,
wiping out all of its gains for the year as volatile biotechnology
stocks became the latest high-tech segment to falter. Blue-chip
issues benefited once again from the technology slump, and the Dow
Jones industrials reached their highest levels since January.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 132.30 to close at 4,055.90. The
choppy trading that has characterized the market in the past two
weeks returned, with the Nasdaq paring an early loss of 178 points
to fewer than 10 before heading lower again.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of tumultuous selling, the Nasdaq is now
fractionally lower for the year and nearly 20 percent below its
peak of 5,048.62, which it reached March 10. Still, the index is up
a stunning 56 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The resurgent Dow Jones
industrial average rose 100.52 to close at 11,287.08, its highest
level since Jan. 20, when it closed at 11,351.30.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.87 to 1,500.59.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rotation continues,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment
officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co., referring to investors' turn away from
high-tech and back to old reliable stocks like the Dow issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fast and it's volatile, but it's really becoming the
norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Two downbeat earnings reports derailed the technology sector.
Biogen, which has stronger earnings than most biotech companies,
said it earned 41 cents a share in the first quarter, below Wall
Street expectations of 43 cents. Biogen cited a slowdown in demand
for its multiple sclerosis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen fell 12 to 53 and dragged down other biotech firms.
Genentech tumbled 20 to 136{.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Motorola said it expects second-quarter and
full-year 2000 earnings to fall short of analysts' views due to
price cuts that are shrinking profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from Motorola, which makes cellular phones and
semiconductors, deflated enthusiasm from its strong first-quarter
earnings report, released late Monday. Motorola shares plummeted
26| to 123|, dragging many other technology companies with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some concern that what's hurting Motorola could affect
the rest of the techs,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst
at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said nervous investors are continuing to shed technology
stocks that may not be worthy of their valuations, which are
generally much higher relative to earnings than the industrial
stocks that dominate the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than a few portfolio managers found themselves
overexposed to technology last quarter,'' he said. ''Some are
getting out, and some are just sitting on their hands waiting for
the market to settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   Some high-profile Nasdaq stocks fell for no fundamental reason,
analysts said. Cisco Systems fell 2 9/16 to 70, Oracle fell 5[ to
77] and JDS Uniphase fell 7 15/16 to 102 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate earnings reporting season begins in earnest this
week, and while profit growth for most companies is expected to be
quite strong, investors are proving unwilling to tolerate any
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, Wall Street strategists have been reminding
investors that many old-line companies in the energy, financial and
consumer sectors may reward investors seeking stable, growing
profits. Tuesday, General Electric gained 1 15/16 to 161] and Alcoa
rose 2 11/16 to 70].
</P>
<P>
   But Rice pointed out that breadth, the difference between the
numbers of rising and falling stocks, remains very narrow, with
just a handful of Dow issues making sharp gains Tuesday. Most
investors are continuing to shift money from sector to sector on a
daily basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The narrowness of the rally in blue-chips is disconcerting,''
he said. ''It shows you just how nervous the market is.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.19 billion
shares, compared with 1.05 billion in the previous session. On the
Nasdaq, decliners led by a 3-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.53 to 510.13.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 2.4
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Edges Higher Vs. Currencies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against other major
currencies on Tuesday, but traders remained hesitant before some
major economic reports and financial policy meetings later in the
week that could move the market.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, dollar was quoted at 107.09 Japanese
yen, up from 106.47 yen at the same point on Monday, while the euro
was quoted at 95.97 cents, down from 96.16 cents.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, there were no government reports on
the U.S. economy to guide the market, which has been handcuffed in
advance of the monthly inflation readings due on Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also said to be worried about Thursday's meeting
by the European central bank, which could produce another
euro-boosting increase in short-term interest rates, and a weekend
gathering by the Group of Seven industrial nations, where officials
are expected to discuss the ongoing threat of a strong yen on
Japan's fragile economy.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6397 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6382 on Friday, and 1.4638 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.4612. The British pound rose to $1.5848 compared with late
Friday's quote of $1.5848.
</P>
<P>
   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed
rate. Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0376
German marks, up from 2.0344 on Monday; 6.8336 French francs, up
from 6.8229; and 2,017.18 Italian lire, up from 2,014.01 lire.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Resuming U.S. Phone Links  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba said Tuesday it will soon resume direct
telephone links with the United States now that American companies
have unfrozen $6.2 million payments.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Communist Party daily Granma did not say exactly when the
direct links would be re-established by the Cuban phone company
Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A., or ETECSA. The move was
taken after a U.S. federal appeal court said relatives of three men
shot down by Cuban jets cannot claim the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban phone company stopped most direct service to the
United States a year ago, after the men's relatives sued Cuba for
damages and attempted to force the Cuban phone company to pay. The
appeals court ruled that ETECSA is not a legal stand-in for the
Cuban government and can't be fined in lieu of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The payments have been frozen since December 1998, awaiting a
final ruling. Direct service was cut in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, calls between Cuba and the United States have been
rerouted largely through third countries, causing only minor
disruptions to service.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the families of three of four fliers killed on
Feb. 24, 1996, won a $187 million judgment against Cuba and the
Cuban Air Force. The families were unable to collect because the
State Department objected and because President Clinton waived a
new anti-terrorism law allowing the families to be paid using
blocked Cuban funds.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King ruled that Clinton could
not waive the anti-terrorism law and awarded the families the $6.2
million. The largest payment was to have come from AT&AMP;T, more than
$4.1 million. MCI International Inc. faced the second largest
payment, about $1.05 million.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Atlanta reversed King's decision
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the Miami-based group exile group Brothers to
the Rescue were searching for Cuban immigrants on rafts when Cuban
MiGs shot down two planes in the Florida Straits that separate Cuba
and the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Three men -- Armando Alejandre, 45; and pilots Carlos Costa, 29,
and Mario de la Pena Jr., 24 -- were U.S. citizens, making their
families eligible to sue under U.S. law.

<HEADLINE> Report Looks At Disabled Students  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Record numbers of students with disabilities
are being educated in regular classrooms and few teachers are
specially trained to instruct them, the Education Department said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, 46 percent of the nation's 5.9 million special
education students spent most of their time in a regular classroom,
up slightly from the previous year's 45.9 percent, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Heumann, assistant secretary of the office of special
education and rehabilitative service, on Tuesday praised the end of
the ''days of turning away the students with disabilities at the
schoolhouse door.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, research on teachers suggests that students might
not find a qualified educator waiting for them. Just 330,000 of the
nation's 2.2 million teaching force are specially hired to teach
special education students; in 1996-97, 8 percent of them were
improperly certified to teach those classes.
</P>
<P>
   Among general teachers, preparedness is worse: Four out of five
teachers with special education students in their classes feel
ill-prepared to teach them, officials said. General education
teachers are not required to have special education certificates,
though nearly half of states require some coursework in special
education.
</P>
<P>
   Heumann said colleges need to focus on training any teacher to
instruct special-needs children -- whose disabilities range from the
physical to problems with learning and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're looking at making the general teaching population
more effective, you need to have that be a basic part of the
training,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That training includes persuading more teacher candidates to be
choose working with special education children, said Heumann, whose
wheelchair kept her out of classrooms when she was a student.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Gardner, an associate professor at California State
University, Sacramento, which combines special education and
regular education training, said graduates there usually go on to
teach in special education classrooms. However, they are trained to
teach special education students in regular classes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''District administrations are seeing the value of this as a way
of educating future teachers,'' she said. ''We can't graduate them
fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1975, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which
gives states money to help end discrimination against disabled
children, requires that disabled children be schooled with other
students whenever possible. Previously, children were often put in
institutions or separate programs. The department considered
children as included in a regular classroom atmosphere if they
spent at least 80 percent of their time in regular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that fewer college instructors are
preparing teaching candidates to work with blind students.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gets Asset Forfeiture Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents whose kids get caught growing
marijuana at home will be among those in less danger of losing
their property under legislation Congress completed Tuesday that
would make it harder for the federal government to seize assets
connected to crime.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, supported by groups ranging from the American
Civil Liberties Union to the National Rifle Association, passed the
House on Tuesday on a voice vote. The bill has already won Senate
approval and is expected to be signed by the president.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would shift the burden of proof in asset
forfeiture cases from the property owner, where it now lies, to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Key sponsors, including the chairmen and ranking Democrats of
both the House and Senate Judiciary committees, have argued that
while civil forfeiture is a valuable law enforcement tool,
particularly against drug traffickers, changes are needed to stop
abuses that victimize innocent property owners.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, said House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
''returns civil asset forfeiture to the ranks of respected law
enforcement tools that can be used without risk to the civil
liberties and property rights of American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary panel cited as examples of abuse a 1993 case
where police in a Seattle suburb seized a Mexican restaurant as
part of the arrest of the brother of the owner who, without the
knowledge of the owner, was charged with selling a small quantity
of cocaine in the restaurant restroom. After five days of lost
business and negative media attention, the owner's lawyer got the
decision reversed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Houston seized a motel in
a high-crime area of the city, charging that the owners had
''tacitly approved'' alleged drug activity by guests in the motel's
rooms. There were no allegations that the owners participated in
any crimes, and the government, before dropping its forfeiture
proceedings five months later, at one point recommended that the
motel raise room rates as a security measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would have believed that under our current law the
government could confiscate a person's private property on a mere
showing of probable cause?'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan,
top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone the government seized nearly $500 million worth
of assets linked to criminal activities under federal forfeiture
procedures dating back to 19th century admiralty laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the government must show ''by a preponderance of
the evidence'' that homes, cars, boats or airplanes it seeks to
seize are linked to crime.
</P>
<P>
   It allows federal judges to release property to the owner if
continued government possession causes substantial hardship to the
owner, extends the time a property owner has to challenge a seizure
in court and ends the requirement that a person seeking to recover
property post a bond with the court worth 10 percent of the
property value.
</P>
<P>
   To win Justice Department approval, writers of the bill also
added several provisions to strengthen crime-fighting tools,
including giving federal courts the authority to issue civil
restraining orders when there is a strong probability the
government will prevail in a forfeiture and there is danger of the
property being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   A court may also dismiss a claim brought by a property owner if
the owner is a fugitive from the United States.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Low-Power Radio Plan Defended  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It started out with what regulators thought was
a simple way to squeeze more voices into increasingly consolidated
airwaves: mini-radio stations that could cover several miles at a
time to serve up local news, sports and music.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan by the Federal Communications Commission to
authorize hundreds of low-power FM stations rankled a formidable
opponent -- the nation's commercial broadcasters. As the industry
gathers here for its annual meeting, undoing the FCC's action is
high on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's fuzzier, the static from low-power FM or
the FCC's thinking on the issue,'' said Edward Fritts, head of the
National Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, the driving force behind low-power
radio, took the stage here Tuesday and chided the industry for
trying to derail the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why in the midst of all this opportunity for broadcasters have
you chosen to muster your considerable resources in Washington and
around the country to deny churches and schools and community-based
organizations just a little piece of the broadcast pie?'' Kennard
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned why the group had ''squandered its goodwill
at the FCC'' in its battle against low-power. Kennard offered to
work with the industry to address its concerns but stressed the new
service would not cause harmful interference with existing FM
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial broadcasters disagree and say that the new, low-power
stations would ruin the integrity of the FM channel. They have
galvanized support on Capitol Hill, where legislation that would
curtail the number of low-power stations the FCC could license is
winding through the House. Floor action could come this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill boosts the interference protections between neighboring
channels from what the FCC had authorized and requires the
commission to set up an experimental program in nine markets to see
what would happen if those protections were relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials have asserted that they took a conservative
approach in deciding to create the low-power service, and that they
provided ample protection to existing stations. They also say that
increasing the buffers between stations means that there would be
up to two-thirds fewer stations licensed. A market like
Indianapolis would have had nine stations under the commission
plan, but none under the legislation, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure has drawn the backing of some surprising allies,
like National Public Radio. Because most public radio stations are
more tightly packed together and have restrictions on their power
level, they are more vulnerable to interference, said NPR president
Kevin Klose. The group also is concerned that the low-power
stations might interfere with reading services for the blind that
are carried on subcarrier channels.
</P>
<P>
   And local broadcasters meeting here have their own worries.
Thomas Young, who operates an AM and FM station in Napa Valley, 40
miles outside of San Francisco, said some broadcasters are leery
because of bad experiences with pirate radio. Even though the FCC
has set restrictions on who is eligible for the stations, ''we of
course are nervous about what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the transition from analog to digital TV, which
stations must complete by 2006, Kennard pushed aside the idea
floated by some broadcasters of pushing back the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delay is simply not an option,'' Kennard told the group. The
transition ''will happen as sure as day follows night.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fritts said broadcasters are making investments to upgrade
their stations to digital without any assurances that their digital
signals will be carried by cable companies on those systems or that
the quality of digital TV sets on the market will improve.

<HEADLINE> CSX Corp. President Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- CSX Corp. said Tuesday that its president,
Ronald J. Conway, has resigned and his duties will be assumed by
John W. Snow, the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   CSX, headquartered in Richmond, operates the largest rail
network in the eastern United States and also provides intermodal,
container shipping and contract logistics services.
</P>
<P>
   Conway, who joined CSX from Conrail in 1998 and was named
president in 1999, resigned to pursue other interests, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are grateful to Ron for his contributions, most notably for
leading CSX Transportation through the complex integration of
Conrail properties into our network,'' Snow said. ''I am pleased
that he will be staying with us as a consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway's resignation comes as CSX faces a financial squeeze from
its takeover of Conrail.
</P>
<P>
   It has high debt and has seen profits tumble as a result of
freight congestion and other problems stemming from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal officials earlier this month reported
serious track defects on several key CSX routes as well as a lack
of quality control in the company's track-maintenance and
inspection programs.

<HEADLINE> Takeover Report Lifts Ben &AMP; Jerry's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock price rose Tuesday
following a report on attempts to buy out the company built on
quirky ice cream flavors and social activism.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. were up $1.18} to $34.93}
at 4 p.m. Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have
surged nearly 70 percent since the company first disclosed it was a
possible acquisition target in early December.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of
investors who follow a socially responsible agenda, led by company
co-founder Ben Cohen, had pulled out of the bidding for the South
Burlington company.
</P>
<P>
   That development appeared to leave two large competitors working
against each other to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   None of the principals in the several deals being considered by
the Ben &AMP; Jerry's board would comment Tuesday. Ben &AMP; Jerry's
officials refused to confirm reports the company's board was
meeting Tuesday to consider the remaining offers.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. of Oakland, Calif., and Unilever
NV, a Dutch and English conglomerate that's also in the ice cream
novelty business, have both made offers to the Ben &AMP; Jerry's board
to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever also was part of the group that teamed up with Cohen in
a bid organized through the Meadowbrook Lane Capital to buy the
company and take it private.
</P>
<P>
   That $38 a share offer was withdrawn late last week, in part
because it would have saddled Ben &AMP; Jerry's with too much debt, the
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was withdrawn after Dreyer's, which also produces a
premium ice cream under the trade names Edy's Grand and Edy's
Dreamery, sweetened its buyout offer to $35 to $38 in stock, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Meadowbrook hoped to make another bid involving Social Venture
Network members and Unilever might be interested in reconfiguring
that coalition, the Journal said.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, which makes such ice cream brands as Breyer's and
Klondike, still has a separate bid for $43 a share in cash for Ben
&AMP; Jerry's.

<HEADLINE> Women-Owned Businesses Booming  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women business owners are heating up the U.S.
economy, yet they remain frozen out of advantages enjoyed by their
male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message from a bipartisan group of lawmakers who want
to reverse the trend, starting with a June 4-5 summit in Kansas
City, Mo. The goal of the meeting is developing an agenda for
Congress and the new president in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know how to put together a bid, we know the rules. We want
to know what's happening at the other end as to why we're not
getting the contracts, why women aren't a designated group under
SBA guidelines,'' said Janet Poppen, a St. Louis accountant who
serves on the National Association of Women Business Owners
advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of women-owned businesses belies the obstacles.
Women-owned firms number more than 9 million nationwide and are one
of the swiftest-growing segments of the economy, annually
generating more than $3.6 trillion in sales, according to Census
Bureau and NAWBO estimates. Still, they face challenges that range
from no access to capital to inability to buy health insurance to
balancing responsibilities caring for children or aging parents.
</P>
<P>
   These firms employ about 27.5 million people in the United
States. That's more than all the Fortune 500 companies combined,
said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who once owned a Dallas
candy-making business. ''We must create a climate in which they can
flourish,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Poppen, who went into business for herself 15 years ago, said a
common problem for women is lack of access to capital. Many women
start service businesses, which are not asset-heavy and are
difficult to sell to lenders, she said: ''It comes down to personal
net worth, and if you're a single parent such as I was, you don't
have the asset base,'' Poppen said.
</P>
<P>
   On the schedule of featured speakers are Boeing Co. Vice
President Debby Hopkins; the editor of Working Mother magazine,
Lisa Benenson, along with public officials including Whitman and
Aida Alvarez, head of the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and Democratic Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana,
Dianne Feinstein of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts are
scheduled to attend, along with GOP Sens. Christopher Bond and John
Ashcroft of Missouri, Sam Brownback of Kansas and Olympia Snowe of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   From the House, GOP Reps. Kenny Hulshof and Jim Talent of
Missouri plan to attend, as do Democratic Reps. Karen McCarthy of
Missouri and Dennis Moore of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never heard of anything this size, with this kind of
bipartisan support, focusing on women's business issues,'' New
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who plans to attend, said
Tuesday.

   DETROIT (AP) -- With sales and profits at record highs, Ford
Motor Co. has rewarded its top executive with a boost in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said Tuesday that president and chief executive Jac Nasser
was paid $10.2 million in salary, bonus and dividends in 1999.
That's a 48 percent raise from his $6.9 million package in 1998,
when he was head of Ford's automotive operations.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser also received stock options worth $7 million, cashed in
$802,740 in previously granted options and received $2.9 million in
stock under a long-term executive incentive program.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 pay packages for Ford's top executives were disclosed
in the automaker's annual proxy statement filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Top executive pay at Ford is determined in part by formulas that
calculate how the automaker met financial and management goals for
the year or, in the case of stock options, over several years.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation can vary widely from year to year based on the
amount of previously granted stock options the executive decides to
cash in and the extent to which the company's financial performance
affects the long-term incentive plans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, retiring Ford chairman Alex Trotman cashed in $30.1
million in stock options on top of $14.9 million in salary, bonus
and dividends.
</P>
<P>
   In its proxy, Ford's executive compensation committee said Ford
met most of its financial goals for the year. In 1999, Ford earned
$7.2 billion, or $5.86 per share, up 22 percent over operating
earnings of $5.9 billion, or $4.72 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee also said compensation was reduced slightly
because the company failed to meet an unspecified target for
quality, based on vehicle warranty repairs and customer
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser holds $20.2 million in Ford stock options that he can
cash in at any time, as well as $10.5 million in options that he
cannot exercise yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. was paid $1.5 million in
restricted stock options for his job as chairman. Ford is the
great-grandson of founder Henry Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The other Ford executives and their reported compensation
include:
</P>
<P>
   -- W. Wayne Booker, vice chairman, who received $3.5 million in
salary, bonus and dividends, as well as $2.5 million in stock under
the long-term incentive plan. Booker also exercised options for a
gain of $735,964 and received new options worth $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- John M. Devine, Ford's former executive vice president who
retired Sept. 1, received $3 million in salary, bonus and
dividends, $2.6 million in stock under the long-term incentive plan
and new options worth $1.75 million. Devine exercised no options.
</P>
<P>
   -- Richard Parry-Jones, group vice president for product
development, received $1.8 million in salary, bonus and dividends;
$1.2 million in stock under the long-term incentive plan; exercised
options for a gain of $380,315 and received new options worth
$876,500.
</P>
<P>
   -- Peter J. Pestillo, vice chairman, received $3.3 million in
salary, bonus and dividends; $2 million in stock under the
long-term incentive plan; exercised options for a gain of $155,687
and received new options worth $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Robert L. Rewey, group vice president for marketing, sales and
service, received $2.5 million in salary, bonus and dividends; $2
million in stock under the long-term incentive plan; exercised
options for a gain of $3.1 million, and received new options worth
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. said last week that chairman and CEO Jack
Smith was paid $6.9 million in salary, bonus and dividends, and
cashed in $6 million in stock options. He was also given $5.25
million in stock under a long-term executive incentive plan and was
granted an estimated $7.9 million in stock options.

<HEADLINE> Media General Profits Surge in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General's profits jumped 27 percent
in the first quarter on strong growth in its publishing and
television operations, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned $14.4 million, or 55 cents per share, for the
first three months of the year, up from $11.3 million, or 42 cents
per share, in the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings matched analysts' projections for the quarter and
reflect a $13.6 million cut in interest expense and an $8.2 million
increase in interest income, both aided by the October sale of the
company's cable television division.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue increased 4 percent, to $199 million from $191.8 million
in the first quarter of 1999. Television revenues increased 9
percent, to $40.4 million from $37 million, and publishing revenues
climbed to $132 million from $127.9 million the previous year, up 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The newsprint division, however, posted an operating loss of
$5.3 million for the first quarter compared with income of $3.1
million for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Media General's chairman and chief executive, J. Stewart Bryan
III, said he expects that newsprint operations will show an
improvement as market conditions change.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major (newsprint) producers are trying to raise their
prices this month, and if they are successful, the performance of
our newsprint division should improve substantially in the second
half of the year,'' Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Media General is an independent, publicly owned communications
company with interests in newspapers, television, interactive
media, recycled newsprint production and diversified information
services primarily in the southeastern United States.

<HEADLINE> Cold, Meningitis Drug Disappoints  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug that appeared promising as a cure for the common cold and
viral meningitis showed disappointing results in three large-scale
studies released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the results released by ViroPharma Inc., the makers of
pleconaril, sent its stock price plummeting, but officials of the
small company said they are confident they can prove the drug
works.
</P>
<P>
   Pleconaril has been closely watched because of early studies
suggesting it is effective against both the common cold and viral
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   While the just-completed studies offer hints that pleconaril
eases symptoms, they failed to produce the kind of clear-cut
evidence of effectiveness that is usually needed to win Food and
Drug Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to have great confidence in pleconaril, especially
for treating viral respiratory disease'' -- the common cold, chief
executive Claude Nash told investors and analysts in a conference
call Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors disagreed, sending shares of ViroPharma down $48.50 to
$23.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier study, pleconaril shortened the duration of a
common cold by about 3{ days. This time, using a somewhat different
definition of a cold's conclusion, the drug shortened the misery
from 9.4 days to 7.7 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, pleconaril also significantly reduced users'
nasal secretions and coughing and improved their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if pleconaril continues to show some benefit for
picornavirus-related colds, eventually it may well have a role,''
said Dr. Ronald Turner, a cold expert at the Medical University of
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. McKinlay, ViroPharma's research director, said the
Exton, Pa., company expects to start two more large cold studies
this year and seek FDA approval for such uses by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cold study was directed by Dr. Frederick G. Hayden of
the University of Virginia, who was in Argentina and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the company said it hoped to get pleconaril on the
market for treating viral meningitis by the end of this year. But
now it says that is likely to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the new studies looked at pleconaril for viral meningitis
in children and adults. Severe headache is the major symptom of the
illness, which strikes an estimated 500,000 American a year.
</P>
<P>
   In children, the drug had no significant overall effect on the
duration of headaches. The company said that was because, for
reasons they could not explain, many of the children had extremely
short bouts of illness, regardless of whether they got the
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Pleconaril also did not seem to help much across the board in
adults, either, though it did shorten headaches from 10 days to
seven in the most severe cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark H. Sawyer of the University of California at San Diego
said many pediatricians hope the drug will win approval so it can
be used for newborns with rare, overwhelming enterovirus
infections, which were not a subject of the latest studies.
</P>
<P>
   Pleconaril appears to be potentially lifesaving in such cases,
and ''the prospect of having an antiviral drug to intervene with in
these patients is very exciting,'' Sawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Split Over Ethanol Issue  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state lawmakers were split Tuesday over
whether Congress should repeal a clean-fuels standard that requires
gasoline sold in many cities to contain an oxygen-enhancing
additives such as MTBE and corn-based ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration last month said it planned to ban
MTBE because it has been found to be contaminating underground
water supplies and proposed that Congress eliminate the oxygenate
standard.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure a continued market for ethanol, which is more
expensive than MTBE, the administration suggested replacing the
oxygenate standard with a requirement that gasoline refiners
continue using a minimum amount of ethanol and other fuels made
from renewable resources.
</P>
<P>
   The ethanol industry risks a public backlash if the oxygenate
standard is not repealed, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
a South Dakota Democrat who backs the administration's position.
</P>
<P>
   ''Support for the oxygenate rule is guaranteed to weaken even
more over time,'' Daschle told the Senate Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers say it would be a mistake for ethanol
supporters to go along with eliminating the oxygenate requirement
since it guarantees that there would be demand for ethanol when
MTBE can no longer be used.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygenate rule ''has produced astounding benefits in
reducing air pollution, and ... it makes no sense to gut the Clean
Air Act simply because one of the oxygenates -- MTBE -- is
contaminating water,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a
letter Tuesday to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on MTBE would raise farm income by $1 billion, or more
than 2 percent a year, if it is replaced by ethanol, according to
Agriculture Department projections.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is under pressure from Northeast states to do away with
the oxygenate standard so they don't have to use either ethanol or
MTBE. California, which is banning MTBE on its own, has asked the
Environmental Protection Agency for a waiver from the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic impact of mandating the use of ethanol in the
Northeast, California and the Gulf Coast is simply unknown,'' said
Jason Grumet, who represents the air-control agencies of eight
northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Clean Air Act led to widespread use of MTBE, or methyl
tertiary butyl ether, by requiring gasoline in areas with serious
air pollution to contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 9,000 community water wells near leaking underground
storage tanks in 31 states may be affected by contamination from
MTBE, according to a recent study. MTBE is now used in one-third of
the gasoline sold in the United States, primarily in areas with
smog problems.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry opposes both the oxygenate rule and the
proposed renewable fuels standard.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITS to ADD photo tag  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- What do you do when the date of the Yankees home
opener falls on the same day as an important campaign swing to
Rochester and Buffalo? If you are Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, there's
no question: Cancel the upstate trip.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, despite slacking poll numbers and complaints from
some upstate Republicans that Giuliani is doing little to show that
he wants to represent them in the U.S. Senate, the Yankees-mad
mayor is trading Buffalo for the Bronx to take in opening day on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it at a press conference Tuesday, Giuliani
burst out laughing and pulled on a special commemorative Yankees
cap that read ''1999 World Champions, Team of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Long before I was a politician, I was a Yankee fan, what can I
tell you? This is me. I'm a Yankee fan. I love the Yankees. I
haven't missed an opening day since I've been the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   And where will Hillary Rodham Clinton, his rival for the U.S.
Senate and herself a self-proclaimed Yankees fan be that day? She's
opting for Buffalo, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was asked about Giuliani's schedule change, she
managed a good natured dig at the mayor's campaign and slipping
poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had a tough couple of weeks. It might be good for him to
go to a game,'' Clinton said while campaigning in Albany on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's scheduling conflict arose after forecasts predicted
snow and rain for the city and baseball officials canceled
Tuesday's home opener against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, like all die-hard Yankees fans, waited all winter for
the game and even cleared his schedule in anticipation. This year's
opener is to include a celebration of the team's World Series
victory last year.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the weather didn't cooperate and the mayor's schedule was
redone. He postponed appearances before a women's group in
Rochester and a fund-raiser in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was seen as key because Giuliani has been criticized
lately for his lack of upstate campaign appearances. Recent polls
show that the mayor has surrendered his lead over Clinton and the
race has slipped into a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Stephen Minarik III, the Republican Party
chairman in Monroe County, which encompasses Rochester, said he
understood Giuliani's choice of a baseball game uptown instead of a
campaign event upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is the mayor of the city of New York (and) the New York
Yankees are an institution within the city of New York, so let's
cut the guy some slack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, Erie County's Republican Party chairman, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing the right thing,'' said Davis. ''I'm a big baseball
fan, I understand. People understand. Buffalo is a Yankees town
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added that the postponement of Giuliani's trip to Buffalo
gives him an opportunity to take in a home opener of his own: The
Buffalo Bisons, the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Davis did have one minor regret. ''I wish he had invited me to
sit next to him at the Yankees game.''

<HEADLINE> Jenny Craig Drops Lewinsky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky has been shed as a spokesmodel
by struggling weight loss business Jenny Craig Inc., which had been
criticized by some of its franchises for selecting the former White
House intern for its ads.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Craig began running new television ads this week featuring
noncelebrity clients, and officials of the San Diego-based company
would not say whether Lewinsky will appear in future campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want the emphasis to be on the program as opposed to
any one individual client,'' said Jenny Craig spokeswoman Jeanne
McDougall.
</P>
<P>
   Ads featuring testimonials from Lewinsky had a five-week run
that began Jan. 2. Some privately owned franchises, criticizing the
selection as inappropriate, kept running older ads rather than
using the Lewinsky campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky remains a client of Jenny Craig, but McDougall declined
to discuss specifics of the financial relationship or plans for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was not available for comment Tuesday, McDougall said.
In addition, a call to a publicist for Lewinsky was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with USA Today, Lewinsky said that Jenny Craig's
promotional campaign might ''be a lot easier without me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has been devoting attention to promoting a line of
high-end handbags. The bags, made of silk, velvet and other
fabrics, have a label on the outside that says ''Made especially
for you by Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   She first started stitching the bags while being cooped up at
home during the White House scandal in which President Clinton was
impeached on perjury and obstruction of justice charges in 1998.
The Senate voted not to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Jenny Craig program, Lewinsky lost 31 pounds since
last summer and has kept the weight off. The company won't provide
her current weight.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Larchet, Jenny Craig's president and chief operating
officer, told USA Today that the company might ''revisit her'' if
she reaches her new goal to lose an additional 10 or 15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Craig has struggled in the face of a trend toward
do-it-yourself dieting. The company posted a net loss of $7.6
million last quarter and announced plans in November to close 86
underperforming weight-loss centers and trim 15 percent of the
staff at its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to report its latest financial earnings in
late April or early May.

<HEADLINE> Report: Youth Crimes Declining  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Youth violence is falling, but more children
are paying the price of public fears driven by high-profile school
shootings -- harsher punishments for nonviolent or minor offenses --
says a new report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got kids getting kicked out of school for saying
'bang-bang' to each other,'' said Vincent Schiraldi of the Justice
Policy Institute, a youth advocacy think tank that co-authored
report. ''It's no more fair to stereotype them all as school
shooters than to stereotype all adults as Timothy McVeigh,'' who
bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The report -- released a week before the first anniversary of the
April 20 Columbine High School massacre -- says the public isn't
paying attention to overall youth-violence trends. Instead,
shootings in Colorado, Arkansas, Oregon and most recently Michigan
-- where one first-grader shot and killed another youngster in class
-- have driven schools to install more metal detectors, conduct more
locker searches and impose more suspensions and expulsions for
threats, Schiraldi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though these are awful tragedies, we can't set public
policy based on these events,'' Schiraldi said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Justice Policy Institute, based in Washington
and San Francisco, and the nonprofit legal aid Children's Law
Center in Covington, Ky., recommends more school counseling,
balanced media coverage of school shootings and tougher gun control
laws. The groups -- which gleaned data from federal and state
agencies and nonprofit research centers -- are releasing the report
publicly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings include:
</P>
<P>
   --Seven in 10 Americans think a school shooting could happen in
their communities, but a child has a 1 in 2 million chance of being
killed in a U.S. school.
</P>
<P>
   --Youth homicide arrests dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 1998,
but two-thirds of 1,000 people polled by The Washington Post in
November said they believed children were getting more violent.
</P>
<P>
   --Citing Maryland as an example, suspensions for false alarms and
bomb threats went up 44 percent from the 1997-98 school year to the
1998-99 year. Although it was not known whether the alarms and
threats themselves increased, the group said the significant
increase in suspensions alone reflected a crackdown on such
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids have to know there are consequences to illegal
activity,'' said Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal
Order of Police, the 285,000-member police union. ''The real issue
is how can they (officials) be tough without creating the
perceptions that they are oppressing these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the punishments were for what the report called ''petty
acts.'' For example:
</P>
<P>
   --A 17-year-old junior was expelled from his suburban Chicago
high school in 1998 after the paper clip he shot with a rubber band
struck a cafeteria worker, drawing a small amount of blood. He was
also charged with disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   --Two 10-year-old boys in Arlington, Va., were suspended for
three days for putting soapy water in a teacher's drink. Felony
charges filed against them were later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The crack down hit minority children especially hard, the report
said. In Phoenix, black students are suspended from school at 22
times the rate of white students; in Denver, San Francisco and
Austin, they are suspended at least three times as often.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents oppose zero-tolerance laws that require tough
penalties for all children who carry weapons, start fights or make
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone who is in a position of responsibility
can be mindless,'' said Alan Heitner, a physician in Madeira, Ohio,
whose son Dana, 18, was suspended for school-election signs in a
restroom that joked about a bomb in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Heitner said the two-week suspension didn't protect anyone and
caused his son to miss exams at his suburban Cincinnati high
school: ''From a safety standpoint, this is really absurd.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Boy Tells Clinton To Break Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Standing in a throng of children,
President Clinton couldn't help but laugh at the little boy's
question: Is he still president?
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to leave in January,'' Clinton replied. He explained
that the law limits him to two terms in office.
</P>
<P>
   So the boy offered a solution: Break the law, or at least change
it so he can stay.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton roared with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't do that. But I'll be around,'' the president said.
''I'll try to do something useful.''
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous little questioner was in a group of children who
encountered Clinton on a street outside the Maryland statehouse
Tuesday, just after the governor signed a new gun safety law that
Clinton supports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then ducked into the Aurora Gallery, an arts and crafts
shop, and bought a few cat pins and a ceramic candy bowl decorated
with cat figures.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed into his limousine to head back to Washington.

<HEADLINE> House, Senate Bridge Differences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate budget bargainers have all but
eliminated their narrow differences over taxes, defense and other
issues and will push a final fiscal 2001 blueprint through Congress
later this week, aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.8 trillion compromise -- written entirely by Republicans --
will allow a five-year tax cut of at least $150 billion, and up to
about $215 billion. That is about $25 billion less than the House
approved and $25 billion more than the Senate provided.
</P>
<P>
   The budget will set aside up to $40 billion for creating a new
Medicare prescription drug benefit and making other overhauls in
the health-insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reno: US Had No Right in Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Attorney General Janet Reno says a federal
intelligence center under her department had no business looking
into drug trafficking allegations against one of Mexico's most
prominent families.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the National Drug Intelligence Center, according
to newspaper reports last year, had called the Hank family of
Mexico ''a significant criminal threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in a March 21 letter to lawyers for a member of the
family, said the NDIC report on drug trafficking, first disclosed
last year by the Mexican newspaper El Financiero, ''was beyond the
substantive expertise and area of responsibility of the NDIC.''
</P>
<P>
   The employee responsible for unauthorized release of the draft
report was ''no longer in federal service,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   She told former Sen. Warren Rudman, attorney for Carlos Hank
Rhon, the NDIC project that produced the report had been terminated
and all copies of the report retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of her letter was sent to Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan at Rudman's request, since the Hank family has
banking interests in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The father of the family, billionaire ruling party member Carlos
Hank Gonzalez, last year denied the allegations linking him and his
two sons to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The NDIC, a strategic drug intelligence center under the Justice
Department but based in Johnstown, Pa., was referring inquiries to
the department. A department spokesman said there would be no
comment on the report or Reno's letter.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent member of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, Hank Gonzalez was an elementary school teacher who rose to
becoming one of Mexico's richest businessmen. As he gathered his
wealth, he served as mayor, governor, congressman and secretary of
the tourism and agriculture ministries. He has been retired from
politics since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Hank Rhon has been chairman of the third
largest independent bank holding company in Texas, Laredo National
Bancshares Inc.

<HEADLINE> House, Senate Near Deal on Budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate budget bargainers have all but
eliminated their narrow differences over taxes, defense and other
issues and will push a final fiscal 2001 blueprint through Congress
later this week, aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.8 trillion compromise -- written entirely by Republicans --
will allow a five-year tax cut of at least $150 billion, and up to
about $215 billion. That is about $25 billion less than the House
approved and $25 billion more than the Senate provided.
</P>
<P>
   The budget will set aside up to $40 billion for creating a new
Medicare prescription drug benefit and making other overhauls in
the health-insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   No details of the program are provided, and no action is
required. Gone is Senate-approved language that would have let any
senator bring a prescription-drug bill to the chamber's floor by
Sept. 1 if there had been no prior legislative action.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cancer Conspiracy Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Doctors in at least seven states are being
investigated for allegedly administering free samples of an
expensive cancer drug and then billing their patients' insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Only one doctor has been charged in the allege scheme, but
papers filed by federal prosecutors in U.S. District Court claim
the conspiracy spread to the drug company's employees and doctors
in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Kentucky, South Carolina, New
York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney's spokeswoman Samantha Martin declined to say how
many doctors might have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that the producer of the prostate cancer drug
Lupron Depot gave free samples to physicians as an inducement for
them to use the drug -- as well as ''to provide the physician with a
source of money ... to pay (any) past-due balance'' owed to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of a monthly dose of Lupron was $566 in 1998,
according to an industry reference book. The drug, which must be
administered by a physician, is also among Medicare's largest
out-patient drug expenditures, costing the government $467 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lupron is a product of Illinois-based TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
a joint venture of Abbott Labs and Takeda Chemical Industries.
</P>
<P>
   TAP spokeswoman Kim Modory on Tuesday confirmed that Lupon
marketing practices are being investigated and said the company is
cooperating. She declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company had $2.5 billion in sales last year, about a third
of that from Lupron.
</P>
<P>
   In the only charges filed so far, Dr. Rodney Mannion, a
urologist in northeast Indiana, is accused of conspiracy to defraud
for allegedly accepting between $40,000 and $70,000 from insurers
billed for 60 one-month doses of the drug between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at Mannion's office said the doctor would not
comment on the allegations. Mannion's attorney did not immediately
return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The charge was outlined in a federal information paper, a
document often filed before a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted as charged, Mannion could face up to five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine. His arraignment is scheduled April 25.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Court Lifts Stay of Execution  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee's first execution in 40 years
is back on track for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday lifted a stay
of execution for Robert Glen Coe, who a week ago was set to die by
injection for the 1979 murder and rape of 8-year-old Cary Ann
Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Supreme court has set April 19 for the execution --
the fourth date set for Coe since October.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court had delayed Coe's execution to consider
motions questioning his mental competence and the state's process
for determining it. A 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling bars the
execution of insane inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The court on Tuesday found that Coe is competent and the state
gave him a fair competency hearing, which lasted several days and
allowed his lawyers to question mental health experts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would serve no jurisprudential purpose to discuss these
claims any further,'' the justices wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Stout, Medlin's stepfather, said the family has grown
weary of two decades of legal wrangling, especially in the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Coe's death was near, Cary Ann's family prepared to
leave their West Tennessee home for Nashville to witness the
execution, only to learn of a last-hour stay of execution. Stout
said the family hopes this is the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just wait to see what goes from here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's lawyers still have several appellate options. One of Coe's
lawyers, Jim Walker, wouldn't discuss which option the legal team
would choose, adding that the appeals are not meant ''in anyway to
minimize the pain and loss of Cary Ann Medlin's friends and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Her death was a tragedy, but when Tennessee is seeking to
accelerate its first execution in 40 years, I do not think the
execution of a severely mentally ill man, for whom there are
substantial, lingering questions regarding his guilt, should be the
person executed,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's lawyers say he becomes mentally unstable under stress, a
condition that will worsen as he nears execution. They believe once
in the death chamber, he will not be mentally competent for
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Coe, who turns 44 on Saturday, told police when he was arrested
in 1979 that he lured the girl from a church parking lot into his
car and raped her. After she told him, ''Jesus loves you,'' he said
he decided to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has not put anyone to death since 1960. The U.S.
Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Transportation plan reduces borrowing but also lacks permanentfunding  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Whitman administration has proposed a
system of paying for new highway and rail projects that provides
only 12 months of financing, but lawmakers on Tuesday did not seem
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   And most motorists probably will not mind either since the plan
provides a record $1 billion in transportation projects to reduce
traffic congestion, and there is no talk of raising the gasoline
tax to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the proposal provides only a short-term
solution for the Transportation Trust Fund, which finances the
state's projects and which in the past has been given a stable
source of revenue to pay its bills year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Barbara Buono, D-Middlesex, the ranking Democrat
on the Assembly Budget Committee, said, ''I am disappointed that
the governor hasn't come up with a long range plan, that she hasn't
proposed a dedicated source of funding to fund the Transportation
Trust Fund over the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really for just one fiscal year, as I see it,'' Buono
said. She said she would have preferred a permanent dedication of
more gasoline and oil-products taxes over a longer term.
</P>
<P>
   While Gov. Christie Whitman's plan may be short-term, it does
have a new feature that appeals to many lawmakers, Buono added. For
the first time, Whitman is proposing to pay for more than a quarter
of the work in cash, limiting the amount that the Trust Fund
authority will have to borrow through bond issues.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, 90 percent to 95 percent of the money needed for
new projects was borrowed through the sale of bonds. In the fiscal
year beginning July 1, only 73 percent of the money needed will
have to be borrowed. The rest of the cost will be paid with $266
million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein appeared before the
Budget committee for four hours Tuesday to discuss his department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Legislature has been complaining about a too heavy
reliance on debt. It is good economic times, so there's money in
the budget, and we are making the shift,'' Weinstein said. ''If you
can (pay cash) as opposed to issuing debt, if you have that option,
then I think you are going to get support from both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, chairman of the budget
committee, spoke for his GOP colleagues. ''I favor pay-as-you-go to
the greatest extent possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, most of the Transportation Trust
Fund's money has been coming from the gasoline tax, but under a
1995 law most of the gas tax revenue will go to pay off existing
debts starting this year and so will be unavailable to pay for new
work.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, many had believed a higher gas tax would be
necessary this year. Whitman proposed a 4-cent increase two years
ago to prepare for this date but it died in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein on Tuesday said this option is now out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of what is happening with gasoline prices, there is
not any sense in talking about a gas tax,'' he said. ''There are
times to do things and there are times not to do things. This is
not a time to talk about gas tax increases.''

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Stock Rises on Pact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s shares soared nearly 29
percent Tuesday after the drugstore operator announced it had a new
financing pact that its chief executive said will be key to
rebuilding the financially troubled company.
</P>
<P>
   The operator of the nation's third largest drugstore chain said
it had received a commitment for $1 billion in secured credit from
Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it said J.P. Morgan agreed to convert $200 million
of existing bank debt into Rite Aid common stock at a price of
$5.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   After completing the transactions, Rite Aid said it will have
virtually no debt maturing prior to August 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rite Aid shares were
up $1.62{ a share at $7.31\.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Miller, who was named Rite Aid's chairman and chief
executive last December, said the new financing commitment and debt
modifications ''are a cornerstone of our turnaround plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid said the financing will provide it with more than $600
million for general working capital purposes, repaying debt and
paying expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion credit facility will be secured with inventory,
accounts receivable and certain other assets owned by Rite Aid
units PCS Health Systems and drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid has been trying to recover after financial woes sent
its stock tumbling by more than 80 percent in a year. The company
has switched auditing firms and a restatement of its earnings for
the past three years was expected to result in a $500 million
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Hill-based company had been looking to sell PCS to help
pay off $1.3 billion in debt due Nov. 1. Rite Aid bought the
pharmacy benefits management business for $1.5 billion last year
from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., which paid $4 billion for it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what this means is that Rite Aid wasn't able to sell
PCS at the right price, and banks, when forced with the choice of
forcing Rite Aid into Chapter 11 bankruptcy or refinancing, it went
for the financing structure,'' said Mark Husson, analyst with New
York-based Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a Rite Aid shareholder, (the financial pact) is
better than bad news,'' he said. ''It looks like Rite Aid will
survive. It now has a good shot, an opportunity to turn itself
around.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Spends a Rainy Day at School  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- In the middle of a school day full of
smiles and upbeat talk, Al Gore walked into a controversy over
state-mandated testing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of time for chatting at lunch with his Avondale
Elementary schoolmate-for-a-day, 9-year-old Beca Rawlins. They
talked about pets, jokes and food, she said, and she promised ''to
tell my mom to vote for him because he's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal Mary Ann Burns also praised the vice president's
visit, but she and at least one parent had strong words on the
testing issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where controversy over mandatory proficiency tests is
growing, the Democratic presidential candidate said he supported
such tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to measure the performance of the students because
communities are going to have an easier time putting the heat on
the politicians, the school boards, the taxpayers and everybody
else in order to improve the schools if there is a fair and
accurate way to get a measurement of how the schools are doing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a softer note, he said that children who don't do well on the
tests should be given extra help rather than be automatically held
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to make sure there's a balanced attitude toward
tests, that you have a good test that's appropriate for the kids
and isn't destructive but is constructive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Burns had nothing good to say about the state's
fourth-grade guarantee, which beginning next year will hold
students back a grade if they don't pass a reading test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe a legislator should say a child should fail
the fourth grade,'' she said. ''I believe a teacher and parent and
principal should get together and decide whether a child should
pass on to the fifth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Morales, whose son Jason took the fourth-grade test last
month, told Gore that her son was upset, couldn't sleep and was
worried all the time about the test.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids really work hard, and this is one thing more to hold kids
back in their grade,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 2 percent of Avondale Elementary fourth-graders have
passed all five proficiency tests, compared with about 13 percent
citywide and 32 percent statewide. But the school is striving to
improve with the help of smaller class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent almost seven hours at the 109-year-old red brick
school, helping first-graders write a letter to ''Mother Earth''
pledging to pick up trash, drawing a collage of the Earth with a
fourth-grade art class and visiting with janitors in a basement
boiler room. He has pledged to spend a day at a school every week
or two during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used Tuesday's visit to release an ''education bluebook''
summarizing his proposals that include universal preschool for
4-year-olds, smaller class sizes, testing new teachers, and making
sure new and current teachers are qualified to teach their
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched the value of early-education programs during a
meeting with parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that dollar for dollar that's the single most valuable
investment our country can make,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore returned to Washington for a $1-million dinner of
sea bass and chocolated-dipped pears. He was dining at the
Mayflower Hotel with some 50 contributors, many of them drawn from
Washington's gay and lesbian community, who gave the Democratic
National Committee $20,000 apiece for the occasion.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Police Seek Cult Leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Police on Tuesday put up rewards of about
$1,300 for information leading to the arrest of any of six cult
leaders whose followers were killed across southwest Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Police have been searching for the leaders since a fire in a
cult chapel in the village of Kanungu on March 17 killed 530
people. Following the fire, authorities unearthed a series of mass
graves in nearby villages, turning up 394 more corpses. Many of
those victims had been strangled or stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Asuman Mugenyi said the rewards are available
to anyone -- inside or outside Uganda -- who helps track down the
cult leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how many of the six are alive. Unconfirmed
reports say the group's two main leaders, Credonia Mwerinde and
Joseph Kibwetere, fled Kanungu just before the fire. Another
leader, the defrocked Roman Catholic priest Dominic Kataribabo, is
believed to have perished in the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Mwerinde, an ex-banana beer vendor known as ''The Programmer,''
is widely seen as the real power behind the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God.
</P>
<P>
   The other three for whom rewards are offered are: Joseph
Kasapurari, another excommunicated priest; Ursula Komuhangi; and
John Kamagara.
</P>
<P>
   Police issued arrest warrants for all six last week, saying they
assumed they had survived the blaze and gone into hiding. All of
them are charged with multiple counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   More mass graves are believed to have yet to be found, though
ill-equipped police have suspended digging until they have more
equipment and funding.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the killings were sparked by an internal
revolt after the cult's prediction that the world would come to an
end on Dec. 31, 1999 was proved false. After that, police believe
cult members began asking that their possessions, which they'd
given to the group upon joining, be returned.

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia Files Gun Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Joining more than two dozen U.S. cities,
Philadelphia sued the gun industry Tuesday, blaming manufacturers
for gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court accuses gun
makers of engaging in a ''pattern of conduct ... that is harmful to
all who reside, work or travel in the city ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to recover costs including medical care,
police protection and prisons. It also demands that manufacturers
add safety features to guns and change how the weapons are marketed
and distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen gun makers are named as defendants, including Smith &AMP;
Wesson, Glock, Browning and Beretta.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the defendants said it is misguided to blame gun
manufacturers for crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always monitored how our products are distributed,''
said Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman Ken Jorgensen.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 other cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami,
and Boston, have sued gun manufacturers. Three of those suits were
dismissed and are under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia lawsuit was filed despite a law signed last
year by Gov. Tom Ridge that bans Pennsylvania cities from suing gun
manufacturers to recover the costs of gun-related violence. The ban
was to take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia City Solicitor Kenneth Trujillo said Tuesday the
state law was narrowly tailored to ban suits against the legal
marketing of guns. The city contends that gun makers marketed their
products illegally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ridge administration said it would review the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are skeptical that the fairly straightforward law passed
last year ... somehow doesn't prohibit lawsuits against gun
manufacturers,'' Ridge spokesman Tim Reeves said. ''We look forward
to hearing their arguments.''

people or corporations that kill endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, which requires approval by parliament,
corporations could be fined up to $685,000 and their officials
imprisoned for five years, while individuals could face fines of
$171,000 and five years in prison for killing an animal considered
an endangered species or destroying its habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Fines could be doubled for a second conviction. The bill also
would allow compensation for landowners who suffer financial losses
because they have endangered species on their property, preventing
development or other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Canadians want all species at risk protected,'' Anderson said.
''By combining incentives with strong legal protections and the
ability of the federal government to act alone when necessary, the
government of Canada is creating a workable species protection
system that will achieve concrete results.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups support increasing protection of endangered
species, but they oppose a provision in the measure that allows the
Cabinet to decide which species get designated as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very disappointed,'' said Stewart Elgie of the Sierra
Legal Defense Fund. ''This bill will do little to ensure that
endangered species and their habitat are protected -- it leaves
everything up to political discretion.''

<HEADLINE> Bogus Passport Ring Busted in Spain  </HEADLINE>
By MAR ROMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Police have uncovered a crime ring whose
members sold bogus passports and offered diplomatic privileges from
a nonexistent country, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 people used an Internet page to advertise passports
from Sealand -- described on the Web as a principality based on an
abandoned military platform off the coast of England, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The passports went for $5,780, said Civil Guard spokesman
Fernando Jimenez. The group claims on its Web site to have sold
160,000 of them since September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A 48-year-old Spaniard, Francisco Trujillo Ruiz -- who called
himself Sealand's ruler -- is the only person arrested so far. But
officials have raided the ring's Madrid headquarters and
authorities do not rule out further arrests, Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Civil Guard has requested cooperation from police in
other countries to track down the rest of the group members. No
arrests warrants have been issued.
</P>
<P>
   The Sealand Web page said the principality was founded more than
20 years ago by a Briton it names as Paddy Roy Bates. The site
shows a Sealand flag and says the entity follows international laws
and issues its own passports.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish police started investigating in November when a man
detained in a fraud case claimed diplomatic immunity with a Sealand
passport.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the ring have criminal records for drug
trafficking and fraud, and some drove around Spain in cars with
purported diplomatic license plates from Sealand, Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that among the people known to have held Sealand
passports was suspected serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who shot and
killed fashion designer Gianni Versace. Nine days later, with
police closing in, Cunanan committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, more than 4,000 Sealand passports were sold
shortly before Britain returned the colony to Chinese sovereignty
in July 1997, the Civil Guard spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Prepares for Son  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez will treat his son
Elian to a hot dog and scrambled eggs -- the 6-year-old Cuban boy's
favorite foods -- when they are reunited, but other than that ''he's
not making any grand plans,'' a National Council of Churches
representative said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Gonzalez, the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell,
former general secretary of the council, said he ''is strongly
convinced he will see his son very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, she said, he is worried that Elian looks
thin in the pictures he has seen. She said he tried to call the boy
at the home of the Miami relatives who are caring for him three
times during her visit but wasn't even able to leave a message
because the answering machine was full.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Republican leadership and two
Cuban-American members of Florida's congressional delegation
invited Gonzalez to a private meeting Wednesday in the Capitol.
''We want to be sure that you are aware of all the options
available to you as you make your decision,'' they wrote in a
letter delivered by representatives of House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want you to have the freedom to express your true feelings
during your visit without coercion and without intimidation,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, DeLay told reporters he wanted to
determine whether the elder Gonzalez ''is free from Castro's
intimidation while he is staying in the shadow of the United States
Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bethesda, Campbell said Gonzalez told her he would go to
Florida if he must to reclaim custody of his son, although he is
hoping that someone will bring Elian to the Washington area. He
said he would not go to the home of the Miami relatives who have
cared for his son since his rescue Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll do whatever he has to do short of meeting with
relatives,'' she said. ''He does not wish to meet with the
relatives until he has Elian in his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Once he has his son, then the adults can work on their
relationships,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is fighting the attempt by
the boy's father to gain custody and return with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell hosted Elian's grandmothers on their visit to the
United States lobbying for the return of Elian to Cuba and
accompanied Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer on the trip to Havana to
arrange for the father's trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place at the Bethesda home of a Cuban diplomat,
where Gonzalez has been staying since his arrival in Washington
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Gonzalez planned to do when he finally meets his son,
Campbell said, ''He's going to give him a hot dog and scrambled
eggs because those are his favorite foods. He's not making any
grand plans at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Gonzalez went to the Cuban Interest Section for
a meeting with members of the Alliance for a Responsible Cuba
Policy, which advocates Elian's return to Cuba and also seeks the
establishment of normal relations between the United States and
Cuba.

<HEADLINE> USDA Resurrecting Loan Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers will be able to get low-interest
government financing to build grain storage facilities on their
property in time for this fall's harvest, Agriculture Department
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   USDA is resurrecting a loan program that was discontinued in
1982 after studies showed that there was sufficient storage
available. Now some farmers have nowhere to store grain, because
local elevators are full, department officials said. Others want
additional storage so that they can keep genetically engineered
crops separate from conventional varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Without sufficient storage space, farmers are sometimes forced
to sell their crops when commodity prices are low rather than
waiting until they rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have got to have a much better on-farm storage
infrastructure than we have right now,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The department is working on rules for the program and plans to
issue them in time for farmers to obtain the storage they need for
this year's crop, said aides to Glickman. USDA has come under
criticism from some lawmakers for not moving quicker on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The loans can be repaid in five or 10 years and will carry an
interest rate of 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cops Review Tape of Kennedy, Guard  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL ZOLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- An airport security guard is
misrepresenting a confrontation with Rep. Patrick Kennedy to make
money off his famous name, the state Democratic Party chairman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She started to look at this thing and heard cash register
sounds in her head,'' said William Lynch, who discussed the
incident with Kennedy two days ago. ''He's resigned to the fact
that because his name is Kennedy, these types of things that
ordinarily wouldn't mean anything are totally blown out of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy does not deny having some ''inadvertent contact'' with
Della Patton, 58, at Los Angeles International Airport last month,
but he did not grab or shove her, as she claims, Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have reviewed a surveillance video of the incident,
but have not made it public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows there appears to have been physical contact between
Ms. Patton and Mr. Kennedy,'' Los Angeles police Lt. Horace Frank
said. ''She said she was battered at a preboard checkpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy released a brief statement Tuesday night denying
Patton's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all the facts become public, people will see that the
press reports don't reflect what actually happened,'' Kennedy said.
''I apologized for this unfortunate incident at the time and
continue to regret that it occurred. I sincerely hope that this
matter can be resolved soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton, reached at her home Tuesday, said she was in pain but
declined to comment and referred calls to her attorney, Paul Trump.
He did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Patton has accused Kennedy of grabbing and pushing her at 11:35
p.m. on March 26 when she told him his bag was too big to fit in an
X-ray scanner.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., then
allegedly grabbed Patton's arm and cursed at her while ordering her
out of the way. Patton complained of injuries to her left shoulder.
She filed a battery complaint with police on or about April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the case was being handled by detectives in the
robbery-homicide division because of its high-profile nature.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against the Rhode Island Democrat.
Misdemeanor battery carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail
and a $2,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 32, has hired defense attorney Abbe Lowell, who served
as chief investigative counsel for House Democrats in President
Clinton's impeachment proceedings. Lowell did not return calls to
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Patton filed a worker's compensation claim and remains at home
on paid leave while her claim is being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, the party's chief fund-raising arm in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He was traveling from Los Angeles to Rhode Island to deliver a
civil rights speech the next day at a Providence church at the time
Patton said they scuffled.
</P>
<P>
   Patton told airport security supervisor Michael Cobb that
Kennedy tried to lift the metal gate on the X-ray scanner and cram
through a bag that didn't fit. The congressman told her he had a
speech to make and there was a physical confrontation, Cobb told
The Providence Journal.
</P>
<P>
   When Patton didn't budge, he allegedly returned to the ticket
counter to check his bag and apologized to the security guard on
his return through the checkpoint, Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the congressman did tell her he was running late, but
peacefully went to check the bag at a ticket counter when she
wouldn't let him through. Lynch said it was his understanding the
guard, not Kennedy, was the antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer broke the story in its April 18 edition,
based on a tip from a freelance writer, said John South, an
Enquirer senior reporter. He would not say whether the tabloid paid
Patton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't reveal that information, but it is common knowledge
that we do pay for stories,'' South said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said Patton's cooperation with the Enquirer shows she was
trying to trade on the Kennedy name.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's outrageous,'' Lynch said.

<HEADLINE> Census Officials Feeling Encouraged  </HEADLINE>
BY GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Florida and Michigan, they stuffed Chinese
fortune cookies with ''Census 2000'' messages. In Santa Ana,
Calif., traveling food merchants hand over groceries in bags to
customers emblazoned with the Census 2000 logo.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the more unusual things the Census Bureau is
doing to get Americans to fill out and return their form, and
Census officials say it's working -- despite recent criticism that
some of the things asked on the 53-question long form are too
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, 62 percent of all forms were mailed back, Census
director Kenneth Prewitt said, surpassing the 61 percent minimum
goal that officials had set for this year's count.
</P>
<P>
   While some states, particularly in the South, continue to lag
behind the national numbers, others have surged ahead, giving hope
to Prewitt that they'll get as many form backs this year as they
did in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got my fingers crossed,'' Prewitt said. ''This suggests
that we will meet the 1990 rate of 65 percent. That would be quite
a serious accomplishment not just by the Census Bureau, but by the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Response rates have declined each year since 1970, from 78
percent, to 75 percent in 1980, and 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau will release final response rate figures on
April 18. After that, the rate of forms mailed back is expected to
be reduced to a trickle, and Census officials will prepare to send
temporary workers out to homes that did sent back a form. That
operation begins on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say they are encouraged by positive numbers in
some states and local communities. For instance, Macomb County,
Mich. has one of the highest response rates among all counties at
78 percent, and regional director Tom Chodzko says they tried a
number of different things there -- including stuffing fortune
cookies with ''Census 2000'' messages -- to get people to turn in
their forms.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Ana, traveling food merchants known as ''vendedores''
go through mostly-Hispanic neighborhoods peddling fruit and
vegetables. Vendors stuff bags with census pamphlets, then try to
reassure customers that information on their forms won't be turned
over to other federal agencies such as the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''For people who otherwise may not know of the process, they
help them not to be afraid of it,'' said Jeanine Kabrich, census
spokeswoman in Los Angeles. ''The message is it's OK that you can
do this without fear of reprisal.''
</P>
<P>
   Operationally, Prewitt considers this census a success since
they passed the 61 percent goal. But he says the bureau is not done
in trying to get people to return their forms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, several congressional Republicans said they
were suggesting to people worried about the intrusiveness of the
long form to leave certain questions unanswered -- such as ''What is
your annual income?'' and ''Do you have plumbing at home?''.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, 64 percent of all short forms were mailed back,
and 50 percent of long forms, Prewitt said. The 14 percent gap went
up two points in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect that in the next week as questionnaires continue to
come in that the mail response rate will inch even higher,'' said
Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel. He has urged people to fill out the whole
long form.

<HEADLINE> Two men joined by a common affair face trial together  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- One defendant is the former chief executive
officer at a prestigious Wall Street firm, the other a businessman
and novice gambler. Their common romantic interest -- an X-rated
movie star -- has united them in an insider trading trial.
</P>
<P>
   Through their lawyers, James McDermott Jr. and Anthony Pomponio
have both admitted to a relationship with Kathryn Gannon, a
Canadian woman who the jury is getting to know by order of Judge
Kimba Wood only as a ''model, dancer and actress who appeared in
films under the screen name, Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette
&AMP; Woods, and Pomponio, a New Jersey man who built his own quartz
and glass cutting company, knew Gannon as the star of such movies
as ''Sins of the Flesh,'' ''The Passion Potion'' and ''The
Violation of Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   But the men say they did not know about each other until shortly
before their arrests. Throughout pretrial hearings and the start of
the trial, they have remained largely separate in court, bonded
only by their extramarital affairs with Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Their fates rest in part on the jury's perception of their
relationship with Gannon, a Canadian citizen who remains in her
Canadian home out of the reach -- so far -- of U.S. efforts to
extradite her.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan began hearing and
seeing evidence in the case on Monday, including a simple headshot
photograph of Gannon, described by a prosecutor as a ''28-year-old
blonde, an attractive woman.''
</P>
<P>
   They have listened to witnesses from a brokerage where Gannon
opened her first account after meeting McDermott, and from
representatives of McDermott's company. The witnesses are giving
the jury a crash course on how information about stocks reaches the
public and how Gannon and Pomponio traded in stocks that
prosecutors allege earned them $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, enamored
with Gannon, fed her secret information about pending mergers and
acquisitions of six regional banks and a credit card company,
allowing her to profit illegally. She then allegedly gave the
information to Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's lawyer, Scott Muller, so far has encouraged jurors
to believe that McDermott and Gannon were so close that it would be
impossible to conclude he might not have recommended the six stocks
before they went on a secret list at his company prior to major
public announcements about them.
</P>
<P>
   He said McDermott and Gannon spoke to each other several times a
day from 1996 through 1999, when the couple allegedly committed
conspiracy and securities fraud, along with Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's thousands, literally, of opportunities, face-to-face
and on the phone ... for them to have discussed it legitimately,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no reason for McDermott, an executive earning
nearly $4 million annually, to risk his flourishing career by
giving stock secrets illegally to Gannon when he could afford to
just send her checks, which he did in amounts that nearly added up
to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio's lawyer, Thomas Dunn, told the jury that his
45-year-old client did nothing wrong except engage in an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   When the Securities and Exchange Commission interviewed him,
Pomponio confessed everything about the relationship, including how
he met her in an Atlantic City casino when she was at a trade show,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had gotten involved with this good looking woman and now
he's realizing that it was an immoral thing and how it's going to
impact on his family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said his client also had been successful, leaving high
school early to build a company, North Jersey Diamond Wheel, which
makes diamond wheels that cut the ''hardest material in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said his client also is a chief executive officer, living
in North Caldwell, N.J., with his wife, Bonnie, and a young
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a sense, his business success is that of the American
dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial continues Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 'Hefner Way' Stirs Chicago Debate  </HEADLINE>
By KATE N. GROSSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Playboy may seem tame in today's world of online
porn, lewd pro wrestling and shock-talk shows, but the old magazine
can still cause a stir.
</P>
<P>
   After heated debate, a City Council committee Tuesday approved
the naming of a street after Hugh Hefner, whose Playboy empire has
its headquarters in Chicago. The vote came after Hefner's daughter
pulled a rabbit out of her hat by taking centerfold, uh, center
stage.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the committee had voted down the proposed ''Hugh
Hefner Way'' after listening to arguments that Hefner's work is
degrading to women. But by midday Tuesday, Hugh Hefner Way got the
OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that my father and Playboy provoke debate and
discussion about deeply felt issues of personal freedom, about
sexuality and about morality,'' said Playboy chairman and CEO
Christie Hefner, who requested the street naming. But she defended
her father's work as a celebration of things ''that are beautiful
and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hugh Hefner is the quintessential American success story -- one
of many that deserve recognition on our city's streets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   City aldermen have honored more than 800 Chicagoans with street
signs, most of them in the past few years. Debate is rare and a
City Council vote is usually a formality.
</P>
<P>
   Hefner, in Chicago to sign a Playboy issue featuring his twin
girlfriends, took the debate in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, they made it very exciting,'' he said. ''It shows the
prejudice in this society that still exists. But it's what has made
me a very successful and very wealthy man.''
</P>
<P>
   To make Hefner's sign -- posted Tuesday at the corner of Michigan
Avenue and Walton Street -- permanent, it must be approved by the
full City Council on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hefner started Playboy in Chicago in the 1950s and his bunny
symbol was long associated with the Chicago skyline. The company
has grown beyond the magazine into cyberspace and pay television
but remains headquartered in town -- something that was not lost on
members of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   During a rancorous debate following Hefner's speech, several
aldermen spoke of Hefner's contributions to the city. Christie
Hefner offered a laundry list of donations her father has made to
local organizations, including the Women's Rights Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Chicago Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   Just before calling a vote, Alderman Ed Burke reminded the city
of Playboy's place in Chicago's business landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ''You continue to be a remarkable, successful and caring
Chicagoan,'' Burke told Christie Hefner. ''We our proud to keep
your business in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Chicago law student Jim Madigan testified against
Hefner, calling the magazine ''masturbation material.'' Madigan
brought a copy of Playboy and opened the centerfold wide for the
committee's inspection.
</P>
<P>
   He said said he respected Playboy's right to produce the
magazine, but ''the question is do we have to honor it?''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Madigan said he wasn't surprised by the city's
reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly money and business trumps the exploitation of women,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> West Bank Settlers Plan New Homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EFRAT, West Bank (AP) -- Bulldozers leveled ground on the
outskirts of a Jewish settlement Tuesday to prepare for 350 new
homes, a first step by settlers to challenge the government's curb
on building.
</P>
<P>
   Several settlers held up banners reading ''No to strangling
settlements'' as the bulldozers worked.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to say that if the government won't allow the
contractor to build, we will find a way and a contractor who will
start building without permission,'' said Enon Achiman, the leader
of Efrat, a West Bank settlement south of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leaders said there has been a sharp curb in settlement
construction under Prime Minister Ehud Barak, so they have
nullified an agreement to coordinate all settlement activity with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak is afraid to publish the (construction) bids in the
newspaper, just in case (Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat sees
them and starts making trouble,'' said Yehoshua Mor-Yosef,
spokesman for the Settlers' Council.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's government imposed a partial construction freeze in
December in an attempt to fulfill an election pledge to shift
national resources away from settlement construction.

   Kobi Bleich, spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, said that no
new bids were published for Efrat. He said the ministry approves
building ''according to need and circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who wish to establish an independent state in
the West Bank and Gaza, maintain that the settlements are illegal
and should be dismantled as part of a final peace treaty, due in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman said the
settlement building makes peace efforts look insincere.
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement watchdog group, Peace Now, the pace
of settlement building has actually increased since Barak came to
power last July. The organization says some 7,120 homes are under
construction, much more than is necessary to accommodate population
growth.

<HEADLINE> Algerian's Hearing in Canada Set  </HEADLINE>
By JACK BRANSWELL, 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Canada will begin extradition hearings in June
against an Algerian wanted by the United States for alleged links
with a bombing plot on U.S. soil, a court ruled Tuesday after the
FBI filed evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mokhtar Haouari is accused of supporting a terrorism plot in
connection with the case of Ahmed Ressam, another Algerian arrested
in December as he crossed the border from Canada into Washington
allegedly with a carload of bomb-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A third Algerian, Abdel Ghani Meskini, was arrested in New York
City soon after Ressam, on charges of providing support to
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, 31, faces no charges in Canada, but has been held since
Jan. 10 on a U.S. extradition request.
</P>
<P>
   Canada on Monday ordered the extradition hearing to go forward
after the FBI turned over evidence. A court on Tuesday scheduled an
extradition hearing for June 13-15.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari attended Tuesday's hearing in handcuffs, but said
nothing. His lawyer previously has said Haouari was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S authorities have not disclosed any potential targets of the
alleged plot or the scope of who might be involved.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence submitted Tuesday detailed links between Haouari,
Meskini and Ressam, including telephone calls and written
addresses. The FBI says telephone calls taped after Ressam's Dec.
14 arrest implicate Meskini and Haouari in the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
   In one call, Meskini, 31, says Ressam and Haouari were part of a
well-organized network, according to the court documents. They also
include statements by Meskini after his arrest in December that he
and Haouari had ''several conversations about Jihad (holy war) and
about how to become a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   The court documents said U.S. authorities would consider
granting Meskini limited immunity from prosecution to testify
against Haouari.
</P>
<P>
   The January grand jury indictment against Haouari and Meskini
accuses them of conspiring since October 1997 to support members
and associates of a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment and the court documents filed
Tuesday, Haouari provided various forged identification documents
while Meskini went to Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari and Meskini are also accused of conspiring to transfer
fake or stolen U.S. immigration identity cards and passports of
other countries. They were also accused of using fake credit and
bank cards over the last year to buy $1,000 or more worth of
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari has said that he fled to Canada in 1993 because he was
wanted by military police in Algeria for his involvement with the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front. He said he had left the
group a year earlier because he was opposed to its use of violence.
He has said he knew Ressam and Meskini but denied any involvement
in a terrorist plot,
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, 32, who has pleaded innocent to nine charges including
possessing and transporting explosives with the intent to cause
damage or injury, had Meskini's phone number in his pocket when he
was arrested.

<HEADLINE> Judge Strikes Down Dolphin Decision  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a
government decision to allow the use of the ''dolphin-safe'' label
on canned tuna even when some of the tuna are captured by huge
encircling nets that often harm dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson, in a ruling handed down
in San Francisco, said the Commerce Department improperly concluded
that the change would not have any significant adverse impact on
dolphin fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by some environmental groups
and dolphin-protection activists who have argued that the labeling
change a year ago by the Commerce Department amounted to a
weakening of U.S. laws protecting dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department officials could not immediately be reached
late Tuesday for comment, although the ruling is expected to be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what impact the ruling will have,
if any, on grocery shelves. The judge did not address Congress'
decision in 1997 to lift the import ban on tuna caught with the
nets, only whether the label could be used when tuna is known to be
caught in that way.
</P>
<P>
   The three major tuna processors -- Star-kist, Chicken of the Sea
and Bumble Bee -- have all said they would continue using only tuna
caught by methods other than net encirclement. The three processors
share about 90 percent of the U.S. tuna market.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1997 directed the Commerce Department to re-examine
the use of the label after it voted to lift the import ban.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Commerce Secretary William Daley concluded that
there was insufficient evidence to say that the use of purse-seine
nets by tuna fishermen causes ''significant adverse impact'' on
dolphins. So, the label's use was broadened.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the nets once was responsible for the death of more than
100,000 dolphins a year. But the dolphin death toll has declined to
no more than 3,000 a year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, in his ruling, concluded that Daley ''abused his
discretion'' and went beyond the law when he initiated the change
in label criteria simply because he did not have evidence of
adverse impact.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has had environmental groups sharply divided.
</P>
<P>
   David Phillips, director of Earth Island Institute's marine
mammal project, was pleased with the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tremendous rebuke to President Clinton, Vice
President Gore and the free-trade bureaucrats who sold out dolphin
protection to accommodate a handful of foreign fishing companies,
killing dolphins to catch tuna,'' declared Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But the labeling change has had the support of such groups as
Greenpeace, the Center for Marine Conservation and the
Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   These organizations argue the old, strict adherence to when the
label can be used has blocked international cooperation aimed at
protecting dolphins. Some countries like Mexico will not
participate in dolphin protection measures unless U.S. markets are
opened without restrictions, these groups have argued.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the change, Commerce Department officials have argued,
observers must still be stationed on tuna boats and must verify
that dolphins were not killed or seriously injured by nets if the
label is to be used.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Earth Island Institute, those who joined in the
lawsuit challenging the label change included the Humane Society of
the United States, Defenders of Wildlife, International Wildlife
Coalition, Animal Fund, Oceanic Society and Environmental Solutions
International.

<HEADLINE> Uranium Workers To Be Compensated  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will offer
compensation to workers at an Ohio uranium enrichment plant
sickened by radiation exposure, a congressman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, met with officials from Vice
President Al Gore's office and said the administration's plan is to
treat workers at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon,
Ohio, the same as those at a plant in Paducah, Ky. The
administration has suggested paying sick Paducah workers $100,000
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Energy leases both plants to a private
company.
</P>
<P>
   DOE could make an announcement as early as Wednesday on the
findings of a study of compensation issues prompted by revelations
that some workers at its plants were not informed when exposed to
radioactive substances and were not given proper protective gear.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the agency had refused to acknowledge workers'
health problems might be linked to work at the plants, all of which
were part of the U.S. nuclear weapons production effort during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has said he is committed to
addressing the health and environmental concerns involving the
gaseous diffusion plants in Ohio and Kentucky, a former uranium
processing plant in Tennessee, and at Energy Department plants that
handled beryllium, a metal used in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson already has asked Congress to approve a compensation
program for a limited number of workers with cancers linked to
radiation exposure, and for workers with incurable beryllium
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation proposal, which is before Congress, would
provide medical benefits, lost-wage reimbursement, optional job
retraining or a single $100,000 cash payment to workers suffering
illnesses caused by beryllium exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has proposed similar compensation for workers
at the Paducah plant.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Paducah plan, the proposal for Piketon workers would
cover those who spent at least one year on the job between 1953 and
Feb. 1, 1992, who ''were badged or should have been badged'' to
measure their radiation exposure and who contracted one of a
specific list of diseases, Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   The diseases include certain types of leukemia, lymphoma,
myeloma, bone cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, stomach
cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer, provided the victims were not
heavy smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland is working with Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., on another
compensation plan that would give medical care and $200,000 to
sickened workers at every nuclear weapons plant.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, also has been working on a
compensation plan, but it has not yet been introduced. His
spokesman said workers deserve more than what is being offered by
the Clinton administration.

<HEADLINE> Weinstein: Reports of cost overruns will not delay E-ZPass start  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Possible demands for extra cash from the
firms installing the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system will
not delay the work, state Transportation Commissioner James
Weinstein said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said E-ZPass, already in operation at Garden State
Parkway toll plazas in Middlesex County and north of there, will be
operational in Monmouth County toll plazas by summer and throughout
the parkway by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the New Jersey Turnpike, which is already three months
behind schedule, E-ZPass is expected to be operational sometime in
August. While parkway toll plazas can convert to E-ZPass one at a
time, the turnpike must implement the system all at once at all of
its toll plazas.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reports in The Star-Ledger of Newark, Weinstein
told lawmakers at the Assembly Budget Committee Tuesday that a
reported demand by one of the E-ZPass construction contractors for
an additional $75 million has not been formally filed and will not
be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were contingencies in the $43 million contract to
install E-ZPass that will allow for some cost overruns, but that
such a massive amendment to the contract would not be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's fiction is that there is serious consideration being
given to a subcontractor's piece of paper that says the cost to
this has to be $75 million. It is fiction, it is a pipe dream, it
will not happen,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   However, when pressed on details, Weinstein said higher
''discretionary'' costs could be involved as E-ZPass contractors
document work they have done or need to do that was not specified
in the original contract, such as repairing old toll-plaza
structures. Additional work yet to be done could include protecting
the E-ZPass systems from lightning damage.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein confirmed the Star-Ledger's report of increased
spending by construction firms that had been hired as
subcontractors by the prime E-ZPass contractor, Adesta
Communications, and further that talks were occurring with Adesta
officials about contract changes.
</P>
<P>
   But Weinstein ruled out a change in the contract to raise the
price to more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers questioned Weinstein about the financial stability of
Able Telcom, the parent company of Adesta Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The state originally awarded the $43 million contract to install
E-ZPass plus the $500 million contract to operate the multistate
system to a subsidiary of WorldCom, which last year sold the
subsidiary to Able Telcom.
</P>
<P>
   Able Telcom earlier this year ran into debt problems that
threatened to drive it into bankruptcy, although Weinstein on
Tuesday said new corporate financing has resolved the emergency. He
said at no time did any of the fiscal turmoil interfere with the
progress of work on the toll roads.

<HEADLINE> SLA Case Gag Order Made More Strict  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge who promised to modify a gag order in
the case of a former Symbionese Liberation Army fugitive issued a
more restrictive order Tuesday that forbids parties from commenting
on a wide array of subjects including the judge's own rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge James Ideman set out nine separate areas in
which parties, attorneys and witnesses are barred from commenting
and said his order ''is not limited to any geographical boundaries
given the reach of modern communications.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am stunned,'' said Carol Sobel, an American Civil Liberties
Union attorney who joined the Sara Jane Olson defense in seeking
modification of the original order. ''When we were in Judge
Ideman's court he said he recognized his order was overbroad and
now he's issued one that's even more overbroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the order, she said, no party or witness could say
anything remotely related to the case without being in violation of
the order.
</P>
<P>
   ''And this order is not limited to talking to the press,'' she
said, noting that attorneys talking to their friends could be in
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel, who does not consider herself or the ACLU a party to the
case, said she is likely to appeal the order. ''It's sweeping and
it's stifling,'' she said. ''It's nothing short of outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jordan, the lawyer who represents Olson, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''To comment on this order would be to violate it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing March 22, Ideman said: ''There is no question the
order needs to be modified. It is too broad. But I don't intend to
lift it entirely. I don't think it is in the interest of justice to
have a freewheeling discussion in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot stop the talk,'' Jordan said at that hearing.
''This is a subject for debate. The public is entitled to know how
the system works and how much money is being spent.''
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of the gag order was Deputy District Attorney
Michael Latin, who wanted to prevent pretrial comments on his case
including the credibility of his key witness, Patty Hearst Shaw, a
convicted bank robber who has said she does not want to testify.
Hearst herself has said her past makes her a less-than-credible
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan asked Ideman to allow Olson to speak at fund-raising
events and suggested the judge would not be able to stop public
debate about why the case is being tried 25 years after the events
in question.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, 53, is accused of conspiring to murder by putting bombs
that didn't explode under police cars in a failed 1975 plot to
avenge six SLA members killed in a shootout. Formerly known as
Kathleen Ann Soliah, she was a fugitive until her arrest last year
in St. Paul, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Ariz. Teacher Shot Herself  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A school teacher who reported being shot in
her empty classroom confessed to authorities that she shot herself.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Kathy Morris had also sent herself threatening letters,
Pima County sheriff's spokeswoman Deanna Coultas said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Morris told authorities she did it to highlight the lack of
security at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we're dealing with irrational thinking and irrational
behavior,'' Coultas said.
</P>
<P>
   She said authorities were looking into other motives and past
incidents with the school but declined to elaborate, citing
confidentiality issues. Morris has taught at the school since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Morris reported Monday that she had been shot in the shoulder in
her classroom by a young Hispanic man after excusing herself from a
staff meeting. The shooting occurred about 90 minutes before
students were scheduled to begin class.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 35, was in fair condition Tuesday at University Medical
Center. Morris has declined all requests for interviews, according
to hospital spokeswoman Vicki Gaubeca.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Morris' allegation was destructive, damaging, and
insulting to our students and members of the district's minority
community,'' district Superintendent Robert J. Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Morris had been placed on paid administrative leave
pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Coultas said investigators found a gun that had been fired once
in a false bottom of Morris' purse.
</P>
<P>
   Coultas said Morris was not immediately facing any criminal
charges, but the Pima County attorney's office was seeking to have
her sent to a mental health facility.
</P>
<P>
   A school custodian told investigators he heard a shot but there
were no witnesses, Coultas said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, sheriff's deputies, including SWAT officers,
searched the two-story school before expanding their search into
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   After all other teachers and school personnel were accounted
for, school officials canceled classes Monday. Students returned to
class Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard Case May Go to Jury Soon  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AFFLECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Forensic evidence like DNA shows Dr. Sam
Sheppard did not beat his wife to death in 1954 and also validates
his son's long fight to clear his father's name, an attorney said
in closing arguments Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you follow your common sense and follow your instincts and
use your intellect, I think that you will come up with the only
conclusion that is possible,'' Terry Gilbert said. ''Sam did not
commit this crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's client, Sam Reese Sheppard, has sued the state of Ohio
claiming his father was wrongfully imprisoned for his mother's
slaying in the case that inspired ''The Fugitive'' television
series and film.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were expected to begin deliberating Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyahoga County prosecutors, who have been defending the state,
told jurors Tuesday that authorities had the right man all along.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may just be that you are being asked to reward the killer's
son for the killer bludgeoning his wife,'' Prosecutor William Mason
told jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard was convicted of murder and spent almost a decade in
prison before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the verdict in a
landmark ruling on the effects of pretrial publicity. Sheppard was
acquitted at a retrial in 1966 and died four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors described Sheppard as a cheating husband who killed
his wife because he felt trapped in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Sheppard was found lying in a pool of blood on her bed
early on July 4, 1954, at the couple's home on Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert told jurors that Sheppard never varied from his alibi:
that he was sleeping downstairs at the time of the killing and
awoke to his wife's cries. He ran upstairs to help her but was
knocked out. Upon waking up, he chased the killer -- whom he
identified as a bushy-haired man -- down to the beach outside the
house but was knocked unconscious again.
</P>
<P>
   He reviewed testimony from scientific experts who indicated
through DNA and blood evidence that a third person bled in the
Sheppards' bedroom. That person must be the killer, Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA evidence ''excludes the critical parties in this case,''
Gilbert said. ''It's not from Sam and it's not from Marilyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Reese Sheppard, who was 7 at the time of the killing, has
worked since the late 1980s to try to clear his father's name.

<HEADLINE> Court refuses child killer access to DNA 12 years after trial  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- He didn't make it an issue at his 1988
trial. He didn't mention it in any of his earlier appeals.
</P>
<P>
   And now a convicted child killer can't use DNA evidence to
possibly overturn his double-murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court ruled Tuesday that the evidence is off
limits for the Plainfield man who killed his girlfriend's two
children after he sexually assaulted one of them, a 7-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11-page opinion, the court recognized the growing use of
DNA evidence and the growing improvements in testing those
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, every defendant cannot forever seek to have
post-judgement tests conducted in the hopes that something
beneficial may result, even assuming that the evidence to be tested
remains available,'' wrote appellate division Presiding Judge Edwin
H. Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Halsey, who had faced the death penalty at his trial, is
now serving two life sentences for the murders and assault.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the testimony against Halsey were his two
confessions to police and the results of a polygraph test he failed
before his arrest. He did not testify before the jury, but his
attorney presented claims that Halsey was intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Halsey appealed his initial sentence as well as the conviction,
beginning in 1991. It wasn't until May 1997 that he asked the state
to turn over evidence collected during an exam of the child as well
as ''semen on the victim's panties'', according to the appeal.
Prosecutors presented no scientific evidence using that evidence at
the trial that linked Halsey to the killings, the court noted.
</P>
<P>
   In this appeal, Halsey's public defender simply said an analysis
of the clothing and the DNA ''will undoubtedly prove that he is
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   That was simply not enough of a reason ''in light of the
overwhelming evidence of the defendant's participation in the crime
and the nature of the defense,'' the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been no showing of what defendant believes the
testing will reveal, the basis for such a belief, and why defendant
did not present a defense at trial which the testing he now seeks
would support,'' Stern said in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The court however did leave a door open for Halsey. Defendants
can appeal at any time for a new trial based on the claim of newly
discovered evidence. And prosecutors are required to maintain
physical evidence in homicide cases throughout the appeals process
and in some cases beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We only hold that this defendant has not shown enough to
compel testing of whatever evidence may remain available at this
late date,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Matthew Astore said Halsey maintains his innocence
and repeatedly challenged his confessions and the polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state should at least turn over the evidence so we can
test it. Why would they not want to know,'' Astore asked.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Kevin Elster made a splash in the opener of
Pacific Bell Park, and he didn't even put the ball in the drink.
</P>
<P>
   Elster homered three times to overcome one each by Barry Bonds,
J.T. Snow and Doug Mirabelli and lead the Los Angeles Dodgers over
the San Francisco Giants 6-5 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sellout crowd of 40,930, the $319 million stadium by
the bay near downtown formally opened with many in short sleeves.
It was in stark contrast to the wind and cold at Candlestick Park,
the Giants' home for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, who was out of baseball last year and made the Dodgers
as a non-roster player, had the first homer in the cozy park, a
third-inning drive off Kirk Rueter (0-1) that tied it at 1.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a two-run shot in a three-run fifth and added a solo
homer in the eighth off Felix Rodriguez, finishing 3-for-3 with
four RBIs in the first three-homer game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park (2-0) allowed three runs and six hits in six
innings, and Jeff Shaw got three outs for his second save despite
allowing Snow's leadoff homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who took their rivalry with the Giants to the West
Coast after the 1957, also won the final game at the old ballpark
last Sept. 30, that one by 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   The twin draws of the new field and national pastime were
evident in the stands and along side the five port-holes in the
right field wall, where hundreds of people stood on the pier-side
walkway watching the game as if they were kids peering through a
knothole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this heaven?' read one sign held aloft by a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter threw the first pitch at 1:39 p.m. -- a ball -- after
hour-long pregame ceremonies that began with a ballpark blessing by
two Franciscan friars and finished with Bobby McFerrin's stirring
rendition of the national anthem punctuated by a thundering flyover
by a squadron of Navy fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White was the first batter up and got the first hit in the
new park, a single to left. He quickly became the first runner
caught stealing when Rueter picked him off first.
</P>
<P>
   The commencement of play coincided with the release of hundreds
of red, white and blue balloons and a barrage of fireworks lighting
up the sky above Willie McCovey cove, the inlet just beyond the
right-field wall that serves as a splash landing for home runs
balls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we begin a new century of Giants baseball, playing the
best game there ever was in the best city in the best city in the
best ballpark,'' said team owner Peter Magowan, who led the
investor group that bought the club eight years ago, preventing a
move to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Magowan, who oversaw the construction of the first privately
financed major league ballpark in 38 years, joined club executive
Larry Baer in throwing out ceremonial first pitches, Magowan
recalled his first opening day as Giants owner in 1993 at San
Francisco's windy stadium on Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a full house, a beautiful day. Tony Bennett was there,
the Grateful Dead. Barry Bonds homered in his first at-bat as a
Giant. We won the game and it was the start of a great year,''
Magowan said. ''But we still had to open that game in Candlestick
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' RBI double in the first scored Bill Mueller with the
ballpark's first run and his third-inning homer gave San Francisco
a 2-1 lead. Elster's homer and Shawn Green's RBI single put Los
Angeles ahead 4-2 in the fifth, but Jeff Kent scored on a wild
pitch in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo Berroa had an RBI single off Alan Embree in the
seventh, and Mirabelli's homer off Terry Adams pulled the Giants to
5-4 in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The home opener was the second of three for the Dodgers,
who began the season April 3 at Montreal by beating the Expos 10-4
and return to Los Angeles for their home opener on Friday against
Cincinnati. ... Elster had three previous two-homer games, most
recently May 2, 1998, at Boston while with Texas. ... The Dodgers
placed RHP Gregg Olson on the 15-day disabled list with a right
forearm strain and recalled LHP Jeff Williams from Triple-A
Albuquerque. ... Mirabelli had the first Pac Bell triple in the
second inning, a drive off the base of the center-field wall. It
was also the first triple of his career.

<HEADLINE> Houston Trades Bako to Florida  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Backup catcher Paul Bako was traded Tuesday from
the Houston Astros to the Florida Marlins for cash and a player to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   The move allows Houston to keep rookie Mitch Meluskey on the
roster. Bako, acquired in a trade with Detroit last year, likely
would not have cleared waivers had the Astros tried to demote him
to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Bako, 27, hit .256 with 17 RBIs in 215 at-bats in 1999. As the
club's third catcher this season behind Tony Eusebio and Meluskey,
Bako was 0-for-2 in the first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a tough thing for me to do because Paul is a major
league quality player,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker
said. ''You always try to protect yourself against injury and depth
is something you always want. But having Paul as the third catcher
was not a productive situation. It's difficult to carry three
catchers.''
</P>
<P>
   To replace Bako, the Astros promoted infielder Julio Lugo from
their Triple-A team at New Orleans. Outfielder Matt Mieske
eventually is expected to take the roster spot, when he returns
from the disabled list, possibly as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Astros officials said the health of third baseman Ken
Caminiti could change that. Caminiti has missed the last two days
with a slight hamstring pull and he is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not sure what we'll do when Mieske comes off,'' manager
Larry Dierker said. ''Because we don't know what we're going to
have to do with Caminiti, if he'll be ready. Lugo can play both
infield and outfield so that's why we brought him up now.''

   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, 1861, the American Civil War began as Confederate
forces fired on Fort Sumter in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On this date:
</P>
<P>
   In 1606, England adopted as its flag the original version of the
Union Jack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1862, Union volunteers led by James J. Andrews stole a
Confederate train near Marietta, Ga., but were later caught. (This
episode inspired the Buster Keaton comedy ''The General.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, ''Tender Is the Night,'' by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was
first published.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt died of a cerebral
hemorrhage in Warm Springs, Ga., at age 63; he was succeeded by
Vice President Harry S. Truman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, the Salk vaccine against polio was declared safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man to
fly in space, orbiting the earth once before making a safe landing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the space shuttle Columbia blasted off from Cape
Canaveral on its first test flight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, radical activist Abbie Hoffman was found dead at his
home in New Hope, Pa., at age 52.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, former middleweight boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson
died in Culver City, California, at age 67.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Euro Disneyland opened in France.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago: In its first meeting, East Germany's first
democratically elected parliament acknowledged responsibility for
the Nazi Holocaust, and asked the forgiveness of Jews and others
who had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: In a move that stunned the business world,
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian and former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
made an unsolicited $22.8 billion-dollar bid to buy the nation's
third largest automaker; Chrysler responded that it wasn't for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright cited
President Clinton for contempt of court, concluding that the
president had lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky in a
deposition in the Paula Jones case. A jury in Little Rock, Ark.,
acquitted Susan McDougal of obstructing Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's Whitewater inquiry and deadlocked on two other charges,
causing a mistrial.

<HEADLINE> Bush Unveils $42B Plan for Poor  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Continuing his outreach to independent and
moderate Democratic voters, Republican George W. Bush on Tuesday
rolled out a five-year, $42 billion plan to help the working poor
move up into the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest share of money, $35 billion, would be used for tax
credits to help people who don't get health insurance from their
employers but earn too much to qualify for government programs like
Medicaid. They could use the credits to gain access to basic
private health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $5 billion would be used to provide health care
through medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would include $1 billion to help low-income
renters buy homes and another $1 billion to give tax credits to
banks that match the savings deposits of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called New Prosperity Initiative continues the presumed
Republican presidential nominee's outreach to independents and
moderate Democrats by talking about subjects often ignored by GOP
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bush unveiled environmental and educational
proposals. On Wednesday, he was speaking to a St. Louis audience
about additional health care plans. Aides said Bush also will
unveil proposed spending cuts as part of a broader government
reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Missouri later in the day, Bush noted for the 1,000
people gathered in an airport hangar in Columbia that the state is
a bellwether that could help choose the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's the case, I think you're looking at the next
president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing his newest proposals for the poor, Bush was
criticized for the lack of progress on health care at home in
Texas, where he is in his second term as governor and where up to
one-fourth of the population lacks health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our newspapers and television programs praise and profile all
the winners in our high-tech economy, but we must never become a
winner-take-all society,'' Bush told about 250 community and church
leaders at the West Side Ecumenical Ministry on Cleveland's heavily
Democratic West Side.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our economy must also honor and reward the hard work of
factory and field, of waiting tables and driving cabs -- not just
enterprise, but sheer effort, not just technology, but toil,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, immediately
pounced on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps Bush calls this proposal his 'New Prosperity
Initiative' because fixing health care, affordable housing and
lifting people out of poverty are all 'new' to him, since he has
failed to address these issues in Texas,'' said a campaign
statement.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, some 1.4 million of the nearly 11 million
children nationwide without health insurance are Texans, according
to state health officials.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to 1999, 193,400 Texas children, or 14.2 percent, were
dropped from Medicaid, according to a report by Families USA, a
Washington-based nonprofit group that supports affordable health
and long-term care for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of the state's overall population is uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   State officials counter that about 500,000 of the children who
lack insurance will be eligible for the federal-state Children's
Health Insurance Program beginning this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's initiative includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- A tax credit of up to $2,000 per family to cover 90 percent of
health insurance costs. Also, permission for employees to roll over
$500 in Flexible Savings Accounts from one year to the next, and to
expand and make permanent Medical Savings Accounts, which are
tax-free accounts for catastrophic health care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Support for legislation that would allow local public housing
authorities to provide Section 8 renters -- those who receive a
government subsidy to pay market rents -- up to a years' worth of
vouchers in a lump sum to finance the down payment and closing
costs on a house. Other low-income renters would be helped with an
''American Dream Down Payment Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Build personal savings by supporting legislation that
encourages Individual Development Accounts, or matched savings
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   -- Previously announced tax changes, including lowering the
bottom tax bracket from 15 percent to 10 percent and doubling the
per-child tax credit from $500 to $1,000.

<HEADLINE> Senators Aim To Curb 'Sex Slaves'  </HEADLINE>

Senators Aim To Curb 'Sex Slaves'   
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two senators want to see life sentences
imposed on people who bring young children into the country to work
as sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and Sam Brownback, R-Kan., plan
separate bills aimed at cracking down on an illegal industry the
CIA said brings 50,000 women and girls into this country every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sex trade is the new slavery,'' Brownback said. ''Our
estimates are that 700,000 primarily young girls are trafficked a
year. It's one of the most awful aspects of the new global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone called the practice ''morally outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The only difference in the senators' bills, which will be
unveiled Wednesday, is how they would punish countries that don't
meet ''minimum standards'' to eliminate sex trade trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback's bill calls for sanctions to automatically be imposed
for the most serious violators. Under Wellstone's bill, the
president would have the discretion to impose sanctions on such
countries. A House bill takes a similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said his review provision would kick in only for the
most egregious cases, where a country is participating or turning a
blind eye to the trade. Both senators said they would support
whichever bill makes it out of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both senators want life sentences for people trafficking
children under 14, and a 20-year prison term for those who bring
people 14 and older into the country to work in the sex trade.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would give victims a ''temporary visa'' of
up to three years, with the possibility of a longer stay after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''These women are afraid they will be deported'' and don't go to
the authorities, Wellstone said.

<HEADLINE> Poor Countries Seek End to Poverty  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Leaders of developing nations on Tuesday were
drawing up a call for a new world order meant to help them escape
poverty, while other heads of state held meetings aimed at solving
regional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers at the Group of 77 summit were proposing calls
on rich countries to forgive debts, increase aid and trade, share
new technologies and shift more decision-making to the United
Nations away from institutions such as the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to achieve a more democratic and equitable
arrangement,'' said a draft of the proposed plan of action for the
133-nation organization which is holding the first summit in its
34-year history.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 heads of state or government were to take part in the
top-level talks scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With many hours left open, some leaders also were tackling local
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''To those already enjoying them, the benefits of globalization
are clear,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a speech at
the University of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ''Many millions experience globalization not as an
agent of progress but as a disruptive force, capable of destroying
jobs, traditions and even a society's cohesion, sometimes with
lightening speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan told The Associated Press Tuesday that he planned to meet
Wednesday with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to discuss ways to
break the deadlock in efforts to try Khmer Rouge leaders for
genocide. Annan said that earlier reports that the pair met Monday
were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did some make some progress at the last discussions, but
the talks are ongoing and we have not concluded them yet. I haven't
met Prime Minister Hun Sen yet. It will be tomorrow,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan on Tuesday issued a statement praising the decision for a
summit between leaders of North and South Korea and offering ''to
contribute to efforts aimed at reducing tensions and promoting
mutual confidence in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending the summit is North Korea's ceremonial
head of state, parliament President Kim Yong Nam, though it was not
clear if he would have a private session with Annan.
</P>
<P>
   In documents under discussion, the country's representatives
urged richer nations to forgive debts of poorer countries while
increasing aid to the level of 0.7 percent of gross domestic
product, the amount promised in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo, whose nation chairs the
G-77, told a news conference Tuesday that such steps would help
promote democracy and stability, citing the case of Nigeria, where
his elected government replaced a military dictatorship last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have just established a new dispensation, a democratic
situation where we want to do everything right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo said that if he goes to villagers and tells them, ''I
wanted to give you water but I have to pay debts ... even though
the origin of these debts are dubious, and therefore I will not be
able to give you water ... they will say 'get away with your new
dispensation''' of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled out a joint decision by poor countries to suspend debt
payments, saying it would interfere with aid transfers that some
nations depend upon for part of their domestic budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The draft documents call for giving poor countries a greater
voice in development decisions by encouraging the United Nations to
take a bigger role in economic aid, rather than channeling it
through organizations controlled by rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggest easing patent restrictions that keep poor
nations from benefiting from new technologies and of setting up
mechanisms to share inventions.
</P>
<P>
   The drafts also called on rich countries to give preferential
trade concessions to poorer nations and to liberalize rules on
movement of labor as they have with movement of capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our peoples have run out of patience,'' Cuban Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque told a meeting of foreign ministers Tuesday.
''For decades they have suffered broken promises and are today
living in an economic and social situation that is increasingly
serious and unsustainable.''

<HEADLINE> Chief of Boston's 'Big Dig' Ousted  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McELHENNY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Gov. Paul Cellucci ousted the head of Boston's
troubled ''Big Dig'' on Tuesday after a stinging federal audit
claimed project managers hid crucial financial information about
the nation's largest-ever highway project.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci removed Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Chairman James
J. Kerasiotes after auditors detailed how Big Dig officials failed
in February to report $1.4 billion in expected cost overruns to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his zeal to do the job and complete this project, he did
something you can't do in a democracy. You can't withhold
information,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, auditors said the failure to immediately
disclose cost overruns ''stands as one of the most flagrant
breaches of the integrity of the federal-state partnership in the
history of the nearly 85-year-old federal aid highway program.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Kerasiotes apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have misled anyone, I am sorry. Clearly, people felt that
I did mislead them. I must accept that verdict and move on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Natsios, the state's secretary of administration and
finance, will succeed Kerasiotes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are keeping a close eye on the Big Dig, which
will create a three-mile buried highway beneath the city, because
the federal government is paying about 70 percent of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal audit, which estimated the project's pricetag at at
least $13.6 billion, made dozens of recommendations on how the
project should be managed, including a re-evaluation of whether the
Massachusetts Turnpike Authority should continue to manage the
project, as it has since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also recommended that federal highway officials
require extremely detailed accounts of the project's finances from
now on -- a recommendation U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater said he would accept.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't pull any punches. It's tough, candid and it is the
first step in helping restore confidence in this process,'' said
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Administration will also review whether Kerasiotes
or others should be barred from working on any other projects
involving federal money, the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched its own
investigation into whether Kerasiotes and other officials misled
investors by failing to disclose the cost overruns before a $200
million bond issue in December.
</P>
<P>
   Now the task of overseeing the agency that oversees the Big Dig
-- or, as it is officially known, the Central Artery/Third Harbor
Tunnel project -- falls to Natsios, who once served overseas as a
top humanitarian official for the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes had headed the project since 1992, when he was named
the state's transportation secretary. Four years later, then-Gov.
William Weld also appointed him to head the Turnpike Authority,
which overtook control of the project in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes' supporters said his outspoken self-assuredness and
strong will qualified him perfectly as a tough manager who wasn't
afraid to hurt people's feelings to save public tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But those qualities also earned him widespread criticism from
Beacon Hill to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The state auditor once said trying to get information from
Kerasiotes' team of Big Dig managers was like working with Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the federal official who oversaw the project for the
Federal Highway Administration, Peter Markle, was also removed from
his job. Critics in Congress had expressed outrage that the
project's cost had risen by $1.4 billion with no warning.

<HEADLINE> Former Sportscaster Sues ABC  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An Olympic gold medalist who spent three decades
in sports broadcasting is suing ABC, saying the network dropped her
because of her age and gender.
</P>
<P>
   Donna deVarona, 52, who set 18 world swimming records, filed the
$50 million lawsuit in U.S. District Court late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges ABC paid deVarona less than other
broadcasters and gave her fewer assignments, often of inferior
quality, because it was trying to appeal to younger viewers by
using younger sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the lawsuit says, a former vice president of ABC
Sports programming told deVarona ABC Sports was eager to recapture
the ''young 18 to 39 male market'' and that she should consider
looking for work elsewhere because her age was catching up to her.
</P>
<P>
   Her freelance contract, signed in 1991, was terminated two year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ABC responded to the allegations Tuesday, saying that changes
over the years in the events covered by ABC Sports, including the
loss of the Olympics, had reduced deVarona's role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. deVarona and her representatives were advised of this fact
over the years and she was encouraged to look for work elsewhere.
We believe Ms. deVarona was treated fairly and that this suit has
no merit,'' the network said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   DeVarona joined ABC in 1965 but quit 11 years later because she
was ''unable to break the discriminatory barriers facing a
pioneering female sports broadcaster,'' the lawsuit said. She later
returned to ABC and in 1980 was the first female host of Olympic
coverage at the games in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit alleges that after signing her freelance agreement
1991, ABC treated her in an ''intentional, calculated, callous and
opportunistic'' way in its efforts to appeal to a younger audience.

<HEADLINE> Trial begins in shooting death of man who tried to intervene  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- Alex Crawford was just trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old truck driver was in the parking lot of a
Pleasantville bar when he saw a gunman shoot another man in the
chest during an argument.
</P>
<P>
   He died trying to intervene, a prosecutor told jurors Tuesday in
the murder trial of the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alex Crawford got caught in a bad situation, being in the
wrong place at the wrong time, being a good Samaritan,'' Assistant
Atlantic County Prosecutor Cary Shill said in opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Carnell Gibbs, 24, of Pleasantville, is accused of murder,
attempted murder, conspiracy and weapons charges in the Oct. 22,
1998 shootings of John Byrd, 25, and Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Avenging earlier bad blood with Byrd, Gibbs pulled a 9-mm
handgun and shot Byrd during a chance encounter outside Wash's Inn
in Pleasantville, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was shot several times, but survived.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, who wasn't involved in the feud, approached Gibbs as
Gibbs walked away from Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had his hands up,'' Crawford's brother, Cory Crawford, 20,
testified. ''He was just regular walking, he had his hands up. He
asked (Gibbs) what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs then fired two shots at Crawford, killing him, according
to Shill.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and his alleged accomplice, cousin Thomas Allen, 22, fled
after the shooting and remained on the lam for three months before
turning themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has since pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and is
awaiting sentencing. If convicted, Gibbs could get life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Scott Becker acknowledged that Gibbs shot the
men, but said it was not premeditated and therefore wasn't murder.
He says it was self defense: Gibbs believed Byrd was reaching for a
pistol, and then shot Crawford when Crawford ran toward him,
screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is guilty,'' Becker said. ''The question is, is he guilty
of first-degree murder?''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the gallery in Superior Court Judge Robert
Neustadter's courtroom were Crawford's parents, two of his aunts
and his 3-year-old son, Alex Crawford Jr.
</P>
<P>
   One of his aunts, Edna Munns of Pleasantville, described
Crawford as a friendly guy who helped her and her husband with yard
work. She said she wasn't surprised when she learned how he died.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could understand it. That was just like him,'' Munns said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's mother, Katherine Crawford, 50, said the start of the
trial gave her mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to see him (Gibbs) being brought to justice, but
it's still hard to be here,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> S.F. Boaters Catch Baseball Action  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The boaters on McCovey Cove didn't mind
that they couldn't see the action on the field at Pacific Bell
Park. They were more interested in their catch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping to catch a milestone!'' Mike West shouted from his
boat.
</P>
<P>
   West's ''catacraft'' was among about four dozen boats of all
shapes and sizes crowded in McCovey Cove, just beyond the brick
right-field wall at the San Francisco Giants' new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone? The boaters were hoping to fish out the first
regular-season home run to clear the wall and splash into the cove,
nicknamed after Hall of Famer Willie McCovey, the Giants'
celebrated first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants opened their first season at the bayside ballpark
under sunny skies Tuesday with a 6-5 loss to the Dodgers. And,
alas, none of the home runs made it to the waters of the San
Francisco Bay -- although the Giants' J.T. Snow came close in the
ninth with a homer to right that was caught by a lucky fan
positioned in the seats atop the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell Park had a dress rehearsal two weekends ago when
the Giants hosted a pair of exhibition games. Against the New York
Yankees, Barry Bonds hit a homer that cleared the wall, bounced on
an outside walkway and then into the cove -- where it was fished out
by a lucky fan in a motorized inflatable dinghy.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark's first official home run went to left field -- not
right -- off the bat of Dodgers shortstop Kevin Elster in the third
inning. It was one of three homers Elster hit, all to left.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-foot-high right-field wall has five portholes for
passersby on the walkway to watch the game for free. The
right-field foul pole is just 309 feet from home plate, and balls
hit high enough and far enough over the wall can reach the water --
which is exactly what the Giants hope.
</P>
<P>
   The team had the ballpark designed with the bay in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the view of the bay is the coolest sight in all of
major league baseball,'' said architect Joe Spear of HOK Sport.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Nantz, playing catch with a friend on the walkway, hoped
the first right-field homer didn't make it to the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''See that X?'' asked Nantz, pointing to an 'X' he taped on the
cement. ''That's where the first one is gonna land!''
</P>
<P>
   Nantz said he almost had a hand on Bonds' exhibition homer, but
it took a bad bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Would he jump in if the ball splashed down just past his dry
spot on the walkway? ''Nah,'' he said, smiling. ''Not unless I have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs posted along the walkway read ''No swimming, diving or
wading. Violation of Port Code 3.2''
</P>
<P>
   Most boats were equipped with nets on long poles, just right for
scooping balls from the water. One fan came prepared for the
home-opening media frenzy: He taped a large sign reading ''Hi Mom!
Go Giants!'' on the windshield of his boat. Others stripped down to
shorts and swimwear, enjoying the spring sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   West got up early to drive from his home in San Jose for a prime
spot on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I collect home run balls and I'm an avid whitewater rafter,''
he said. ''So I guess I'm combining both my passions.''

<HEADLINE> Peruvians Cry Election Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- With President Alberto Fujimori just shy of
the majority of votes needed to win an unprecedented third term,
details surfaced Tuesday of voting irregularities and possible
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties said ballots with the names of other
candidates were waxed over, allowing only Fujimori's name to be
marked. Poll watchers also reported finding ballots favoring
opposition candidates that appeared to have been sabotaged to
invalidate them, and newspapers said the election board's computers
may have been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Roncagliolo, head of the private monitoring group
Transparencia, decried a ''volume of irregularities and
contamination without precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori denied any fraud at a news conference Monday night, his
only appearance since Sunday's elections. ''The process has been
clean, free and fair,'' he said. ''There were small incidents that
did not affect the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that with 90.82 percent of the ballots
counted, Fujimori had 49.79 percent, compared to Toledo's 40.39.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls and unofficial vote tallies by independent monitors
after the election had indicated Fujimori received significantly
less support and projected he would not reach the 50 percent plus
one vote needed to avoid a runoff. If no candidate wins a majority
of valid votes, a runoff would be held in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Toledo said he and his Peru
Posible party would not accept the election results ''if there is
no second round.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton administration spokesman Joe Lockhart
said the White House was aware of reports of irregularities. ''We
expect it will be a runoff, and I think serious questions will be
raised if the vote count indicated something otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Transparencia and the Council for Peace, a human rights
organization, reported various irregularities, including the
discovery of ballots already marked ahead of time for Fujimori near
a polling station in a working-class neighborhood of Lima. Similar
marked ballots were found in the town of San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers also reported finding ballots favoring opposition
candidates that appeared to have been sabotaged to invalidate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been innumerable accusations ... the most general
being the distribution of copies of pre-marked ballots,'' the
National Ombudsman Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's campaign said it found ballots in which Toledo's name,
listed last among the nine contenders, had been cut off at polling
stations in Lima, Huancayo, Trujillo and Piura.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern city of Piura, Ferran Zegarra, a local
representative of the Ombudsman Office, said 300 ballots had been
found in the nearby village of Tambogrande that had been printed
without Toledo's photo.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, ballots normally are destroyed after they have been
tallied, making it difficult to investigate any ballot tampering.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition newspapers La Republica and Liberacion also
reported that the election board's computers may have been tampered
with to alter the vote count to favor Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   El Comercio, Peru's leading independent newspaper, cited
computer experts as saying the election board's computer system was
vulnerable to tampering because it does not have sufficient
security. The elections board has 10 computer centers in Lima and
47 elsewhere around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Portillo, the official in charge of tabulating votes,
scoffed at the reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said there is a modem that can be used to alter
the election results. That is science fiction,'' he said. ''I would
like to have it to change my bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of his aides, Jose Cavassa, was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if the technology exists for modifying the
results or interfering with the electronic transmission of data,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Amazon As Market Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A top government official praised a
private-sector initiative launched Tuesday to certify
''environmentally correct'' timber as a way of curbing destruction
in the Amazon rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Initiatives like this one show that economic alternatives are
an important way to contribute to the preservation of the Amazon,''
said Mary Allegretti, the Environment Ministry's secretary for
Amazon issues.
</P>
<P>
   Allegretti also confirmed official figures, released in Brasilia
Tuesday, estimating 6,800 square miles of Amazon rain forest were
destroyed last year, much of it through illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 percent of the 2-million-square-mile wilderness already
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 companies from the furniture, packaging, printing,
flooring and other industries have signed on to the Brazilian
Buyers' Group of Certified Timber, pledging to use only wood ''from
forests planned and managed in an environmentally sustainable
fashion,'' said Roberto Smeraldi, executive director of Friends of
the Earth, which put the group together.
</P>
<P>
   While buyers' groups already exist in the United States, Canada,
Australia and in seven European countries, this is believed to be
the first in a developing nation.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumer-oriented campaigns tried mainly to curb exports
of lumber, ignoring the fact that Brazil is the world's largest
consumer market for tropical timber, Smeraldi said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, about 840 million cubic feet of tropical wood are
consumed in Brazil. ''And about 80 percent of the trees that
provide this wood are cut down illegally, with no concern for the
environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we create a bigger demand for certified timber, logging
companies eventually will have to provide it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure they do, Friends of the Earth and other local
environmental groups have joined forces with the Mexico-based
Forest Stewardship Council, an international non-governmental
organization that identifies well-managed forests and certifies
they are acceptable sources of forest products.
</P>
<P>
   The FSC also tracks the timber from the forest to the end
product, making sure that non-certified wood is not added along the
way.

<HEADLINE> Wounded Ore. Teens Receive Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ore. (AP) -- Twenty-five students wounded when Kip
Kinkel opened fire in the Thurston High School cafeteria two years
ago and the siblings of the two students killed in the attack will
share $150,000 in donations collected after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   John Lively, chairman of the Thurston Healing Fund's executive
committee, said letters have gone out to the families telling them
of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Each wounded student is to receive $4,000 from the fund, and the
five siblings of Ben Walker and Mikael Nickolauson will each
receive $10,000. A date for delivering the money has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has collected $476,000 in donations and interest since
the shooting May 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   About $130,000 has been paid out to cover victims' medical
expenses, travel and other costs related to the shooting. The
remaining $195,000 will be kept in the fund for five more years to
cover any continuing medical or mental health treatment the
survivors might need. Money remaining at the end of 2005 will be
split among the wounded students and families of the slain
students.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel, now 17, was convicted of murder last year and is serving
a life sentence in prison.

<HEADLINE> Russia Trying To Deflect Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia's U.N. Mission on Tuesday
circulated an appeal by 21 prominent Russians against Western
attempts to isolate Moscow or impose sanctions because of its
military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It was distributed as allegations of widespread Russian abuses
in Chechnya were being debated at the U.N. Human Rights Commission
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists and cultural figures asked the Russian and
international media to remember that the military action is aimed
at combatting terrorism -- and that the Russian people backed the
campaign by electing President Vladimir Putin on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ''We call on everybody, both our partners and opponents, to take
this will into account,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent troops into Chechnya for a second time last
September, after militants based in the territory invaded the
neighboring region of Dagestan. Chechens also are blamed for four
apartment bombings in Russia in September that killed 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the European Union have been sharply
critical of what they call excessive use of force by Russian
troops, widespread civilian suffering, and reports of human rights
abuses in the campaign against Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 Russians said soldiers in Chechnya were ''literally
guarding the sound sleep'' of their countrymen and should have been
supported by the world community which is spending huge resources
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Introduction of sanctions against Russia, declaration of an
international embargo on trade with our country, as well as
suspension of Russia's membership in a number of international
organizations are being discussed in earnest on a high level,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists who signed include Yuri Osipov, president of the
Russian Academy of Sciences, and Alexander M. Prokhorov, winner of
the 1964 Nobel Prize in physics.
</P>
<P>
   In the cultural field, signatories included directors Nikita
Mikhalkov, who won an Oscar in 1994 for Best Foreign Film with
''Burnt by the Sun,'' and Karen Shakhnazarov whose film ''The Day
of Full Moon'' was screened at last year's Cairo International Film
Festival. Irina Antonova, director of the Pushkin State Museum of
Fine Arts, pianist Nikolai Petrov, and singer Alexander Gradsky,
also signed the appeal.

<HEADLINE> After Delay, Haiti Vote Set for May  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haiti's long-delayed legislative
and local elections will be held May 21, the electoral council
announced Tuesday, in an effort to halt rising tensions in the
troubled Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
   The elections have been delayed three times since November, and
opposition politicians have accused President Rene Preval of trying
to derail the voting.
</P>
<P>
   The last delay came when Preval rejected an April 9 date, saying
the council had no authority to set a date without consulting him.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders received Tuesday's announcement warily.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has not yet officially set the new date,'' said
Gerard Pierre-Charles, leader of the majority opposition Struggling
People's Organization. ''We must consult with other parties and
with our members before we decide whether the new dates would be
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The new date, however, appeared to have Preval's support.
</P>
<P>
   Preval said Tuesday that he and the nine electoral council
members had reached a ''consensus'' Monday night. He spoke before
he left for a conference in Cuba and before the council's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Election council member Carlo Dupiton said, ''I don't think
there will be any new postponement.'' He said the vote would be
held May 21, ''so the atmosphere will be less tense'' -- referring
to the turmoil that has shaken the capital this month.
</P>
<P>
   The new date will not become official until Preval publishes an
executive order to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Preval has previously said there will be presidential elections
Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Dupiton did not say when a second round of voting in the
legislative and local elections would be held. But it could not be
in time to install a new Parliament on June 12, as the United
States and many Haitian political parties have demanded. Second
rounds are held to resolve inconclusive elections where no
candidate has won the required 50 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has not had a Parliament since January 1999, when Preval
shut it down after an 18-month power struggle with the Struggling
People's Organization. Preval appointed a new premier and the
electoral council by decree in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Elections have not been held since 1997 polls that the
opposition charged were rigged to pack Parliament with allies of
Preval and former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is widely
favored to win the coming presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Senate OKs Spending Limits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The government won a key victory in its
campaign for fiscal austerity Tuesday when the Senate approved
strict spending limits for federal, state and municipal
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 60-to-10 to approve the bill, known as the fiscal
responsibility law, which now goes to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso who is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The law will tighten payroll expenditures and public debt at all
three levels of government. It will also keep public administrators
from overspending ahead of the elections, a common practice here
especially among Brazil's 5,507 mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Payroll expenses will be limited to a maximum of 60 percent of
the budget. And long-term projects will be allowed only if
administrators show where the money will come from.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil pledged to curb its chronic budget deficit under a 1998
agreement with the International Monetary Fund in return for a
$41.5 billion loan. Cardoso said states and municipalities have run
up a debt of more than 110 billion reals, or about $61.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal responsibility law is viewed as a type of guarantee
that Brazil's austerity program ending in 2001 will be sustainable
in the long run, without the need for emergency tax hikes and
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a lower house committee is expected to approve a
separate bill establishing punishments for noncompliance with the
fiscal responsibility law.

<HEADLINE> Video shows dancer's body in bed of pickup truck resembling accusedkiller's  </HEADLINE>
Precede PHILADELPHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) -- The body of a woman believed to be a
slain stripper could be seen sprawled in the back of a pickup truck
as it drove across a Pennsylvania Turnpike bridge on the night she
was killed, officials confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The image was captured on videotape by surveillance equipment on
the bridge, according to a probable cause affidavit made public by
Burlington County Prosecutor Robert D. Bernardi.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, the truck can be seen crossing the bridge linking
the New Jersey and Pennsylvania turnpikes at about 3:13 a.m. on
March 29.
</P>
<P>
   ''The body is that of a small person wearing a white top, blue
jeans and white footwear. The description of the body is consistent
with that of Rachel Elizabeth Siani at the crime scene,'' according
to the affidavit, filed Friday by Detective J.C. Villamil of the
New Jersey State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The truck is a red Dodge believed to be that of John A. Denofa,
35, of Buckingham, Pa., who is accused of killing the 21-year-old
dancer. The affidavit does not identify the truck, but says its
aluminum trim, cylindrical step-bar and color match a 1996 Dodge
truck owned by Denofa.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit did not say whether Siani was alive or dead when
the truck passed through Toll No. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Siani, of Bensalem, Pa., suffered a fractured skull, lacerated
kidneys and punctured liver in a fall, according to the Burlington
County medical examiner, which ruled the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was found April 1 beneath the same bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Siani worked at Diva's International Gentleman's Club, a go-go
bar in Levittown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Denofa, a prominent businessman who was a Tuesday night regular
at the bar, told police he smoked marijuana with Siani the night
she disappeared, but that was the last he saw of her.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested after police searched his home, his truck and a
motel near the turnpike bridge in Levittown, Pa., where he rented a
room that night.
</P>
<P>
   According to the probable cause affidavit released Tuesday,
Officer Ken Burns of the Bristol Township Police Department saw
Siani and Denofa enter the Econo Lodge Motel about 2:40 a.m. March
29.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodstains were found on the door and curtain of Room 223 of
the motel and fibers found on the weather stripping and metal
channel of the window in Denofa's room resemble the fabric of
Siani's sweater, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a blood stain was found beneath the window, outside
the room, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Fibers matching Siani's sweater also were found in the bed of
the truck, which had blood stains on the bumper, trailer hitch,
license plate frame, bed and interior head liner, the affidavit
said.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified second woman who was with Denofa earlier in the
evening told police that when she left him, he was with Siani,
according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Denofa, who was being held without bail at the Bucks County
Prison, is awaiting extradition to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Several dancers at Diva's have described Denofa as a generous
tipper and courteous customer.
</P>
<P>
   Denofa owns J&AMP;L Wholesale Tapes, a sign and equipment supplies
business in Warminster, Pa., and lives in an expensive home. Denofa
and his wife, Lisa, held a neighborhood Labor Day party annually
and were well liked, according to residents.

<HEADLINE> Russian Proposes Nuke Waste Import  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Ministry of Atomic Energy said Tuesday it
wants to import 20,000 tons of nuclear waste to Russia to boost the
country's economy, but parliament would first have to cancel a law
forbidding most of such imports.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed program, countries exporting nuclear waste to
Russia would pay $21 billion over 10 years. Most of the waste would
be spent fuel rods from civilian nuclear power plants in Europe and
Asia, Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov said.
</P>
<P>
   The expected earnings are nearly equal to Russia's entire
federal budget in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deal is extremely beneficial for (the ministry), and we
are intending to carry it out,'' Adamov said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Minister Valentin Ivanov said the plan is at a stage of
''market research'' to study global demand among countries eager to
unload their waste, and lobbying parliament. About 200,000 tons of
nuclear waste is now stored at temporary sites worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry plan proposes recycling the waste at the Mayak
facility in the Ural Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The process extracts usable nuclear material for new fuel rods
while improving safety by reducing the material's potential to be
used in weapons, said Ivanov, the ministry's top nuclear scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The spent fuel would travel across European Russia or Siberia by
rail in armored wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian and foreign environmental groups object to the
plan, which has been under discussion for several years, saying
Russia is already awash in nuclear waste from domestic sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an extremely dangerous and cynical deal to generate
billions of dollars which will add to the enormous environmental
problems that already exist in Russia,'' Greenpeace nuclear
campaigner Tobias Muenchmeyer said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 law forbids importing nuclear materials from foreign
countries other than former East Bloc nations with existing
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia now imports spent fuel rods from Ukraine, Bulgaria,
Slovakia and Hungary for reprocessing, a system established during
Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Adamov said his ministry plans to make $550 million
reprocessing Soviet bomb-grade material into civilian reactor fuel
this year under a U.S.-sponsored program begun in 1993. The program
aims to reduce available bomb-grade material and reduce the risk of
theft.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Police Probe Recent Killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (AP) -- Police are investigating whether the
gangland-style killing of four young men in the border city of
Nuevo Laredo may have been tied to drugs or a dispute over a
romance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, Jorge Lopez Rodriguez, 20, was a native of
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The four were killed after their car, which Lopez Rodriguez was
driving, was cut off by another vehicle, from which gunmen opened
fire on Monday in Nuevo Laredo, just south of Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, Roberto Gonzalez, 17, died in the back seat of
the car. Another passenger, Gerardo Garza Avitia, 17, was shot
three times, then run over by the gunmen's car as he tried to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The third passenger, Pedro Garza Armendariz, 16, died in a
hospital Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Rodriguez was forced into the gunmen's car and driven
around for an hour before being shot to death and dumped nine
blocks from where the others were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Hilario Molina, a deputy state attorney general, said
investigators are exploring whether the killings may have been
drug-related -- a common cause of much of the violence on the
border. Lopez Rodriguez had been recently released from prison,
where he had been serving time for auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   But Molina said it could also be related to a dispute Lopez
Rodriguez was having with the family of a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect has been arrested but authorities have not decided
whether to charge him in the killings.

<HEADLINE> Chile Bans 100 Pro-Nazi Visitors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The government has banned some 100
foreigners from entering Chile after learning they were planning to
attend an international gathering planned by pro-Nazi groups.
</P>
<P>
   The government had previously prohibited the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have compiled a list of some 100 people, dulely identified,
who will be stopped at airports or borders because they plan to
attend the Nazi-congress,'' deputy Interior Minister Jorge Burgos
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burgos would not give any names, but he said some of those on
the list are well-known pro-Nazi activists who face arrest
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos last month said his government would not
allow the gathering to take place in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was scheduled to start next week and was to last for
five days, according to its organizer, Alexis Lopez, leader of the
New Society Movement, a small pro-Nazi group.
</P>
<P>
   Burgos said the government believes organizers of the meeting
have mostly been looking for media attention ''rather than
organizing something real big.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted some foreigners may still slip into the country and
that a small gathering may take place ''at some private home, but
they will not succeed in holding a massive gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering had been scheduled to take place in Santiago, or
in the port city of Valparaiso, 75 miles to the northwest.

<HEADLINE> House Chaplain Conducts Mass  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first Roman Catholic chaplain of the House
was welcomed Tuesday at a Mass and reception organized by the
Republican Party, but he said politics had nothing to do with his
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think some people think there are political overtones to my
being here,'' the Rev. Daniel P. Coughlin told a group of about 200
gathered in the basement of St. Peter's Church near the Capitol.
''There is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The events put on by the Republican National Committee were
criticized by Democrats as appearing to be a political ploy by the
GOP to woo Catholics, who account for a quarter of the vote in
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicagoan's appointment as chaplain last month followed a
bitter process during which some Democrats accused GOP leaders of
being anti-Catholic because they at first appeared to pass over a
priest in favor of a Protestant for the post.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview about Tuesday's events, Coughlin said he ''just
though it was a Catholic group'' that proposed them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt it was inappropriate for a political party to
honor him given the highly divisive nature of the selection
process, Coughlin said: ''Anything that seems partisan -- yes. I
hope for another invitation'' from other groups.
</P>
<P>
   RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson said it was possible Coughlin did not
know Republicans organized the events, because they were put
together by the former ambassador to the Vatican, Thomas Melady.
Melady heads the RNC's Catholic Task Force, an effort to draw
Catholic voters into the party.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson insisted the events were intended not to score
political points, but merely to introduce Coughlin to lawmakers he
will be counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can anybody politicize the celebration of a Mass?''
Nicholson told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to the group, Nicholson proclaimed: ''This is a wonderful
day for our country, and for our party, and our church.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 26 House Republicans who are on the RNC task force were
issued personal invitations to the event, along with other
prominent Republican Catholics, said RNC spokesman Chris Paulitz.
All other House members of both parties were just sent advisories
alerting them.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of House members attended, most Republican.
However, Coughlin said he had been ''approached by a couple people
who identified themselves as part of the minority party.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his new job has kept him extremely busy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it somewhat disarming to be on regular prayer on
C-Span,'' the slight, unassuming man said to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of being in awe of his grand new everyday surroundings
-- ''Walking through the hallways -- I hope I never lose that'' -- and
of feeling ''the weight of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said scores of delighted Catholics have written to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has made Catholics around the country very, very happy
and very proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other Republican
leaders came under fire late last year when they announced the
selection of the Rev. Charles Wright for the chaplain job.
Democrats insisted that a Catholic priest, the Rev. Timothy
O'Brien, was the top choice of a bipartisan selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker vehemently denied their characterizations of
anti-Catholic bias. Wright eventually withdrew and Hastert
unexpectedly appointed Coughlin.

<HEADLINE> Bush Appointee 'Regrets' Comments  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HOLMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Health Commissioner William ''Reyn''
Archer apologized Tuesday for comments he made in newspaper
interviews about Hispanics and teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deeply regret that I have created an erroneous impression
about Hispanics and teen pregnancy. I apologize for any harm that
it may have caused,'' Archer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's apology referred to remarks he made to The New York
Times and the Austin American-Statesman in articles published
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Times story, Archer said Texas' high teen pregnancy rate
came about because the state's Hispanic population lacked the
belief ''that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were to go to a Hispanic community and say, 'Well, we
need to get you into family planning,' they say, 'No, I want to be
pregnant,' it doesn't work very well,'' he told the Times.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Austin newspaper, ''I think the Hispanic community
generally thinks that pregnancy is a positive thing. Society values
pregnancies in teen-agers as bad, but certain communities within
society may feel differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's comments brought an outcry from the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the same time minorities hear that race discrimination is a
thing of the past, you see high public officials promote negative
cultural stereotypes about Latinos,'' said Al Kauffman, MALDEF
regional counsel in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, a physician, was chosen by the Texas Board of Health in
1997 and Gov. George W. Bush approved his appointment. He is the
son of retiring Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the House
Ways and Means Committee.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Japan: Economy Improving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Improvements in Japan's economy are becoming
increasingly visible, the Bank of Japan said in its monthly report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recovery has started in some areas of private demand, as seen
in a gradual upturn in business fixed investment,'' the central
bank said.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment represents an upgrade in the bank's view of the
country's economy, which is struggling to emerge from its worst
downturn in decades.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's report, the bank said the economy had ''started
to improve'' but that clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in
private demand had yet to be observed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report comes after the economy fell back into
technical recession late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced last month that gross domestic product
-- the measure of all goods and services produced within Japan's
borders -- fell 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter, the
second consecutive period of negative growth.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Council OKs Member Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The three divisions of the NCAA Management
Council agreed Tuesday to recommend a two-year moratorium on new
membership in the association.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean new members and those wanting changes in
division membership must wait until Sept. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said escalating membership in recent years prompted
the moratorium request, explaining it would allow time for the
divisions to evaluate and plan for championships,
educational/compliance programs, and necessary support services.
</P>
<P>
   The Division III recommendation would permit a Division I or II
school to reclassify to Division III during the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations will be forwarded to the appropriate
presidential group in each division and on to the NCAA's Executive
Committee later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In Division I, the Management Council approved a recommendation
for modifications to automatic qualification legislation for
Division I championships. The modification would require, for
example, that to be considered for automatic qualification into the
Division I men's basketball championship, a member conference must
have seven members which have been active Division I participants
for eight preceding years. In addition, six of those institutions
must have conducted conference competition together in Division I
for the five preceding years in men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for three exceptions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Before September 1, 2003, a Division I conference that was an
NCAA member as of Sept. 1, 1999, may be considered for automatic
qualification in all sports by meeting either existing automatic
qualification provisions or those in effect on September 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   -- Before Sept. 1, 2003, the eight-year core principle will not
apply to a Division I active, provisional or reclassifying
institutions as of Sept. 1, 1999. They would be subject to
provisions in effect on Sept. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   -- After Sept. 1, 2003, a Division I conference as of Sept. 1,
1999 may continue to apply automatic qualification requirements in
effect on Sept. 1, 1999 until any change in men's basketball
membership occurs
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation also includes a one-year grace period
for conferences unable to meet the core-member requirement in men's
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In other action the council agreed not to approve a measure that
would have recommended an earlier calendar date for telephone calls
to high school juniors in women's basketball. The council approved
allowing one telephone call to a prospect between April 24 and May
14 of the junior year Tuesday morning, but reconsidered the
proposal when student-athlete council members noted that the
measure would be intrusive to prospects during a heavy academic
time of the year and that a similar measure affecting men's
basketball recruits was defeated on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Division I Council sent to the Board of Directors
legislation to modify Division I-A football attendance
requirements. The proposal provides that a Division I school meets
football attendance requirements if it averages more than 17,000 in
actual paid attendance for home games in the immediate four-year
period. One current exception to the requirement will be retained.
A school that fails to meet home-attendance requirements can retain
Division I-A football status if it is a member of a conference
which has at least six members sponsoring football and more than
half of them meet the attendance criterion.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the legislation is to establish more stringent
attendance standards consistent with expectations for competing in
the subdivision while providing deserving institutions interested
in moving to Division I-A the opportunity to participate at that
level.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that fail to meet requirements would be placed in a
restricted membership category for a maximum of three years. If the
institution fails to meet the requirements after three years, it
would be reclassified into the appropriate subdivision.

<HEADLINE> Shorts, Tees Abound at S.F. Opener  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Balls splashing into San Francisco Bay. A
26-foot-tall mitt in left field. Yet the strangest sight at
Tuesday's debut of Pacific Bell Park was Giants fans in shorts and
T-shirts instead of parkas and mittens.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't an earmuff to be found when the Giants opened their
$319 million ballpark with a 6-5 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The temperature at game time, following an hour-long ceremony with
fireworks and jet flyovers, was 65 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm skipping school to be here. My dad said it was OK,''
12-year-old Stephen Mason said. ''This is better than Candlestick
because it's not as windy. I didn't like night games there.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles down the bay at windswept Candlestick Park, now
relegated to the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, fans and players
dreaded the cold winds that swirled through the stadium on summer
nights.
</P>
<P>
   So even those fans who wore shorts and suntan lotion to
Tuesday's opener packed an extra layer or two of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have sweatshirts, sweatpants, windbreakers just in case,''
said Dan Block, who was wearing shorts. ''That's our Candlestick
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Bales and Amanda Tucker, who got opening-day tickets as
a high school graduation present from their parents, wore
sleeveless shirts and worked on their tans while reminiscing about
how cold they used to be at Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   Several stadium quirks have the potential to become Pac Bell
trademarks, just as Boston's Fenway Park has the Green Monster and
Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix has a swimming pool beyond the
right-center wall.
</P>
<P>
   Balls hit over the right-field wall, just 309 feet from home
plate along the foul line, will splash into a channel named McCovey
Cove in honor of the Giants' Hall of Famer. Several balls landed
there during batting practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though six homers were hit in Tuesday's game, including three by
the Dodgers' Kevin Elster, none landed in the water. The closest
was a ninth-inning solo homer by San Francisco's J.T. Snow that
landed in the seats atop the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The wall itself has already generated plenty of controversy.
There will be strange bounces off the 25-foot-high brick surface,
driving right fielders crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a beautiful park, but right field could become a circus
with all the bounces out there,'' Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green
said after a workout Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the giant mitt above the left-field bleachers, 518
feet from home plate -- reachable by sluggers such as Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell Park is the 10th stadium the Giants have called home,
ranging from the St. George Cricket Grounds in Staten Island, N.Y.,
(25 games in 1889) to Seals Stadium -- their home for two seasons
after moving west in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   With its hand-operated scoreboard in right-center, its small
foul territory and the brick wall in right, the Giants hope Pac
Bell captures the old-time feel of some of those previous homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of a traditionalist. The grass and the dirt and the
brick -- you get that here,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
''The best things about the new ballparks is they're bringing the
fans and their emotions more into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40,800-seat park, which took nearly 2{ years to build, is
the first privately financed major league stadium in 38 years.
Designed by the same architectural firm that did Camden Yards in
Baltimore, Jacobs Field in Cleveland and Coors Field in Denver, it
resembles all of those 1990s parks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 29,000 season tickets have been sold, compared to a
peak of 12,000 at Candlestick Park, and most games this season are
sellouts. When Peter Magowan bought the Giants in 1992, the team
was on the verge of moving to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that what this park will mean is the Giants are now
safe,'' Magowan said.

   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A former ''Star Search'' comedian accused
of several sexual assaults at college campuses throughout the
Midwest was found guilty Tuesday of the rape of a student here.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson Horace Champ, 38, of Los Angeles was found guilty of
raping a woman at Union College, a small Seventh-day Adventist
school in Lincoln, in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was scheduled for June 6. Champ faces up to 50 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Assistant Lancaster County Public Defender Shawn
Elliott, referred all questions to Lancaster County Attorney Gary
Lacy, who was not in his office Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Champ also has been charged or is a suspect in a series of
attacks at several other colleges.
</P>
<P>
   A booking agency in Chicago, Ario Professional Artists, booked
Champ on the college circuit. Champ, who once appeared on the
syndicated talent show, ''Star Search,'' also performed on cruise
lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the rapes, the attacker liked to spit on his victims, quizzed
them about their sex lives and asked them to pray for him.
</P>
<P>
   Champ already has pleaded no contest to raping a faculty member
at the University of Nebraska at Omaha about a month after the
Lincoln attack. Prosecutors in that case agreed to delay Champ's
sentencing until his case is resolved in Lincoln.

<HEADLINE> Chmura Posts Bail After Arrest  </HEADLINE>
By TODD RICHMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Green Bay Packers tight end Mark Chmura's
arrest on allegations of sexual assault has blemished his
reputation, his attorney said Tuesday, even though charges may be
weeks away, if they come at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chmura's name was at the center of radio talk shows
and water-cooler conversations. Images of Chmura, a fan favorite
since he joined Green Bay in 1992, in a jail jumpsuit and chains
flashed on television newscasts around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's self-evident he's hurting,'' attorney Gerald Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The publicity is overwhelming,'' said Boyle, who also handled
serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's defense. ''Human nature is such that
when something is said that is negative about a person, many people
believe it. Mark recognizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartland police were still looking into allegations that Chmura,
a married father of two, sexually assaulted his 17-year-old baby
sitter at a high school party at his neighbor Robert Gessert's
house early Sunday. The party was held after Waukesha Catholic
Memorial High School's prom.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert Rosch said Tuesday police were nearly finished
interviewing the 20 or so people at the party and were trying to
piece together a timeline of that night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're actively going after the kids that were involved,''
Rosch said. ''We've talked to the majority of them. We need to find
out what they saw, who was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into whether parents supplied
alcohol for the bash. Police have sent samples of Chmura's hair and
blood to the state crime lab for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Van Deun, president of Catholic Memorial, a school of
1,010 students, stressed the party was not sanctioned by the
school. He said he would wait until the police probe was finished
before launching his own investigation. Under school codes,
drinking can mean suspension from extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, 31, and Gessert, 42, arrived at the party about 3:30
a.m., according to court records. The 17-year-old Pewaukee girl
told police she was drunk when Chmura led her into a bathroom and
had sex with her on the floor. She and Chmura said nothing to each
other during the alleged assault, she told police.
</P>
<P>
   The girl said she had known Chmura for two years from
baby-sitting his two sons, according to a search warrant. Boyle
acknowledged Chmura was at the party, but declined to say if he had
been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year-old Muskego woman said Gessert fondled her in a hot
tub at the party.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chmura and Gessert were arrested early Monday at their
homes, which are about a half-mile apart in the upscale Bristlecone
Pines subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Both posted $5,000 bail and were released Monday afternoon.
Police recommended charges of third-degree sexual assault, defined
as having sex with someone without consent, against both men.
Packers general manager Ron Wolf declined comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura and Gessert have not been formally charged. District
Attorney Paul Bucher said he expects to make a decision on whether
to pursue charges by May 15, when Chmura and Gessert are due back
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in a holding pattern, just like everybody else,'' Boyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what the cops do that counts. We have to wait for the
evidence. I'm confident the DA will run a fair investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said he thinks people can recover from damaged
reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are fair-minded,'' he said. ''We're a very forgiving
society.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Refute Fortier Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Michael Fortier's 12-year prison term for not
alerting authorities about the Oklahoma City bombing is appropriate
considering the explosion's devastation, prosecutors said Tuesday
in asking that his sentence be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
attorneys dispute Fortier's argument that his sentence was too long
and that he shouldn't be held responsible for the April 19, 1995,
bombing that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   They also dispute that U.S. District Judge Thomas VanBebber of
Oklahoma, who imposed the sentence, was biased and vindictive
against Fortier.
</P>
<P>
   Fortier pleaded guilty to charges he knew in advance about the
bombing plot but didn't warn anyone. He also admitted he helped
Timothy McVeigh move and sell stolen weapons and that he had lied
to FBI agents after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh, a friend of Fortier's, was convicted on federal murder
charges and sentenced to death. Terry Nichols was sentenced to life
in prison without parole after being convicted of conspiracy and
involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   VanBebber sentenced Fortier to 12 years in prison and fined him
$200,000 in May 1998. Fortier appealed the sentence and the appeals
court in Denver sent the case back to Van Bebber, saying he
mistakenly used guidelines for first-degree murder rather than
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   VanBebber imposed the same prison sentence but reduced the fine
to $75,000. He said a 12-year sentence was warranted ''based on a
combination of factors that the court considered individually and
in combination with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortier appealed the new sentence.

<HEADLINE> Iran Detains Suspected Oil Smugglers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran is detaining 10 tankers suspected of
carrying smuggled Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. sanctions, Iran's
official news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Patrol boats seized the tankers on Monday and Tuesday, the
agency quoted Isa Golverdi, a naval zone commander in the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's new moves against smugglers are believed to be an effort
by Tehran to demonstrate closer cooperation with the United States,
the main enforcer of the sanctions against Iraq. U.S. officials had
accused Iran of allowing Iraq to elude sanctions by using its
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   Golverdi, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency, said the
tankers, now anchored on an Iranian island, were carrying 45,000
tons of oil from Iraq. Documents of more than 100 crew members of
different nationalities were also being held, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iranian boats patrolling the area will not permit the use of
Iranian territorial water for the smuggling of oil,'' he said,
without providing any other details.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Iranian authorities said a Panamanian-flagged tanker
allegedly smuggling Iraqi oil was detained. Last week, Iran
detained a Honduran-registered tanker, accusing it of carrying
smuggled Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has not responded to the Iranian reports and there was no
immediate word from Baghdad on the latest seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is allowed to sell oil only under U.N. controls, with the
proceeds used to fund humanitarian programs and pay Gulf War
reparations. The sanctions barring other oil sales cannot be lifted
until the U.N. Security Council certifies that Iraq is free of
weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. commander of the multinational force
patrolling the Gulf said Iraq was smuggling record amounts of oil
by paying off Iran and using its coastal waters to avoid detection
by the patrol force.
</P>
<P>
   Iran-U.S. relations have been thawing since the 1997 election of
the reformist President Mohammad Khatami. Last month, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright made the most significant U.S. gesture to
Iran in more than 20 years by announcing the lifting of some
sanctions and saying the United States wanted to start a new
relationship with Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Gore Visits School, Tough Issue  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- In the middle of a school day full of
smiles and upbeat talk, Al Gore walked into a controversy over
state-mandated testing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of time for chatting at lunch with his Avondale
Elementary schoolmate-for-a-day, 9-year-old Beca Rawlins. They
talked about pets, jokes and food, she said, and she promised ''to
tell my mom to vote for him because he's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal Mary Ann Burns also praised the vice president's
visit, but she and at least one parent had strong words on the
testing issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where controversy over mandatory proficiency tests is
growing, the Democratic presidential candidate said he supported
such tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to measure the performance of the students because
communities are going to have an easier time putting the heat on
the politicians, the school boards, the taxpayers and everybody
else in order to improve the schools if there is a fair and
accurate way to get a measurement of how the schools are doing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a softer note, he said that children who don't do well on the
tests should be given extra help rather than be automatically held
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to make sure there's a balanced attitude toward
tests, that you have a good test that's appropriate for the kids
and isn't destructive but is constructive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Burns had nothing good to say about the state's
fourth-grade guarantee, which beginning next year will hold
students back a grade if they don't pass a reading test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe a legislator should say a child should fail
the fourth grade,'' she said. ''I believe a teacher and parent and
principal should get together and decide whether a child should
pass on to the fifth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Morales, whose son Jason took the fourth-grade test last
month, told Gore that her son was upset, couldn't sleep and was
worried all the time about the test.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids really work hard, and this is one thing more to hold kids
back in their grade,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 2 percent of Avondale Elementary fourth-graders have
passed all five proficiency tests, compared with about 13 percent
citywide and 32 percent statewide. But the school is striving to
improve with the help of smaller class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent almost seven hours at the 109-year-old red brick
school, helping first-graders write a letter to ''Mother Earth''
pledging to pick up trash, drawing a collage of the Earth with a
fourth-grade art class and visiting with janitors in a basement
boiler room. He has pledged to spend a day at a school every week
or two during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used Tuesday's visit to release an ''education bluebook''
summarizing his proposals that include universal preschool for
4-year-olds, smaller class sizes, testing new teachers, and making
sure new and current teachers are qualified to teach their
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched the value of early-education programs during a
meeting with parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that dollar for dollar that's the single most valuable
investment our country can make,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore returned to Washington for a $1-million dinner of
sea bass and chocolated-dipped pears. At the Mayflower Hotel, he
privately led a discussion with four dozen gay and lesbian
activists who gave the Democratic National Committee $20,000
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Campaign director Elizabeth Birch called it an
opportunity to ''vet issues, get underneath -- with the press not
there -- air grievances ... and discuss how do we get him elected.''
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks open to reporters, Gore joked about being
endorsed by the assembly. ''It was politically incorrect for you to
say your preference was Al Gore, but it's OK to say you were
oriented towards me,'' Gore said. ''It works for me.''

<HEADLINE> Plane Crashes Into Home, Pilot Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) -- A small plane nose-dived into a house
Tuesday, killing one person and scattering dozens of small children
playing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was believed to be the only victim in the fiery
accident, but a search of the gutted house was continuing, said
Fire Chief Steve Magliocco.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was flying low, clipped a wire and nose-dived into the
house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said no one on the ground was hurt and the home was
unoccupied at the time. The plane plunged to the ground and ignited
the house as dozens of children enjoying their spring break were
playing in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Four children were swimming in a plastic pool when the plane
crashed across the street, sending debris flying toward them. The
plane's tire landed a few feet from them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was going to get my cousin,'' said 6-year-old
Britnee Sunday, who was in the pool with her 4-year-old cousin,
Joey Grohman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just heard this kaboom,'' said 6-year-old Nicole Fowler,
who was playing with them. ''I was so scared I ran to my house.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Break Up Fake Memorabilia Ring  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An investigation into fake sports and celebrity
memorabilia has resulted in charges against 20 people and the
seizure of thousands of baseballs, photos, T-shirts and other items
with forged autographs in five states, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Operation Bullpen investigation targeted a network of
forgers and distributors, as well as others who provided fake
authentication documents intended to persuade buyers the items were
legitimate, said Phillip Halpern, an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The forgery ring was based in Southern California but
authorities believe the merchandise was distributed nationwide and
beyond. Federal agents seized items, including 10,000 signed
baseballs, in California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would imagine stuff from this ring is in every single state
in the country,'' Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities planned to detail the investigation at a
news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise included items with fake autographs from Albert
Einstein, Abraham Lincoln, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jordan, Martin
Luther King Jr., Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mark McGwire and Tony
Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items, Halpern said, were almost comically fake,
including a baseball supposedly autographed by Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Sold on the open market as legitimate, the collectibles would be
worth about $10 million, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both McGwire and Gwynn helped investigators identify fake
autographs, Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation suggests the celebrity memorabilia industry is
rife with fraud, including merchandise sold at stores that appear
to be legitimate, said Halpern, who estimates that half or more of
the autographed items sold to the public are counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We seized what I firmly believe is just a fraction of what's
out there on the market,'' said Daniel Dzwilewski, assistant
special agent in charge of the FBI's San Diego division.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities began investigating the industry after receiving a
tip from Upper Deck Co. of Carlsbad, a trading card and memorabilia
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI set up an office in Oceanside with an agent who posed as
a businessman who exported celebrity memorabilia to Pacific Rim
countries, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Those charged in the scheme include six members of a family in
Escondido. Angelo Marino, 67, and his son, Greg Marino, 38, forged
items while the others distributed and sold it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects face a variety of charges including forgery, mail
and wire fraud, racketeering, counterfeiting, and tax offenses, FBI
spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said. All 20 defendants are aware of the
charges and are expected to surrender to authorities, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those charged live in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange
counties, but arrests in other states are expected, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 more people in several states will be charged in the
case within two months, Dzwilewski said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have dismantled a prolific group of forgers,'' Caldwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Internal Revenue Service executed more than 50
search warrants in the case and is storing thousands of items in a
10,000-square-foot warehouse in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Also seized as part of the investigation were a Ferrari and two
homes in San Diego County, Caldwell said.

<HEADLINE> Coldwell Banker Gets Games Rentals  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Renting out an ordinary four-bedroom house
in the Salt Lake valley to Olympic visitors could bring homeowners
$800 a night during the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   But the official Olympic broker will charge a commission that
could be as high as 40 percent on home rentals.
</P>
<P>
   Coldwell Banker Premier Realty of Salt Lake City was chosen
Tuesday by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee as an official
manager for residential accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The broker will help people who in August can start buying
tickets to the 2002 Games also arrange for accommodations in
private homes. SLOC will list Coldwell Banker on its Web site and
refer visitors to the broker.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Webber, president of Coldwell Banker Premier Realty, said
he will charge a ''small'' listing fee when he starts accepting
rental applications from private homeowners in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Webber said he hasn't set a commission on private rentals. But
SLOC president Mitt Romney said private management firms typically
charge a 40 percent commission on rentals in Park City, which has
an abundance of condominiums and second homes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement with Coldwell Banker, Webber said
homeowners will get to keep more than 50 percent. He would not
offer a more specific figure and said it will depend on the level
of service Coldwell Banker provides, such as maid service, for
private homes being rented out.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC, in turn, will take on licensing royalty on Coldwell
Banker's commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but SLOC collects a 15
percent royalty from licensed merchandise vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers already have booked 20,000 hotel rooms for
the world's media, Olympic and sports officials and for sponsors
and SLOC contractors, said John Sindelar, director of
accommodations for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar said another 12,000 hotel rooms are still available for
the games within a 2-hour drive of Salt Lake City. Some of those
hotels, however, are not booking rooms yet for the games.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many condominium owners in Park City are holding out,
refusing so far to sign up with SLOC or property managers and
seeking deals on their own.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC has an agreement to market 85 percent of Park City's hotel
space, guaranteeing occupancy for the full 17 days of the winter
games. Those rooms have mostly been taken, but Park City has
two-thirds of its available rooms in condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Condo owners may be put off by SLOC's 15 percent booking fee and
red tape. Any owner who teams up with SLOC must register the
agreement to the deed with the county recorder so visitors are
guaranteed their reservations even if the property changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar said the going rate at private residences for the
Olympics is likely to average $200 a night per room.
</P>
<P>
   Coldwell Banker will market single rooms or entire houses for
rent. It will not guarantee homeowners who sign up with the broker
that they will actually find a paying tenant.

<HEADLINE> France Seeks To Promote New Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Tuesday said the
creation of new companies must become less complicated, less
expensive and less insecure in France, a country where red tape and
hefty taxes have previously hobbled prospective entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a conference on business creation, Jospin said his
Socialist-led government would simplify procedures for founding new
companies and set aside more money to help people with new business
ideas. He said an Internet portal would be created to help those
who want to set up new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The French were beginning ''to rediscover little by little their
taste for risk,'' the prime minister said, adding that the state
must do more to lower registration fees for new firms.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders have criticized the government for standing in
the way of entrepreneurs by burdening them with unnecessary
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin said the French government, state bank Caisse des Depots
et Consignations and the European Investment Bank will set up a new
$144 million investment fund to back up small, newly-created,
tech-heavy start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, newly appointed Finance Minister Laurent Fabius
acknowledged that an excessive number of laws and regulations makes
it difficult and costly for young entrepreneurs to set up their own
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to remove some of the brakes that too often prevent
those intending to start up new companies from actually doing so,''
Fabius told the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, some 268,920 new companies were set up in France, up
0.9 percent from the previous year -- a modest improvement
considering the sharp jump in French economic growth rates. But,
with the exception of 1994, the number of companies being created
in France has been going down since the start of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius said French society should ''better value''
entrepreneurs. ''We must improve the image of the entrepreneur,''
he said, ''Failure is not a fault. After failure can come a
rebound, and a rebound with the benefit of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabius said his own Finance Ministry will be the first to
contribute to a simplification of company start-up rules.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Jospin will have to revitalize a first wave of reform,
initiated with his nomination as Prime Minister in 1997, but remain
discreet on subjects that strongly divide his left-wing majority,
such as stock-options, extension of shares for new company
creators.

George Thiemeyer Hemmeter:
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Prolific inventor George Thiemeyer Hemmeter died
Saturday. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmeter was credited with coming up with the idea for the
newspaper vending machine in 1947. He also invented a food
dehydrator during World War II and a self-balancing washing machine
in 1950, among many other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmeter was the father of prominent Hawaii developer Chris
Hemmeter.
William A. Leonard:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- William A. Leonard, who helped bring 1960s
displays of artists Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper
Johns to the Contemporary Art Center as its director, died Saturday
of heart failure. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   He was the museum's director from 1964 to 1971 and produced 60
exhibitions at the center and at other museums and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   After his tenure, the Contemporary Arts Center was acquitted of
misdemeanor obscenity charges in 1990 for exhibiting a display of
Robert Mapplethorpe photographs that included homoerotic pictures.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the Cincinnati Art Museum for its 1985 display of
Mark di Suvero's sculpture ''Atman'' composed of steel beams and a
swing hanging at its center, when others derided it as looking like
an A-frame for a teepee.
John Luter:
</P>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- John Luter, former chairman of the University of
Hawaii journalism department, died Saturday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Luter joined the university in 1974 and helped create the
journalism department, which had operated as a program in the
English Department. He was chairman of the department until he
retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The program had 74 majors when he arrived, and 200 when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Luter began his journalism career at the San Antonio Light. He
was a reporter for the Washington Star, Time magazine and CBS News,
and was an associate editor at Newsweek. He also taught at the
Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most important accomplishments at the University of
Hawaii was his creation in 1981 of the Parvin Fellowships, which
annually brings groups of young journalists from the People's
Republic of China to study in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Luter also established the Carol Burnett Fund for Responsible
Journalism at the university. After Burnett won an initial $1.6
million lawsuit against the National Enquirer, Luter made the pitch
for the fund, which fosters the study, teaching and research of
professionalism and ethics in journalism.

<HEADLINE> Replacement for Art Bell Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Popular overnight radio host Art Bell will be
replaced by Mike Siegel, a veteran talk radio broadcaster based in
Seattle, Premiere Radio Networks said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, whose ''Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell'' attracts legions
of listeners with discussions of arcane mysteries and conspiracy
theories, said on March 31 that he was retiring from radio.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 54, said he was leaving because of ongoing torment his
family has suffered since his son was kidnapped and raped in 1997
by a substitute teacher. He also said he was leaving because of
being falsely accused of being a child molester.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bell is looking forward to living an anonymous lifestyle as he
retires not only from radio broadcasting, but also all other forums
of media including book publishing, television, etc.,'' said a
statement from Premiere Radio Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, 55, will replace Bell on April 27. Siegel has been a
regular fill-in for radio hosts around the country. He is known as
an activist who advocated a consumer boycott of Exxon after the
1989 Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Court Fines Newspaper  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Yugoslav court slapped a leading
Belgrade weekly with a $30,000 fine Tuesday, as friends and family
marked one year since the unsolved assassination of a prominent
Serb publisher and government critic.
</P>
<P>
   Vreme and its chief editors were forced to pay $30,000 to the
state after Serbia's information minister, Zeljko Simic, took the
weekly to court claiming it falsely reported he had dismissed a
Belgrade theater director. Simic said the government, not he, had
sacked the director.
</P>
<P>
   Vreme is the latest in a line of about 60 independent media
outlets to be fined in the past several months under a media
crackdown launched by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
regime.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came on the first anniversary of the unexplained
killing of Slavko Curuvija, editor in chief of the independent
Dnevni Telegraf daily. Police have not named suspects or published
details of the investigation into the killing that Curuvija's
friends and family, as well as the opposition, blame on the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clearly a politically motivated killing intended to
intimidate all those critical of the regime,'' said Aleksandar
Tijanic, a prominent newspaper columnist and friend of Curuvija.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's ultranationalist Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj,
rejected accusations of state involvement Tuesday during a Serbian
parliament session, saying Curuvija was ''a criminal'' who
published ''trash.''
</P>
<P>
   When an opposition leader, Dragan Veselinov, responded to
Seselj's accusations against Curuvija, his speech was voiced over
during a live state TV broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   A political ally of Milosevic, Seselj recently warned
independent journalists that they would be ''liquidated'' because
of their alleged pro-Western views.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, several hundred people succeeded in chasing
internal revenue inspectors from the local independent Narodne
Novine daily in Nis. The inspectors were trying to confiscate
equipment after the paper refused Monday to pay a $35,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also deducted $7,000 from the paper's bank account,
Nis media reported. As night fell the paper's employees, boosted by
the crowd of about 1,000 outside, began taking away some of the
lighter equipment ahead of a possible return of the inspectors --
this time with police.

<HEADLINE> Jets-Bucs Johnson Trade on Hold  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A trade sending Keyshawn Johnson from the New
York Jets to Tampa Bay was worked out Tuesday, but remained on hold
when the wide receiver and the Buccaneers couldn't agree on a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Stanley, the agent for the two-time Pro Bowl receiver,
and Bucs general manager Rich McKay broke off talks about 9:30 p.m.
EDT and will begin meeting again Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has been finalized, but they are still talking,'' Bucs
spokesman Reggie Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The holdup apparently was over the amount of a signing bonus,
with a range of between $9 million and $13 million being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay offered Johnson a deal that would average just over
$6.5 million a year for either four or five years. He would have
made $2.4 million under the contract he signed when the Jets made
him the No. 1 overall selection in the 1996 draft. With the Bucs,
he'd be among the highest-paid receivers in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets would get two first-round draft choices, Nos. 13 and
27. It would give them four selections in the opening round, the
most ever for one team. Previously, they got the 16th choice from
New England for allowing Bill Belichick to become Patriots coach,
and owned the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson threatened to hold out if the Jets didn't renegotiate
his contract, which had two years remaining at an average of about
$2 million. That was well below the going rate for a receiver with
his credentials, but the team historically does not redo contracts
with more than a year remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In his four seasons since being the top overall choice in 1996,
Johnson has caught 305 passes for 4,108 yards and 31 touchdowns. He
has become one of the league's most versatile and dependable
receivers, even though only in 1998 with Vinny Testaverde did he
have a high-quality quarterback throwing to him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would become the best receiver the Bucs ever have had.
But he would go from a well-balanced, imaginative attack to one of
the most staid offenses in football. He wouldn't have a veteran at
quarterback, either, with second-year pro Shaun King behind center.
</P>
<P>
   But he would have plenty of bucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who claim they are strapped by the salary cap and
couldn't afford to renegotiate with Johnson, would have plenty of
draft leverage. They could use a combination -- or all -- of the four
picks to move way up. Or they could select four youngsters who
could fill their holes on the defensive line, at tight end, in the
secondary and, with Johnson gone, at wideout.
</P>
<P>
   When Jets chief of football operations Bill Parcells began
shopping Johnson last month, he focused on Baltimore, which owns
the fifth overall pick. When that fell through, Parcells and new
coach Al Groh said Johnson wasn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But when they found out he wouldn't be going to the offseason
workout program and almost certainly would not be at minicamp or
the start of training camp, the Jets went shopping again.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, they found a willing partner with the right collateral
-- if Johnson agrees to a new contract.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Vote Fairness in Doubt  </HEADLINE>
By JORGE RUEDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Catholic Church leaders on Tuesday
expressed doubt about whether May's presidential elections in
Venezuela can be fair since President Hugo Chavez's political
movement hand-picked electoral authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that election officials ''only represent one of the
candidates doesn't produce a sense of serenity, nor does it
guarantee the most basic impartiality needed in any popular
election,'' said Monsignor Baltazar Porras, the country's top
Catholic Church leader.
</P>
<P>
   Porras urged the country's National Election Council to make the
May 28 elections more transparent by including international
observers and allowing opposition members on the council.
</P>
<P>
   Etanislao Gonzalez, the electoral council's head, said Tuesday
that international observers, including representatives of the
World Bank, the United Nations and the Carter Center in Atlanta,
have been invited to oversee the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Porras's comments came amid growing concern in Venezuela over
the fairness of the upcoming elections, which are required by a new
constitution pushed through by Chavez last year calling for most
public offices, including the presidency, to be ''re-legitimized''
through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez faces his most serious challenge from Fransisco Arias
Cardenas, a former army officer who helped Chavez stage a failed
1992 coup attempt, but who now accuses the president of abandoning
the original goals of their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office over a year ago, Chavez has transformed
Venezuelan politics, virtually erasing the traditional political
parties that ruled the South American nation during 40 years of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly to avoid a power vacuum in a transition period before
May's elections, Chavez's leftist coalition hand-picked members of
an interim legislature, the Supreme Tribunal and the National
Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize there are imperfections in the transition of
power, but you must have faith in the honor of the council's
members,'' said Luis Miquilena, the pro-Chavez head of the interim
legislature.

anti-government protests continued in some regions Tuesday, but a
protest leader called for a stop to weeklong violent protests after
an agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at rock-throwing
students in clashes that lasted for several hours in the center of
in La Paz, the country's seat of government.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting running skirmishes with police, the students
retreated to their campuses. A university professor, Jaime Vilela,
said 15 students were injured and around 50 detained.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a strike shut down Potosi, a mining city of 160,000
located high in the Andes, where local leaders said the government
is indifferent to their economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the clashes in La Paz, the leader of protests in
Cochabamba called for residents of that city, Bolivia's third
largest, to cease all demonstrations. The city returned to normal
as thousands of demonstrators began returning home after the
agreement reached Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Cochabamba, 350 miles east of La Paz, that
demonstrations broke out April 3 to protest a planned water hike.
The protests spread throughout the country, leaving six dead and
prompting a ''state of siege'' decree giving police and the
military a freer rein to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leader Oscar Olivera called for a stop to protests hours
after Congress passed legislation Tuesday revising the water law as
required under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress removed a clause that would have pegged water rates to
the U.S. dollar, and another that would have forced peasants to pay
for using water from wells.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the government canceled the contract
granted to Aguas del Tunari, an international water company pushing
for the water price hike.
</P>
<P>
   Peasant leaders and government officials also opened
negotiations aimed at lifting roadblocks and ending demonstrations
at Aymara Indian communities, where soldiers and local residents
fought over the weekend, leaving six dead and more than 50 injured.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are mediated by representatives of the Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   While the water conflict sparked the protests, the government
admitted difficult economic conditions played a major role.
Information Minister Ronald MacLean attributed the crisis at least
in part to the raise of international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, MacLean said drug traffickers were backing the
demonstrations in an attempt to stop a government program to
eradicate production of coca leaf, used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of coca leaf plantations has deprived thousands
of peasants of their sole means of income, especially in the area
around Cochabamba.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivian Workers Confederation -- the leading workers' union
grouping farmers, teachers, factory workers and miners -- called for
a general strike Wednesday against the ''state of siege'' decree
passed Saturday. That decree suspended many constitutional
guarantees, allowing police to detain protest leaders without a
warrant, restrict travel and political activity and establish a
curfew.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tourist Disappears From Cruise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAPEETE, Tahiti (AP) -- An American tourist has disappeared from
the cruise liner he was traveling on in French Polynesia.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the man Tuesday as Cris Allen Swartzbaugh. One
of his brothers, Scott Swartzbaugh, said Cris, 39, was an Iowa
native but currently lives in Tea, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   They said he was seen boarding the ''Paul Gauguin'' liner on
April 8. His disappearance was noted the following day when the
liner arrived in Raiatea, an island 125 miles northwest of Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   The liner takes tourists on a six-day trip from Papeete to the
Sous-le-Vent archipelago every week. Investigators believe
Swartzbaugh disappeared somewhere between Tahiti and Raiatea.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the liner had been thoroughly searched. A plane and
Puma helicopter from the naval aviation forces flew over the route
taken by the ''Paul Gauguin'' but the search was called off on
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Police were still investigating the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that a fisherman might have found him, taking him
up on an island. There are miracles that happen,'' said Scott
Swartzbaugh, who lives next door to his brother. ''It's been a long
time for someone to be in the water. But if anyone can do it Cris
can.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox 13, Devil Rays 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox hit four home
runs, including consecutive shots by Chris Singleton and Carlos Lee
in the fifth inning, to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 13-6 on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton hit a two-run homer that put Chicago up 6-5, and Lee
followed with a solo shot that extended his hitting streak to eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham hit a leadoff homer and Paul Konerko, who went
4-for-5 with four RBIs, had a two-run inside-the-park homer in the
first inning for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko also had a two-run double during a four-run
eighth-inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Frank Thomas, who had a cortisone shot Monday for
tendinitis in the inner heel of his right foot, left after five
innings with a sore right foot. He went 1-for-3 as the designated
hitter and has a hit in all eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco and Greg Vaughn homered for the Devil Rays, who
have dropped six of their past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox starter Jim Parque (1-1) gave up five runs -- three
earned -- and six hits in five innings. The left-hander has allowed
11 runs over nine innings in two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, at 5-3, is above the .500 mark after eight games for
the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took a 4-3 lead after a 32-minute first inning that
saw the teams hit two home runs apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Durham hit his 11th career lead off homer -- second this season --
and Konerko had a two-run inside-the-park homer as Chicago went up
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Karkovice had the last White Sox inside-the-park homer on
August 30, 1990 at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays responded in the bottom of the first as Canseco
hit a two-run homer, Vaughn had solo shot and John Flaherty added
an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco's first homer of the season was a 425-foot shot to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays starter Esteban Yan (0-1) allowed seven runs, four
homers and 10 hits in five innings. He struck out a career-high
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay third baseman Vinny Castilla (strained left rib cage
muscle) was activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game
and went 0-for-4. It was the first time this season Tampa Bay had
all four of its sluggers -- Castilla, Canseco, Vaughn and Fred
McGriff -- in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup only remained intact until the seventh inning when
Vaughn was thrown out of the game for arguing a third strike call
with home plate umpire Bill Miller.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The contest drew just 13,639. ... U.S. Coast Guard Captain
Earl Fox, who at 80 is currently the oldest World War II veteran on
active duty, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... Durham has
homered in four of his past five games. ... The White Sox have 10
or more hits in six of their eight games. ... Tampa Bay LHP Wilson
Alvarez (left shoulder tendinitis) will throw two innings Wednesday
in an extended spring training game. ... Tampa Bay has been
outscored 50-19 in its last four games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom and the
Italian energy company ENI on Tuesday signed a credit agreement
with Western banks for $1.1 billion to help finance the Blue Stream
gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The banks include Banca Commerciale Italiana, Mediocredito
Centrale and West Deutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.
</P>
<P>
   ENI's and Gazprom's joint venture Blue Stream Pipeline Company
will use the money to build the offshore section of the pipeline
crossing the Black Sea, and to procure Italian pipes and equipment
to build the overland section of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom said the long-term credit will be guaranteed by Italy's
export credit agency SACE, but didn't disclose the terms of the
loan. The cost of the entire project is estimated at $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom is due to start gas exports through the pipeline in
mid-2001, with the planned annual capacity set at 565 billion cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Russia expects to earn billions of dollars from gas exports
through the 750-mile pipeline, 250 miles of which will be built on
the bed of the Black Sea.

<HEADLINE> Fake Memorabilia Ring Busted  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An investigation into fake sports and celebrity
memorabilia has resulted in charges against 20 people and the
seizure of thousands of items with forged autographs -- including a
baseball supposedly signed by Mother Teresa, authorities said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise included items with fake autographs from Albert
Einstein, Abraham Lincoln, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jordan, Martin
Luther King Jr., Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mark McGwire, and Tony
Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items, Halpern said, were comically fake, including
a baseball supposedly autographed by Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   The Operation Bullpen investigation targeted a network of
forgers and distributors, as well as others who provided fake
authentication documents intended to persuade buyers the items were
legitimate, said Phillip Halpern, an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The forgery ring was based in Southern California but
authorities believe the merchandise was distributed nationwide and
beyond. Federal agents seized items, including 10,000 signed
baseballs, in California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would imagine stuff from this ring is in every single state
in the country,'' Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   Both McGwire and Gwynn helped investigators identify fake
autographs, Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects face a variety of charges including forgery, mail
and wire fraud, racketeering, counterfeiting, and tax offenses, FBI
spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said. All 20 defendants are expected to
surrender, she added.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Journalists Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- A Luanda court Tuesday convicted two
journalists of defaming a senior government official and gave them
suspended sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was the latest confrontation between independent
journalists and officials who have started legal proceedings after
the publication of critical articles.
</P>
<P>
   Graca Campos, news editor at the Luanda-based weekly Angolense,
was sentenced to four months in jail, while Americo Goncalves, the
weekly paper's editor, was given three months for a series of
articles published in 1998 and 1999. The sentences were suspended
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   They also were ordered to pay together $40,000 in compensation
to Manuel Pedro Pakavira, the governor of Kwanza-Norte province.
</P>
<P>
   The articles alleged Pakavira was incompetent and speculated he
would be fired by the central government, which appoints governors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trial opened Tuesday in Luanda of two journalists
from the weekly Actual on charges they defamed Transport Minister
Luis Brandao.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from an article written in 1998 by Machado
Brandao, a reporter, quoting local people in Gabela, 180 miles
southeast of Luanda, who criticized the minister because there was
no public transport.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly's editor, Leopoldo Baio, was also charged for
defamation in connection with the article which was headlined,
''The Minister of Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Several countries and human rights groups have condemned the
Angolan government for harassing, questioning and jailing dozens of
independent journalists since the country's two-decade civil war
resumed in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The government has used the State Security Law to limit news
reporting of the war, alleging that critical reports destabilize
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, began fighting after
the Southwest African country gained independence from Portugal in
1975.

<HEADLINE> Elian Saga Finale Taking Shape  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Pushing for a swift end to the Elian Gonzalez saga,
Attorney General Janet Reno indicated Tuesday she is willing to get
involved personally by meeting in Miami with the boy's relatives
and Cuban community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the custody transfer also hit a snag, as the government put
off sending the relatives a letter outlining how and when the
relatives are to hand the 6-year-old Cuban boy over to his father,
who wants to take him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said late Tuesday that any meeting in Miami between Reno
and Elian's relatives was unlikely to occur Wednesday. Earlier, the
official said Reno probably would go to Miami on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the Cuban American National
Foundation said Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would meet
with the Miami relatives around noon Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Ninoska Perez, said the meeting had been
brokered by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. A news conference about
the meeting was planned for late Tuesday, and the meeting could not
be immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Miami relatives asked to talk to the
father, but said they would only do so in Florida and added that
they would not relinquish the boy at such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's possible return to her hometown -- where Cuban protesters
have displayed signs depicting her with horns and blaming her for
the Waco confrontation -- would come at a crucial time in the Elian
case.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have resisted her goal of reuniting the
6-year-old boy with his father this week, balking at handover plans
and continuing to press their court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were for the custody transfer were still being
worked out, said the official, who added that any meetings
involving Reno wouldn't alter the timetable being worked out for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who discussed the situation with the
attorney general in Washington on Tuesday, said Reno was ''very
willing to meet Lazaro and any member of the Gonzalez family and
wants to meet with community leaders in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had said they would send the Miami relatives a
letter Tuesday with instructions for the custody transfer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the great-uncle would follow the
instructions, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez responded, ''All I
can tell you is that Lazaro will not break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Little Havana, where Elian has
been staying since he was rescued at sea while clinging to an inner
tube on Thanksgiving, five of his Miami schoolmates and his
principal stopped by to bring him a big card that read, ''Elian we
miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been kept out of school recently because relatives
said they feared he would be taken away. The boy smiled and waved
goodbye to his classmates, then did a pull-up on the fence in front
the house and monkeyed around for TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami relatives offered to meet with Elian's father,
they said they would bring the boy along if they were assured Elian
would not be taken during the reunion. The father is staying with a
Cuban diplomat in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such meetings are essential and long overdue,'' Lazaro wrote
in a letter to a government-appointed psychiatrist. ''While we
cannot guarantee the ultimate outcome of discussions among the
family members, they might well help matters a great deal and could
not possibly make things any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a representative of the National
Council of Churches who met with the father Tuesday, said Juan
Miguel Gonzalez told her he would go to Florida if necessary to
reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll do whatever he has to do short of meeting with
relatives,'' she said. ''He does not wish to meet with the
relatives until he has Elian in his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The father's attorney, Gregory Craig, talked for nearly two
hours with Reno and other top officials and refused to comment
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Republican leadership and two
Cuban-American members of Miami's congressional delegation invited
Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son to a private meeting
Wednesday in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want you to have the freedom to express your true feelings
during your visit without coercion and without intimidation,'' the
six lawmakers wrote. ''We want to be sure that you are aware of all
the options available to you as you make your decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, pursuing another legal front, filed a brief
in Family Court on Tuesday, asking for a full hearing to bar
Elian's return to Cuba until his father's fitness is considered.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''has engaged in abusive
conduct'' -- allegations the attorneys said the federal courts never
considered. It also said Elian would be subject to ''imminent
indoctrination'' in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father's attorneys have characterized abuse allegations as
desperate tactics. The U.S. government asked the court to dismiss
the request, saying a state judge cannot overrule federal
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, an overflow crowd of about 2,000 gathered at The
Shrine of Our Lady of Charity on the edge of Biscayne Bay to sing
and pray for Elian's mother and the 10 other Cubans who died when
their boat sank in the Florida Straits. Each victim's name was
read.

Ugandan Police Seek Cult Leaders

   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Police on Tuesday put up rewards of about $1,300 for
information leading to the arrest of any of six cult leaders whose followers
were killed across southwest Uganda. Police have been searching for the leaders
since a fire in a cult chapel in the village of Kanungu on March 17 killed 530
people. Following the fire, authorities unearthed a series of mass graves in
nearby villages, turning up 394 more corpses. Many of those victims had been
strangled or stabbed. It remains unclear how many of the six are alive.
Unconfirmed reports say the group's two main leaders, Credonia Mwerinde and

Russia May Ratify Start II Treaty

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers agreed Tuesday to debate the long-delayed
START II arms treaty this week, following a ratification push from President
Vladimir Putin who is aiming for a landmark foreign policy move just weeks after
being elected. Lawmakers across the political spectrum predicted swift
ratification of the treaty that would halve the U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each. The debate is set for Friday. The treaty
was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, but was repeatedly blocked by
Communists and hard-liners who dominated the State Duma, parliament's lower
house. The Communists lost their dominance in last December's elections.

Docs Admit Falsifying Insurance Info

   CHICAGO (AP) -- More than a third of doctors surveyed nationwide admit
deceiving insurance companies to help patients get the care they need. Their
tactics include: exaggerating the severity of an illness to help patients avoid
being sent home early from the hospital; listing an inaccurate diagnosis on
bills; and reporting nonexistent symptoms to secure insurance coverage. In a
random mailed survey of 720 doctors nationwide in 1998, 39 percent said they had
used at least one of those tactics ''sometimes'' or more often within the
preceding year. The results were published in tomorrow's Journal of the American

Malisse to return long. ''He hung in there,'' Agassi said. ''My mindset was to
keep getting better and just hope to finish it off'' in the second set.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 10, Astros 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Thomas Howard had a go-ahead grand
slam in the seventh and Edgar Renteria added a three-run homer
later in the inning as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Houston
Astros 10-6 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis wasted a 3-0 lead and fell behind 6-3 before Howard
homered in the seventh off Chris Holt (0-2), who loaded the bases
with walks to Mark McGwire and Eric Davis around a single by Jim
Edmonds, who is 7-for-7 in his last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Holt then walked pinch-hitter Eli Marrero and Fernando Vina.
Doug Henry relieved and Renteria homered for the second straight
night, getting a career-high four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds also homered for the Cardinals, who hit into four double
plays but won their fourth straight and improved to 7-1. Edmonds
had three hits and is 7-for-7 in his last two games, raising his
average to .529 (13-for-25).
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou hit two-run homers for the Astros,
who dropped four games behind St. Louis in the NL Central. Houston
had gone ahead with a six-run third.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 19 homers in five games at Enron Field, which
opened last Friday, including nine by the Astros, just 1-4 at their
new ballpark. On Tuesday, the teams combined for eight homers, a
record for a major league game in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The game drew 37,463, the fourth straight time since the opener
that the Astros failed to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (2-0) allowed six runs and seven hits in six
innings, while Holt gave up nine runs, seven hits and five walks in
6 1-3 innings, his ERA rising to 8.74.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, who was 3-for-3, homered in the second, and the
Cardinals made it 3-0 in the third on Vina's RBI triple and
Renteria's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Houston came back in the bottom half on Roger Cedeno's two-run
triple, and the homers by Bagwell and Alou.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The grand slam was the first of Howard's career. ... The
Cardinals upped their major league-leading home run total to 23.
... St. Louis is 10-for-10 in stolen-base attempts. ... Richard
Hidalgo's steal in the third was the first allowed by the Cardinals
in six tries this season ... Bagwell's homer was his first in 60
at-bats since last Sept. 9 at St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 100, Nets 93  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- With the Chicago Bulls putting on an offensive
display the likes of which hasn't been seen at the United Center in
two years, the ailing New Jersey Nets didn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls made a season-high 11 3-pointers, and were a
season-best 69 percent (11-of-16) from long range in a 100-93
victory Tuesday. They also shot over 50 percent (36-of-67, 54
percent) at home for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Bull had a hand in the offense. Matt Maloney was
5-of-6 from 3-point range for a season-high 19 points. Elton Brand
led Chicago with 22 points and 15 rebounds, and also had a
career-high seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carr was 7-of-10 from the floor for 17 points, and Hersey
Hawkins added 10 with three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn led the Nets with 25 points. Kendall Gill had 19
points, and Elliott Perry added 17. Jamie Feick had 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn's layup with 6:25 left in the third cut Chicago's lead
to 64-56, but Maloney hit a 3-pointer and the Nets struggled to
stay within double digits the rest of the game. With about 3{
minutes left, the Chicago fans started chanting, ''Tacos, tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans get a free taco if the Bulls score 100 points in a home
victory.
</P>
<P>
   When Fred Hoiberg made two free throws with 31 seconds left to
give the Bulls 100 points, the fans cheered so loud the United
Center sounded like the good old days when Michael Jordan and
Friends were around.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Nets had four players in double figures and shot a
semi-respectable 43 percent (35-82) from the floor, they're just
too thin right now. Stephon Marbury (tendinitis), Kerry Kittles
(sore knee) and Evan Eschmeyer (sprained ankle) sat on the Nets'
bench in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Counting center Jayson Williams, who hasn't played this season,
New Jersey was missing about $200 million in talent. And if that
wasn't enough, center Jim McIlvaine dressed, but didn't play.
McIlvaine left Saturday night's game with a bulging disk in his
back.
</P>
<P>
   That the Nets, eliminated from playoff contention Friday, were
in for a long night was made perfectly clear in a five-second span
midway through the second quarter. They threw the ball away on a
wild Van Horn pass that almost went into the stands and then failed
to hustle back on defense, allowing Ron Artest to score on an
uncontested layup.
</P>
<P>
   Carr was all over the place in the first half, going 5-of-7 from
the floor. He scored on slams, long jumpers and rebound goals, and
fed Brand on a nice layup under the basket. He scored the Bulls'
last six points as Chicago took a 54-45 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kittles, who has been out since Friday with a sore right
knee, will be examined by New Jersey and New York Knicks' doctors
Wednesday. Kittles' offseason surgery was performed by the Knicks'
doctor. ... Marbury, who missed his fourth game with tendinitis,
also is scheduled to be re-examined this week. ... Hoiberg,
sidelined this season by a strained quadriceps, a sprained ankle
and a concussion, was sporting a bandage on his left thumb Tuesday.
... Northwestern coach Kevin O'Neill, Eschmeyer's old coach, was at
the game.

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Greg Vaughn was ejected
from Tuesday's night game against the Chicago White Sox for arguing
a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn argued the seventh-inning call by plate umpire Bill
Miller, then continued arguing after returning to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   After his ejection, he ran back onto the field and made slight
contact with Miller before being sent to the clubhouse by Tampa Bay
manager Larry Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did make contact with me ... it wasn't a lot,'' Miller
said. ''He just chested me. I'm going to write that when he came
out, he touched me. So we'll leave it at that. I'm sure they will
have a videotape of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn would not get into specifics of what was said between him
and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want respect, you give respect,'' Vaughn said. ''I'm a
grown man. You want respect, talk to me with respect. It's over
with. He thought they were good pitches, and I thought they were
bad pitches.''

<HEADLINE> Lie Detector Sought for Ramseys  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Boulder police and district attorney said
Tuesday they will take John and Patsy Ramsey up on their offer to
undergo a lie-detector test in the death of their daughter
JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said in a statement they agree to the Ramseys'
publicly announced conditions, including having an examiner
independent of the Boulder police, and have notified the Ramseys'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer L. Lin Wood asked Police Chief Mark Beckner in a
letter that was released to the media Tuesday night whether the
Ramseys ''will be officially and publicly cleared from the umbrella
of suspicion'' if they pass a polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
   Wood also questioned whether FBI agents would qualify as
independent examiners, as suggested by Beckner, if the FBI has been
involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys raised the issue of a polygraph test during
interviews with ABC and CNN in March about their recently published
book, ''The Death of Innocence.'' The two said Boulder police
didn't ask them to take a polygraph test about their daughter's
death but they were volunteering to take one to help prove their
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner had said he was interested in the offer, but District
Attorney Alex Hunter said last month that he would advise Beckner
not to accept because of problems with the test's reliability.
Medication or other conditions can taint the results, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Beckner said Tuesday that his office, prosecutors from
Hunter's office and the FBI met this week and agreed to accept the
Ramseys' offer.
</P>
<P>
   The results of polygraph tests are not allowed as evidence in
court but are used by police as an investigative tool. Legal
analyst Andrew Cohen said even if the Ramseys pass the test,
authorities wouldn't hesitate to prosecute them if the evidence
warranted it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public perception about their role in all of this could be
more favorable'' if the polygraph results support their account,
Cohen said. ''That could influence potential jurors down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''But just passing this test isn't going to stop prosecutors
from prosecuting them in the future. It doesn't create Teflon
around them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   No suspects have been named in the death of 6-year-old beauty
queen, who was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her
parents' home on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A Boulder County grand jury investigating the case adjourned
last fall with no indictments issued. Authorities, however, have
said the parents remain under an ''umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckner said in a letter to Wood that police would meet the
Ramseys' conditions for taking a lie-detector test: an independent
examiner; doing the test in Atlanta; and publicizing the results.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood questioned whether an FBI agent could be considered
independent of Boulder police if the FBI is involved in the
investigation, as former Boulder police detective Steve Thomas has
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked whether Boulder police think polygraph tests are
reliable and agree with Hunter that a test might interfere with a
future prosecution of JonBenet's killer.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 92, Trail Blazers 81  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Finley scored 24 points and Dirk Nowitzki
added 21 and 14 rebounds as the Dallas Mavericks won their fifth
straight game, 92-81 over the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Strickland had 18 points and Shawn Bradley scored 12 to
help the Mavericks win for the seventh time in their last eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace's 13 points paced the Trail Blazers, who shot
34.6 percent from the field (28-for-81) and hit only 19 of 33 free
throws. Stacey Augmon had 12 points and Damon Stoudamire and Bonzi
Wells both scored 11 for Portland, which had won five of its
previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas built a 71-56 lead with 9:57 left on Bradley's
three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   But Portland climbed back into the game with nine unanswered
points, capped by Wallace's three-point play with 7:52 remaining to
reduce Dallas' advantage to 71-65.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers were as close as 80-74 with 3:26 left, but
Wells missed two free throws on Portland's next possession. Finley
sank a 20-foot jumper just before the shot clock expired, and
Strickland converted two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Portland made one last charge, narrowing the deficit to 86-79 on
Stoudamire's 3-pointer with 1:15 left. But Finley's 3-pointer with
52 seconds left boosted Dallas' lead and ended the Trail Blazers'
comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks expanded a 43-39 halftime lead to 64-54 entering
the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mark Cuban's $280 million bid to purchase the Mavericks
received final approval from the league's board of governors
Tuesday in New York. ... Wallace collected his league-leading 36th
technical in the third quarter when he continued to gripe about an
offensive foul. ... Bradley suffered a sprained left knee late in
the first half, but returned wearing a brace midway through the
third quarter. ... The Trail Blazers missed nine of their first 19
free throws. ... Portland's Detlef Schrempf did not play due to a
cervical strain.

<HEADLINE> Capital All-Stars Beat US All-Stars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Sweetney, a 6-9 center from Oxon Hill
(Md.) High headed for crosstown Georgetown University, wasn't fazed
Tuesday night by the presence of U.S. All-Star center Neil
Fingleton, a 7-6, 310-pounder headed for North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Neither were teammates Bernard Robinson and Tamir Goodman, named
co-Most Valuable Players for leading the Capital All-Stars to a
112-101 upset of the U.S. All-Stars in the 27th Reebok Capital
Classic at MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Julius Page gave the U.S. All-Stars a 9-6 lead on a
3-pointer with 8:23 remaining in the first quarter, Fingleton had
blocked three shots and altered several more. He finished the
period with 4 blocks, 4 rebounds, 2 points and 2 assists in 6
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With 5 minutes remaining, the Capital All-Stars went on a 10-0
run capped by David Hawkins' slam and kiss off the glass for a
101-96 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Cuffe pulled the U.S. Stars to 103-97 with a free throw,
but Sweetney answered with a slam and a 3-point play to seal the
locals' second consecutive victory in the Capital Classic after
losing five in a row.

<HEADLINE> Tape Shows Knight Grabbing Player  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HOSKINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A videotape aired Tuesday night shows
Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight grabbing a player by the neck
during a practice and pushing him backwards.
</P>
<P>
   Two university trustees are investigating the outspoken and
controversial coach following recent reports from two former
players that he physically abused team members.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, CNN/Sports Illustrated reported former player Neil
Reed's allegation that Knight choked him during a 1997 practice.
The videotape obtained by CNN/SI shows Knight grabbing a player by
the neck, pushing him backward. The player's head appeared to snap
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who left Indiana in 1997, said he is the player on the
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't need a tape to tell me what happened,'' he told
CNN/SI.
</P>
<P>
   University officials who reviewed the tape Tuesday would not
comment on its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had known of the tape's existence and had tried to
obtain it in the past, university spokesman Christopher Simpson
said. After viewing the tape, Simpson said he couldn't tell when it
was made but is convinced of its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly it's an important piece of information as we continue
our review,'' Simpson told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana president Myles Brand last month appointed John D.
Walda, the president of the board of trustees, and Frederick F.
Eichhorn, a trustee and former president of the Indiana State Bar
Association, to investigate whether Knight physically abused team
members.
</P>
<P>
   The two flew to Atlanta on Tuesday to view the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tape does seem to shed some light on the reported incident
between Coach Knight and Neil Reed,'' Walda told CNN/SI. ''Now it
will be up to us to continue and complete or investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the investigation are due no later than the
third week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said Knight choked him during a 1997 practice and also
ordered Brand to leave a practice. Knight and Brand have denied the
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Knight also has denied an allegation by former Indiana player
Richard Mandeville, who told CNN Knight once came out of a
bathroom, pants around his ankles, and showed players soiled toilet
paper, saying, ''This is how you guys are playing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, former player Ricky Calloway said Knight
punched Steve Alford and slapped Darryl Thomas. Both former players
say the incidents never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was out of town and could not be reached for comment
Tuesday. Knight declined an opportunity to view the tape before it
aired, CNN/SI reported.
</P>
<P>
   University officials investigated and rejected Reed's claims
three years ago. Brand said athletic director Clarence Doninger
interviewed the entire coaching staff and all team members,
including Reed, in 1997. None of those interviewed, including Reed,
made any specific allegations of abuse at the time, Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of abuse are the latest in a long line of
incidents involving Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he was accused by a Bloomington man of choking him
in a restaurant parking lot. The county prosecutor refused to file
charges, saying Knight was provoked.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 season, Knight was fined $10,000 by the Big Ten
for berating referee Ted Valentine, whose officiating Knight called
''the greatest travesty'' he had seen in his coaching career.
Knight received three technical fouls and was ejected by Valentine
during the second half of a loss to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But Knight remains popular with the state's basketball fans.
Hundreds turned out last Sunday on the steps of the university's
Assembly Hall to show support for Knight -- and to label as failures
the former players who allege he abused them. Many former players
also have issued statements supporting the coach.

<HEADLINE> Peru Vote Fraud Details Surface  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- With President Alberto Fujimori just shy of
the majority of votes needed to win an unprecedented third term,
details surfaced Tuesday of voting irregularities and possible
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties said ballots with the names of other
candidates were waxed over, allowing only Fujimori's name to be
marked. Poll watchers also reported finding ballots favoring
opposition candidates that appeared to have been sabotaged to
invalidate them, and newspapers said the election board's computers
may have been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Roncagliolo, head of the private monitoring group
Transparencia, decried a ''volume of irregularities and
contamination without precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori denied any fraud at a news conference Monday night, his
only appearance since Sunday's elections. ''The process has been
clean, free and fair,'' he said. ''There were small incidents that
did not affect the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But later, some 30,000 Peruvians chanting ''down with the
dictatorship'' rallied outside a downtown hotel where Alejandro
Toledo, the 54-year-old economist turned candidate, demanded a
second vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alejandro Toledo will not lead disturbances or violence,'' he
said, ''but I should say forcefully that we won't hesitate for one
second to defend democracy and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration weighed in with a
strongly worded appeal for fairness, telling Fujimori that the
United States expects a runoff and would question the legitimacy of
a first round win.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian election authorities said final results from Sunday's
ballot would be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that with 90.82 percent of the ballots
counted, Fujimori had 49.79 percent, compared to Toledo's 40.39.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls and unofficial vote tallies by independent monitors
after the election had indicated Fujimori received significantly
less support and projected he would not reach the 50 percent plus
one vote needed to avoid a runoff. If no candidate wins a majority
of valid votes, a runoff would be held in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Toledo said he and his Peru
Posible party would not accept the election results ''if there is
no second round.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton administration spokesman Joe Lockhart
said the White House was aware of reports of irregularities. ''We
expect it will be a runoff, and I think serious questions will be
raised if the vote count indicated something otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Transparencia and the Council for Peace, a human rights
organization, reported various irregularities, including the
discovery of ballots already marked ahead of time for Fujimori near
a polling station in a working-class neighborhood of Lima. Similar
marked ballots were found in the town of San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers also reported finding ballots favoring opposition
candidates that appeared to have been sabotaged to invalidate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been innumerable accusations ... the most general
being the distribution of copies of pre-marked ballots,'' the
National Ombudsman Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's campaign said it found ballots in which Toledo's name,
listed last among the nine contenders, had been cut off at polling
stations in Lima, Huancayo, Trujillo and Piura.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern city of Piura, Ferran Zegarra, a local
representative of the Ombudsman Office, said 300 ballots had been
found in the nearby village of Tambogrande that had been printed
without Toledo's photo.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, ballots normally are destroyed after they have been
tallied, making it difficult to investigate any ballot tampering.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition newspapers La Republica and Liberacion also
reported that the election board's computers may have been tampered
with to alter the vote count to favor Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   El Comercio, Peru's leading independent newspaper, cited
computer experts as saying the election board's computer system was
vulnerable to tampering because it does not have sufficient
security. The elections board has 10 computer centers in Lima and
47 elsewhere around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Portillo, the official in charge of tabulating votes,
scoffed at the reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said there is a modem that can be used to alter
the election results. That is science fiction,'' he said. ''I would
like to have it to change my bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of his aides, Jose Cavassa, was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if the technology exists for modifying the
results or interfering with the electronic transmission of data,''
he said.

   On the stock market, the Nikkei index initially was lower with
technology issues losing ground following a drop by their U.S.
counterparts in New York, where the Nasdaq composite index fell
132.30 to close at 4,055.90 on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 100.52 to 11,287.08.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nikkei moved into positive territory toward the morning
closing bell after the Bank of Japan said in a monthly report that
economic recovery has started in some areas of private demand, as
seen in a gradual upturn in business fixed investment.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment represents an upgrade in the bank's view of the
country's economy, which is struggling to emerge from its worst
downturn in 50 years.

   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the

   In currency dealings, there was some yen-selling in the morning,

   Finance Ministers and central bankers from the G-7 -- the United
States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan -- will

   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7500 percent at late morning from Tuesday's finish of 1.7450
percent. Its price fell 0.04 point to 101.29.

<HEADLINE> ChiSox's Thomas Leaves Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Frank Thomas of the Chicago White
Sox might miss several starts after leaving Tuesday night's game
against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the sixth inning because of a
sore right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the tendinitis is really flaring up,'' White Sox
manager Jerry Manuel said. ''We might not see him the rest of the
series. Maybe in a pinch-hitting role.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been slowed by tendinitis on the inner heel of his
right foot and received a cortisone shot on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should notice a difference by the end of the week'' he said
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had surgery on his right ankle last September. He was the
designated hitter Tuesday night and went 1-for-3 before Jeff Abbott
hit for him.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox third baseman Greg Norton left with a sore left
hamstring and could wind up on the disabled list, according to
Manuel.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Clinton Discuss Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak drew the
Clinton administration's endorsement Tuesday for his decision to
pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon. At the same time, he
was prodded to move faster with the Palestinians on a West Bank
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will do what we can to help,'' President Clinton said as he
met at the White House with the Israeli leader. Meeting mostly
alone, except for note-takers, they surveyed for nearly four hours
Mideast peace prospects, taking time out for a dinner of hamburgers
and mixed vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good, productive, serious discussion, and Clinton feels
very encouraged that there is a new energy in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, a senior U.S. official said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In a light moment, Clinton emerged from the Oval Office with
Barak and declared to waiting officials: ''We have solved
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no such claim was made, nor did the U.S. official who
briefed reporters on an anonymous basis identify any problem as
being resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, without making any statement, left in a motorcade for
Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland to board his jet and
fly home, where a visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin loomed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reporters' questions on the South Lawn, with Barak
at his side, Clinton said he would try in their meeting to energize
the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, now engaged
in talks at a Washington Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of hope for rapid movement on the Palestinian
front,'' Clinton said. But he said the next few weeks will be
critical.
</P>
<P>
   As for Israel's stalled negotiations with Syria, Clinton would
not rule that track dead. ''There are still differences,'' he said.
''What we've got to do is to figure out where we go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, said he had ''a variety of ideas'' to take up
with Clinton about how ''to give new momentum and energy to the
Palestinian track'' in order to meet a mid-September deadline for
an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue that needs to be done as rapidly as
possible,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said earlier
about the slow-moving negotiations with the Palestinians on turning
over more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, under way at an Air Force base in southeast
Washington, are aimed at reaching an overall settlement and also
working out the details of an Israeli pullback on the West Bank
scheduled for June. ''So far, there are no results,'' said Hasan
Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington. ''Let's hope
that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright praised Barak at a news conference for planning to pull
Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon in July under U.N.
resolutions. ''It is strange that a country is criticized for
withdrawing from another country,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in Washington on a fast-paced 18-hour visit, has
expressed concern the pullback could touch off violence. Syria,
which has considerable influence in Lebanon and with Hezbollah
guerrillas there, wants a withdrawal as part of an overall
agreement in which Syria would recover the Golan Heights along its
own border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli-Syrian negotiations broke down three months ago.
Albright said the Clinton administration would assist Israel at the
United Nations in making preparations for a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's approach on Lebanon, the Palestinians and Syria all
were on the agenda for Barak's meetings with President Clinton and
other top U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian diplomat Rahman said in an interview that confidence
in the peace process will be shaken if the current round of
negotiations does not produce concrete results ''and show
seriousness on the part of the Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier round was unproductive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman said the Palestinians wanted Clinton to make clear to
Barak that the negotiations must be concluded successfully by Sept.
13, a deadline set by the United States, Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak flew in at 3:15 a.m., had some rest and met with members
of his staff before his first appointment, with American mediator
Dennis Ross, at Blair House across Pennsylvania Avenue from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Embassy spokesman Mark Regev said Barak was ''very
serious about the series of meetings he has today.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking with Ross, Barak met in the Lee sitting room at
the presidential guest house with Albright, Ross and Sandy Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Barak turned aside questions from American and Israeli reporters
at a brief photo session. Afterward he crossed blocked-off and
heavily guarded Pennsylvania Avenue to see Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Barak planned to fly home after calling on the President.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is due Wednesday in Israel to begin
the first-ever visit by a Chinese head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Israel and huge China established diplomatic relations only
eight years ago. Israel's modern technology is attractive to
Beijing, and ties are developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. disapproval, Israel plans to proceed with mounting
an advanced radar system on a Russian-made cargo airplane and
selling it to China.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Barak faced grim news about prospects for a
compromise accord with Syria. A Syrian response to Clinton's
overtures to reopen peace talks with Israel is being dismissed by
the State Department as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there is something for the Clinton administration to
work with, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a reporter
Monday, ''There isn't so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not much give'' in Syria's restated position on a
land-for-peace deal with Israel, she said. ''But I do think it's
important that they responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barak is saying he remains ready to make tough decisions
for peace -- a signal to the Israelis that he is willing to
surrender land to the Arabs -- and negotiations continue with the
Palestinians despite Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's assertion
they are a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   With the mid-September deadline, the Palestinians want virtually
all of the West Bank for a state and part of Jerusalem for its
capital.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the Clinton administration is beginning to
help Israel arrange withdrawal of its troops in July from a
security strip in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been unable to negotiate an agreement to
curb increasingly deadly guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers.
Barak, mindful of the toll's impact on the Israeli public, has
decided to abandon the strip.

<HEADLINE> Expos 7, Pirates 3  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jose Vidro hit a pair of two-run homers and
Lee Stevens added a two-run shot off Kris Benson as the Montreal
Expos won their fifth in six games, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates
7-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro, who had 14 homers in 290 games before this season, hit a
two-run shot in the third following Peter Bergeron's single and
another in the seventh after Bergeron tripled in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron and Vidro, the top two hitters in the Expos' order,
combined to go 6-for-10 with two homers, a triple, five RBIs and
four runs scored while reaching base eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro has at least one hit in all nine Expos' games and his .515
batting average leads the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens restored Montreal's lead at 4-2 after the Pirates tied
it on Pat Meares' two-run triple in the third. Stevens hit a
two-run shot that barely cleared the left-field wall near the foul
pole in the fourth inning for his second homer in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Benson (0-2) struck out a career-high nine in seven innings, but
was roughed up for his second consecutive start by allowing seven
runs and nine hits. He has lost eight of his last nine decisions
dating to last season has a 6.23 ERA in two starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez (1-0) apparently wasn't bothered by a two-hour,
two-minute rain delay that delayed the start until after 9 p.m.,
yielding three runs -- two earned -- in six innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kline, aided by double plays in both the seventh and
eighth innings, finished up with three scoreless innings for his
first save.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have lost three in a row to drop to 2-5.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It has either rained or snowed for four of the Pirates'
five home playing dates this season. Last week's opener was rained
out. ... The game-time temperature of 46 was about half that of the
91 for Sunday's Pirates-Diamondbacks game in Arizona. ... Montreal
is playing its last series in Three Rivers Stadium, which closes
after this season. ... The Pirates had gone 30 innings without an
error until first baseman Kevin Young misplayed Bergeron's grounder
to start the game. ... Pittsburgh 3B Aramis Ramirez was in a
0-for-12 slide until he singled in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Texas Congressional Elections Heat  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A retired military attorney won the Democratic
nomination Tuesday to run against Republican incumbent Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison in November, while a longtime state lawmaker won
the Republican nomination for retiring GOP Rep. Bill Archer's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The two races were among four runoffs held in Texas for Senate
and House nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate contest, South Texan Gene Kelly, who lost six
previous statewide races, defeated former one-term state
representative Charles Gandy. They had emerged from a field of five
Democrats in the March 14 primary.
</P>
<P>
   With 74 percent of Texas precincts reporting, Kelly had 118,038
votes, or 58 percent, to 84,194, or 42 percent, for Gandy.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, whose campaign has more than $6 million in the bank,
will be the heavy favorite in November.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year state Rep. John Culberson defeated businessman
Peter Wareing in a bitterly fought runoff for Archer's seat.
</P>
<P>
   With 67 percent of precincts reporting, Culberson had 21,288
votes, or 58 percent, while Wareing had 15,445 votes, or 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wareing accused Culberson of being a career politician and an
ineffective leader. Culberson branded Wareing a disloyal Republican
for voting in six Democratic primaries and donating to Democrats as
recently as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Jeff Sells is expected to provide only token opposition
in the predominantly Republican district in November.
</P>
<P>
   Also, retired Temple oilman Ramsey Farley defeated Belton
contractor Rodney Geer in a Central Texas GOP runoff to challenge
Democratic Rep. Chet Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Bryndan Wright, a former aide to House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, defeated retired lawyer Bill Payne for the right to oppose
Rep. Martin Frost, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Walt Williams had 23 points and 12 rebounds and
the Houston Rockets outscored the Denver Nuggets 14-2 in the final
6:20 to win their fourth straight game, 103-93 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was 7-of-12, making all four 3-point attempts, but had
only a 3-pointer in the second half. Kenny Thomas and Cuttino
Mobley added 15 points each for the Rockets, who avoided losing the
season series to Denver for the first time since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel led the Nuggets with 27 points and 11 assists.
Raef LaFrentz had 16 points for Denver, which lost its second
straight and had won two of the previous three meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took control late as Steve Francis tied the game 91-91
with 6:20 left and Thomas hit two shots over Antonio McDyess.
Shandon Anderson hit a reverse layup and Williams sank a 3-pointer
before Van Exel stopped a nearly five-minute Denver drought with a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nuggets never scored again.
</P>
<P>
   Denver took a 78-74 lead into the fourth quarter, but Matt
Bullard's 3-pointer provided the Rockets with a brief 81-80 edge.
McDyess' fadeway jumper got the Nuggets the lead right back and
baskets by Van Exel, Keon Clark and George McCloud gave Denver a
91-87 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 51-45, McCloud awakened the Nuggets with six points and
set up a layup by LaFrentz with a perfect pass as they took a 62-61
lead midway through the third quarter. They extended the lead to
67-61 as LaFrentz hit a layup and free throw, then Van Exel nailed
a 15-foot jumper while the Rockets went 2-for-10 and turned over
the ball four times.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley snapped a five-minute scoring drought for Houston with a
basket with 5:14 left, but LaFrentz hit a reverse dunk and Van Exel
a 3-pointer and running one-hander to push Denver's lead to 74-63.
Two free throws by Mobley brought the Rockets within 74-71, but
Clark and Ryan Bowen had a basket each in the last 1:10 of the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Clark sparked a 10-6 run at the start of the second quarter with
six points, including a dunk to get the Nuggets within 28-26.
Williams, who had 16 in the period, heated up, hitting a pair of
3-pointers and a two-fisted dunk off a miss as Houston built a
44-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams connected on his third 3 of the quarter in the final 25
seconds, but Clark countered with a reverse layup to cut the
Rockets' lead to six points at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Point guard Chris Herren (sore tooth) was unavailable for
the Nuggets. ... Walt Williams returned early in the second quarter
after leaving the game with 3:11 left in the first quarter after
knocking knees with Chris Gatling. ... Denver has connected on 437
3-pointers, second most in franchise history to the 636 in 1996-97.
... Houston's last win in Denver came on May 5 in the last game at
McNichols Arena. ... The Nuggets have given up at least 100 points

<HEADLINE> L.A. School Districts Break Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The school board voted unanimously Tuesday to
break up the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District into 11
mini-districts, with each having its own superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization of the nation's second largest school
district was proposed by interim Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines.
Its goals are to give schools better access to resources; to
improve communication between parents and teachers and to focus
attention on student achievement, especially reading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Student achievement is the only reason to reorganize,'' said
school board President Genethia Hudley Hayes. ''We've failed every
sector of our youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has been under fire for low student test scores and
poor management that led to the Belmont Learning Center scandal.
The nation's costliest high school sits abandoned and half-finished
on an old oil field that was found to be leaking toxic gases.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines took over the district in January and will serve as
interim superintendent through June. A nationwide search is
underway for the new general superintendent, who will oversee the
superintendents of the mini-districts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect the plan to be implemented by July, when the
new school year begins.
