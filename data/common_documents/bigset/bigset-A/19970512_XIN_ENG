<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Drawing up Common Arab Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has called for hammering out a
unified Arab strategy in the coming period in order to achieve
Arab solidarity that keeps abreast of international developments.
</P>
<P>
The appeal is contained in a working paper to be presented to
the 28th session of the Council of the Arab Parliamentary Union
(APU) set for Monday on Arab solidarity at the Cairo-based Arab
League (AL), the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The document warns of challenges facing the Arab countries
arising from Israel's hardline policy that threatens to undermine
the Mideast peace march, and the failure in implementing Arab
economic integration plans.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the nature of the challenges facing the
Arab world makes it hard for any "individual country to stand up
to them" and therefore boosting the efforts in restoration of
inter-Arab solidarity is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
To revive solidarity, the Arab countries should, at a starting
point, "turn from inter-Arab confrontations to reconciliation
before initiating an overall reconciliation with Israel," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also urged the reactivation of the AL, which it described
as an "actual embodiment for Arab regional order and the home of
the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
The league has to restore its vital role in order to rebuild
confidence among Arab countries and overcome problems through its
"natural framework."
</P>
<P>
The document urged the formation of a mechanism to coordinate
Arab actions at both the governmental or non-governmental levels
and uphold the idea of establishing a pan-Arab parliament or
legislative council.
</P>
<P>
The paper also contains a draft resolution on Arab solidarity
which will be a major topic at the meeting .
</P>
<P>
It advised closing up Arab ranks and realizing an all-out Arab
reconciliation, protecting public freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Arab lawmakers' agenda of talks will focus on two main
issues, Arab solidarity and the establishment of an Arab common
market.
</P>
<P>
Leading Arab lawmakers have already started to arrive in the
Egyptian capital for the 28th meeting of the APU Council Monday
and the 7th conference of the APU Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Returns Home After African Tour for Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki returned home today after having secured
agreement between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel
leader Laurent Kabila to hold further peace talks, said a source
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Mbeki's spokesman Ricky
Naidoo, who accompanied Mbeki on his shuttle diplomacy mission,
said Mobutu had put forward a number of proposals and these were
being discussed with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We will have some clearer answers tomorrow," said Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
The second round face-to-face peace talks between Mobutu and
Kabila are again likely to be held on board a South African Navy
ship off Pointe Noir, Congo on May 14, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was quoted as saying he expected the planned second
meeting to conclude running negotiations on a peaceful transition
of power.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu returned to Kinshasa, capital of Zaire on Saturday from
a regional summit in Libreville, Gabon where he had met Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Kabila earlier this week repeated his assurances that his
forces' advance on Kinshasa had been halted pending the talks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mobutu and Kabila held their first direct talks,
presided by South African President Nelson Mandela, on board a
South African Navy ship off Pointe Noir, and promised to meet
again within eight to 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki to Deliver ANC Submission to TRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki will make the second submission on behalf
of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) on Monday, said a source here
today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who returned home earlier today after his shuttle
diplomacy mission over Zaire peace talks, is among several senior
ANC members having applied for amnesty for their human rights
violatins during the apartheid era, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's national and provincial leadership has earlier
applied for amnesty to undertake "collective responsibility" for
political-activated violence perpetrated by their followers
during the anti-apartheid liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
Defence Minister Joe Modise, ANC national chairman Jacob Zuma,
Justice Minister Dullah Omar, Acting ANC Secretary-General Cheryl
Carolus and former ANC military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of
the Nation) special operations commander Aboobaker Ismail are
expected to be among the high-level ANC delegation attending
Monday's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"The submission will in the main deal with the conduct of the
movement's military and security and intelligence within the
context of a just war against apartheid, designated a crime
against humanity by the international community," said ANC
spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa.
</P>
<P>
The submission would also seek to answer "honestly and as
comprehensively as possible" questions posed by the TRC, chaired
by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, after the ANC made its first
submission in August last year, said mamoepa.
</P>
<P>
Two days have been set aside for the ANC to make its
submission, which will be followed on Wednesday by a presentation
from the former ruling National Party and another by the Freedom
Front on Friday.
</P>
<P>
By the midnight of May 10, the deadline set for applying for
amnesty, the TRC had received more than 7000 applications
nationwide.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and Sudanese President Hassan El Bashir have agreed to exchange
prisoners of war (POWs) and release all abducted civilians held
in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, during their peace talks held in the northern
Kenyan town of Eldoret, also asked Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi, mediator of the Ugandan-Sudan summit, to seek a peaceful
solution to the civil war in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In another move, they agreed that John Garang, leader of the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), must be involved
in Sudan's peace process.

Uganda captured 114 Sudanese government troops last month in a
border clash while Sudan held four Ugandan soldiers who were
gathering information in southern Sudan.

The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group acting in
northern Uganda, reportedly abducted hundreds of Ugandan civilians
and sent them to its bases in southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Banks to Dish Out 136 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Banks in South Africa will
spend about 600 million Rands (136 million U.S. dollars) on crime
prevention and security measures this year after suffering losses
of 26 million dollars in robberies, burglaries and ATM thefts in
1996, informed sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Security expenditures of major banks in South Africa in 1996
included over 170 million Rands (one dollar equals to 4.4 rands)
on securing branches and agencies -- of which 80-million Rands
was spent on guards -- and 156 million Rands on protecting cash
in transit, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the banks' 1997 security expenditures has had little
impact -- there has been a singificant rise in the number of bank
robberies in the first four months.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the banking industry for the first time
show the 1996 losses were the result of 620 robberies, burglaries
and ATM thefts -- nearly two for each day banks were open.
</P>
<P>
This year the number of robberies is estimated to go up
dramatically (to about 777 based on first-quarter trends),
banking sources predicted.
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Tucker, chief executive of the Council of
South African Banks, the first four months of this year have
witnessed 164 bank robberies, 34 ATM attacks and 60 burglaries.

BEIRUT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Pope John Paul II left here this
evening, winding up a 32-hour visit in Lebanon, the first by a
pope to the only Arab country where the number of Christians
matches the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Pope was seen off at the Beirut International Airport by
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and hundreds of Christian and Muslim
clerics and other individuals.
</P>
<P>
Following an official farewell ceremony, the Pope's special
plane took off at 7:50 p.m. (1650 GMT).
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the Lebanese capital, John Paul met 15,000
Lebanese youth in a hilltop church at Harissa, some 25 kilometers
north of Beirut, at Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
He conducted a mass at a seaside square in Beirut on Sunday
morning, which was attended by more than 100,000 people, including
the country's three top leaders.
</P>

freedom and its national territory should be recognized and

<HEADLINE> World Bank on Zimbabwe's Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has dubbed as
"prudent" Zimbabwe's policy on foreign borrowing but expressed
concern at the country's servicing of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The bank's resident representative in Zimbabwe David Cook said
here today that the southern African country had maintained its
external debt well and was therefore considered "credit-worthy".
</P>
<P>
"The country is in a reasonably comfortable position as far as
external debt is concerned because of its prudent and sound
policy," said Cook.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cook said the Zimbabwe government had so far not
entered into an external debt obligation which it would be unable
to service.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe presently spends between a quarter and one third of
its revenue on servicing both external and domestic debt which is
over 4.8 billion U.S. Dollars, one and half times more than its
current budget of three billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of servicing, particularly the domestic debt,
has been blamed for the country's budget deficit, over which
Zimbabwe and its western financiers are bickering.
</P>
<P>
Because of its international "credit-worthiness", Zimbabwe
would not be considered for the Paris Club debt cancellation
facility, said cook, adding that Zimbabwe is "always current
with its payment".

Jacques Santer today wound up his four-day official visit to
Greece with declaration of his satisfaction with progress in

</P>
<P>
Before his departure from the northern Greek port city of
Thessaloniki today, Santer visited the offices of the Development

each state separately.
</P>
<P>

special agreements with Bulgaria and Romania, which covered the
entire spectrum of relations. The EU was also contributing aid to
the strife-ridden Albania, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Santer held talks with Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister Costas Simitis on the
progress of the Inter-governmental Conference being achieved by EU
countries on the future shape of their union, the Economic and
Monetary Union (EUM), developments in Europe, Greek-Turkish
relations and Cyprus's candidacy for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
He also participated in the events organized by Greece to
celebrate Europe Day Friday.
</P>
<P>
Santer also praised Greece in his speeches here for the
economic achievements which Greece made in recent years, saying

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Gaddafi Braves UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With flights to two black African
countries, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi again positioned himself
in the forefront to counter the U.S. and other Western powers.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, aboard a Boeing-727 of the Libyan Arab Airlines,
visited Libya's southern neighbor Niger on May 8 and Nigeria on
May 8-9 in defiance of a U.N. air embargo against Libya banning
international flights to and from the country.
</P>
<P>
In both Niamey, the capital of Niger, and Kano, the third
largest city of Nigeria, he leveled sharp and heavy criticisms
against the Western powers, with the U.S. and France in particular
for "belittling Muslims and the Islam religion."
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that Gaddafi himself flew out of Libya
contravening the embargo, which was imposed in 1992 to force the
surrender of two Libyans allegedly involved in bombing Pan Am
flight 103 over Lockbie, Scotland, in 1988. The blast claimed 270
lives. He defied the U.N. sanctions last June by flying from Libya
to Cairo to attend a pan-Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
This time by flying to Niger and Nigeria he wanted to show to
the world not only his existence but also his unswerving efforts
to combat his foe -- especially the United States, observers
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The timing of his trip is also significant. The Islamic new
year gave him another chance to raise aloft the banner of Islam
and broaden his influence in the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
In the pan-Arab summit last June, Gaddafi called on the Arabs
to close ranks in the fight against what he described as the
aggression and domination of the West, especially the United
States. His well-planned southward trip manifested his intention
to seek support from beyond the Arab world, diplomats in Cairo
said.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi virtually put another test to the West, especially the
U.S., after he had sent planes three times to carry Muslim
pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the past three years in a row in
defiance of the U.N. air travel ban.
</P>
<P>
These bold actions seemed to have met little real challenge but
verbal protests from the West. Instead, Gaddafi found his
popularity growing among the Muslims across the African continent,
who have born resentiment against the West.

<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Upon his arrival in Niamey, he was
accorded a rousing welcome. President Ibrahim Mainassara, senior
government officials, religious leaders and thousands of local
residents turned out to greet him, holding placards and chanting
slogans eulogizing the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the Islamic new year, Gaddafi led a mass
prayer, attended by tens of thousands of local Muslims, to show
"the power and unity of the Muslim world" and then gave a speech
propagating Islamic ideas and repudiating the U.S. and France.
</P>
<P>
On May 9, Gaddafi arrived in Kano in a four airplane convoy
from Niamey and was greeted at the Kano International Airport by
Nigerian President Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
He was also welcomed by thousands of school children and
inspected a guard of honor before leading Friday prayers in front
of a gathering of at least 100,000.
</P>
<P>
In his speech made after the mass prayer, Gaddafi said that he
wanted to demonstrate Islam's strength against Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We want to mobilize the millions of Muslims from the start of
this year (Islamic year) to show off our power. We want to show
Islam's power and its ability to challenge and return the insults
to those who voice them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Standing in a shaded pavilion and wearing a pair of sunglasses,
Gaddafi accused Washington of controlling the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a secret that America and Europe are leading a
campaign to insult and belittle the Islamic peoples," Gaddafi
said. He also showed the crowd photos of children killed in U.S.
air raids on Libya in 1986, and in Israeli attacks in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"These are the symbols of terrorism and barbarianism," said
Gaddafi. "The Israelis are still occupying Lebanon after these
attacks and they don't withdraw because the Americans are with
them."
</P>
<P>
He maintained, "The U.N. did not impose sanctions against the
people of Iraq, the people of Libya or the people of Palestine --
the fact of the matter is that the United Nations is controlled by
the biggest enemy of the mankind -- the United States of America,"
said Gaddafi, wearing a turban and a white robe.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said that the U.S. military presence in the
Mediterranean sea and the Gulf region is meant to destroy Islam.
</P>
<P>
The trip of Gaddafi, who is widely known for his secretive and
uncertain whereabouts, was well arranged for fear of possible
attack. He was aboard a Boeing 727, accompanied by a same model
jet apparently used as a decoy in prevention of a potential attack.
</P>
<P>
A group of foreign journalists were picked up from Cairo by a
special plane to accompany him to the two African states.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was discontent with Gaddafi's moves. U.S. State
Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns Thursday denounced Gaddafi as
a leader of a "terrorist state," saying that the people of Niger
could "say their prayers without him."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. even asked Nigeria to detain Gaddafi's plane. Nigeria
did not show full obedience, but the local government of Kano
state gave in a little by canceling a previously announced holiday
designed to allow local residents to welcome Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Western countries opted to keep silence on
Gaddafi's trip.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Turkey Sign Agreement to Build Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of Energy and
Natural Resources Recai Kutan today left Baghdad for home after
signing an agreement on a pipeline project with Iraq, the Iraqi
News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The INA said Kutan and Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid
signed the agreement to build a 1,300-kilometer-long pipeline to
take Iraqi natural gas to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the
Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, which will cost about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars,
has an annual capacity of 10 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony Saturday, Rashid said that the two
sides have agreed on the formulation of implementation procedures
and that besides Iraqi and Turkish companies, several foreign
companies will also join in the project.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Kutan's visit to Iraq has achieved "positive
steps" which show what he termed as the mutual desire and
absolute identity of views between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Turkish minister voiced "satisfaction" at
the conclusion of the agreement which will help meet Turkey's
bad need of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
He described the signing of the agreement as "an important
step" on the way to boost the cooperation between Iraq and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Turkish minister declared that Turkey is
trying to buy from Iraq 8 billion tonnes of crude oil and 3
billion cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is going to be one of the biggest markets of Iraqi crude
oil and natural gas, said Kutan, adding that Ankara intends to
reactivate trade ties with Iraq which were interrupted in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister, accompanied by 17 oil experts, arrived
in Baghdad Thursday on a 3-day visit, during which, he held
talks with senior Iraqi officials to discuss cooperation between
the two countries in the fields of oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, whose proven and probable oil reserves separately stand
at 112 billion and 214 billion barrels, was Turkey's top crude
oil supplier and the third largest trade partner before the United
Nations imposed the economic sanctions on Iraq following its its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

LUANDA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- About 1,500 tons of relief food,
was destroyed today in a major fire which occurred to a barn in
Luanda, capital of Angola. No casualty was reported.
</P>
<P>
Fire workers could virtually do nothing about the fire, which
lasted for more than four hours this morning, because there was
no source of water available near the barn.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Norway Supports Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern
Tore Godal today reiterated his country's keenness on promoting
the Mideast peace process and exerting its efforts to help find a
way out of the current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival here on his two-day visit to Egypt, Godal said
that he will discuss with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa the
general situation in the region especially the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will also discuss means of boosting the good
ties binding the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Saad al-Shazli who received
the Norwegian official at the airport said that "Norway plays a
role in Hebron through its presence within the international
observers," referring to the redeployment agreement of Israeli
troops from the West Bank town of Hebron in January.
</P>
<P>
The January accord on Israeli redeployment in Hebron has given
the Mideast peace process a boost but since then the momentum has
been lost. The Israeli construction of a new settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem has plunged the process into a two-month crisis.
</P>
<P>
Norway was a mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo peace
accords in 1993, which have become a cornerstone of the whole
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first leg of Godal's regional tour that will also
take him to Jordan, Syria, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Security Cooperation Yet to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of security
cooperation between the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and
Israel is pending the freeze of construction of Jewish
settlement, according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service in Gaza, told reporters that the weekend talks between
Palestinian and Israeli security chiefs did not signal a renewal
of cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Dahlan noted that the Palestinian side will resume the
security cooperation with Israel only after it commits to fully
implementation of the interim agreement signed by Israel and the
PLO in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Israeli General Security Service, the
Palestinian Preventive Security Service and CIA met Friday at
the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, which was described by Palestinian
officials as a gesture to the Americans and Israeli President
Ezer Weizman, to whom Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had
promised the resumption of security cooperation. It was agreed
to have another meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Weizman during their summit at Erez Tuesday that
if Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu does not change his
decision to build the new settlement in Har Homa, then the two
sides are stuck and he cannot see how he can meet with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu sent his confidant, attorney Yitzhak Molcho, to
meet with Arafat in Nablus Friday, with the proposal to renew the
negotiations. Arafat conditioned this on freezing the
construction in Har Homa, which Israel rejected.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, Friday met
with U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross, who is
shuttling between Tel Aviv and Gaza in an attempt to revive the
stalled peace talks. He told Ross that continued settlement
building on the part of Israel would keep the peace process
frozen.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Lifting of Embargo This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today called on the Arab world
to work for the lifting this year of the UN-imposed economic
embargo for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Arab nation has long expressed its solidarity with the
Iraqi people and denounced the continued enforcement of the
embargo, said Speaker of Iraq's Parliament Saadoun Hamadi, who
arrived here today to attend Arab Parliamentary Union (APU)
council meeting scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This year is to witness the lifting of the unjust economic
embargo on Iraq, long overdue after Baghdad's compliance with all
UN Security Council resolutions on the Gulf War," he said.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the embargo has become an issue of interest to
every Arab country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi also complained about delays in approving food and
medicine contracts by the UN Sanctions Committee (UNSCOM) under
the oil-for-food deal, which allows Baghdad to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food and medicine
for Iraqis suffering from the six-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The deal is stalled "because of the political intransigence of
UNSCOM," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi top legislator said only a few of the contracts Iraq
signed with various parties for the receipt of food and medicines,
have been effected and blamed the U.S. for blocking those deals.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will present tomorrow at the APU Council meetings a working
paper on Arab solidarity and the Arab common market, he added.

<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 41 were
injured in three explosions which struck today a highland district
of Algiers, four days from the official beginning of the campaign
for Algeria's legislative elections on June 5, said reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Algerian security services said that a car bomb explosion this
afternoon killed one and wounded 12 near the Palace of Justice,
the seat of the supreme court of Algeria, in the Ben Aknoun
highland district of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty other people were injured by another bomb explosion near
a music record library of a zoo in the same district, while a
third explosion injured nine people near a law school, also in the
Ben Aknoun district.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse said that at least one explosion was
heard all over Algiers, and a thick smoke was seen rising from the
Ben Aknoun district.
</P>
<P>
Four high school students and one child were killed last
Tuesday by a car bomb explosion outside a high school in the plain
center of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian capital was hit by a wave of terrorist bombing
attacks during the Ramadan month this year. Dozens of people were
killed in what was described as a nerve war launched by Islamic
militants during the Muslim fasting month.
</P>
<P>
A small political party, the Movement of Democratic Youth,
announced today that two of its leaders were murdered several days
ago on a road in Medea, 80 kilometers south of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Islamic extremists always set up false police check points on
the country roads to massacre people, usually by cutting throats.

<HEADLINE> Mossengwo Reserves Response to Designation as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Archbishop Laurent Mossengwo, who
was elected parliament speaker Saturday by Zaire's political
parties, today said that he reserved his response to the
designation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zairian constitution, the parliament speaker
could serve as the country's temporary head of state if the
president resigns or is prevented from fulfilling his duty.
</P>
<P>
Mossengwo said at a press conference held today in Brussels
that his designation must be guaranteed nationally and
internationally and must be approved by the Roman Catholic Church
of Zaire and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Mossengwo, who is the archbishop of Kisangani, Zaire's third
largest city now in the hands of the rebels of Laurent-Desire
Kabila, was forced to resign from the post of parliament speaker
in 1995 by Zaire's political parties.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he would start a mission as "constitutional
mediator" in Zaire at the request of the country's political
forces at a "sovereign national conference." He refused to specify
what kind of conference it was.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels of the "Alliance of Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire" of Kabila said today that it would
not deal with Mossengwo.
</P>
<P>
The "foreign minister" of the alliance, Bizima Karaha, said
today in Lubumbashi that if Mossengwo accepts the post as
parliament speaker, he should take "the entire responsibility for
a possible blood bath in Kinshasa."
</P>
<P>
Karaha today also urged foreigners staying in Kinshasa to leave
the city immediately, because he said Zairian government forces
plan to kill them to justify an international intervention in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"Mobutu and his allies want to kill the foreigners to provoke
an intervention by foreign troops in our country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Testing Blood Levels of HIV Improves Treatment of Infants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A test that counts AIDS viruses
in blood should be routinely used on newborns with HIV-positive
mothers for an early treatment, U.S. scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The test, until now used only to adults, offers hope that
infants infected with HIV can be identified quickly and their
lives extended, perhaps until they are able to respond to newer
and more effective drugs, according to a news letter from Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Measuring viral RNA in the blood more accurately reflects the
level of infection" and the test shows within a month after birth
whether a baby is also infected, chief researcher professor Thomas
Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
Until now, doctors measures anti-HIV antibodies to determine
whether a baby was infected. Because most antibodies newborns have
are those they get from their mother in the womb, doctors had to
wait several months before the mothers' anti-HIV antibodies in the
baby disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Measuring virus RNA with a technique called polymerase chain
reaction, the Hopkins team also found that virus levels in adults
fall quickly after infection while in infants the level falls
slightly after a few months and remains much higher than in adult.
</P>
<P>
"These viral kinetics demonstrate why young children die faster
with this disease than do adults." Quinn explained. "This study
shows that if you treat babies early and keep their virus load
below 70,000 per milliliter, you have a good chance of preventing
an early death."
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied 106 infants for at least one year, or
until infants younger than one year died of AIDS, said the news
letter. The study was also published in the latest issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.

gives up violence.
</P>
<P>
Before calling a general election this week, the Irish prime
minister criticized opposition Fianna Fail leader Bertie Ahern for
promising to meet Sinn Fein if he won the upcoming election in
June, Irish Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Bruton insisted that the IRA abandon its terrorist actions for
Sinn Fein to gain entry to all-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"If they (IRA) wanted to make the decision, which they have got
to make eventually, to put aside violence for once and for all, I
think they should have made it (by) now," he said. "I won't meet
Sinn Fein until there is a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
The IRA is the main underground group fighting to merge
Northern Ireland into an all-Ireland state and has resorted to an
armed campaign to achieve its goal over the past three decades.
Britain and Ireland banned talks with Sinn Fein in February 1996
after the IRA quit a 17-month truce.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, an off-duty policeman was shot dead in a bar in
Belfast by two gunmen from a small leftist Republican militia. The
latest violence has cast a shadow over the peace talks on Northern
Ireland to be resumed next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany is to provide 500,000 marks
(about 290,000 U.S. dollars) in emergency aid for victims of the
earthquake which shook northeast Iran on Saturday killing more
than 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Ministry said the money will finance the
delivery of blankets, tents and other urgently needed aid supplies
by the German Red Cross to Mashhad, capital of the stricken
province Khorassan, which borders Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the German Red Cross said that a cargo plane
would send the first consignment to Mashhad on Tuesday with
another flight planned for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed at
least 2,400 people and injured about 6,000. It was Iran's most
severe earthquake since 1990, when about 35,000 people died.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Family Income Stalls in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Canadian family after-tax income was
essentially unchanged in 1995 from 1994 after adjusting for
inflation, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the average after-tax family income was 44,286
Canadian dollars (31,886 USD), which is about five percent less
than in 1989, the peak year for income.
</P>
<P>
"Income, excluding government transfer payments, was up
marginally from the 1994 level while transfer payments were down,"
the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Since income taxes were basically the same, the net result was
that average family income after tax was essentially unchanged,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
Transfer payments and personal taxes are two important
mechanisms used by the Canadian government to redistribute income.
</P>
<P>
For example, before taxes and transfers, the families in the
highest quintile had 21 dollars (15 USD) for every 1 dollar (0.72
USD) received by those in the bottom quintile.
</P>
<P>
Yet, after taxes and transfers, the gap was 5 dollars (3.6 USD)
for every 1 dollar.
</P>
<P>
Families in lowest quintile saw their average income rise to
17,058 dollars (12,282 USD) after taxes and transfers from 5,182
dollars (3,731 USD) before transfer.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the highest income families saw their
average incomes fall to 82,646 dollars (5,951 USD) after taxes
from a pre-tax, pre-transfer average of 108,309 dollars (77,982
USD).

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Norway Urge Stronger Push to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Norway today lamented the
crisis-ridden situation in the Mideast and urged a harder push
from all parties to return the peace process to its original
track.
</P>
<P>
Both sides made the appeal following a meeting between
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Norwegian Foreign Minister
Bjoern Tore Godal here today.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian foreign minister told reporters that he was not
very optimistic over the resumption of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is going through one of the most crucial
phases since Madrid and Oslo," said Godal, who arrived here
Sunday on a multi-leg tour of the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
"It will take a huge effort to return it to its original
course," he said.
</P>
<P>
Each has a different role to play, the Arab, American and EU
roles are very important, he said, urging more efforts from the
Palestinian National Authority and Israel toward the resumption
of talks.
</P>
<P>
"The alternative would be worse," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Norway, a key broker of the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords, has criticized Israel's settlement policy for
contradicting U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Deploring the futility of exhausted mediation, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said he fears all Arab and
international efforts had used up and urged the Arab nation to
take a strong line to defend the peace process from collapse.
</P>
<P>
"A firm Arab stance is required, and I favor the resolutions
that were adopted at the latest pan-Arab summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo summit held last June recommends reconsidering
normalization steps with Israel if it fails to comply with the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"One should not forget that Israel is an occupier and that the
lands it seizes by force are occupied Palestinian land," he said,
adding that Israel thus has no right to infringe on the land, as
is clear under the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Moussa affirmed that the Arabs have to adopt a definite and
clear position on the Israeli settlement activities, which have
plunged the peace process into a two-month-old crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot alter it, we can reject it," he said, cautioning
the exercise of caution when doing so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa underlined that Arab economic aid to the
Palestinians would be necessary and feasible to help them
overcome the difficulties under an Israeli economic and military
closure, its construction of settlements and imposition of a fait
accompli.
</P>
<P>
Godal will leave later today for Syria, then head for
Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas to complete
his multi-leg tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli accord in January on Israeli
withdrawal from Hebron has given the peace process a boost but
since then the momentum has been lost. The Israeli construction
of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March has
plunged the process into a two-month crisis.
</P>
<P>
Norway was a key broker of the Israeli-PLO Oslo peace accords
in 1993, which have become a cornerstone of the whole peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Ivory Trade Urged Not to Be Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Several wildlife protection groups
urged here today to maintain the ban on ivory trade worldwide,
especially in Africa, warning the lift will lead to an upsurge in
poaching and finally the sharp fall of elephant population.
</P>
<P>
"The continued international ban on the ivory trade is the
only hope for the African elephant," said Nehemiah Rotich, the
Chief of the East African Wildlife Society at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The call is part of the attempts to lobby the 10th Session of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES),
set for June in Harare, not to downlist the status of the African
elephant from current CITES Appendix I to Appendix II.
</P>
<P>
Under Appendix I, the trade of ivory and other elephant
products are absolutely forbidden, while the Appendix II
legalizes limited ivory trade, including raw tusks of ivory.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia have put forward a formal
proposal to the CITES demanding the resumption of the ivory
trade, saying the over-populated mammal poses a danger to the
environment and local residents.
</P>
<P>
The African elephant was placed on CITES Appendix I as an
endangered species in 1989 following a vote of the overwhelming
majority of CITES members, including the above three countries
and other 35 African states.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservationists argued that once the
seven-year-old ban is lifted, elephant poaching will soar again
and become out of control.
</P>
<P>
"The African continent was loosing an estimated 70,000
elephants annually to meet the world demand for ivory prior to
the 1989 ban," Rotich recalled.
</P>
<P>
During the late 1980s, Kenya lost more than 2,000 elephants
every year while Tanzania lost over 25,000, meaning at least 70
elephants killed a day, he quoted related survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer tolerate international trade in ivory," said
Perez Olindo, Director of the African Elephant Foundation
International.
</P>
<P>
Olindo spoke highly of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi who
publicly burnt ivory stockpiled in Kenya in 1989, calling on Moi
to maintain leadership of the fight against the ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
These conservationists also charged that Japan, currently the
chair state of the CITES Standing Committee, not only fails to
effectively curb ivory trade, but also seeks to boost it by
backing the proposal on lifting the ban.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable that Japan, a hugely wealthy country
with no elephants... is threatening this important African
economic asset," said Rotich. enditem

<HEADLINE> Germany to Run Short of Engineers, Engineer Group Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany might run short of engineers
in a few years from now because of a drop by half in the number of
students studying engineering since 1990, a German engineer group
warned today.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish job markets in the 1990s in Germany should be
blamed for the drop in the enrollment of engineering students,
said Hans-Juergen Warnecke, President of the Association of German
Engineers (VDI), at the opening of the German Engineer Conference
Monday in the eastern German city of Leipzig.

About 1,300 representatives from Germany's scientific and

According to VDI, there are about 800,000 engineers in Germany
at present, a fourth of them are in the eastern half of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pak Foreign Secretary-Level Talks to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kurumba Island, the Maldives, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The foreign
secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan will be resumed
in Islamabad either by the end of this month or in the middle of
June, a senior Pakistani official said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to continue the talks between the two countries'
foreign secretaries came at a meeting between Indian Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, on Kurumba Island near the Maldive capital, Male.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad Ahmed, Pakistan's foreign secretary, told a press
briefing that Sharif and Gujral held discussions in a "very
constructive and friendly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Both prime ministers are attending a summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which opened in Male
today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was the first between the prime ministers of
the two countries in four years, covered the whole range of issues
between the two countries, Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers decided to continue the dialogue at the
foreign secretary-level and expressed satisfaction over the
outcome of the first round of talks held in New Delhi in late
March after a break of three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign secretaries' meeting, which I hope, will be either
at the end of this month or perhaps the middle of June" in
Islamabad, Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the March talks, a good beginning was made toward
understanding each other's positions and the two prime ministers
today gave specific guidelines to the foreign secretaries for the
second round of talks for the "evolution of a comprehensive
mechanism to address all outstanding issues between the two
countries," Shamshad said. "Here I emphasize, including the core
issue of Jammu and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
But he said nobody should expect major breakthroughs at the
foreign secretary-level talks. "We are dealing with complex issues
which are rooted in the last 50 years and we are just making a
beginning ... We are very realistic and there are no quick fixes."
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also agreed to establish a hotline
between themselves and they will be in constant contact, Shamshad
said, adding that such hotlines had existed in the past, but had
not functioned.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to take some measures which include the
immediate release of all civilian prisoners on both sides,
Shamshad said. The number of civilian prisoners to be released
would be exchanged by concerned authorities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries will discuss other measures which can
be taken to alleviate the situation between the two countries, he
said. "When we meet in Islamabad, we will pick up the threads from
where we left in New Delhi."
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to relax the restrictions on travel
between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov signed in the Kremlin a peace
treaty on Monday, declaring an end to the long time conflict
between Moscow and the independence-seeking north Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
"We have signed a peace deal of historic dimensions, putting a
full stop to 400 years of history," Interfax news agency quoted
Yeltsin as saying after the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying:"Today we have
ended the 400-year confrontation, regardless of those who wanted
the war to continue."
</P>
<P>
The signing of the peaceful treaty between Moscow and Chechnya
is regarded by the Russian president as a first step towards a
great program of action, including the signing of a package of
agreements in the economic sphere.
</P>
<P>
The truce had halted a 21-month war in which tens of thousands
of people died in the Russian military operation to crush
Chechnya's independence drive.
</P>
<P>
The agreement included the withdrawal of Russian troops and the
deferment of any decision on Chechnya's status until 2001.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: No Water Crisis With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh today denied there is a water crisis between his country
and Israel, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
No real crisis exists in Jordanian-Israeli relations as
reported by the Israeli media, although the two countries do hold
different views about some provisions in the Jordanian-Israeli
peace treaty concerning water, the minister told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Under a provision of the peace treaty, Israeli should allocate
50 million cubic meters of water to Jordan immediately after the
signing of the treaty, and another 100 million cubic meters
through international-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it had already allocated 50 million cubic meters
of water to Jordan, and insisted that the remainder should come
from desalinization and a new dam.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said, However, the provision has not been realized up
to now.
</P>
<P>
As water is an important resource in the Middle East, Jordan
and Israel have been at odds for decades over sharing the water of
Jordan River and its tributaries.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
and Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan due early this month did not
materialize because Israel has not produced any concrete idea to
keep its promise in the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Hassan walked out of the meeting, saying he did so for both
sides could not reach an agreement on sharing the spare water of
the Jordan River as required under the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second country among the Arab states, after
Egypt, to have signed a peace treaty with Israel. There has been
wide complaints in the kingdom that the people have not
benefited from the treaty signed in 1994, particularly in the
economic field.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's forthcoming Ninth
Five-Year Plan will mainly focus on the alleviation of poverty by
developing the country's agricultural sector, a government
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The government is going to formulate a long-term agricultural
plan aimed at solving many problems concerning poverty and
unemployment in the country, where over 85 percent of the people
depend on agriculture for their livelihood, Mangalsiddhi
Manandhar, vice chairman of the National Planning Commission, told
a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Noting that previous development plans were not able to achieve
much in poverty reduction, the official hinted that a land reform
program could be introduced in order to remove the very roots of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government would give due priority to the
development of water resources in the next five years as
irrigation and electric power are necessary for agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will introduce a new development plan this year as the
current Eighth Five-Year Plan ends in the coming July.

<P>
The law, adopted by the fifth Session of the Seventh
National People's Congress in April 1992, came into force on
October 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the law, women in China enjoy equal rights

The law states that governments at all levels shall protect
women's special rights and interests according to law and improve
the social security system for women. All discrimination,
maltreatment and violence against women shall be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Working Committee on Women and Children under
the State Council shows that since the law went into effect in 1992
women's participation in government and political affairs has
been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the report said, the number of women
officials in government institutions and enterprises had increased
by two million, compared with 1992, jumping to 13.2 million and
accounting for 33.8 percent of the country's total. It is 200
times the number at the founding of New China in 1949.

universities and graduate schools accounted for over 45 percent,
36 percent and 27 percent of the totals, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-1995 period, the report said, more than 96
million women in rural areas had received various kinds of skill
training.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Ministry of Labor said that the number of women
workers in cities in 1995 hit 57.55 million, accounting for 38.6
percent of the total urban workers, an increase of 1.69 million
compared to 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the ministry, the mortality rate of
pregnant women and women in labor has dropped by more than 30
percent compared with 1989, to 61.9 per 100,000. The average life
expectance of Chinese women in 1996 was double the figure
for 1949, rising to 72 years.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Reproductive Health Communication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A five-day international
conference on the reproductive health communication at
the grassroots opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Head of the Ethiopian National
Population Office Negussie Tefera said effective communication
among policy makers, professionals and population at the
grassroots level is one of the most important factors that
determine the fruitful implementation of development programs.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that development programs during the
past three decades were characterized with the lack of proper
communication and effective interaction among the three entities.
</P>
<P>
"Experience has shown that well-designed and well-managed
communication activities can contribute significantly to creating
awareness and interest, increasing knowledge and understanding
and changing attitudes and even behavior within a reasonable
period of time," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening ceremony, Isaac Bekalo, Director
of the Africa Region of the International Institute for Rural
Reconstruction (IIRR), said the five-day conference will serve as
a forum for exchange of views about experience gained by
professionals who worked with communities in Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of active involvement of the public
in development endeavors.
</P>
<P>
"Often the contribution of the grassroots level population is
unrealized and not properly documented. It is through their
understanding and active participation that development efforts
will be sustained," he added.

"And maintaining diversified lives which are produced by the
sexual method has become the fundamental condition for man to
adapt to the environment and survival," the Chinese scientist said.
</P>
<P>
"Animals, plants and microorganisms have become integral parts
of the world of life after tens of millions of years of
interaction and evolution," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Any application of cloning to copy animals, plants and
microorganisms could cause problem of environmental safety and
threaten the ecology," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must keep sober minds and think about the problems caused by
the breakthrough in cloning technology," Professor Xu said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to control the use of human genes, the Chinese Society
of Genetics has set up a national committee of ethics, society and
law with regard to human genes.
</P>
<P>
"China should also set up a national committee of ethics and
law with regard to cloning animals, which will define scientists'
rights, duties, responsibilities as regards cloning," Xu suggested.
</P>
<P>
"While paying full attention to the negative aspects of
cloning technology, CAS firmly believes that man is able to stop
the misuse of scientific achievements," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Research Into Cloning to Copy Humans (1) By Li Xiguang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), the country's top scientific body, has banned all kinds of
research related to cloning technology to copy human beings.
</P>
<P>
"CAS takes a clear-cut and firm stand in banning all kinds of
research related to the use of cloning technology to copy humans,"
announced Professor Xu Zhihong, the country's leading biologist
and CAS vice-president.
</P>
<P>
British scientists created the world's first cloned sheep
out of frozen cells in late February, which led scientists to
believe that human cells frozen in controlled conditions and
protected with certain chemicals could possibly be cloned, thus
replicating a person.
</P>
<P>
This means that people who were deep frozen after death may one
day be brought back to life.
</P>
<P>
Since the British announcement of their breakthrough, there
have been many reports of Chinese researchers cloning cows, lab
rats and genes of hereditary diseases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
But the genetic breakthrough also touched off a controversy
in the meantime on what scientists might do with the
technique, such as using it to copy humans.
</P>
<P>
"Banning the use of cloning to copy humans is absolutely
necessary to maintain ethical morality which holds together
today's human society," Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Modernization of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
said that economically prosperous regions of the country
should act as models for modernizing the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of Guangdong Province from May 9
to 12 he pointed out that high-technology should be brought into
the sector and intensive farming encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that economically prosperous coastal regions have
the technological and economic power to support the development of
a modernized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He urged that agriculture, industry and commerce be combined,
and that the use of science and technology be spread to modernize
the farming sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the modernization of agriculture must be based on
the continuation and improvement of the initiative-based household
contract system.
</P>
<P>
"We must see to it that grain production will increase steadily
and farmers will earn more incomes," he told local officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, closer attention should be paid to the market
demand and to fostering leading industries in various localities,
Jiang urged.
</P>
<P>
He called for efforts to introduce a service system to provide
for farmers a whole range of services including seeds, materials,
funding, information, techniques, machinery, processing, storage,
transportation and marketing.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Universities Urged to Train Qualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan called
on universities to train qualified labor force to contribute to
the economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and Arab societies need more qualified and talented
people instead of a torrent of university certificate holders,
said Hassan Sunday at the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that vacational and academic education should be
coordinated with the needs of the labor market so as to
contribute well to the economic development.
</P>
<P>
Hassan`s remarks testified to a bare fact that Jordan`s
higher education system is now past its prime days of the 1980s
when it supplied Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
and Oman with some 350,000 well-educated people, two-fifths of
Jordan`s total labor force.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the export of high-level labor force earned
Jordan one billion U.S. dollars per year and ranked among the top
foreign currency-earning industries together with tourism and
entrepot trade.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of Jordanian young people aged between 18 and
22 were educated at universities or community colleges. Due to
the limited need in Jordan, some of them found jobs in other Arab
states and made the country big wealth.
</P>
<P>
However, these foreign currency-makers were driven back to
Jordan by other Arab states due to Jordan's support for Iraq when
the Gulf crisis began in 1990 triggered off by Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the country began to lose money and the
universities gradually abandoned efforts to educate qualified
graduates due to the decreasing demand of the market.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Swimmers Outpace Chinese peers at East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- In the last 25 meters, Ichikawa Yosuke of
Japan outpaced Chinese Xiong Guoming to steal the gold medal in the
men's 4x200 freestyle relay at the second East Asian Games here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese quartet clocked 7:31.32 to award Japan the third out
of five gold medals at stake in the day's swimming competition, while
China finished second in 7:31.35 and South Korea third in 7:45.71.
</P>
<P>
"We felt disappointed to lose the relay because Xiong Guoming had
not fully displayed his powers, he should break away in an earlier
stage," lamented Chinese coach Tang Qun.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, 23, once swept six gold medals at the 1993 national games,
suffered an early blunt in the morning when he was disqualified in the
heats of the men's 400m individual medlay.
</P>
<P>
Japan finished one-two in the men's 100m butterfly as Takashi
Yamamoto clocked in 53.98 seconds and Katsuhiko Morita swam home in
54.73, with Andrei Gavrilov of Kazakhstan winning the bronze medal in
55.40.
</P>
<P>
The other gold medal for Japan was from Masami Tanaka who won the
women's 200m breaststroke in 2:29.34, beating a duo of South Koreans
to second and third to the dismay of the home fans.
</P>
<P>
Byun Hye-yung finished second in 2:29.82 while her teammate Noh
Joo-hee got the bronze medal in 2:32.95.
</P>
<P>
The other two gold medals were split between China and South Korea
as Kim Bang-hyun won for the host in the men's 400m individual medlay
and Zheng Wenyu won a lone swimming gold for China in the women's 200m
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Korean Kim clocked 4:25.75 to touch home first in the individual
medlay where Koichi Masuta and Shunsuke Sonoda, both of Japan,
finished second and third respectively in 4:27.78 and 4:31.09.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Wenyu got the gold medal in the women's 200m freestyle in
2:01.98, as her compatriot Guo Wei finished third in 2:03.78 with the
silver medal snatched by Japanese Sachiko Miyaji in 2:02.22.
</P>
<P>
In the diving competitions which started today, Huang Wen and Liu
Ben, both of China, finished one-two in the men's one-meter
springboard with 360.81 and 350.88 points respectively. The bronze
medal went to Kiichiro Miyamoto of Japan who garnered a total point of
338.43.
</P>
<P>
The women's 1-meter springboard title was taken by Irina Vygouzova
of Kazakhstan who scored a total of 263.88 points.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shunqun of China failed in her last dive and scored a miserable
39 points for a total of 250.23, good enough for a bronze medal while
her compatriot Zhang Jing finished second on 255.09 points.

<HEADLINE> China's Holds First Gathering of Quadruplet Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese family usually has one
child only nowadays because of the national family-planning
policy. But 11 families gathered here today have brought a record
of 44 children together.
</P>
<P>
They are all families with quadruplets and are having a special
reunion, believed to be the first of its kind ever held in China.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the oldest quadruplets are the 35-year-old
daughters of Wei Guoxiang from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A baby food company announced at a party here Sunday for the
quadruplets that it will supply its products free to all triplets
and quadruplets born in China from now on until they are three
years old.
</P>
<P>
"The survival of the quadruplets shows that the general living
standard of the Chinese people has greatly improved. But they
and their families still need help from society as a whole," said
Zhong Xiushen from the Shanghai "Wenhui" daily, one of the
sponsors of the event.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the chances of giving birth to quadruplets
is one in more than 700,000.
</P>
<P>
China, with a population of 1.2 billion, has 32 sets of
quadruplets at present, including five sets in Hong Kong and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, eight sets of quadruplets were born in China, of
which five sets survived.
</P>
<P>
In order to help parents of quadruplets, many Chinese
enterprises, government departments and individuals donate cash
and materials to them, and provide for them medical checks free of
charge.

<HEADLINE> Port Users of Bangladesh's Seaport Call Off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) - Port users of Chittagong, the largest
seaport in Bangladesh, have called off a strike after Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina promised to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong Port Users Forum announced on May 7 that it
would begin a strike on May 11 to protest against what it called
"the failure of the government in giving permission to use private
equipment in cargo handling at the port."
</P>
<P>
According to Chittagong port sources, Sheikh Hasina assured a
port users' delegation Saturday night that the government would
solve the problem and she also sought cooperation of the port
users in the greater interest of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the delegation that her government was
very much aware of the importance of the Chittagong seaport and
said all possible endeavors would be made for the improvement of
the overall condition there.
</P>
<P>
Convenor of the Forum Kamaluddin Ahmed once said imported
equipment worth millions of U.S. dollars had been lying unused at
the port for the last one and a half years due to the lack of a
government decision on its use.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a fixed time to settle the issue but the government
and the port authorities failed to provide us with that," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier this year agreed to the use of private
cargo handling equipment by the port users, but it later withdrew
the decision under the pressure of the port workers' union.

<P>
XICHANG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo today
praised the scientists who sent a new Chinese-made satellite into
orbit this morning at the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that, despite difficulties and heavy pressure, the
scientists did a wonderful job of ensuring that the
"Dongfanghong-3" communications satellite moved safely into orbit.
</P>
<P>
This success has proved that the country's space industry has a
bright future, Wu said, added that the scientists are politically
qualified, their spirit is indomitable and their technology is
superb.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the State Council are very concerned about every
satellite launching. Therefore, workers on that front must keep
clear minds and fully understand their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
He asked them to continue to attach importance to management
and quality, and do their best to make every launching a
successful one, thus making great contributions to the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wu watched the launching this morning at the center.
</P>
<P>
Dongfanghong-3 is a newly developed communications satellite
with 24 C-band transponders. Its life span is about eight
years. The launching was done by means of a China-made Long
March-3a rocket.

<HEADLINE> RCRC Appeals for Aid to Iran's Earthquake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies appealed on Sunday for an urgent
aid of 12 million Swiss francs (about 8.5 million U.S. dollars) to
victims of a strong earthquake in eastern Iran.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter
scale rose to nearly 2,400 on Sunday. The earthquake injured about
6,000 people and destroyed some 200 villages in the Khorasan
region, leaving around 60,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The federation sent a representative on Monday to Iran to
coordinate aid activities. "Rapid action should be made to help
those survivors," said Under Secretary-General of the federation
Ms Margareta Wahlstrom. "With no shelters, survivors will suffer
more in a temperature lower than zero centigrade."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Switzerland sent a nine-member rescue team and dogs
trained for rescue to help search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday, an earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale
struck Iran's north-western cities of Ardabil and Nir, according
to the official IRNA news agency.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Palau Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that China is ready to work with Palau to lay a solid
foundation for the development of their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting Palau President Kuniwo
Nakamura, Jiang said that the promotion of the relations between
the two countries is not only in the interests of the peoples of
the two countries, but also beneficial to peace and stability
in the South Pacific region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the stable political situation and booming
economy in the region provide a favorable opportunity for furthering
cooperation and common development between the countries there.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that at the turn of the new century China,
together with countries in the South Pacific, including Palau, is
ready to make contributions to the stability and prosperity of the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Chinese government and people always
support Palau's reasonable demand for the end of trusteeship,
realization of independence and the achievement of the status of an
equal member of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Since the two nations are both developing countries, there is
no conflict of interest between them, Jiang said, adding that
developing their economies and improving their peoples' living
standard are common tasks of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said that China's hospitality and remarkable economic
achievements have deeply impressed him.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the high-ranking delegation he has led to China
demonstrates the great importance his country attaches to China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed thanks for China's support for Palau's efforts to
achieve independence, adding that he was convinced that the
bilateral ties, including two-way trade, would see constant
development.

<HEADLINE> Former PAC President Continues in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) President Clarence Makwetu was back in his
parliamentary office today despite an internal disciplinary
committee decision at the weekend to expel him from the party.
</P>
<P>
Seated behind his desk in the PAC's parliamentary wing,
Makwetu told reporters that he is waiting for an official
notification from the party's National Executive Committee (NEC)
before deciding whether he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
"Until then I will continue in Parliament," said Makwetu.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Frene Ginwala's office said the PAC had yet
to inform Parliament of Makwetu's expulsion.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the constitution, a member of parliament loses his
seat on expulsion from the party he represents in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu was expelled from the party by the disciplinary
committee on Sunday after being found guilty of three charges
relating to allegations that he has divided the party, created
factions, and violated the party's oath of allegiance which
states that a member will accept party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu lost the presidency to former Methodist Bishop Stanley
Mogoba at the PAC's National Conference in December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu's supporters claim the elections were
unconstitutional and have refused to accept the party's new
leadership, triggering a crisis in the PAC which culminated in
disciplinary action against Makwetu.

<P>
The two leaders also agreed to release all the civilian

</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at their face-to-face meeting at the

Sharif and then Indian prime minister Narasimha Rao met also on
the sidelines of a summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to form different working groups
on various subjects which will be identified by their foreign
secretaries.

<P>
"The talks are very useful and constructive," Nawaz Sharif told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to continue our talks," he said, without elaborating
on the date of the next meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are personal friends. I like this man very much," said a
smiling Nawaz Sharif, patting the shoulder of Gujral.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Gujral and Nawaz Sharif exchanged a olive
branch in their respective speeches at the inaugural session of
the ninth summit of SAARC.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will add another milestone in further enhancing the
cooperation and good-neighborly relations between the two
countries," said Gujral.
</P>
<P>
"I value my friendship with Nawaz Sharif and I hope it will
open a new era in our bilateral relations and SAARC cooperation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan is determined to continue the
process of dialog with India "so that all outstanding issues can
be comprehensively addressed".
</P>
<P>
"With sincerity and resolve we can overcome these problems and
establish good neighborly and cooperative relations," he added.

The concert, to be held in Fuzhou, capital of east China's
Fujian Province and Lin's hometown, will be part of the activities
nationwide to celebrate Hong Kong's return to the motherland July 1.
</P>
<P>
"People will certainly think of Lin Zexu when celebrating Hong
Kong's return," said Chen Zhanghan, chairman of the Fuzhou Federation
of Literary and Art Circles.
</P>
<P>
The concert, which will present patriotic poetry written by
Lin, will be the first one ever in China to extol Lin, a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
Composer Luo Jichao, who has been studying Lin's poetry for 12
years, composed all the songs to be sung at the concert. Tian
Lihua will conduct the concert.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zexu (1785-1850) was a Qing Dynasty official. He was
appointed imperial envoy to stamp out the opium trade being
conducted by British merchants in south China.
</P>
<P>
Lin confiscated over 20,200 chests of opium, or nearly 1.2
million kg, which was then destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The British government launched a war against China in June
1840 under the pretext of protecting British businessmen. The war,
known as the Opium War, resulted in the signing of the Treaty of
Nanjing, which forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: No Alternative for Stalled Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 12 (Xinhua) - There is no alternative yet for the
stalled Middle East peace process, said an official here today
after Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali and the U.S. special envoy
Dennis Ross concluded a close-door meeting in the prime minister's
office.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan still will do its best to help put the peace
process back on track, said Minister of State for Information
Affairs Samir Mutawe.
</P>
<P>
Ross' Amman stop came after he held talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat but scored no progress for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan helped bring about the signing of Hebron accord in
January between Israel and the Palestinians, according to which
Israel will withdraw troops from Hebron and other parts of the
West bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks came to a halt in
March after Israel started to construct a new Jewish neighborhood
at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Gheim) on the southeastern outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross, on his third shuttle diplomacy in the region in less than
two months, is scheduled to go to Egypt soon in an attempt to seek
help for reactivating the deadlocked peace process.

<HEADLINE> Hanson's Political Agenda, Morally Wrong: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer tonight described Independent MP Pauline Hanson's
political agenda as dumb and morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is federal leader of the National Party, said in
an ABC TV interview, that his party "has no common ground in terms
of jobs with Pauline Hanson, because her dumb agenda would wreck
jobs, wreck our export efforts to Asia".
</P>
<P>
"It is a dumb agenda, it's morally wrong, but it's also a dumb
agenda in that 50 billion Australian dollars (38.9 billion U.S.
dollars) of exports Australia has to Asia, would be placed in
jeopardy," the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government agreed with Hanson there should be more
efficiency in allocation of funds for Aboriginal health and
education, and a lower immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the government had already lowered the immigration
intake.
</P>
<P>
Hanson has advocated an end to immigration and criticized aid
to Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
She had drew strong condemnation during the past few days from
Prime Minister John Howard, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
other senior government officials for her policies of anti-Asian
immigration and anti-foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Downer told some Australian ambassadors to Asia early this
month that the policies of Hanson would "cripple Australia in its
economic and political relations" with Asia, would cost Australia
tens of thousands of jobs if they were ever to become official
Australian policy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the government would fight and
destroy Hanson's ideas, which were based on fear and ignorance.

</P>
<P>
He said SAARC should also step up political cooperation as a

<HEADLINE> Tourism Employs 11 percent World Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 million people, or 11
percent of the global workforce, were either directly or
indirectly employed in the hotel, catering and tourism industries
in 1995, according to a report of the International Labor
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The ILO report, to be presented at a tripartite meeting which
opened here today, said the figure is expected to rise to about 340
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
About 80 delegates representing workers, employers and
governments gathered here today for a four-day tripartite meeting
on improving working conditions in the hotel, catering and tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said in the report
that the tourism produced 10.9 percent of the world's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and contributed 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars
in wages and salaries.
</P>
<P>
WTTC said by the year 2010, tourism, measured in terms of
international arrivals, is expected to double to more than one
billion. Forecasts of international tourism suggest the fastest
growth in East Asia and the Pacific, followed by South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that low wage growth, overtime,
irregular working hours and the part-time or seasonal nature of
much hotel, catering and travel work lead to high levels of
employee turnover, which is "certainly one of the most important
difficulties faced by employers and employees alike in the sector".

will provide more opportunities for overseas investment, according
to Zhang Hongxiang, deputy governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here this morning, Zhang said that
with Hong Kong's return to the motherland, he believes that more
and more Hong Kong investors will turn their attention to Central

</P>
<P>
The press briefing was held for a five-day trade fair starting
from Tuesday.

<P>
Zhang said that Hubei Province is expecting overseas business

According to Zhang, there are now 6,000 overseas-funded
enterprises in Hubei with 2,800 already going into operation. The
total overseas investment in the province has reached 3.8 billion

The deputy governor said that there is still broad room for the
overseas investors to develop business in Hubei.
</P>

listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the next few months to
absorb more funds to expand infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises include some engaged in power industry and in
the management of high-grade highways which have been completed as
well as Dong Feng Motor Corporation.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of Dong Feng Motor Corporation Gao Mingxiang
said on the occasion that his company is now under re-adjustment
so as to meet the requirements for a company to be listed
overseas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Businessmen Confident in HK's Economy in Future: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A latest survey conducted by a
Hong Kong newspaper demonstrated a considerable rise in foreign
businessmen's confidence in Hong Kong's economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the two-months-long survey by the
Chinese-language newspaper Hong Kong Commercial Daily were
released here on Monday, which marks the 50th day on the countdown
of Hong Kong's handover to China at midnight on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
A 1996 study by the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong
showed that 98 percent of the British businessmen interviewed in
the survey said they would stay in Hong Kong in the year 2000.
And 70 percent of them had planned to expand their business in the
three years to come, which showed a solid confidence on Hong
Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Hammerbeck, Executive Member of the Board of the
Chamber, said that it was more important for Hong Kong to maintain
its status as an international financial center rather than
changes, if any, brought about by the handover.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now handles 75 percent of China's transit foreign
trade and it is widely believed that Hong Kong will remain, after
the handover, as a springboard to China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
As regards the issue of Most Favored Nation status granted to
China, Hammerbeck said that it is Hong Kong that suffers most if
such status is revoked.
</P>
<P>
A government prediction showed that, if China is not granted
the MFN status, Hong Kong's trade total would decline by six to
eight percent, which means a direct loss of 24 to 34 billion HK
dollars (3.07 to 4.35 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mitsuoka Hideyuki, an official of the Economics Department of
the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong now
enjoys an optimistic economic foundation before the handover.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong witnessed a rising trend in personal consumption last
year and the inflation rate, one of local residents' major
concerns, had been withheld a relatively low level of 6.4 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
An economic increase in 1997 of 5.5 percent has been predicted,
against just 4.7 percent registered in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
If the concept of "one country, two systems" and "high degree
of autonomy" is applied concretely after the handover, no one
could predict any major change in the Japanese-Hong Kong economic
relations, Hideyuki added.

<HEADLINE> Wang Guohua Wins Weightlifting Gold with World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lifter Wang Guohua lifted a world
record weight to take the gold medal of the men's weightlifting 54-kg
category at the second East Asian Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guohua, national champion in 1996, snatched 150 kilograms to
set a new world mark, beating his own world record of 148.5 kilograms
by 1.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
After lifting that weight in the snatch, Wang Guohua continud his
his dominance in the clean and jerk, in which he had 150 kilograms in
the first attempt.
</P>
<P>
With gold medal in the category in hands, he asked 175 kilograms in
his second try. If he have had lifted that weight, he would set a new
Asian record in the total. But unfortunately, he failed twice on that
weight.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guohua, with a total of 300 kilograms from two lifts, defeated
Liao Hsing Chou of Chinese Taipei and Hwang Eui Youl of South Korea to
the second and third.
</P>
<P>
The victory would bring back self-confidence t Wang Guohua for
future competitions as the Olympian failed three attempts in the
snatch in Atlanta last summer.
</P>
<P>
"He has the strength, what he needs is international competitions
experience," said Chinese weightlifting headcoach Yang Hanxiong.
</P>
<P>
"We have predicted that he would set a new world record in the
snatch," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the last Olympic Games, Wang Guohua was the only Chinese lifter
who did not have results in the total.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 70-kg division, Chinese Atlanta Olympics gold medal
winner Zhan Xugang won the title with ease, collecting a total weight
of 330 kilograms from snatch and jerk. Kim Hak Bong of South Korea
had the silver at 317.5 and Vassiliy Pozyomin of Kazakhistan won the
bronze at 310.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 50-kg and 54-kg divisions, Chu Nan Mei and Kuo Ping
Chun, both from Chinese Taipei, notched up the titles at 180 and 187.5
kilograms respectively.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Punish Terry-Builders of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government warned here
today that it will punish any contractor of government
establishments and buildings which collapsed due to negligence in
the killer earthquake Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rasoul Zargar, head of the Natural Disasters Headquarters of
the Interior Ministry, said that those who were found neglecting
the building codes and standards will be reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
The official made the statement while inspecting the
devastations caused by the quake in east Iran. The quake measuring
7.1 degrees on the Richter scale killed 2,400 people and injured
6,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Zargar said that one of the causes behind the collapse of
government buildings in southern Khorasan province was that the
contractors of these buildings did not build them quake-resistant.
</P>
<P>
Many government buildings in various villages of Dar Mian
district of Birjand, such as rural health centers, schools and
administrative centers, were flattened in the quake.
</P>
<P>
The official said that scores of houses reconstructed in 1989
also collapsed since they were not up to the technical standards.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,500 houses were destroyed in Birjand and Qaen, the
epicenter of the earthquake which hit eastern Iran Saturday,
about 800 kilometers east of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's special envoy
Jalil Besharati today met a group of people wounded in the deadly
earthquake at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Besharati paid some money to every wounded person on behalf of
the president and allocated 500,000 rials (about 160 U.S. dollars)
to every person who has lost a relative.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operation has been under full swing in 180 villages by
100 teams consisting of 2,000 relief workers along with four
C-130 aircraft and six helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale is
the strongest earthquake that has ever occurred in Iran for the
past eight years. A 7.3-degree quake claimed 40,000 lives in
northern Iran on June 21, 1990.
</P>
<P>
It is the third strong earthquake within four months this
year. A total of 965 people were killed and more than 2,600
wounded following the deadly earthquake which rocked Ardebil
region in northeastern Iran on February 28.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today rushed to the quake-hit city of Birjand, east
Iran, after suspending his six-day overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the Iranian
president cut short his visit by two days to Turkmenistan and
flew directly to Birjand from Ashkhabad.
</P>

<P>
The report said that the 64-year-old president will go to
another quake-hit region of Qaen, where more than 2,000 people
were killed and thousands of others injured.
</P>
<P>
An official close to Rafsanjani said that the president has
been closely following the quake-related developments and the
relief operations.
</P>
<P>
After the death toll of the quake increased, the president

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Norwegian FM Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today exchanged views with visiting Norwegian Foreign Minister
Bjoern Tore Godal on the crisis-ridden Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
told reporters that Norway, which tops the list of donor countries
which offer assistance to the Palestinian National Authority, is
keen on saving the stalled peace march.
</P>
<P>
Godal spoke at the meeting about his country's role in the
peace process and ways to salvage it in addition to bilateral
relations, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"Norway sees that Israel's settlement activities do not go in
line with the peace process and the settlement policy should come
to a halt so as (that) the peace march may continue," Moussa
quoted the Norwegian minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that Godal's meeting with Mubarak is aimed at
exchanging views, rather than raising Norwegian proposals on the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister said that the peace march could only
be saved through a halt to settlement operations and a sincere
implementation of the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Godal, who arrived here Sunday, will leave later today for
Damascus, then head for Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas
to complete his multi-leg tour of the region, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli accord in January on Israeli withdrawal
from Hebron has given the peace process a boost but since then the
momentum has been lost. The Israeli construction of a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March has plunged the process
into a two-month crisis.
</P>
<P>
Norway was a mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo peace
accords in 1993, which have become a cornerstone of the whole
peace process.

MALE, the Maldives, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral said here today that his country heartily
endorses Pakistan's initiative to hold bilateral talks with India
at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the inauguration of the ninth SAARC
(South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) summit just
before his face-to-face meeting with his Pakistani counterpart
Nawaz Sharif, Gujral said the recent convincing mandate enjoyed by
Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan helped usher in a new era.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a cause of encouragement for India," he said.
"We are also encouraged that Nawaz Sharif has committed to the
process of dialog to normalize relations with India."
</P>
<P>
"Today's meeting will add another milestone in further
enhancing the cooperation and good-neighborly relations between
the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I value my friendship with Nawaz Sharif and I hope it will
open a new era in our bilateral relations and SAARC cooperation,"
he added. "I welcome Nawaz Sharif's statement."
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the opening session of the SAARC summit,
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan is determined
to continue the process of dialog with India "so that all
outstanding issues can be comprehensively addressed".
</P>
<P>
"With sincerity and resolve we can overcome these problems and
establish good neighborly and cooperative relations," he said.
"The dividends of success will be enormous not only for Pakistan
and India but also for the entire SAARC region."
</P>
<P>
Gujral and Sharif are expected to hold a face-to-face meeting
over lunch on Kurumba Resort Island, the first meeting between the
prime ministers of the two countries since April 1993, when Nawaz
Sharif and then Indian prime minister Narasimha Rao met also on
the sidelines of a SAARC summit in Dhaka.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Gymnasts Take Team Title at East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese top-notched women gymnasts
outclassed their peers from South Korea and Japan to win the team
event with dominating momentum at the second Pusan East Asian Games
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese collected an accumulated total of 188.698 points for
the top honour, while the host South Korea bagged home the silvers on
178.437 and Japan finished the third on 176.849 points.
</P>
<P>
All the event-highest scores were awarded to the Chinese women as
Ji Liya netted the day-highest score of 9.775 points in the uneven
bars, Liu Xuan got 9.750 in the beam, and Ji Liya recorded 9.650 in
the floor exercise and 9.637 in the vault horse.
</P>
<P>
"Our gymnasts had displayed their prowess in both vault horse and
uneven bars, we are stronger than the others and deserve the gold
medals," said Gao Jian, deputy Chef de Mission of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Four Chinese entries surpassed the score of 9.750 in the uneven
bars and the top six marks were swept by the Chinese gymnasts in the
vault horse.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad that all our gymnasts had performed their new routines
and exploited the games as a whetstone for the upcoming World
Gymnastics Championships to be held in August in Switzerland," said
Gao.
</P>
<P>
"Failures including those of our top-class athletes have been
foreseen prior to the games as new rules were introduced for a
four-year period starting from 1997 by the International Gymnastics
Federation," said the official who is in charge of the sport in China.
</P>
<P>
Mo Huilan, silver medalist in vault horse and individual
fourth-placer in the Atlanta Olympic Games, failed to stand up firmly
in her landing from the beam, and Liu Xuan, the eldest one in the
squad at the age of 18, slipped off from the uneven bars as the first
Chinese gymnast competed in the first apparatus.
</P>
<P>
However, "we still felt that Liu had her best performances as a
veteran athlete in the later events, including an event-high score of
9.750 points in the vault horse," said Qian Kui, team manager of the
Chinese gymnastic squad.
</P>
<P>
"We have won the title as expected, but not in a satisfying manner,
because of the new rules which reduce the difficulty merits in an
abrupt pace," said manager Qian.
</P>
<P>
The new rules which resulted in new routines for the gymnasts,
explained the high frequence of failures and numerous drops at the
gymnastic arena, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"A team that made eight-plus errors is surely to be eliminated from
the podium in the world-class competitions," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of three or four top gymnasts from Japan who are
preparing for the World Championships, South Korea stole the second
place from its chief rival in the nine-day games, the Chinese team
manager said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Affected by Industrial Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing sector in
Malaysia recorded the highest number of fatal industrial accidents
with 63,700 cases in the past two years, seriously affecting the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), according to a government
official today.
</P>
<P>
This means there are 31 industrial accidents for every 1,000
workers and the fatal industrial accidents in the sector have
reduced the country's GDP by 3 to 4 percent, Deputy Human Resource
Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir said today at a national
seminar on Occupational Safety And Health Management at Bangi,
about 30 kilometers south from here.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, 1,167 workers died in industrial
accidents in 1995, of whom 437 were from the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of industrial accidents could be reduced
through efficient occupational safety and health management, which
would increase productivity and profits.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar focused on identifying ways to reduce
industrial accidents.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production Index Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Industrial
Production Index for March rose 2.7 percent to 145.4 from 141.6 in
February, which was also an increase of nine percent in comparison
to 133.4 in March 1996, the Statistics Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Production Index is a measure of the rate of
change in the production of industrial commodities over time.
</P>
<P>
The index of the manufacturing division rose 12.9 percent from
134.1 to 151.4, the electricity division rose 15.6 percent from
133.0 to 153.8 and the mining division rose 2.1 percent from 122.4
to 125.0, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing division, 17 out of 23 major groups
recorded higher indices for the first quarter of 1997 over the
same 1996 period, with plastic products, not elsewhere classified,
registering the biggest leap of 40.8 percent from 130.0 to 183.0,
it said.
</P>
<P>
In the electricity division, the rise in the index was due to
the increase in the generation of electricity from 11,270 million
kilowatt-hours for January-March 1996 to 13,025 million
kilowatt-hours (15.6 percent increase) for January-March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The contributor to the rise in the index of the mining division
between January-March 1996 and January-March 1997 was the increase
in the index for natural gas (14.5 percent) from 168.6 to 193.1.
</P>
<P>
However, the index for crude oil and tin dropped 1.5 percent
from 113.2 to 111.5 and 23.2 percent from 55.7 to 42.8
respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, six major groups -- footwear, miscellaneous
products of petroleum and coal, wearing apparel, beverage
industries, machinery except electrical, and professional and
scientific and measuring and controlling equipment -- registered
lower indices in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the decline was lower production of leather
footwear, lubricating oil, blouses, soft drinks, calculators and
cameras, it said.

<HEADLINE> Rare Strong Leonid Storms to Be Observed Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The strongest Leonid storms in the
world in the past 30 years are expected to be observed in November
of 1998 and 1999 in the eastern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The Purple Mountain Observatory attached to the Chinese Academy
of Sciences announced that it will be the first time for the
countries in the eastern hemisphere including China to see the
strong Leonid storms since the beginning of this century.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xin, Deputy President of the observatory, said, the Leonid
storm could shoot several hundreds or even tens of thousands of
meteors each hour. At that time, the shooting stars will look like
a dance of firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the meteor storm will not cause direct harm
to ordinary people on the earth. However, they can constitute a
threat to the space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Leonid storms could also have influence on
ionization status and other physical conditions of the earth's
upper atmospheric layer.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xin said the Tenple-Tuttle Comet, producer of the Leonid
storm, has an orbital period of 33 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the peak hour of the Leonid storm will be 02:00 hour
(Beijing Time) on 18 November, 1998. The best observing region
will be the western Pacific region and east Asia area.
</P>
<P>
The following peak hour will be 08:00 hour (Beijing Time) on 18
November, 1999. The best observing regions will be central and
western part of Asia and eastern tip of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said if the sky is clear, people can observe the magnificent
scene in places without urban lights.
</P>
<P>
The previous three meteor storms in this century all happened
in the western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Dai said, the meteor storm is a rarer seen phenomenon than the
bright comets or total solar eclipse. So far, scientists are not
able to make very exact prediction of the meteor showers.
</P>
<P>
The US-based Leonid Shower ILW, an international organization
established in 1991, has arranged for the worldwide joint
observation of Leonid storms in the coming years.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan province in southwest China
lifted more than 30,000 handicapped people out of poverty during
the past few years by providing them jobs in welfare enterprises,
according to Tan Yulin, an official of the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is a populous inland province. About 3.5 percent of its
83 million residents are handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
To create more job opportunities for the handicapped poor, the
local government collected funds through various means and built
up more welfare enterprises, said Tan.
</P>
<P>
The government also granted favorable policies, such as
reducing or even cancelling taxes, to those enterprises, where the
handicapped people make up a large proportion of the employees.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the province received 6.4 million
yuan worth of loans for poverty-relief from the central
government, and granted six million yuan of supplementary funds to
carry out rehabilitation and poverty-relief projects for the
handicapped, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
Tan said, to date, the province has built more than 1,800
welfare enterprises, providing jobs for 47,000 poor handicapped
people. The average annual income of the handicapped in the
province has reached 3,500 yuan.

ago is capable of producing 700,000 tons of finished products
annually.
</P>
<P>
The products are currently for the local construction industry
but Perwaja Steel plans to export them to neighboring countries.

Perwaja Steel and Universiti Technologi Malaysia (UTM)
(Technology University of Malaysia) today signed an agreement for
the establishment of a steel technology center in the country,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Holds Talks with Palau President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China attaches
importance to the development of its relations with Palau, and is
willing to make joint efforts along with Palau to enhance
understanding and trust, and expand exchanges and cooperation, so
as to raise bilateral relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark during talks with President of the
Republic of Palau Kuniwo Nakamura, who arrived here last night to
visit China at the invitation of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome, Qian said that Nakamura is the first Palau
president to visit China since Palau gained independence, adding
that this visit will contribute to promoting mutual understanding
and developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his thanks for Palau government's message of
condolence sent to China after the death of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura expressed his pleasure at visiting China for the first
time, saying that his delegation is the most senior one of his
country ever sent abroad after Palau's independence, which is
aimed at strengthening mutual understanding between the two
peoples, and expressing their admiration for China's rich culture
and rapidly developing economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the visitors will also exchange views with Chinese
leaders on issues of common interest, adding Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that although China and Palau are far away from each
other, they have a long history of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
China, as one of the permanent members of the Security Council
of the United Nations, actively supports the ending of trusteeship
and the entrance into the UN of Palau, Qian said, adding that the
Chinese government and people are glad to see Palau as a new
member of the big international community.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that although there are no diplomatic ties between
China and Palau so far, the two sides have increasing political
and economic cooperative links, and bilateral economic and trade
cooperation has had a good beginning, which can be demonstrated by
some cooperative projects in fishery and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
Expressing appreciation of China's support for Palau's
independence, Nakamura said that in the three years of Palau's
independence, Palau-China relations have been continuously
strengthened, and there have been more personnel exchanges between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Chinese investment in Palau, Nakamura voiced his
belief that Palau-China relations, especially bilateral economic
and trade cooperation, will continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Palau does not have "diplomatic relations"
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian appreciated Palau's "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to its relations with island countries in the south Pacific
region, and China has diplomatic ties with nine countries in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has conducted reciprocal cooperation with ten
countries and regions in the area, as well as regional
organizations like the South Pacific Forum, which has promoted
common development of the economies of China and south Pacific
countries, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that in the past few years, the relations
between China and the island countries in the south Pacific area
have been continuously consolidated and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
As an Asia-Pacific country, China sincerely hopes to continue
to strengthen its friendly cooperation with south Pacific
countries, added Qian.

<HEADLINE> Central China City to increase Overseas-Backed Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Huanggang City of Hubei Province has
approved the establishment of 203 overseas-invested businesses in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, these businesses have a combined
investment of 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Located on the northern bank of the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River and the middle of Beijing-Shenzhen (Kowloon) Railway
Line, Huanggang has many geographical advantages.
</P>
<P>
These include 15 ports that have been constructed along the
Yangtze, capable of handling ships and boats up to
 5,000 dwt (dead weight tonnages); more than 300 km of operational
railway lines; and 8,000 km of operational highways.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-backed enterprises of the city generated 700 million
yuan (84.3 million U.S. dollars) and earned 500 million yuan (60.2
million U.S. dollars) from sales in 1996, including some 20
million U.S. dollars in earnings from exports.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Liu Youfan told reporters that the city would concentrate
efforts to promote investment in areas along railway lines,
especially near train stations, and to advance industrial
development in these areas this year.
</P>
<P>
To materialize the plan, the city has made thorough
preparations for an investment promotion and publicity program
that will be held in Hong Kong this month. The forthcoming event
will give publicity to over 80 local investment projects and help
overseas investors better understand the city's investment
environment, according to the mayor.

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents earned 6,885 yuan
last year, less than those in Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to
the city's statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents spent 83 percent of their income on living
expenses, the lowest rate of the three cities and also lower than
Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an, other
major cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that among the nine big cities, Beijingers are
the greatest consumers of vegetables -- 143 kilograms for an
average Beijinger. And they have one of the lowest rates of pork,
beef and mutton consumption. Beijing ranks the seventh in
consumption of poultry meat in the nine cities.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches National Plant Genome Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Ministry of Science
and Technology has started a new national plant genome project
with the aim to upgrade more staples, according to a recent
report of the Weizmann Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
Virus-resistant and herbicide-tolerant rice and slow-to-ripen
tomatoes are among the familiar products of the age of genetic
engineering, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The march of new transgenic foods to the supermarket shelves
depends on closing the gap between plant research at academic
institutions and the technologies available to plant breeders,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Robert Fluhr, the coordinator of the
project at the Weizmann Institute, the project is aimed at
removing the main "bottleneck" blocking the development of new
transgenic crops: the isolation and characterization of genes.
</P>
<P>
It offers seed companies and plant breeders the much-needed
research technologies and expertise that will enable them to
produce plants with higher nutritional value, better resistance
to disease and other much desired properties, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
The project involves scientists from the Weizmann Institute,
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Israel Institute of
Technology of Haifa. Possible joint research with the neighboring
Arab countries is also under consideration, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Current activities in Israel include studying genes affecting
leaf shape (a characteristic that enables plants to adjust to
specific climatic conditions), endowing tomatoes with resistance
to various diseases, and producing more color varieties in
tomatoes and other plants.
</P>
<P>
The project offers plant breeders a precise genetic map of
the tomato, "libraries" that contain plant genes into plant
cells.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project offers access to unique research
tools, such as the pencil-sized mini-tomato plant that carries
the so-called "jumping genes."
</P>
<P>
These genes "jump" along chromosomes, causing mutations, such
as different colors and shapes of leaves and fruit, and can be
used to isolate genes with specific functions. The mini-tomato's
diminutive size turns a greenhouse into the research equipment of
a several-acre field.

<HEADLINE> Israel Faces No Immediate Threat to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- None of Israel's enemies is
currently threatening the existence of the Jewish state after 49
years of independence, Israeli army Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an special interview with Israel Radio on the 49th
anniversary of Israel's independence, Shahak said this was
because "Israel is a strong country with a strong army and strong
economy."
</P>
<P>
"No doubt that in its 49th anniversary, Israel is a strong
country that knows how to defend its citizens. But it still needs
a very strong defense force," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Shahak acknowledged that Israel is still facing many
challenges both at home and abroad: Israeli economy and society
still face problems and divisions, Hezbollah forces in south
Lebanon are also threatening the stability of northern Israel, and
Syria has not made peace with Israel. But he added all these could
not threaten the existence of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Talking about future threat to Israel's existence, Shahak
singled out the potential nuclear threat posed by Iran, which he
said is actively seeking to acquire the nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
"If Iran, for example, 10 years from now (acquires such
capability), it will threaten not only Israel, but also the
stability of the region and the world peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to make efforts to
check this development. "Therefore, all the world should do its
utmost to prevent Iran from achieving this kind of capability," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On peace with Syria, Shahak said that even at the time when he
was appointed the chief of staff two years ago when Israel was
conducting peace talks with Damascus, he was cautious against
optimism about a quick solution.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel and Syria should build mutual confidence before
sealing peace, and Israel should make sure that Syria will pose
no threat to Israel after the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
However, Shahak remained optimistic about the prospects for
making peace with Syria in the long term. "We have to discuss what
the meaning of the peace with Syria (is), and I think it is
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shahak's remarks were apparently more optimistic than those
made a day earlier by his deputy Matan Vilnai in an interview
with The Jerusalem Post. Vilnai said Israeli army was preparing
for increased prospect of war with Syria, which is threatening
Israel with long-range missiles and nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have remained suspended since early
last year, fueling speculation that Syria could launch a sudden
attack against Israel in order to achieve political gains.
</P>
<P>
While Israel has repeatedly called on Syria to resume the
peace negotiations, Syria insists Israel first promise a
full withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights before such
talks.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Host African Anti-Mine Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to host a
three-day anti-personal mines conference in Kempton Park of
Johannesburg this week, the local daily "the Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, expected to be attended by delegates from
across the continent, is organized by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), in cooperation with the South African government,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming conference aims to identify opportunities for
mine-clearance and victim-support on a regional basis, in an
attempt to achieve a total ban on the destructive weapons.
</P>
<P>
It will also pledge to provide tangible and practical
indicators, against which progress towards a mine-free continent
can be measured.
</P>
<P>
The OAU will monitor the implementation of such a plan, the
continent's first real offensive on anti-personal mines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa has already taken the lead in Africa
by its announcement in February this year that it would ban the
production of anti-personal land mines and immediately begin the
destruction of its 160,000 mines.
</P>
<P>
A ban was also placed on the export of the weapons from South
Africa in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Joe Modise said in February that about 2,000
people were maimed or killed by landmines across the globe every
month.
</P>
<P>
There are about 120 million mines in more than 70 countries
at present, said the International Committee of the
Red Cross, an organization that has spearheaded the anti-mine
campaign around the world.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, only 16 countries have imposed a total ban on
mines.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Plans to Use US$30 Billion Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
set a goal to attract a total of 30 to 40 billion US dollars of
overseas investment by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the use of overseas funds will account for
one-third of the provincial total investment in fixed assets in
the year 2000, compared with one-fourth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, more than one billion US dollars
of overseas investment will go to local transportation facilities
projects and two billion US dollars for developing the power
sector. The use of overseas investment is expected to help upgrade
local telecom and urban construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Inflow of the funds is also expected to help the province
develop high-yield and export-oriented agriculture, and optimize
the sector's structure.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu will increase cooperation with overseas investors in
the local leading industries of electronics, chemicals, machinery,
automobiles, and service trade.

KAMPALA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A huge boat exploded on the
Ugandan waters of Lake Victoria on Saturday, burning about
100,000 liters of fuel and other merchandise on board, reported
the local daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The boat caught fire after a safe landing at Nalugala on Lake
Victoria, about 9 km from Entebbe Town near Kampala, the paper

<P>
The burnt boat, which was abandoned, carried two fuel tankers
estimated to be about 60,000 liters each, 20 drums of petrol and
cooking oil from a Kenyan port, a local Ugandan police officer
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, any death on board has not yet confirmed, the paper
said, adding that the police suspect the disaster was caused by a
generator that was used to siphon fuel from the containers into
waiting trucks which drove off immediately after the incident.

Michael Jordan's 27 points and Scottie Pippen's 26, held off
Atlanta 89-80 in their Eastern Confereance semifinls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win gave the defending NBA champions a 3-1 lead in the
four-of-best series. Chicago can advance to the conference final
by winning game five at home Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pippen scored 13 points in the first quarter as the Bulls
pulled away early, leading 55-42 at half-time and 75-53 entering
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Jordan added 10 points in the fourth quarter, including four in

</P>
<P>
Christian Laettner scored 21 points and Steve Smith added 16
for the Hawks, who have never advanced to the Eastern Conference
final since the format began in 1970.
</P>
<P>
In another Eastern game, Patrick Ewing had 25 points, 11
rebounds and a key block as the New York Knicks beat the Miami
Heat for a 77-73 home victory and a 2-1 lead in their
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
In the west, Rookie Matt Maloney's 3-pointer with 36 seconds
left in overtime lifted the Houston Rockets to a 110-106 victory
over the Seattle SuperSonics Sunday and a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets-SuperSonics game saw 21 ties. Maloney's eighth
3-pointer provided the 25th and final lead change, bombing from
the top of the key to give Houston a 108-106 lead.

</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler scored 16 points and Mario Elie and Kevin Willis
added 12 apiece for the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Ewing atoned for a turnover with his big block of
Tim Hardaway's potential game-tying 3-point attempt.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks had a 3-point lead and possession when Ewing was
double-teamed, lost the ball, recovered it but fell along the
sideline with 13 seconds left. After a timeout, Miami worked the
ball to Hardaway, but Ewing jumped out and blocked the shot.

<HEADLINE> Nong'an County Leads China In Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nong'an county in northeast Jilin
Province is China's largest county-level grain producer.
</P>
<P>
The county produced 2.5 billion kg of grain last year,
accounting for over a two-hundredth of China's total grain output
among more than 2,000 counties or county-level cities, and scored
a record high in farmers' per-capita income by 2,677 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Farmers attributed the growth to increased efforts by local
government in improving rural infrastructure and services for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 674 sq km of waterlogged lowland in the
county, and 150,000 people in the area suffered from crop failures
twice in every five years.
</P>
<P>
So the county raised 12 million yuan and organized a labor
force of 160,000 last year to dredge or dig canals for better
drainage, and increased 50 million kg of grain as a result.
</P>
<P>
Nong'an invested 17 million yuan into building 64 km of highway
last year, in a bid to encourage farmers to engage in farm
products processing and transportation, as well as diversified
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
To date, the county's grain purchase department has bought
820,000 tons of farmers' grains at market price, which alone has
added 164 million yuan to farmers' pocket.
</P>
<P>
The county also sent 320 officials to help 600 poor families in
109 villages to boost production, and aided them with 140,000 yuan
in loans, 1.23 million tons of chemical fertilizer, and started
432 poverty relief projects.

India is understood to have field-tested the multiple

This means that India now has the technology to divert the path

Dhaka, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Dhaka Stock Exchange
(DSE) Council Imtiyaz Hossain was removed from his post Sunday by
the members of the council through a no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The DSE Council at a meeting Sunday replaced him with M. A. Huq
Howlader, a long time DSE member having postgraduate education and
training in securities trading at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Imtiyaz Hossain, under growing pressure for his resignation for
the past few months, walked out of the meeting and threatened
legal action against the move.
</P>
<P>
"Only a three-fourth majority of the general members can
impeach the chairman in an extraordinary general meeting. What the
council members did was totally illegal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Imtiyaz Hossain, who was elected Chairman in 1995 for a
two-year term, has been stranded in this country's biggest-ever
stock scandal in recent months.
</P>
<P>
He, with some other noted DSE members, was formally charged by
the Securities and Exchange Commission last month with
manipulating share prices through fraudulent means during the bull
run last year. The bubble burst quickly last December and made
huge losses to a large number of small and new investors.
</P>
<P>
A capital market expert welcomed the decision taken by the DSE
councilors and said this move would help restore the badly-needed
confidence of the financial market.
</P>
<P>
However, stock prices continued its bearish trend Sunday in
lackluster trade marked by a thinner turnover. The benchmark DSE
all share price index fell 17.88 points, or 1.62 percent, to
1083.79 with declining issues outnumbering gainers by a large
margin.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Ponders Tax Cut Instead of Wage Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is considering
to cut personal income tax rather than a wage rise for civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said the government would
later this month review the proposed 5 percent pay rise for civil
servants this year, as there are dangers associated with it.
</P>
<P>
He said on Sunday that workers also want their wages increased
and that many others do no have jobs. This can be harmful for the
entire economy, which is poorer than forecast.
</P>
<P>
Personal income tax cut, which could be extended to low-income
earners, would benefit a greater number of people, Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
Surasak Nananukul, an economic adviser to the prime minister,
said Chavalit had scrapped the pay rise plan for the civil
servants, because the government does not have the money for the
scheme, as it has had a 44-billion baht (1.76 billion US dollar)
shortfall in tax revenue during the first six months of this

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that despite considerable progress in
preparing a charter on Russian-NATO relationship, the two sides
still have some unresolved issues.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview this evening, Primakov did not
specify the unresolved issues, but he said they are mainly
concerning military and political problems.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he is not sure if the charter will be signed on
May 27 as announced recently by President Boris Yeltsin. The issue
will be decided when NATO secretary-general Javier Solana visits
Moscow on May 13, he said.
</P>
<P>
The charter will be a binding document to be signed by the
leaders of all NATO members, said Primakov, adding that the
charter can not be a non-binding "declaration".

<HEADLINE> Preparation Underway to Block Yangtze for Three Gorges Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Preparatory work is being carried out
to pave the way for shipping after the Yangtze River is blocked
for the construction of a gigantic dam for the Three Gorges
Project later this year, according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration invested
over 28 million yuan to build a number of infrastructures
including local shipping administrative bodies and telecom
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Special regulations on navigation during the construction of
the second phase of the massive dam have been formulated by the
authorities, so as to safeguard a smooth shipping during the
river-blocking period.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Hydroelectric Project is the largest of its kind
in the country. High hopes have been pinned on it to generate a
huge volume of needed electricity for the surrounding industrial
cities, promote the river-transport industry along the Yangtze
River, and to improve the river's capacity against flooding.

BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh will oversee economic affairs to shore up confidence
in the government's handling of the economy and to ease criticisms
against the finance and commerce ministries.
</P>
<P>
There would be daily morning meetings with various state
agencies to discuss economic measures, Chavalit told reporters on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would only play a supervisory role over
economic affairs, but would not take power away from those in
charge of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chart Pattana Party led by former prime minister Chatichai
Choonhavan, the second largest party in the coalition government,
and the opposition, are reportedly unhappy with the way the
economy is being run, and demand some ministers such as Finance
Minister Amnuay Virawan and Commerce Minister Narongchai
Akrasanee, to resign over their failure to tackle the economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
Even though the prime minister was optimistic about Thailand's
economic situation, citing "good economic fundamentals," he
expected economic growth to drop to five or six percent this year,
from about 6.8 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Concentrated Natural Reserves Group Grows in Mountain Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The rise of nature reserves in the
Qin-Ba Mountain Area in the middle part of China has made the
place one of the most important bases for China's crusade to
protect wild life.
</P>
<P>
Of the ten demonstration nature reserves being constructed
jointly by China's Ministry of Forestry and the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) across China, six are located in this area.
</P>
<P>
Composing two mountain ranges, the Qinling and Bashan, the
Qin-Ba mountain area is the geographical border between the south
and the north in China. It is home of such rare species as giant
panda and snub-nosed monkey, and has one of the country's richest
and diversified biological resources.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the late 1970s, a number of natural reserves
including Foping, Zhouzhi, Niubeiliang, Taibaishan, and
Shennongjia were established in this area.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a new national natural reserve named Changqing was
established there, and experts believe some 80 giant pandas are
getting better protection as a result.
</P>
<P>
The Shennongjia National Natural Reserve in the Bashan mountain
now protects the only primary forest remaining in middle China. It
is one of China's 40 top natural reserves of world importance, and
has been listed by the UNESCO as part of the world human and
bio-sphere protection network.
</P>
<P>
"After being chosen as a GEF-aided demonstration reserve, our
reserve has made significant progress in both wildlife protection
and resource management," said Zhang Quanyi, director of the
reserve administration.
</P>
<P>
Also a GEF-aided demonstration area, the Foping natural reserve
in the Qinling mountain is the northernmost distribution region
for giant panda. According to the latest survey, the density of
giant panda in Sanguanmiao, the reserve's core area, is 0.48 per
sq km, the highest in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Two trade delegations from
Queensland, Australia, are going to visit China later this month,
a senior state official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Doug Slack, Queensland's economic and trade minister, said a
Queensland government-led trade mission, a business forum and
other activities organized to celebrate the sister state
relationship between Queensland and Shanghai presented enormous
opportunities for the state's businesses.
</P>
<P>
Queensland exports to China in 1995-1996 were valued at 425.8
million Australian dollars (331 million US dollars) with exports
to Hong Kong worth 354.7 Australian dollars (275 million US
dollars), the minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Hong Kong to China, which will occur just
six week after their trip, the combined market of the Chinese
mainland and Hong Kong will be Queensland's third largest overseas
market, Slack said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the combined market provides opportunities
for a range of products in the state's key sectors, including
fresh and processed foods, tourism and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
Queensland, which covers 1.73 million square kilometers, is one
of Australia's leading producers of grain, wool, meat and sugar,
and rich in mineral resources, including coal, aluminum, gold,
copper, silver and oil. The state's tourism industry receives
about half of three million overseas tourists to Australia
annually.
</P>
<P>
The mission is going to visit Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, and Shenzhen, a boomtown bordering Hong Kong,
during May 17-24.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a North Queensland delegation, led by Mark
Stoneman, the representative of Queensland's Premier, would visit
Shanghai, Nanjing, capital of the economically prosperous Jiangsu
province, Changshu city of Jiangsu, and Hong Kong during May
12-23.

which has greatly inspired people in other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the development in China is turning China into a jiant
in a forest of nations, which will make the world order more just
and fair.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria and China share the view that people in various

development and that outside interference should be opposed.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria highly appreciates that China has always upheld
justice and safeguaded the rights and interests of developing
countries internationally.
</P>
<P>

the experiences gained by China, and the visit to Nigeria by the

China bilateral ties and international issues so as to push
bilateral cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Abacha reiterated that his government will resolutely and
unswervingly pursue its "One China" policy. "We are willing to

Hong Kong by the Chinese government," he said.
</P>

the U.N. Charter, opposing hegemonism and power politics,
opposing aggression and outside interference, and making untired
efforts in accelerating the process of world multipolarization to
establish a new, just and fair international order of peace and
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The world will not have peace and development without the
efforts of developing countries, Li Peng said.

unity and cooperation with them.
</P>
<P>

bilateral relations have gained smooth development since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between them in 1971. Now
bilateral economic and trade cooperation as well as cultural
exchanges are expanding and traditional friendship between the two
countries are being further deepened, and Nigeria has now become
China's third largest trade partner in Africa, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the two countries will
continue to build up mutual understanding, develop their
friendship and cooperation, and join efforts in safeguading the
rights and interests of developing countries so as to contribute
to making the world one of peace, stability and thriveness.

<HEADLINE> Some Filipino Workers in Malaysia to be Sent Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Some undocumented Filipino workers
in Malaysia will be repatriated beginning June but it remained
unknown how many of the 30,000 Filipinos working there will be
affected.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that the Filipinos were given six
months by the Malaysian government to legalize their stay in
Malaysia, but so far, the Philippine Embassy had issued only about
8,000 passports.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia launched a campaign against undocumented foreign
workers in the country last year. As a result, the Philippine
government sent Kuala Lumpur earlier this year a diplomatic team
to grant passports to those illegal Filipino workers there.
</P>
<P>
"We are now on an all-out campaign trying to reach out to the
Filipinos who still are not aware of the legalization program,"
Jose Brillantes, Philippine Ambassador to Malaysia, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Brillantes confirmed there would be Filipinos to be repatriated
as early as June, but he did not know how many.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has six million overseas workers in at least
100 countries and regions around the world. However, two million
of them are undocumented workers who illegally slipped out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (77-78) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (77-78) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will lawyers, accountants and engineers in Hong Kong
be required to re-register after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong has always maintained a fairly strict
professional system. Individuals who want to enter professional
practice as lawyers, accountants and engineers must obtain
certificates of qualification from related professional
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Individuals applying to join respective professional
organizations or associations must hold credentials of
professional education or training recognized by these
organizations or associations, and must have practical experience
and pass related professional examinations.
</P>
<P>
This professional system will remain basically unchanged after
1997.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government of the Hong Kong SAR will
formulate provisions on its own for assessing the qualifications
for practice in the various professions.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Hong Kong SAR will continue to recognize
the professions and professional organizations recognized prior to
the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, and these organizations
may, on their own, continue to assess and confer professional
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Persons with professional qualifications or qualifications for
professional practice obtained prior to the establishment of the
Hong Kong SAR may retain their previous qualifications in
accordance with relevant regulations and codes of practice, and
need not apply again.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will government policies concerning subventions for
social welfare organizations be abolished? Will staff members of
related organizations lose their jobs?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The government of the Hong Kong SAR will continue to
implement Hong Kong's previous policy of supporting
non-governmental organizations providing welfare and social
services.
</P>
<P>
People previously serving in the related organizations will
remain employed in accordance with the previous system. Volunteer
organizations providing social services in the Hong Kong SAR may,
on their own, decide their forms of service in accordance with
law.

housing project. And the cost has been cut by 800 to 1,300 yuan
per sq m of housing space.

<HEADLINE> Name Brand Textile Producers Win Major Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the nation's
biggest commercial bank, provided 455 million yuan in loans to
support several local name brand textile producers early this
month.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth sum of special loans the bank has extended
to the first-class performers in local textile industry, a bank
branch official said.
</P>
<P>
To provide bank loans to major textile manufacturers is a major
step to boost sales volume of the name brand textile products. For
example, one yuan of bank loan previously provided by the bank
resulted in an increase of four yuan in sales turnover of such
products.
</P>
<P>
The Hailuo Group, a quality shirt-producer in the city, boosted
its sales earnings by 130 million yuan last year after receiving
35 million yuan in special loans from the ICBC Shanghai branch.

<HEADLINE> Deep Blue Beats Kasparov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The IBM supercomputer beat Garry
Kasparov to creat chess history that the first time a programme
has won over a reigning world chess champion.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov gave up after only 19 moves and just more than an hour
of the sixth and final game.
</P>
<P>
The humbled grandmaster apologised for his performance and said
he was "ashamed" but persisted with his view that the match was
essentially unfair because he had no access to the computer's
pre-match games or any of the IBM printouts during the contest,
worth 700,000 U.S. dollars to the winner and 400,000 U.S. dollars
to the loser.
</P>
<P>
Deep Blue, improved and modified from the one that lost to
Kasparov in Philadelphia in February 1996, pushed the champion to
psychological limits in this match that few of his human
challengers in recent years have accomplished.
</P>
<P>
In six games played over nine days, the system won two, drew
three and lost one -- the opening encounter on May 3 -- for a
final match score of 3.5 points to 2.5 points. One point is
awarded for a win and a 0.5 point for a draw.
</P>
<P>
Deep Blue's match win was the first by a chess-playing computer
in a traditional format in which games can last as long as seven
hours.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, 34, said he would play the system again only if the
match had a neutral sponsor. IBM sponsored the event and the money
the computer won will go back into the company's parallel
processing project.

<HEADLINE> Deep Blue Defeats Kasparov in Chess Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Deep Blue IBM computer won the
final game with world chess champion Garry Kasparov in the
six-game chess match between man and machine.
</P>
<P>
The final score was 3.5 points for the computer and 2.5 points
for Kasparov. The 34-year-old Russian and the computer split the
first two games, then played to draws in Games 3, 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov resigned after the computer's 19th move in Game 6.
Some chess masters said he resigned at a time when it seemed that
the black didn't look lost.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference later, Kasparov appeared to be in low
spirit and complained about IBM's intention to invent a machine to
beat him purposely.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov had beaten an earlier version of the computer in
Philadelphia in February 1996. Since then, IBM engineers have
upgraded the machine, which can now examine twice as many
positions per second, or 200 million.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said that the victory of Deep Blue does not mean
that machine is more intelligent than man. Even the IBM experts
admitted that there is a long way to go for the human beings to
create things with artificial intelligence, which can think as
man thinks.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov said before this match that man would always beat the
machine.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov gets 400,000 U.S. dollars for his loss. If he had won,
he would have taken home 700,000 U.S. dollars. IBM, which staged
the match and put up the purse, will put the winning stake toward
continued research.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
has been the largest supplier of live cattles for Hong Kong and
Macao for the last eight years, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Cattles sold to Hong Kong and Macao come from Hebei's northern
area where there are a large area of grasslands with no pollution,
and meanwhile, a strict system has been adopted by local
authorities to check animals for exports.

<P>
On average, each cattle weighs over 450 kg and is aged three to
four years, with a meat rate of 43 percent and above.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Hebei has provided Hong Kong live
cattles for a dozen years, while Macao has been a new destination
in such exports since 1991. In 1992, the province started exports
of live cattles to Arabic countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Nigerian Head of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and Nigerian
Head of State General Sani Abacha today hailed the smooth
development of bilateral relations while enjoying identical views
on major international issues.
</P>
<P>
In their talks held in Nigeria's capital Abuja this afternoon,
the two leaders promised to promote the bilateral relationship as
a model of friendly cooperation between developing countries so
as to meet the challenge of the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Premier Li Peng's official visit to
Nigeria, Abacha commended Li Peng's trip, the first by a Chinese
premier, as an evidence of the solid friendship between the two
countries. He believed Li's ongoing visit would be a success.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the Chinese government and people harbor friendly
sentiments towards the Nigerian government and people.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties, they have
achieved major developments in their cooperation in areas of
political, economic, trade and foreign affairs, and the cultural
and educational sectors, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier noted that the two countries, while
enjoying identical or similar views on major international
issues, have been understanding and supporting each other in
the international theater.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to its sincerely friendly relations
with Nigeria, and to Nigeria'a role in African and international
affairs, said Li Peng, adding that China wishes to join efforts
with Nigeria to push the bilateral relations to new heights.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Africa belong to the developing world and their
common desire has been to maintain peace and seek development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China holds to establish "new peaceful, stable, just and
equitable international political and economic orders," said Li
Peng. To this end, China wishes to strengthen its unity and
cooperation with Nigeria and other African countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said Nigeria appreciates China's policy on Africa and
other parts of the developing world, noting that the relations
between China and Africa are based on mutual trust, mutual
understanding, mutual respect and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"China is a reliable friend of Africa," said Abacha, adding
that Nigeria upholds the "one-China" policy and will not conduct
any official links with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral trade and economic ties, Li Peng said the two
countries could expand their cooperation in areas of housing,
transport, power generation, petroleum, water conservancy,
fishery as well as iron and steel industries.
</P>
<P>
Li said it should be guaranteed that Projects in these aspects
yield good efficiency to benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that new experiences could be accumulated from the
Sino-Nigerian economic relations to benefit China's economic and
trade ties with other African countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the purpose of his ongoing seven-country Africa
trip is to explore new ways and channels in developing
Sino-African trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
All the countries he had visited during the trip, he noted,
agreed with what he had proposed.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the reform of the United
Nations. China supports the reform of the U.N., which Li said
should give full consideration to the interests and needs of the
developing countries and take into account the requirement of the
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a developing continent and its voice should be
reflected in the U.N. reform, Li stressed.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israel Entering Era of Recognition by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu said today that Israel has entered an era of
recognition by its Arab neighbors nearly 50 years after
independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the state memorial service held at Jerusalem's
Mount Herzl for Israel's fallen soldiers, Netanyahu said the
Jewish people had come a long way in the past 50 years from the
time when they could not defend themselves in face of Nazi
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this has changed because Israel is now not
only an independent state, but also a state with growing
technological power and bustling economy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier added that Israel is slowly achieving the
acceptance by its Arab neighbors nearly 50 years since
independence in 1948.
</P>
<P>
But he attributed the Arab recognition of Israel's strength
and its army's ability to defend the country to the hope for
peace.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio on the eve of the 49th
anniversary of Israel's independence, Netanyahu talked about the
prospects for the peace with the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the current efforts by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross on
reviving the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, he cautioned
against optimism about immediate results from Ross' visit. "I
think it's going to take some time and it is not happening
overnight," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hardline Netanyahu blamed the PNA for causing the deadlock
in the peace process, accusing it of failing to honor its
commitments to the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that while Israel has honored its commitments by
redeploying troops in Hebron, releasing Palestinian women
prisoners and transferring money, the PNA failed to change the
Palestinian Charter calling for destruction of the Jewish state,
jail the extremist leaders and stop incitement of violence.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the peace process could only be resumed on
what he called the principle of "reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would accept a Palestinian state in the
final settlement, Netanyahu indicated that he could only do so
if Israel could retain some sovereign powers, such as controlling
the airspace and restricting Palestinian weapons, in order to
ensure Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Once again, he vowed to keep all the Jewish settlements built
in the Palestinian territories and to protect their "natural
growth."
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of resuming peace talks with Syria,
Netanyahu said he would test Damascus' sincerity in renewing the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If the Syrians are sincere in resuming negotiations, they
will find Israel a ready partner to do so," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the Israeli-Jordanian peace relationship as a model
for all Israel's Arab neighbors. Jordan currently solved a water
crisis with Israel through negotiations instead of exerting
pressures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty to serve as a
model for others, the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese, that
they have much to gain from peace with Israel, and they have
nothing to gain from continued conflict, including political
conflict, with the Jewish state," Netanyahu said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Have Nil Budget Deficit, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti state budget will hit
the nil level shortly, according to a statement by Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Nasser Abdullah Al-Roudhan.
</P>
<P>
The statement released during today's National Assembly session
dedicated for discussing the country's economic situation said
that "the budget deficit average drop will continue or even
vanish completely according to this year's financial statements."
</P>
<P>
It predicted 3.2 billion dinars (10.56 billion U.S. dollars)
total revenues and 4.3 billion dinars (14.19 billion U.S. dollars)
general expenses, or a deficit of 3.63 billion U.S. dollars, 264
million or 6.6 percent below the 1996-97 deficit.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the state budget deficit had been
decelerating in the last three years and the target set by the
government to eradicate the deficit by the end of this century
would be realized comfortably.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for "centering on production and
realizing a positive government saving to cap the budget deficit
and the economic reform program objectives" and rationalizing
public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
It also called for reinvigorating the country's non-oil gross
domestic product and strengthening the private sector performance.
</P>
<P>
The 3.2 billion Kuwait dinars revenues projected in 1997-98
fiscal year draft budget recently approved by the government is
200 million dinars higher than estimates in the current year.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues, which account for around 80 percent of the state
income, for 1997-98 fiscal year starting July 1 are projected to
be at 2.56 billion dinars (84.32 billion U.S. dollars), just 3
million dinars less then estimates in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government adopts oil prices at 13 U.S. dollars a
barrel as the basis for calculating revenues. Kuwait, having
about 10 percent of the world proven oil reserves, exports about
two million barrels of crude oil per day.
</P>
<P>
The budget also proposed to increase non-oil revenues by
more than 40 percent during the coming fiscal year, generating
as much as 645 million dinars (2.13 billion U.S. dollars)
from non-oil sources, mainly increase and imposition of charges
and fees on public services.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil revenues in the current fiscal year, which ends
June 30, are estimated at 442 million dinars (1.459 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The draft budget also envisages a 25 percent drop in military
spending, the first time Kuwait expects to cut military
expenditure since the Gulf War. Kuwait had decided to spend 12
billion U.S. dollars in military reconstruction in a period of 10
years after the war.
</P>
<P>
The budget did not give specific figures of the military
expenditure, believed to be a major item in the budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today dispatched an
urgent humanitarian relief aid to victims of the powerful
earthquake that jolted Iran, the official Kuwait News Agency said.

severe earthquake since 1990 when a quake claimed the lives of
more than 40,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) based in Saudi Arabia today also urged its
member states and the Islamic charity authorities to extend
urgent aid to Iran.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Finalize Cyprus Talks Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
is expected to call direct talks between the Greek and Turkish
communities in Cyprus soon after a visit to the region by
U.N. Under-Secretary for Political Affairs Sir Kieran Prendergast,
starting from this week.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Annan's Resident Representative
in Cyprus Gustave Feissel on his return from a two-week trip to
the U.N. headquarters of New York during which he attended a
meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council on the Cyprus' issue.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said Kieran, who arrives in Cyprus Wednesday, will have
meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash Thursday and Friday before going to
Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of all that, I would expect the
Secretary-General will then make his final decision with respect
to direct talks," the U.N. official told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Kieran is expected to prepare a report to the U.N. chief after
his return to New York, later this month, from his tour in the
region, which will take him to Nicosia, Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N. Security Council meeting, Feissel
described it as "good," and said that all expressed their full
support for the U.N. secretary-general's efforts on Cyprus issue
and support for direct negotiations between the two leaders by
the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The objective remains, needless to say, to have these direct
talks within the next couple of months," he explained, noting
that nothing specific was decided in New York.
