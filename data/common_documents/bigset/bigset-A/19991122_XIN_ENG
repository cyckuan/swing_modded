<HEADLINE> Egypt Doubles Exports to Other COMESA Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt doubled its exports to
eastern and southern African countries in the first half of 1999
after its entry into a regional economic bloc, the minister of
economy and foreign trade said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since Egypt joined the Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) last year, its exports to other COMESA members
rose to 27.3 million U.S. dollars in the first two quarters of
1999, Youssef Boutros-Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told an Egypt-COMESA symposium organized by the
private sector that the figure showed an increase of 14.1 million
dollars, or about 107 percent, from Egypt's exports in the same
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade volume between Egypt and other COMESA members
increased to 106.5 million dollars in the first two quarters of
1999, compared to 78.2 million dollars in the same period of 1998,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the rise to Egypt's accession to the
COMESA as it stipulates the cut of tariffs by 90 percent last
year, a move to ensure freer movement of goods among member states.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is to host the first summit of the COMESA in February to
support the group's efforts to promote economic growth and present
the world business community African countries' investment
opportunities, Boutros-Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
He called on COMESA members to abide by the group's agreement
on revoking all customs in October 2000 to forge economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a free trade area will be formed by then
among the 22 COMESA members, which have 380 million people and
138-billion-dollar gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Russian Federal Troops Tighten Grip on Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Sunday the Chechen
capital of Grozny has been 80 percent encircled by the federal
troops and that the rebels in the city are preparing for all-out
defense.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said there would be no
let-up in the offensive against rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no pauses. We will continue the way we have been
doing," Putin said late Saturday in an interview with ORT
television.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate goal is to eliminate all terrorist bases and all
conditions for their revival in the future over the entire
territory of the Russian Federation, of which Chechnya is a part,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces continue to advance through the Achkhoi-Martan
and Urus-Martan districts to lock up Grozny on the southern flank
as rebel formations are trying to pull back to the southern
mountainous districts of Chechnya, where they are building winter
bases and equipping arms and ammunition depots, the Interfax news
agency said, citing military sources.
</P>
<P>
There are 5,000 to 6,000 rebels remaining in the city, the
federal troops' headquarters in North Caucasus said.
</P>
<P>
Despite poor weather, federal fighter jets continued their
missions over Chechnya, targeting the outskirts of Grozny, Bamut,
and the villages of Kharachoi, Gansol and Gikalovsky.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday alone, Su-24 frontline bombers and Su-25 attack
planes flew 50 sorties against rebel formations there.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mi-24 combat helicopters flew 32 bombing missions
against rebel bases.
</P>
<P>
Artillery and aerial raids have destroyed rebel positions
outside Bamut, the district center of Urus-Martan, the city of
Argun and other populated areas mostly in the south of Chechnya,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched over seven weeks ago in the
wake of armed incursions by Chechen rebels into neighboring
Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings that killed some 300
people in Moscow and two Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 Chechen refugees have fled to neighboring areas,
but as the areas controlled by federal troops increase, more
refugees are returning, reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Emergencies Ministry, 196,315 refugees
remain in Ingushetia, North Ossetia, Daghestan and the Stavropol
territory, while another 21,085 have returned to their homes.
</P>
<P>
There have been mounting Western pressure on Moscow to ease the
military campaign, but Russian leaders have defended the actions
as a struggle against "bandits and international terrorists."
</P>
<P>
At the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) in Istanbul, Turkey, last week, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin told Western countries that they have no right to
criticize Russian actions.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops have now gained control of over 40 percent of
Chechen lands and law enforcement units are combing the liberated
areas to flush out rebels and locate ammunition depots left behind
by rebels.

<HEADLINE> WFP Offers Emergency Aid to Drought-Stricken Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program has
decided to send immediately 23,688 tons of flour to 329 sheep
raisers who were stricken by drought in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The consignment of relief aid amounts in value to 5.5 million
U.S. dollars, the Arab Syrian News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The move comes in response to a study conducted by the Syrian
State Authority on Planning in cooperation with the Ministry of
Agriculture and Agrarian Reform. The study was examined by a
committee belonging to the WFP and U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The emergency aid was aimed at providing the sheep raisers with
food for the coming six months to improve the food security in the
rural areas stricken by drought in Syria. Most of the victims are
small sheep raisers who depend on this craft to earn their living.
</P>
<P>
This year's rainful has been scarce, only 35 percent of that
for a normal year. This caused pasture to wither and thus more
deaths among sheep.
</P>
<P>
In September the WFP offered 875 tons of flour to Syria, to be
rationed out to 17,000 families of small sheep raisers in remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is the leading international organization concerned
with hunger combat worldwide. In 1998 the program helped 75
million people to survive.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for U.S. Intervention in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Sunday urged U.S. intervention and
pressure on Israel to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the appeal after an inspection tour of the Future
Hospital in Al-Beira, according to the Palestine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process, should
throw its weight behind the implementation of Oslo, Wye River, and
Sharm el-Sheikh accords as well as other Palestinian-Israeli
documents, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators ended a new
round of talks, without progress, in Jerusalem to settle the
dispute over the maps of the second Israeli troop redeployment in
the West Bank under the Sharm el-Sheikh deal signed in September.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator to the interim talks Saeb Erekat
said the Sunday talks were a failure and urged the United States
to step in and settle the Palestinian-Israeli dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted that the 5 percent Israeli
redeployment should include Arab-populated and contiguous areas,
and that it should have a say in the future on which area should
be handed over to Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it should solely decide the maps of withdrawal from
the West Bank, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast War and
pledged to cede under the land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
During the latest visit paid to the Palestinian self-rule areas
by Dennis Ross, the U.S. envoy for the Middle East peace process,
the Palestinian side urged the Washington to exert pressures on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. envoy said the talks between the two sides
should be solved by the two sides themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, met
here on Sunday with South African President Thabo Mbeki to discuss
ways of further developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries has laid a solid foundation for further promoting
bilateral ties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries hope to build a just and rational
international political and economic order and their cooperation
will benefit the long- term mutual interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed Mbeki on the Falun Gong cult and Chinese
government's policy towards this issue, saying the cult has
threatened the social stability in China.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also talked about the Tibet issue. Li briefed
Mbeki on the history of Tibet and the current situation there.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said South Africa attaches great importance to developing
 relations with China. The relationship between South Africa and
China, he said, has developed smoothly and there are no disputes
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa and China, both as developing countries,
should join hands to safeguard the interests of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The current international economic order benefits developed
countries much more than developing countries, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated China on its recent agreement with the United
States on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
saying China's participation would strengthen the role of
developing countries in the organization.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the second leg of Li's six-nation Afro-Asian
tour which will also take him to Kenya, Israel, Palestine and
Oman. He has already visited Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Journalists Sentenced for False Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Journalists of Belgium's
French-speaking magazine, Le Soir Illustr, have to pay damages of
one million Belgian Francs (25,640 U.S. dollars) to state
policeman Patrick De Baets.
</P>
<P>
A local media report said this was decided earlier this week by
a Brussels court. The two reporters said in their news stories
that the policeman had manipulated the investigation into the
files about the so-called X-witness.
</P>
<P>
The files concern a young woman who last year claimed to have
more information about the well-known Dutroux child sex and murder
case. The team of De Baets worked on the X-witness file and was
removed from the case later.
</P>
<P>
The two reporters also wrote that De Baets had sabotaged the
investigation by drawing up forged reports. During legal
procudure, the judge says this is incorrect, and has put De Baets
in the right. The court also said that the journalists did not
thoroughly investigate the matter before publishing it.
</P>
<P>
It is said that this is one of the severest sentences ever with
regard to journalists in Belgium.

U.N. sanctions should be lifted to put an end to the sufferings of
Iraqi people, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM Calls for More Japanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid on Sunday called on Japanese investors to capitalize on
Egypt's favorable investment environment and contribute to its
major projects.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Egyptian-Japanese
Business Council, Obeid said Egypt has a lot, including its
political and social stability and strategic geographical
location, to offer to Japanese investors.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to benefit from the low cost of Egypt's natural
and human resources in various spheres and to cooperate with
Egyptians in modernizing agricultural, industrial and services
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Egypt seeks to build an economy that rests on technological
development and market mechanisms and to raise the living
standards of its people, Obeid said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is carrying out national projects in Suez, Sinai and the
southern new valley and welcomes Japan's investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Japan has given economic aid to some of Egypt's major projects,
including the development of the Suez Canal in the 1970s,
construction of the Opera House in Cairo and a children's
hospital. It is assisting Egypt in the construction of bridge
across the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
But its investment in Egypt remains at a low level, with only 8
million U.S. dollars in 31 ventures, Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Obeid voiced confidence in the growth of Egypt's
economy, saying that its success has been attested by various
international economic and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has managed to reduce the budget deficit to less than 1
percent of the gross domestic product, the lowest rate in 50
years, and paved the way for the private sector to assume the key
role in the development process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's economy is expected to grow at 6 percent this year and
it will grow at 7-8 percent in the next two years, he said.

LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Pro-British Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble insisted on Sunday the latest Northern
Ireland peace deal was the best possible as he steeled himself for
a battle to persuade his fractured party to approve it.
</P>
<P>
All eyes are on Trimble in the run-up to a meeting on Saturday

Some within his party oppose the peace formula that would allow
a coalition government for the British province to go ahead before
the Irish Republican Army hands in its weapons.

<P>
"I am confident I will get support, but we will know better on
Monday when we have completed the first survey of delegates," the

He said there was no alternative because the opponents against
this move did not have one.

be recalled on November 29 and ministers nominated.

London would formally hand over power on December 2.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Cooperation among OPEC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday called for cooperation among member states of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in
boosting oil prices and developing economy.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation, understanding and progress of OPEC members is a
source of security and stability at regional and international
levels, Khatami told visiting Venezuelan Minister of Energy and
Mines Ali Rodrigez.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Venezuela for its cooperation with other OPEC
members in solving oil price crisis in the recent two years when
oil prices plunged into the lowest level in 20 years, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, OPEC members reached agreement on oil
production cuts to prop up flagging oil prices. The effort proved
successful in raising oil prices from around 10 U.S. dollars per
barrel to some 25 dollars per barrels on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez invited Khatami to attend the
OPEC summit in Venezuela's capital Caracas, and Khatami has
accepted the invitation and hoped to hold talks with Chavez on oil
cooperation as well as bilateral, regional and international
issues in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the OPEC Caracas summit would without doubt
be a turning point in the development of member countries in the
field of economy at the international level.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the need to protect and strengthen the
accords reached among OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Rodrigez, for his part, said that Venezuelan officials are
interested in expanding relations with Iran, adding that the two
countries can cooperate in all fields, including oil.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan minister on Sunday also held talks with Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on ways of boosting cooperation
within OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Rodrigez said that the Venezuelan government is fully
determined to carry out its pledges to OPEC to reduce oil
production.
</P>
<P>
"We fully support the OPEC policy which if maintained then,
the international oil market will witness more stability," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi highlighted continuation of the policy of cutting oil
production to strengthen and stabilize oil prices, and said that
if OPEC can become a pivotal power and play a determining role in
the international arena, its upcoming summit in Caracas would be
successful.

TEHRAN -- Iran reopened its border with Iraq at Khosravi
checkpoint in the western province of Kermanshah Sunday morning,
to allow Iranian pilgrims to visit the holy sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After a ceremony at the checkpoint, 800 Iranian pilgrims
crossed into Iraq on their way to pilgrimage to the holy sites in
the country, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Iranian pilgrims will visit Iraq every week after
the reopening of border, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq border was closed last December following air
raids carried out by U.S. and British aircraft against targets in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, Iran and Iraq signed an agreement under which
each side sends 3,000 pilgrims every year to the other for visit
to their holy sites. This was regarded as a progress in the course
of improving relations between the two decade-old foes. (Iran-

<HEADLINE> Negotiators Fail to Solve Israeli Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators failed to solve their differences on Israel's second
troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat on Sunday met here
with his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran for four hours to discuss
the issue of further Israeli troop withdrawal, but both sides
refused to compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has asked Israel to hand over some
"municipal territories", but the Israeli side will never agree to
do so, Eran told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The "municipal territories" mean some areas east of Jerusalem,
said Israeli officials close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that the Israeli side refused to re-think about
the West Bank territories slated for further handing over to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side will continue to fight for a "say" in
deciding which areas of the West Bank will be transferred to it
and that is the basic right the signed agreements stipulated to
the Palestinians, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the redeployment issue, Sunday's talks also touched
upon the opening of the northern safe passage, the third Israeli
troop redeployment and the next release of Palestinian prisoners
from Israeli jails, but no decisions were made.
</P>
<P>
As for the redeployment dispute, the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) is opposed to the redeployment lines mapped out by
Israel and is insisting on receiving a contiguous stretch of
territory of the West Bank, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal signed in Egypt in September, Israel has
to hand over another 5 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
self-rule during the second stage redeployment on November 15.
</P>
<P>
But the troop withdrawal has been delayed after Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat refused to sign the redeployment maps
presented to him.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has insisted that redeployment must produce geographic
contiguity and certain Arab-populated areas in the West Bank must
be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said that Israel has the sole right to decide
from which territory to pull back its troops, refusing to change
its mind on re-evaluating its position.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have met several times on the issue, but no
progress has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Releases Arrested Hamas Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government
Sunday decided to release 25 members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas who were rounded up during a month-long clampdown.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made upon orders from King Abdullah Bin
Hussein to pardon, in a goodwill gesture to the Palestinians, the
Hamas members who had been charged with conducting illegal
activities in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"The case of Hamas is now considered closed after His Majesty
the king decided to pardon all of the group's activists," Prime
Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh told reporters after a parliamentary
session.
</P>
<P>
Four of those released Hamas leaders were being sent to Qatar,
apparently to live in exile, after talks between King Abdullah and
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani over the Hamas
issue.
</P>
<P>
Well-placed sources said the four men, all Jordanian citizens,
are Hamas political chief Khalid Mashaal, spokesman Ibrahim
Ghosheh, political bureau members Izzat Rushoq and Sami Khater.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested with 21 other Hamas members during a
Jordanian government campaign starting from late August to
restrain the group, which opposes the peace process between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came as a preemptive measure by Jordan to contain
Hamas activities in the kingdom at a time when Israel and the
Palestinians are holding final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Hamas still calls for a holy war to liberate all territories
occupied by Israel and it had claimed responsibilities for
several deadly attacks on Israelis during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king had defended the government's action, but
called for a political solution to the Hamas issue in a goodwill
gesture to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Amman has been actively promoting the Arab-Israeli peace
process after it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The arrested Hamas members had been charged with participating
in illegal activities, including illegal possession of arms and
conducting anti-Israeli campaigns in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of support for the Palestinian cause, Jordanian
officials said the arrests were not aimed at Hamas itself, but
rather dealt with Jordanian citizens who took part in an illegal
foreign organization.
</P>
<P>
All of the arrested Hamas members were Jordanian citizens.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that Hamas would be banned in Jordan in the
foreseeable future as Amman is under mounting pressure from the
United States, its main donor country, Israel and the Palestinian
authorities to rein in the militant group.

<HEADLINE> Israel Hit by Worst Water Shortage in Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Environment
Minister Dalia Itzik Sunday called for the government to declare
a nationwide state of water emergency as the country with scarce
water resources faces its worst drought in nearly 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The government should take emergency measures to deal with the
current severe situation and launch massive purification treatment
of wasted water for agriculture, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Echoing her remarks, Foreign Minister David Levy said Israel
"must import water from Turkey immediately" to resolve the
worsening water crisis.
</P>
<P>
A newly-formed ministerial committee on water convened Sunday
to continue its deliberations on the continuing drought and water
crisis. Several proposals were discussed at the meeting, the
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Already two months into the winter season, Israelis are still
waiting for a major rainfall. The water level of the Sea of
Galilee in the north, the major water resource for the country,
has dropped 19 centimeters below the red line of 213 meters below
the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the water level is likely to fall further
in the coming weeks if the dry and hot weather goes on.
</P>
<P>
Water Commissioner Meir Ben-Meir told Israel Radio that the
allocation of water for agriculture might have to be cut by up to
40 percent and an education campaign should be immediately
launched to urge urban citizens to save water.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the Water Commissioner's Office decides the
distribution of water to various sectors. Water supplies to some
farms have been cut because they have exceeded their water quotas.
</P>
<P>
In his proposal to the ministerial committee, Ben-Meir called
for the establishment of more sewage treatment plants in order to
increase the amount of recycled water for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
In the last 25 years, Israel has enjoyed the reputation of
having the highest efficiency all over the world in recycling the
sewage. In the southern Negev desert and some other areas,
recycled sewage has replaced fresh water as the major source of
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Meir said Israel has to obtain additional water through
desalination in the long run, but he said the committee did not
discuss the project at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Experts say even if the government gives an immediate go-ahead
to the seawater desalination project, it will take about two
years before the first drop of fresh water comes out.
</P>
<P>
Besides essential for the daily life, water is also a
strategic resource in this semi-arid region. Analysts said it
might become an explosive issue if it is not deal with properly.
</P>
<P>
Israel angered Jordan early this year after it attempted to
cut by half the annual quota of water it should provide to Jordan
under their 1994 peace treaty citing severe drought last winter.
</P>
<P>
Water is also a key issue in the final-status talks
between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel controls 80 percent
of the water sources in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The average annual per capita water use in the West Bank and
Gaza is 3,290 cubic feet, compared to 12,040 cubic feet in Israel,
according to a report published by an international team of
scientists earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, from Israel, the Palestinian areas, Jordan,
the United States and Canada, said freshwater supplies in the
Middle East now are barely sufficient to maintain a quality
standard of living due to population growth and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
They urged countries in the region to work together to
resolve the potential crisis.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ruling Party Elects New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's ruling People's
Democratic Party (PDP) Sunday elected Barnabas Gemade as its new
chairman to replace Solomon Lar.
</P>
<P>
Gemade netted in 1,828 votes in his favor, doubling the number
his main rival Sunday Awoniyi could manage to secure.
</P>
<P>
The voting was taken in a PDP National Convention, which
started Friday in the capital city of Abuja with more than 3,000
PDP delegates from all over the country participating in.
</P>
<P>
"I will uphold the dignity of the party and be a responsible
leader," Gemade pledged in a speech following his victory.
</P>
<P>
Gemade, who was from Nigeria's central region, had been
Chairman of the former Congress for National Consensus, one of the
five lawful political parties under the rule of late military
dictator Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The successful conclusion of Sunday's election without rancor
is a testimony to the patriotism of the national leadership of the
party, said President Olusegun Obasanjo in a address at the end of
 the election.
</P>
<P>
Although Obasanjo did not openly back any candidate, experts
said that he favored Gemade over Awoniyi for the former's ethnic
origin is less controversial.
</P>
<P>
Gemade came from Tiv, an ethnic minority in central Nigeria,
while Awoniyi is a Yoruba with the same ethnic origin as Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
A leader from an ethnic minority is easier to be accepted by
party members from Nigeria's dominant ethnic groups, namely
Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba and Ibo, than one from any of the three
groups.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo does not want to be accused of favoring kinsman with
key appointments, experts said.

<HEADLINE> FM: Russia Thwarts Attempts to Weaken Russia Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Sunday that President Boris Yeltsin's forceful
presentation at the summit of th organization of Security and
Cooperation of Europe (OSCE) last week dealt a strong blow to
Western attempts to weaken Russia over Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's speech dashed expectations of some Western
politicians that Russia would make excuses for the military
campaign in Chechnya and seek compromises on essential problems,
Ivanov said in an interview with the ORT television.
</P>
<P>
At the summit last week in Istanbul, Turkey, Yeltsin said the
West had no right to criticize Russia for its efforts to
"liquidate bandits and international terrorists" in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said many in the West only had a vague idea of the
Chechen problem and made their judgments in accordance with
superfluous information spread by the rebels and their patrons,
and by one-sided coverage of events in Russia's North Caucasus
region.
</P>
<P>
There were certain forces in the West that want to capitalize
on the situation in Chechnya to exert pressure on Russia and limit
its active foreign policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that a main result of the Istanbul summit was the
clearly announced stand of the Russian President that thwarted
such intentions," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan Goes At Full Gear to Join WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's two and a half years of
efforts to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) is getting
crowned this week as it is to conclude bilateral talks with the
U.S. and European Union (EU) countries at Geneva, Switzerlands.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian delegation, headed by Secretary General of the
Ministry of Industry and Trade Mohammad Halaiqa, is scheduled to
hold talks in Geneva Wednesday with its EU and U.S. counterparts
for final touches of bilateral agreements on the kingdom's
admission to the 135-member trade organization.
</P>
<P>
Halaiqa said before heading for Geneva that he was optimistic
that Jordan would be admitted to the WTO after the talks with the
key WTO players, crowning the kingdom's extensive negotiations
with WTO member states in the last two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is apparently accelerating its efforts to join the WTO
as the new millennium approaches, and it had sealed bilateral
agreements with Japan, Canada and Switzerland in November before
the Geneva meeting.
</P>
<P>
Joining the WTO is one of the strategic choices of the Jordan
to lift its economy out of chronic stagnation, which was incurred
in part by the U.N. sanctions on Iraq after the 1990 Gulf crisis
as well as political and economic uncertainties in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian economy shrank by some 2.5 percent in 1998,
forcing the government to speed up its effort to join the WTO to
promote its trade and attract more investments into the
cash-strapped kingdom for a much-needed economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At home, the government has been busy paving the way to join
the WTO, including reducing budget deficit, making amendments to
the economic laws, streamlining its bureaucratic apparatus,
encouraging the private sector to play more active role in the
economy and to improve the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the first eight months of 1999 witnessed positive
signs for an economic recovery, with total investment reaching 337
million Jordanian dinars (471.8 million U.S. dollars), a 20
percent increase over the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics for unemployment rate also dropped to some
10.2 percent in the first eight months from 17 percent in 1998,
though independent estimates still put it at over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is also taking measures to privatize public
institutions which are running at a loss, including the national
carrier Royal Jordan and the Jordanian Telecom.
</P>
<P>
The measures drew applause from Western countries, and U.S.
officials visiting Amman this year, including Defense Minister
William Cohen, said the kingdom had been very close to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts believe that kingdom might be admitted into
the WTO as early as the end of 1999, paving the way for further
economic growth in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The WTO entry is expected to help Jordan's products and
services to enter the North American and West European markets,
reducing dependence on its traditional markets in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's trade with Arab countries accounted for some 27
percent of its overall trade, and 25.3 percent of its exports are
destined for the states in the Gulf in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Majority Say No to Quebec Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The results of a latest poll
showed that the majority of Quebeckers will say "No" to
sovereignty of the French-speaking Canadian province from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail, the country's leading newspaper, reported
Monday that 58.9 percent of decided voters said in the poll that
they would vote No if a sovereignty referendum were held today.
</P>
<P>
This is a slightly stronger federalist vote than in a September
survey, when 58.6 percent decided voters said they would vote No,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Support for sovereignty is at its lowest level since long
before the independence referendum held on October 30, 1995, when
Quebeckers voted 50.6 percent against 49.4 percent in opposition
to the province's sovereignty, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by Group Leger &AMP; Leger for The Globe and
Mail and Le Journal de Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Conference Discusses Peacekeeping, Peace Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of scholars,
specialists and officials from different countries and
international organizations including the United Nations are
gathering here Monday for a two-day conference to discus issues
related to peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
The conference is the fourth of a series organized by
Singapore's Institute of Policy Study and the U.N. Institute for
Training and Research to discuss these issues.
</P>
<P>
Hedi Annabi, assistant secretary-general of the U.N. Department
of Peacekeeping Operation, delivered to the conference a message
from the U.N. secretary-general, who said, "The challenge of
forging a truly sustainable peace compels us to address not only
the immediate suffering and devastation caused by conflict but
also the very roots of upheaval and strife."
</P>
<P>
The message also said, "It has become clear that post-conflict
peace building must begin simultaneously with the deployment of a
peacekeeping operation."
</P>
<P>
At the conference entitled "The Nexus Between Peacekeeping and
Peace Building," Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs S.
Jayakumar gave a keynote speech on the experiences, lessons,
challenges and problems of peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jayakumar said peacekeeping missions have become
more complex and multi-dimensional in the post-Cold War era as
intra-state conflicts have erupted with increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that peacekeepers have been called upon to
undertake a number of non-military tasks aimed for peace building,
including disarming, demobilizing and reinstating former
combatants and resettling refugees.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that peace building contributes to international
peace and security, particularly in preventing conflicts from
recurring, Jayakumar said peace building elements must be included
in the mandates of peacekeeping operations to ensure a smooth
transition to a successful post-conflict phase.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said a number of issues need to be addressed for
peacekeeping and peace building to succeed, including clear and
achievable peacekeeping and peace building mandates to be given by
the U.N. Security Council, proper assessment of the U.N.
capability to undertake peacekeeping and peace-building missions
and the resources and finances of funding these missions.
</P>
<P>
Annabi pointed out in his keynote speech that the operations
that combine peacekeeping and peace building pose special
challenges and the resolution of questions related to material
resources and conceptual problems is crucial to success.
</P>
<P>
He said that when the United Nations is asked to take on a
broader role for peacekeeping and peace-building operations, it is
essential for it to openly acknowledge its inherent difficulties,
to have clear political support for undertaking the operations and
to be given the necessary resources to make these operations
successful.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to discharge poorly understood or articulated mandates
without the necessary support from U.N. member states are doomed
to failure, Annabi stressed.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's GDP to Rise 0.6 percent in 1999: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to rise 0.6 percent in 1999, Kazakh
Economy Minister Zhaksybek Kulekeyev said in the Kazakh capital of
Astana Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Kulekeyev made the
statement at the first session of the Kazakhstan-EU (European
Union) cooperation committee.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output is likely to rise by one percent and
agricultural production by 12 percent, the minister was quoted as
saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production increased by 0.5 percent in the
first 10 months of 1999 over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP fell by two percent in 1998 from 1997.
</P>
<P>
A continuing crisis prevailed over Kazakhstan's economy in
1998 and the first half of 1999, and "signs of economic revival
are just showing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's foreign trade turnover plummeted almost 30
percent in the first three quarters of this year, compared to the
corresponding period last year, with imports diving dramatically,
said Kulekeyev.

<HEADLINE> Grace Period Set for Illegal Foreigners in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Starting December 1, South Korea
will give foreigners staying illegally in the country a two-month
grace period to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Those voluntarily leaving South Korea during the grace period
will be given assistance such as an exemption from fines, the
Justice Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Those remaining illegally in South Korea after the grace
period will face criminal punishment, forced deportation, and a
ban on re-entry into the country, while businesses employing those
foreigners will be heavily punished.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government will make arrangements for paying
salaries in arrears and damages due to industrial accidents for
those illegal foreigners planning to leave the country within the
grace period, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
At present, an estimated 130,000 foreigners are illegally
staying in South Korea, according to statistics issued by the
Immigration Department.

<HEADLINE> South Africa-EU Talks on Alcoholic Drinks Pact Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations on a Wines
and Spirits Agreement (WSA) between the European Union (EU) and
South Africa are currently deadlocked and make the implementation
of an overall trade agreement, scheduled for next year, unlikely
to occur.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said recently that they want to continue talks on
the WSA with South Africa, but Pretoria is unwilling to pursue
further talks.
</P>
<P>
A South African government spokesman told reporters last week
that the issue "has been enough debated" and that "South Africa,
which is ready to fulfill the conditions of the agreement, will
not resume negotiations."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the EU Council of Ministers' sources confirm
that the EU delegation is still in close contact with South Africa
on the issue, but that "everything is deadlocked."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, confirmed
early this month that the port and sherry cases were closed, but
the two sides have not yet found a consensus on designations of
origin for Greek ouzo and Italian grappa. It is not yet clear
whether the EU will defend these two famous names with the same
strength as port and sherry.
</P>
<P>
The EU and South Africa signed a free trade agreement last
month by overcoming a last-minute row over the use of the terms
port and sherry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Spain and Portugal, backed by France, Greece and
Italy, demanded written guarantees that South Africa should phase
out the use of the terms on its fortified wines.
</P>
<P>
The five EU members insisted the names port and sherry can only
be used for drinks originating from particular areas of Portugal
and Spain. But South Africa, one of the southern hemisphere's
biggest producers of fortified wines, argued the terms set down
for such a move.
</P>
<P>
EU and South African negotiators agreed last month to conclude
the issue by the end of October, but missed the deadline,
according to European Commission spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
This "jeopardized plans for the provisional entry into force of
the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two zones by January
2000," since it depends on the prior conclusion of the WSA, the
spokesmen indicated.
</P>
<P>
"We did not meet our negotiating objectives," a Commission
spokesman said early this month, adding that now is the time for a
political assessment by EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the provisional application of the overall Trade and
Cooperation Agreement as of January 1, 2000, appears increasingly
unlikely to occur, since it is conditional on a successful
conclusion of the WSA, observers here believe.

<HEADLINE> Churches in Israel Close Over Mosque Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- As ordered by Christian
leaders in Israel, all the main churches in the Jewish state were
closed for two days as of Monday to protest against a government
decision to allow the construction of a mosque near a Christian
holy site.
</P>
<P>
From Monday morning, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in
Jerusalem, Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth and the
Church of Nativity in Bethlehem have shut their doors to Christian
pilgrims, bringing foreign pilgrims walking in the footsteps of
Jesus to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Despite Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's call to the church
leaders not to include the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem in the
strike because it is in the territory under Palestinian control,
this holy site was also closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a government committee enraged the Christian
leaders by allowing the Muslims in the northern Israeli city of
Nazareth to build a mosque at a site near the Basilica of
Annunciation, where Christians believe Archangel Gabriel told the
Virgin Mary she would give birth to the son of God.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government called the church closures "lamentable"
and issued assurance it was committed to protecting Christian
interests in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
The church closures will likely take toll of Israel's tourist
industry, as tourist officials had expected that around 3 million
foreign visitors, mostly Christian pilgrims, would come to visit
the sanctuaries next year during the millennium celebrations.

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The OSCE summit, held on
November 18-19 in Istanbul, definitely justified Russia's position
on Chechnya, said Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze at a news
conference in Tbilisi on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Russia is capable of localizing the conflict
in Chechnya and so it will not spread to other parts of North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze hoped that Russian President Boris Yeltsin did
not mean Georgia when he said at the OSCE (Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe) summit Moscow has information
about countries conniving with the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has never sheltered terrorists and will never do so in
the future, Shevardnadze said, because "Georgia has suffered most
from terrorist actions in Abkhazia."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister Hints No Stopping in Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Muhammad Rashid on Monday slammed the U.N. Security Council
resolution on extending the oil-for-food program for two weeks,
but hinted that Iraq has not stopped oil export.
</P>
<P>
"We consider this resolution very sinister, it is to blackmail
other members of the Security Council and it is totally
meaningless," said Rashid at a welcoming ceremony held for
visiting Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Ali Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Asked twice whether Iraq is still pumping and exporting oil,
Rashid said "we have finished pumping and loading all the tankers
under the contracts for the sixth phase, so we have no more
contracts to fulfill for this phase."
</P>
<P>
"We have fulfilled by today (Monday) all our obligations
toward the contracts which we have signed with different companies
for the sixth phase, which is approximately 390 million barrels,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the oil-for-food program expired on
November 20. The U.N. Security Council last Friday unanimously
approved the extension of the phase until December 4 to allow more
time for Iraq to reach its oil export ceiling of 8.3 billion
U.S. dollars set by the council.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf announced last
Saturday that Iraq rejected this resolution, accusing the U.S. of
trying to use this new resolution to blackmail other member states
of the Security Council and build pressure on them to accept the
British-Dutch proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain recently have been pushing for the adoption
of the British-Dutch proposal which recommends a conditional
suspension of the sanctions after Iraq agrees to allow
U.N. weapons inspectors to return to the country and put its oil
revenues under U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said Iraq had finished exporting 7.25 billion dollars of
oil in the last six months, but the U.S. and British
representatives at the U.N. Sanctions Committee had put on hold
807 million dollars worth of Iraqi contracts concluded in this
phase for imports of food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported that the visiting
Venezuelan oil minister would start talks with Rashid on Monday
to discuss a summit meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) due in Caracas, Venezuela next February.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's talks with Rashid would also be centered on
cooperation between the two countries in reducing oil supply to
the world oil markets, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez last week met in the Saudi capital Riyadh with oil
ministers of OPEC member Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC country
Mexico. They vowed to maintain the current oil supply cuts until
next April to prop up the oil prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to host an
international conference on the safety, scientific and consumer
concerns about genetically modified food in February next year, a
government spokeswoman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting from February 28 to March 1, will be held in
Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, and is to be organized by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
following a request by the Group of Eight (G8) big powers, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"At the last G8 heads of government meeting in Germany they
asked the OECD to have a look at the issue of GM foods," a report
here quoted a spokesman for the government's GM communications
unit as saying.
</P>
<P>
The OECD, an organization based in Paris, the capital city of
France, will shortly be setting up a committee to determine how to
organize the conference and which countries will attend.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eight comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the genetically modified foods have provoked public
outcry about the safety of the technology and its impact on the
environment and health.
</P>
<P>
Britain set up the GM communications unit within the cabinet
office in July to deal with the increasing demand for information
about the complex issues.

<HEADLINE> Arab Committee Seeks Solution to Somali Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member committee met on
Monday to discuss a plan of action worked out by the Arab League
to help realize peace and stability in Somalia, a league official
said.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid chaired the
meeting of the committee on the Somali crisis, said Ahmed Ben
Helei, assistant secretary general of the league.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid submitted to the meeting a report about the Somali
issue for discussion by the participants, Helei was quoted as
saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the report reviewed the efforts exerted by the
22-nation pan-Arab forum to help realize national reconciliation
in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
It also briefed the committee on the league's cooperation with
regional and international organizations, including the United
Nations, the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority and the
European Union, in this regard, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab committee, which comprises representatives from
Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Libya, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen, has
been set up to seek for steps to peacefully settle the Somali
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since 1991 when the government of
former dictator Siad Barre was toppled. In 1997, the world
community mediated an agreement among the Somali factions on
forming a national assembly, which will be in charge of setting up
a central government. But factional mistrust has obstructed its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid on Sunday expressed the Arab League's readiness to
host a conference to forge national reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Somali faction leaders for the deterioration of
the national situation and called on all countries, especially
Somalia's neighbors, to stick to a U.N. Security Council
resolution banning export of weapons to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has suspended Somalia's membership due to the
absence of a central government in this Horn of Africa country.

</P>
<P>
Organized by the Music Office, the carnival aims to arouse

different zones of various themes at the carnival, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
A multi-media exhibition - "Millennium Retrospect" - will be
staged to review the development of music in the last one thousand
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Students of the Music Office will join other musicians to give
live performances to demonstrate the development of both the
Chinese and Western music in the past millennium.
</P>
<P>
The performances include Chinese Guqin, ancient classical
Chinese singing, Chinese plucked string music, Beijing Opera,
Renaissance and Baroque instrumental ensembles and choral

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Lower for October 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong consumer prices
registered a year-on-year fall of 4.2 percent in last month,
compared with the 6.0 percent drop in September.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Monday by the Census and
Statistics Department, smaller declines were also observed in the
three sub-indices of consumer price index (CPI) A, B and C with a
fall of 3.1 percent, 5.1 percent and 4.1 percent respectively over
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman said the smaller decline in
consumer prices in October was mainly attributable to dissipation
of the effect of the 50 percent cut in the rates payable in the
third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first 10 months of 1999 together, the Composite CPI
declined by 3.9 percent as compared to the same period of 1998.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Continuous Growth in Visitor Arrivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong had maintained a
double-digit growth for 16 consecutive months in the number of
visitor arrivals by October, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (
HKTA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Visitor arrivals in Hong Kong totaled 999,771 in October, up 17.
1 percent from the same month of last year, said the HKTA.
</P>
<P>
The figure for the period from January to October this year was
8,727,645, representing a growth rate of 11.8 percent over the
same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"By the second half of 1998 the post-handover downturn was
reversed and double-digit growth has been recorded ever since --
even with this month's upward adjustment of 2.4 percent in hotel
rooms rates," the report quoted HKTA Executive Director Amy Chan
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The wide availability of attractive tour packages in individual
countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, India and Japan
assisted in boosting arrivals from these markets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming handover of Macao next month lured Portuguese
to visit Hong Kong, a gateway to Macao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, effective direct mail programs in the United States,
exposure through trade activities and competitive air fares and
promotions with trade partners helped produce positive results
from the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the key objective of Hong Kong tourism now is to
induce higher yields, longer stays and increased tourism industry
earnings.
</P>
<P>
For the period from January to September 1999, tourism receipts
totaled 38 billion HK dollars (4.9 billion U.S. dollars), a drop
of 3.4 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita spending fell 12.9 percent to 4,739 HK dollars (607.
6 U.S. dollars), as a result of Hong Kong's lower costs right
across the board for accommodation, services and goods and of
visitors' shorter stay, the average being 3.38 nights.

state budget.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Algeria has suffered economic and material losses
of about 3 billion U.S. dollars so far from terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that terrorist acts in Algeria have also destroyed
the structure of the country's national economy and caused
psychological tension as a result of the country's deteriorating
economic and social situation.
</P>
<P>
Terrorist groups have also targeted factories, equipment,
workshops, vital institutions and schools, leading to the closing
down of them and massive laying off of workers.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has achieved a 6 percent rate of growth this
year which is expected to increase to 7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has succeeded in lowering the country's budget deficit to
less than 1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), the
lowest in 50 years, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievements to efforts to rationalize
government expenditure, encourage the private sector to play a
principal role in developing the country's free market economy and
check domestic and external debts.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi government is studying 11 investment projects
presented by some Arab and foreign companies in various Iraqi
productive sectors.

to be undertaken by Arab investors and five by foreign ones. But
it did not specify the names of the projects or identify the
nationality of the companies.
</P>
<P>
The government tries to develop national economy which was
severely hit by the U.N. sanctions imposed in 1990 following its
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has recently taken measures to improve its economic
performance, such as allowing Iraqis and foreigners to have bank
deposits in foreign exchange, rationalizing public expenditure,
privatizing a number of state-owned companies, raising taxes and
duties, and restricting the issuance of bank notes.

<HEADLINE> Pak Ex-Ruling Party Challenges Army Takeover in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Muslim League
(PML), the former ruling party headed by deposed Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, Monday challenged the October 12 army takeover in
the Supreme Court, asking the apex body to restore the civilian
government.
</P>
<P>
The 12 petitioners, all high-level leaders of PML and its ally
parties, made the National Security Council headed by Chief
Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf the respondent.
</P>
<P>
The petition said the Proclamation of Emergency and the
Provisional Constitutional Order, both issued by General Musharraf
after the army takeover in a bloodless coup on October 12, lack
constitutional validity and legitimacy as they were issued by an
authority unknown to the laws of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Proclamation of Emergency and the Provisional Order are
violative of the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan,
including, but not limited to, their right to have untrammeled
access to justice before a free, impartial and independent
judiciary and to elect their own representatives to govern
themselves," it said.
</P>
<P>
The petition wants the Supreme Court to declare the
constitution in force and all constitutional functionaries elected
or appointed and institutions to continue to function and exercise
their powers under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The petition also asked the court to declare the National
Security Council a body unknown to law and not entitled to
exercise any power.
</P>
<P>
The eight-member National Security Council, headed by the chief
executive, was set up after the army takeover to exercise the
supreme power in charge of all affairs of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The PML government led by Sharif was dismissed by the army on
October 12 and the constitution and the federal and provincial
parliaments were suspended.
</P>
<P>
Deposed Prime Minister Sharif, who remains the head of the
party, is currently under police custody on different charges.
</P>
<P>
The PML decided earlier this month to challenge the army
takeover after internal discussions and consultations.

<HEADLINE> EU Fisheries Ministers Meet on Aid Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) fisheries
ministers met here Monday to discuss implementation of the new
fisheries aid rules written into the "Agenda 2000" EU reform
package.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states are divided over what constitutes
eligible EU aid for modernizing fishing fleets. They agreed last
June on all other funding issues in the new 2000-2006 Structural
Fund package, but failed to reach consensus on the regional aid
issue at their June and October meetings.
</P>
<P>
The aid concerned is substantial and amounts to about 1.106
billion euros (1.139 billion U.S. dollars) between the years 2000
and 2006 for certain EU areas reserved for the poorest EU regions.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Denmark, with some support from Luxembourg and
Austria, are only member states backing the European Commission's
plan to link future aid to progress in fishing capacity cuts. The
EU executive body's plan tries to square fisheries aid with
separate plans to scrap vessels under the current five-year multi-
annual guidance program, which applies until the end of December
2001.
</P>
<P>
Britain has said that paying subsidies for fleets while trying
to cut them at the same time is unacceptable. British Fisheries
Minister Elliot Morley has criticized France's resistance to the
EU executive's proposal, especially since the French fleet has
failed to meet its targets in cutting capacity, and has described
Paris' policy as madness.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission's original proposal said that no vessel built
with public aid can be added to the fleet register until 1.3 old
vessels are scrapped.
</P>
<P>
EU officials say that the current Finnish presidency has taken
the issue forward by drafting a compromise bringing the 1.3 ratio
down to 1.15 for member states that have met their targets, and
leave it at 1.3 ratio for targets not being met.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU fisheries ministers are also expected to discuss the
commission's proposals to reform the common organization of the
market for fisheries products.

<HEADLINE> HK Plans to Build Two Landmark Bridges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The skyline of Hong Kong
will be filled with magnificent infrastructure within the next
decade with the addition of two big bridges, the Stonecutters
Bridge and Tsing Lung Bridge, a senior highways official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Director of Highways K. S.
Leung said the bridges would occupy prominent locations within the
harbor and have their own distinguishing features.
</P>
<P>
"When completed, they will become landmarks of Hong Kong
alongside the Tsing Ma Bridge, the world's longest suspension
bridge carrying both road and rail traffic, and Ting Kau Bridge,
the world's longest cable-stayed bridge with three single legged
towers," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Leung said: "The bridges, as part of the major development in
Hong Kong, will provide vital new links for different parts of
Hong Kong and help Hong Kong to maintain its position as a
regional transport hub."
</P>
<P>
Located across the entrance to the Kwai Chung Container Port,
Stonecutters Bridge is a key component of Route 9 (Tsing Yi -
Cheung Sha Wan). "The clear width of the port entrance is about
900 meters and the bridge will have a span of at least 1,000
meters," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"It will serve as a landmark and gateway to the port, thus
promoting the image of Hong Kong as a vibrant and important center
of international trade," he added. Construction of the bridge will
begin in 2003 for completion in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Tsing Lung Bridge, Leung said it will be a
suspension bridge and carry Route 10 across Ma Wan Channel.
</P>
<P>
The main span of the bridge will be 1,418 meters - 41 meters
longer than Tsing Ma Bridge. When completed, it will be the third
longest suspension bridge in the world.
</P>
<P>
The detailed design of the bridge is scheduled to commence in
February next year and construction will start in 2002 for
completion in 2007.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President in Kuwait to Upgrade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid arrived here Monday on a two-day working visit
aimed to give a fresh push to the development of bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wahid is to hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber al-Ahmad
al-Sabah on means of promoting ties between the two countries,
said a statement issued here earlier by the royal palace.
</P>
<P>
This is Wahid's first visit to the Gulf state since he was
elected president on October 20. He is also the first Indonesian
president to visit Kuwait in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Indonesia, two Islamic countries,
are linked by the Islamic principles, stances towards most of the
international issues and mutual benefits, said the official
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia offered firm support to Kuwait during Iraq's
invasion in 1990 by sending a letter to President Saddam Hussein,
demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Indonesia also are bound by a number of economic
cooperation agreements including the agreement to preventing
double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, an oil producer itself, imports oil from the Gulf
and Middle Eastern countries including Kuwait. It bought 2.2
million U.S. dollars worth of oil from Kuwait in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In June 1999, Jarkata received eight loans totaling 189.4
million dollars from the Kuwait Fund of Arab Economic
Development.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Crackdown on Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to clamp
down on crimes and beef up a nationwide campaign to deal severely
with criminals, a top public security official today.
</P>
<P>
Jia Chunwang, minister of Public Security, said the "Strike
Hard" campaign launched in 1983 has proved an effective way to
curb rampant crimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
He praised a number of local police departments at a gathering
for their efforts in capturing escaped criminals during a three-
month campaign on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the People's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Jia urged to maintain an "energetic attack and intensive
pressure" against criminals to safeguard current reforms and the
modernization drive. From July to September more than 230,000
escaped criminals surrendered to police. This was partly due to
participation of the local media. Many journalists were invited to
help track down escaped criminals.
</P>
<P>
However, criminals at large remains a serious problem. Jia
called for setting up a police operation system at the earliest
possible date.
</P>
<P>
In the next couple of years, public security departments at all
levels will mainly work on reinforcing grassroots units and set up
a contract system for police units.
</P>
<P>
The police will step up control over china's "floating
population", improve the Resident Identity Card system, crack down
on criminal activities involving guns and drugs as well as
criminal gangs, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Electronic Initial Public Offering Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong investors will be
able to enjoy Electronic Initial Public Offering (EIPO) service
for the first time Tuesday, according to a report by Hong Kong
Clearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Clearing announced that its EIPO service will be used
for T S Telecom Technologies Limited's flotation on the Growth
Enterprise Market (GEM) starting from Tuesday, the first time that
the service has been made available to Hong Kong investors.
</P>
<P>
"The EIPO service is a significant step forward in respect of
subscription of new shares, because it reduces costs and clerical
errors, shortens turnaround time and eliminates the risk of lost
checks and share certificates," said Stewart Shing, chief
executive of Hong Kong Clearing.
</P>
<P>
"Since it uses the electronic mechanism of the Central Clearing
and Settlement System, investors will benefit from added
convenience and extended subscription hours," he said.
</P>
<P>
Listed issuers also benefit from the service because it is
capable of handling a larger volume of applications as compared
with manual processing, Shing said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Hong Kong Clearing is also in discussion with
several companies that are considering the use of EIPO service for
their Main Board or GEM listings," he added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's GDP Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Korean economy is certainly recovering fast and real
GDP growth this year is expected to be around nine percent, said a
spokesman from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter's GDP was 104.3 percent of the GDP of 1997,
when a historic financial crisis hit the country as a result of
massive corporate failures and an outbreak of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted real GDP kept growing this year by rising 4.1
percent in the first three months, 3.9 percent in the second, and
three percent in the third from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of this year, production in manufacturing
industries surged 26.8 percent due to increased domestic and
export demand for semiconductors, computers and automobiles, while
the production of service industries jumped 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that concerns regarding over-consumption
were unnecessary since growth is mainly from the recovery of
exports and facility investment instead of from increased
consumption and construction investments.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said his
nation had completely overcome the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the economy is expected to grow from a minus
5.8 percent last year to nine percent this year and inflation will
be controlled at the one-percent level.

<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Wonder boy Michael Owen could
be picked for the England Under-21s' Euro 2000 play-off against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan claimed Under-21 boss Howard
Wilkinson has the right to pick the 19-year-old Liverpool striker
for the yet-to-be-arranged game even though he is a regular with
the senior side.
</P>
<P>
Owen failed to sparkle in England's two games with Scotland in
the Euro 2000 play-offs and Keegan believed he might benefit from
playing with the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said in the Independent on Sunday: "Although the nation
might see it as a real comedown if Michael was called into the
Under-21s, Howard has got the right to pick any of them."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Maybe he's still got things to learn. I've already
said to him he needs to work on his left side.
</P>
<P>
"But he's 19 years of age. He's got potential. He could hold
the ball up better, but it was more due to a lack of games and
lack of service," said Keegan.

<HEADLINE> West Ham Defeats Sheffield Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- West Ham United late rally gave
them a 4-3 victory over 10-men Sheffield Wednesday at the English
premier league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday had been in an edge to score their first away
victory of the season in the match. Bottom club Wednesday have
scored only once away from home all season -- an own goal in a 1-1
draw with fellow strugglers Bradford in August -- but they looked
set for a much-needed victory as they led 3-2 following Andy Booth
's 65th minute goal.
</P>
<P>
But referee Alan Wilkie reduced the Yorkshire side to 10
players after 67 minutes by dismissing Northern Irish midfielder
Danny Sonner for an innocuous-looking challenge on Paolo Di Canio
who writhed dramatically on ground.
</P>
<P>
A minute later, West Ham were level when Marc-Vivien Foe
scrambled the ball in after Trevor Sinclair headed across the
goalmouth and Frank Lampard settled it after 76 minutes with a
fierce left-footed drive into the bottom corner.
</P>
<P>
Wilkie had helped West Ham level matters at 2-2 in the 62nd
minute as Sinclair tumbled under a challenge in the area from Wim
Jonk although little contact appeared to have been made. Di Canio
tucked in the resulting penalty.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Paulo Wanchope had opened the scoring after 28
minutes with his sixth of the season before Petr Rudi made amends
for a bad miss with a pinpoint drive for Wednesday's equaliser 10
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Wim Jonk capitalised on Wednesday's growing confidence with a
48th minute goal after good work from Gilles De Bilde to put his
side 2-1 ahead but it was not to be Wednesday's day.
</P>
<P>
They have been bottom of the table for three months with only
one win all season.

<HEADLINE> TV Industry Faces Opportunities And Challenges After WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Whether domestic color TV
producers will face big challenges after China enters WTO has draw
the attention of many people recently.
</P>
<P>
Major players in the television industry have commented that
the WTO entry will not cause major price reductions in color
televisions produced in China. In fact, China's entry into the WTO
will facilitate domestic products to further establish their
status in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Chen Weihong, general manager of the Konka Group, commented on
the Sino-US bilateral agreement on China's accession to WTO by
saying that trade barriers for Chinese exports will be removed
after the WTO entry, helping Chinese TV makers expand their market
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that as many foreign competitors have established
production bases in China, China is fully capable of producing and
processing any basic TV materials domestically.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hongsheng, board director of the Changhong Group, said
that China's WTO entry will bring fiercer competition to his
company, adding that Changhong will no longer a "hero in the
domestic competition".
</P>
<P>
China produces 30 million color TV sets each year, but the
domestic demand is only 20 million.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Changhong Group, China's largest TV
producer, announced that it would slash the prices of its color
televisions. A number of leading domestic TV producers immediately
followed suit, including Konka and Panda.
</P>
<P>
Market observers say that the price war has reduced the number
of small color TV producers and help promote the concentration of
TV producers and the production of famous brand products.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China witnessed a similar price war. By the end of
that year, the market share of four big TV providers -- Changhong,
Konka, Panda and TCL -- skyrocketed more than 50 percent. A year
later, this figure climbed to 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that these changes are a sign that the domestic TV
market is becoming more established, with domestically-made color
TVs taking an eighty percent share. Slight changes in the price of
foreign TV will therefore not significantly affect the domestic
market.

<HEADLINE> Tension Escalates in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed over the weekend in sporadic communal clashes in Ambon and
some of its surroundings in Indonesia's Maluku province, according
to national newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Following overnight clashes which claimed five lives, the
violence resumed on Sunday in the Nania subdistrict.
</P>
<P>
Another two died from gunshots, which also injured five other
residents.
</P>
<P>
Several houses and shops in the nearby Mardika district were
earlier on Sunday set on fire by a group of unidentified people.
The dawn attack started with home-made bomb explosions and
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted eyewitnesses as saying that security
troops deployed to the scene were unable to take immediate action
to quell the unrest.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 houses were also reportedly torched or looted.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said violence involved residents in the villages of
Durian Patah, Waiheru, Negeri Lama, Nania and Lehitu.
</P>
<P>
The violence was sparked by an incident on Friday when a group
of villagers, believed to be from Lehitu, pelted passing cars from
the village of Nania.
</P>
<P>
Angered by their action, residents then fought back but were
quickly intervened by security forces who rushed to the area.
</P>
<P>
The unabated riots in the province have left infants facing
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency reported that in the last couple of
weeks that baby's milk was in short in markets across the
province.
</P>
<P>
Many vendors of basic foodstuffs have fled the province as
communal clashes, which have prevailed in the Maluku islands for
almost the whole year, are providing little indication of coming
to an end.
</P>
<P>
Over 350 people were reported killed in the series of worst
communal conflicts which have hit the spices-rich province since
January.

BELGRADE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo decided to close down the Pristina
airport Sunday to investigate the crash of a U.N. airplane.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug reported that all of the
24 people aboard were killed when the U.N. World Food Program
flight from Rome to Pristina struck a remote mountain 40
kilometers north of Kosovo on November 12.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities said that the flight over Kosovo
violated the Yugoslav sovereignty and the U.N. Security Council
resolution 1244. The peacekeeping force refused to cooperate with
the Yugoslav air traffic supervision organ and allowed the
airplane to fly over Yugoslav airspace illegally, which were the
direct cause of the crash, the authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Downs Hingis to Win Chase Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Second-seeded American
Lindsay Davenport played what she termed her best match ever to
dominate No. 1 Martina Hingis and win the Chase Championships on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After reaching the final twice before, Davenport dispatched
Hingis, 6-4, 6-2 in a little more than hour to win the WTA Tour's $
2 million season-ending event for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"Just going out to the match, I wanted to be really aggressive
and go for winners," said Davenport, who earned $500,000 for
winning her seventh singles title of the year.
</P>
<P>
"I played my best match ever, and to end my year with that is
really great," the winner added.
</P>
<P>
This season had the 23-year-old Davenport hold the No. 1
ranking for more than a month at the start of the year and for a
portion in the summer. She also capturd her second career Grand
Slam title at Wimbledon, and led the United States to victory over
Russia in the Fed Cup crown.
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old from Switzerland, Hingis fell to 1-2 in finals
here at Madison Square Garden. Last season, she defeated then-No.
1 Davenport in four sets, and in 1996 she lost to Steffi Graf in
five sets.
</P>
<P>
This year's final was only a best-of-three sets.
</P>
<P>
"I guess that was a pretty solid performance," said Hingis, who
received the runner-up check of $250,000. "It was probably her
best match against me, but it's tough to come back consecutive
days and play your best."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hingis won a tight two-set match over third seed
Venus Williams of the United States in the semifinals while
Davenport had an easier time against No. 6 Nathalie Tauziat of
France." In a match between the only players to hold the No. 1
ranking since March 1997,Davenport got off to an excellent start.
She broke serve right away,then held, taking a 2-0 lead with a
service winner and two aces.
</P>
<P>
After Hingis struggled to hold her next service game, Davenport
easily went up 3-1. The American broke again, continuing to pounce
on Hingis' second serve, which usually topped out at around 70 mph.
After losing her serve in the fifth game, Hingis tossed her racket,
bringing about a chorus of boos from a mostly packed house.
</P>
<P>
"I got a little frustrated about some calls, not like the way I
played, of course," Hingis said. "But I think I've been able to
control myself a little bit more. I missed some shots that I wasn'
t supposed to miss, but things like that (bad calls) makes it even
harder."
</P>
<P>
The release of anger must have been good for Hingis as she
gained one of the breaks back, and won her own serve to move to 3-
4. She went ahead love-30 on Davenport's serve but hit three
straight errors.
</P>
<P>
Hingis again held serve and moved within two points of evening
the match. However, Davenport regrouped, hitting an ace and
nailing a cross-court backhand winner. After Hingis' backhand went
wide,Davenport closed out the 36-minute set with a cross-court
backhand volley.
</P>
<P>
"That's why it's always important to get two breaks on Martina,
"Davenport said of Hingis' resurgence in the middle of the set."
Serving at 4-3 after being up 4-1, that was probably the most
nervewracking; even for the set at 5-4 and love-30, the few points
I was able to win in both games, to win that first set, because
she was definitely coming back, getting a little bit more
confident and not making so many effors."
</P>
<P>
The second set began more promising for Hingis, who easily held
serve. But Davenport charged ahead toward her 26th-career singles
title by winning the next three games. The Swiss teen held serve
one last time before Davenport tore through three more games. She
served three aces and a service winner to claim her second
tournament victory in New York, having won the U.S. Open in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Davenport was superior in almost every catagory. She finished
with nine aces, won 83 percent of her first serves, hit 36 winners
and just 12 double faults.
</P>
<P>
Hingis moved from singles action to doubles play, where she
paired with Russian Anna Kournikova to win their fifth title of
the year. The top seeds posted a 6-4, 6-4 victory over No. 4
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain and Latvia's Larisa Neiland. They
will share the $200,000 first prize.
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Kournikova also won the Australian Open, and
appeared in the final of the French Open. However, Hingis will
team with Mary Pierce to begin the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the women's final, Jana Novotna, who announced her
retirement after losing at the U.S. Open, was honored with a
ceremony.A video tribute was shown and Novotna was given serveral
gifts,including a mountain bicycle. She won 24 career singles
titles,including the 1997 Wimbledon crown, and 76 doubles
tournaments over a 12-year career.
</P>
<P>
The doubles match signaled the end of another career as Neiland
retired after 16 seasons. She won six Grand Slam titles -- two
women's doubles and four mixed-doubles crowns. Neiland, who also
competed under her maiden name of Savchenko, captured her 69th
career doubles title last month in Leipzig, Germany.

Connecticut, the United States for a major championship.
</P>
<P>
Lareau and O'Brien claimed their first ATP Tour World Doubles
Championship Sunday by making quick work of Bhupathi and Paes, 6-3,
6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The duo needed only 86 minutes to claim their eighth doubles
title as a team and fourth this season. They posted a 7-6, 6-4 win
over the Indians in September's U.S. Open final.
</P>
<P>
The day's victory will allow Lareau and O'Brien to finish No. 2
in the world behind Bhupathi and Paes when the final ATP doubles
rankings are released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Runners-up in 1996, Lareau and O'Brien pocketed a total of $170,
000 for the week, having accumulated $90,000 in winnings up to
today's match and an additional $80,000 for claiming the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
It was a disappointing end to the season for Bhupathi and Paes,
who also lost in the 1997 final to Rick Leach and Jonathan Stark.
</P>
<P>
The Indians won three titles in 1999 and became the first team
in 47 years to reach the final at all four Grand Slams, winning
the French Open and Wimbledon. They were seeking their 16th
doubles title together.

<HEADLINE> Croatia to Put Off Parliamentary Elections: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Croatia is to postpone the
planned December 22 parliamentary elections till January 27, 2000,
due to President Franjo Tudjman's health problems, a spokeswoman
from the presidential office said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted the spokeswoman, Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, as
saying that as the president was currently under intensive care at
hospital, he failed to sign the decision to hold the parliamentary
elections for December 22.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 77-year-old Tudjman has suffered internal
hemorrhaging and other complications after emergency intestinal
surgery on November 1, and received another operation on November
13. Now blood toxicosis is the major threat to his life.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at preventing a political crisis triggered by Tudjman's
deteriorating health, the ruling party submitted on Saturday a
bill to the opposition group in the parliament on how to cope with
the situation when the president is temporarily incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposed that powers should be transferred to
Parliament Speaker Vlatko Pavletic when the president was too sick
to perform his duties.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear when the parliament would make the decision
because it is in recess until November 27, when it is expected to
dissolve ahead of new parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman, who led his country to independence from the former
Yugoslavia in 1991, has been reportedly suffering from cancer
since 1996.

<P>
YANGON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan will pay a friendly visit to Myanmar soon, according to
an official announcement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first Thai high-ranking official to visit
Myanmar since the siege of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok on
October 1 by five Myanmar gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Surin's visit is seen as seeking ways to improve the strained
Thai-Myanmar relations following the incident.
</P>
<P>
Surin's trip also came more than a month after Myanmar closed
its border with Thailand and temporarily suspended fishing
concession in Myanmar waters by Thai fishing vessels as a response
to the Thai handling of the embassy siege incident.
</P>
<P>
Surin is expected to meet his Myanmar counterpart U Win Aung
and issues of the handling of the embassy siege, lifting of
fishing concession suspension, reopening of border and
resettlement of anti-government Myanmar students in exile in
Thailand will top the agenda of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Five Myanmar gunmen, who are all students, stormed their
country's embassy in Bangkok and held embassy staff, their
families and some foreigners as hostages on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully on the next day with all the 89
hostages freed before the gunmen were flown by the Thai side of
the Thai-Myanmar border after negotiations in exchange for the
hostages.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 21 (Xinhua) -- An organization composed of
young Hungarians on Sunday launched a signature drive to oppose a
possible deployment of nuclear weapons by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) in their country.
</P>
<P>
Vasarhelzi Arpad, chairman of the organization, the Left-Front
Worker Youth League Union, said at a news conference that the
Hungarian government should keep its promise "not to allow the
deployment of nuclear arms" made during the referendum last
November on whether the country should join NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization, which always opposes Hungary's entry
into NATO, considers that certain Hungarian leaders were
irresponsible when making remarks on NATO nuclear deployment.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian premier Viktor Orban told a press interview earlier
November that Budapest would have to consider a NATO request to
deploy nuclear arms on its territory in the case of a global
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The youth union leader called one all political forces in
Hungary to unite and oppose any deployment of nuclear weapons in
the Hungarian territory.
</P>
<P>
Hungary joined the NATO in March this year.

ANKARA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is very pleased of his Turkey
visit because he believes that the messages he gave on bilateral
ties and regional issues have been well perceived and considered
by Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
However, there remains a issue which concerns Clinton: the
ambiguity on how Turkey will react at the expectancy from itself
to make a gesture to Greece. This issue also is closely related to
Turkey's EU candidacy, according to White House officials.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- Greece changed its policy in dealing with Turkey because it
realized that it could not solve the Aegean and Cyprus problems by
keeping Turkey outside and on the contrary the escalating tension
may result in an undesired conflict.
</P>
<P>
Indirect talks are to begin on December 6 between the leaders
of the two Cypriot communities in Cyprus. Progress is not expected
until the European Union (EU) Summit on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who came to Turkey to
attend a summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) in Istanbul, arrived in Ankara late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to Turkish Foreign Ministry said that it will
be an opportunity for Turkey to explain its position and opinions
before the planned proximity talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Annan met separately on Friday with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and Cypriot Turkish leader Rauf Denktash ahead of the
proximity talks scheduled for early December in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan fishers produced
77.4 percent of the total fish production in the country in the
past year, the Angolan Ministry of Fishery said in a document
released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the "positive" performance by the
Angolan fishers to relative stability in operation and the
transference of some foreign ships for national use according to
the law of investment.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Angolan ships captured 157,149 tons of fish
in the previous year, while foreign ships captured only 45,751
tons, mainly due to the instable social-military situation in the
war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1975 when the country gained its independence, Angola saw
the highest production of fish powder, 11,676 tons, and fish oil,
4,147 tons.
</P>
<P>
Among Angola's total fish production, 132,618 tons are fished
by industrial or semi-industrial ways, accounting for 84.4
percent, while the production by handwork is only 24,531 tons.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes Wahid to Ask MILF to Drop State Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government hopes
that a meeting between Indonesian President Abdulrahman Wahid and
the leader of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will
convince the MILF to drop their plan for a separate Muslim state
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said Monday in a
press release that he welcomes the meeting "if President Wahid is
able to persuade the MILF to abandon their efforts at establishing
an independent Muslim state."
</P>
<P>
Wahid and MILF chairman Hashim Salamat are scheduled to meet in
Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines later this week.
</P>
<P>
Mercado has been apprehensive about the forthcoming meeting
because of the MILF's ardent desire "to establish a status of
belligerency."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Cotabato province indicated that the
MILF will not give up its quest for an Islamic state in Mindanao
even if Wahid asks it to do so.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, MILF military adviser, said their
struggle for self-rule will be pursued and not on anybody else's
demand.
</P>
<P>
He said the MILF welcomes Wahid's visit, but Salamat will not
heed Wahid's appeal if the Muslim people in Mindanao do not
approve.
</P>
<P>
Wahid and the MILF can trace their relationship back to the
early 1980s when the MILF broke away from the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The MNLF headed by Nur Misuari signed a peace agreement with
the Philippine government on September 2, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Nepalese Women's Status Unsatisfactory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Although the level of
Nepalese women's empowerment has been substantially raised since
the restoration of democracy in 1990, their social status has
gained little improvement, the results of an opinion poll show.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey on the state of the Nepalese women,
whose results were issued here Monday, more than half of those
polled believed that the election of more than 40,000 women to the
local legislative bodies two years ago has had no perceptible
impact on the overall status of women in the society.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of whether the Nepalese society accords social
respect and recognition to women, more than 70 percent replied in
the negative. The respondents said women were considerably
restricted to developing a sense of self-identity and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which included interviews with 1,050 people all
over the country, revealed that most women did not even receive
equal status in their families with male members.
</P>
<P>
About 32.1 percent of the respondents were of the view that
female members of the family were generally discriminated against
in one way or another, whereas 10.1 percent of those surveyed said
the female members were not at all treated equally by the male
members of the family.
</P>
<P>
The poll clearly identified access to education and awareness-
raising programs for women as the most effective means of winning
social status for women in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial issue of abortion, an overwhelming 72.5
percent of the respondents were against the idea of legalizing
abortion, claiming that abortion was unacceptable to them on
socio-cultural and religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
The 19.6 percent who supported abortion argued that right to
abortion for Nepalese women was long overdue as it would shield
them from likely reproductive health hazards and unwanted economic
burdens. Only 7.8 percent of the respondents did not give any
opinion on this vital issue.
</P>
<P>
Abortion is deemed illegal in Nepal. Women who conduct abortion
are subject to imprisonment of up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, another hot debate on whether daughters should be
given the right to inherit parental property got a positive reply
from a majority of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
More than 64 percent of those polled said daughters should have
an equal claim to parental property while 32 percent spoke against
letting daughters have any claim on the property.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the on-going debate on the right marital
age for girls, as high as 76 percent of the respondents thought 18
years and above was the ideal age for girls.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted between September 7 and 19 by Media
Services International of Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Estrada, Ramos Call for Unity in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada and former President Fidel Ramos called Monday for
national unity, setting aside their personal differences.
</P>
<P>
"This is an occasion for us to set aside difference and find
opportunities to close ranks." President Estrada said here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos stressed, "The crying need now is for unity,
solidarity and team work because no amount of demolition,
disinformation or destabilization will solve our many problems."
</P>
<P>
President Estrada and Ramos have recently had differences of
opinion over how to govern the country. Fueling the feud was a
statement made by Ramos accusing the Estrada administration of
running the country like a yoyo with its changing policies.
</P>
<P>
These remarks angered President Estrada who accused Ramos of
instigating a disinformation campaign against his leadership.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on Monday, Estrada lamented that "our country has
been confronted by contentious and difficult issues," which he
said, "serve to test our fortitude as the father of our nation."
</P>
<P>
He said, "No matter how some false accusations have deeply hurt
me and my family, I still believe that there is inherent goodness
in everyone of us."
</P>
<P>
Without naming names, President Estrada said, "Although we are
often critical of each other, the Filipinos will always rise up to
the challenge of nationhood when the need for it comes."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ramos assured the Presidential Palace that "our
leaders, headed by President Estrada, and our people can continue
to count on me to help in my humble capacity as a private
citizen."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders later shook hands in a display of unity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Calligrapher to Write Largest Character </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese calligrapher plans
to write a giant Chinese character for the word "dragon," which
may be the world's largest at 999 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Sun Xin, from east China's Shandong Province, will use a huge
brush pen and barrels of ink to write his "dragon" tomorrow
morning at Tiananmen Square, an official with the China Federation
of Literary and Art Circles (CFLAC) said here today at a press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We want to show our happiness at embracing Macao's upcoming
return to the motherland," the CFLAC official said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people traditionally favor calligraphy, and the coming
new year will be the Year of the Dragon on the Chinese lunar
calendar, so this will combine two Chinese traditions to celebrate
Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
A business from northeastern Heilongjiang Province supported
Sun's endeavor with a specially made and very large square of red
silk upon which the calligrapher will inscribe the character.
</P>
<P>
The "dragon" will also be shown to the public in the city of
Zhuhai, bordering Macao, and Macao itself.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Marshal's Japanese Daughter Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Kakoi Mihoko, the Japanese
daughter of Chinese Marshal Nie Rongzhen, recently went to
Jiangjin City in southwestern Chongqing Municipality, Nie's
hometown, when Jiangjin forged sister-city ties with the city of
Miyakonoje in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I came here to fulfill the last wish of my Chinese father,"
Mihoko said. "During his lifetime, Nie expressed the hope several
times that his hometown could establish sister ties with my
hometown," she added.
</P>
<P>
Mihoko worked for many years as the go-between for forging a
sister-city tie between Jiangjin and Miyakonoje. Tatsuya Iwahashi,
the mayor of Miyakonoje, came to Jiangjin last Friday to sign the
sister-city agreement.
</P>
<P>
Recalling her dear relationship with Marshal Nie, Mihoko said,
"My younger sister and I became orphans in 1940 when our parents
died in China. Nie heard of our experience while directing the "
Battle of 100 Regiments" in north China.
</P>
<P>
"He said that the children are innocent and asked soldiers to
bring us to the command post. Nie held my younger sister and four-
year-old me in his arms and gave me pears. As my sister was less
than one year old, Nie immediately called for a wet nurse for her,
" Mihoko said.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of two little Japanese girls, Nie asked a local
villager to send them to Shijiazhuang, capital of northern Hebei
Province, and then back to Japan. Unfortunately, the younger girl
died of illness soon after they arrived in Shijiazhuang.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the "Liberation Army Daily" and "Liberation Pictorial"
carried reports inquiring the whereabouts of the two little
Japanese girls.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Daily Yomiuri, Mihoko met her Chinese
father in the Great Hall of the People on July 14, 1980. Nie
grasped Mihoko's hands for a long time and said, "I am very happy
to find you after 40 years of separation."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Nie presented Mihoko with a picture of a
pine, bamboo and plum and said, "Only these plants can withstand
the severe cold of winter. I wish the Sino-Japanese friendship can
withstand any test just like the pine, bamboo and plum."
</P>
<P>
"I treasure the picture very much and hung it in a renovated
vestibule. My father's wish voiced the aspirations of the people
of both China and Japan," Mihoko said.
</P>
<P>
"In 1986, Nie received my husband and me at his home. During
the meeting, he expressed the hope that his hometown, Jiangjin,
would become sister city to my hometown, Miyakonoje," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, his wish remained unfulfilled when he died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Miyakonoje said, "Today, we signed the agreement
of friendship as a gift to Nie on his 100th birth anniversary.
Although Marshal Nie has passed away, his story of helping
Japanese girls will go down in the annals of history forever."

<P>
BEIRUT, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese woman was wounded
Monday in an Israeli shelling on south Lebanon villages, security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Najat Ali Harb, 26, was moderately hurt by shrapnels of an

south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She was rushed to a nearby hospital in Nabatiyeh, four miles
north of her village, the sources added.

<P>
The shelling came as a response to previous Lebanese
guerrillas' rocket attacks on its outposts inside the zone.

responsibility for the attacks, saying in a statement that its
fighters scored direct hits on Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and other Lebanese resistance groups have been
fighting to oust Israelis occupation troops and its allied
militiamen, the South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Police Information Network Created in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua)-- A nationwide police information
network has taken shape in its primary stage as part of the effort
to battle criminals with new technology, according to Minister of
Public Security Jia Chunwang.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement here today at a national
conference to reward police units for their meritorious work
during a nationwide crackdown on escaped criminals on the eve of
the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic on October
1.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that public security departments at provincial,
municipal, and county levels are making efforts to build up local
information networks as well.
</P>
<P>
He called the campaign, which lasted from July to September, a
successful trial of the employment of hi-tech equipment by Chinese
police units.
</P>
<P>
During the three-month campaign, the police for the first time
used information networks at various levels to trace escaped
criminals still at large. VCDs containing criminals information
were also distributed among the police departments.
</P>
<P>
Among the 230,000 criminals seized during this drive, more than
170,000 had had their information and data recorded on the network.
</P>
<P>
Bai Jingfu, a deputy minister of Public Security, said that
tracing criminals with the help of the network has saved a great
deal of manpower, materials, and funds.
</P>
<P>
Currently, local police units are using a variety of modern
technology, Bai said, adding that some police have learned
computer technology at their own expenses in order to catch up
with their computer-literate colleagues.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, local police units that had been praised by
the ministry were rewarded with computers, instead of cash.

<HEADLINE> New Burundian Refugees Pour into Tanzania: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,000 new
Burundi refugees are crossing the border into Tanzania's
northwestern Kagera Region weekly, a Tanzanian newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
These Burundians are fleeing fresh military skirmishes between
armed rebels and the Bujumbura army, which are taking place in
many areas of Burundi, the Guardian newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Other Burundian refugees are fleeing their country to avoid
being resettled in the camps set up by the Bujumbura soldiers.
</P>
<P>
New Burundian refugees have now been crossing the
Burundian-Tanzanian border while leaders of the Great Lakes region
are expected to hold a regional summit in Tanzania's northern town
of Arusha next Monday to appoint a new international mediator for
the Burundi peace process.
</P>
<P>
The new mediator will replace former Tanzanian president Julius
Nyerere who died in London last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a fact sheet released by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the outlook for some
275,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania has become more uncertain
as a result of the suspension of refugee repatriation and doubts
about the future of Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian refugees repatriation program carried out by the
UNHCR in Tanzania was suspended following the October killing of
two U.N. aid workers in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other reports said that thousands of refugees from
Burundi, some of whom are armed, are unleashing a spate of violent
attacks on locals in Tanzania's western region of Kigoma.
</P>
<P>
The locals have appealed to the authorities to either
repatriate the Burundian refugees immediately or beef up security
in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tanzanian government said the refugees will be
repatriated only when peace is restored in their country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Calls for Creating Skilled Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Monday urged the member states of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to make efforts to develop a
skilled workforce to face the challenge of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Creation of a strong technological base is required for
economic growth, progress and prosperity of these states," she
said while addressing the congregation ceremony of the Islamic
Institute of Technology (IIT) here.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said technology is now recognized as the prime factor
for economic growth, adding that most of the OIC member states
mainly export raw materials and different natural resources and
import technology-intensive manufactured goods. "But the export
scenario of the advanced countries was just the opposition," she
added.
</P>
<P>
She said the IIT was going to offer post-graduate courses in
engineering. This effort will not only meet the increased
requirements of specialization in engineering but also help the
OIC member countries keep pace with the fast development of
technology.

<HEADLINE> 3 Filipinos Nominated to Head UN Force in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has nominated
to the United Nations three officers of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) to head the U.N. peacekeeping force in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said Monday in a press
release that the government has submitted the names of Maj. Gen.
Diomedio Villanueva, Maj. Gen. Gregorio Camiling and Maj. Gen.
Jaime de los Santos to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the United Nations will select the commander of
the U.N. Transitional Administration on East Timor (UNTAET) that
will replace the International Force to East Timor that is
presently deployed in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The three are all army officers and graduates of the Philippine
Military Academy, the country's premier military school.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia which had put East Timor under its rule for more than
20 years until the residents voted in a referendum for the
territory's independence, wanted a fellow member of the Southeast
Asian Nations to head the U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Malaysia were mentioned as candidates to
lead the UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
If a Filipino would be selected to command the U.N.
peacekeeping force to East Timor, Mercado said, Philippine
President Joseph Estrada will select from among the three AFP
generals recommended to that prestigious U.N. military post.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Philippines has a 600-man contingent deployed
in East Timor, which is engaged in civic work such as medical and
dental mission and construction of roads, bridges and schools.

CAIRO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

Southern Africa member states stood at 27.3 million U.S. dollars
in the first two quarters of 1999, up by 107 percent from 13.2

</P>
<P>

1998, said Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef
Boutros Ghali Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Says ASEAN Now in Recovery Mode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- After undergoing a financial
crisis in 1997, countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) are now on the path to recovery, according to a
top official of the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Trade and Industry
said the pace of ASEAN's recovery was made faster by the close
cooperation among its member countries and the adoption of
liberalization policies geared to open the region's markets to
global competition.
</P>
<P>
"We see now, l999, with the figures on trade, the gross
domestic product, the gross national product of each of the 10
countries, except for a few, appears to be on a recovery mode,"
Pardo said Monday in a report.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia,
Brunei, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Pardo noted that during a meeting in Thailand, ASEAN economic
managers agreed that the effects of globalization and
liberalization were beneficial to economies affected by the crisis
because these helped draw back investments to the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino said that
unity among ASEAN's member countries has been the key factor in
the region's recovery from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Severino said that instead of slowing down, ASEAN decided to
push through and speed up its economic integration despite the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
One example, according to Severino, was the decision of ASEAN
to advance the target date of the implementation of the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA), originally scheduled for the year 2010, to
2005.
</P>
<P>
As part of its commitment to liberalization, ASEAN has also
decided to advance the implementation of the ASEAN Investment Area
(AIA) to 2003, he added.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, leaders of the ASEAN member countries will be
joined by their counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea
during the third ASEAN Informal Summit in Manila.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Won't Establish Security Pact: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia said Monday that it
would not build a security pact with other nations in the form of
a defense pact, as the country's foreign policy had yet to allow
it to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we will not form or establish any security pact. We
will not also be involved in any security pact with other nations
both in Asia and other region," Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono
told House of Representatives (DPR) Commission I for security and
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Juwono said a comprehensive security cooperation system had
been established by ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries through the ASEAN Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia, through the ARF forum, also has been establishing
confidence-building measures with our neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia would stick to its own stance on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the upcoming ASEAN summit in Manila would discuss the
possibility of establishing an ASEAN security pact, Juwono said:
"I don't know whether or not the ASEAN Summit will deliberate
ASEAN security pact. I will ask the foreign minister."

<HEADLINE> Manila Belies Reports of Adviser's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Monday belied reports that Presidential Adviser on iron and steel
industries John Ng has resigned, saying there is no need for him
to leave the government, even if he decides to take over National
Steel Company (NSC).
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said in a news release
that there is no case of conflict of interest in the possible
takeover by Ng of the NSC since the company is "already a
privatized entity."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports quoted Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora as
saying Ng has tendered his resignation to avoid a conflict of
interest situation, since his company, the Cathay Pacific Steel
Co., is considering investing in the NSC.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has reportedly ordered his economic
managers to undertake a rehabilitation plan for the 24-year-old
NSC to save it from permanent closure and prevent its 2,000
workers from losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Total debt of the NSC was estimated to reach 14 billion pesos
(350 million U.S. dollars), of which 5 billion pesos (125 million
dollars) came from the Philippine National Bank (PNB).
</P>
<P>
Apart from Ng, tobacco tycoon Lucio Tan was also reportedly
interested in the NSC, since he allegedly owns substantial
shareholdings in the PNB, the biggest creditor of the steel
company.
</P>
<P>
Barican asserted that there could be no conflict of interest in
case Ng succeeds in taking over the NSC, since "the government has
only minimal equity possession in NSC, the great majority of the
shareholders being private investors."
</P>
<P>
"There will be no government takeover or bailout of the NSC. At
best, the government's participation will be limited to assisting
a consortium of all industry players to rescue the NSC," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Overseas Students to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The next 5-to-10 years will be
a golden time for overseas Chinese students to return home to work,
said Bai Chunli, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS).
</P>
<P>
"By that time, many important research positions will be vacant
as a result of the flood of retirements by the older generation of
researchers, and they need to be filled by first-rate overseas and
home-educated people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bai cited the CAS as an example, saying that research fellows
there above the age of 55 account for over 70 percent of the total,
while those below 40 make up only some 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
At a recent CAS postdoctoral symposium for the 50th anniversary
of the founding of the CAS, Bai said that the academy will absorb
talent from both overseas and home, and the government will
appropriate special funds to improve their working and living
conditions, adding that treatment of postdoctoral researchers will
be significantly improved in 2 to 3 years.
</P>
<P>
China's postdoctoral system was established in 1985 with the
full support of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past
15 years, the CAS has set up more than 100 postdoctoral research
stations, and over 1,400 postdoctoral researchers completed their
research at these stations.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the postdoctoral system was a breakthrough
in the country's scientific research capability and it has greatly
promoted the field, Bai said, adding that the CAS plans to recruit
even more postdoctoral researchers.

<P>
"That is what they (rulers) want to give me," Sharif told
reporters at the stairs of a special anti-terrorist court in the
southern port city of Karachi, according to the News Network
International (NNI) agency.
</P>
<P>
This was the second appearance of the deposed prime minister

Denying the charges, Sharif Monday reiterated his demand for a

</P>
<P>
"We are innocent and we have done nothing wrong," he said.

These persons have been dealt with according to administrative
rules. Some have had their accountant licenses canceled and others
may face criminal prosecution later.
</P>
<P>
This move shows the Chinese government's determination to
combat the continuing problem of accounting fraud among
corporations.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal supervisors whom the Ministry of Finance dispatched to
local enterprises earlier this year have discovered many cases of
the concealing of huge losses and false bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
Some companies selling shares on the stock market have cheated
investors by generating phony accountant statistics.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Wang Jun said that the central government
has made special decrees calling for a crackdown on these illegal
acts and severe punishment for those responsible.
</P>
<P>
After scrutinizing the accounting of 110 breweries and
distilleries all over the country, the Ministry of Finance filed
documents requesting that the relevant authorities punish or
prosecute 29 persons from 19 companies. It also asked authorities
to cancel the accounting licenses of eight people.
</P>

Wang said the ministry will continue to examine the accounting
practices of other industries next year, and will make public the

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- He Luli, the visiting
vice-Chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China, Monday called for the establishment of a new
international order.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Seventh Indira Gandhi Conference, He Luli, who
is also president of the Chinese People's Association for Peace
and Disarmament, said that in the 21st century, the growing trend
is towards multi-polarization in the world and economic
globalization, together with the rapid advancement of science and
technology and the quiet rise of knowledge of countries in Asia
and the world as whole.
</P>
<P>
"At the threshold of the new century, how to seize the
opportunity and meet the challenges? How to continue the efforts
to promote the establishment of a just and reasonable new
international political and economic order of peace and stability
and work hard to bring into the 21st century a new Asia and a new
world with lasting peace and universal prosperity?" she said.
</P>
<P>
These are the pressing tasks to be tackled by leaders and
peoples from Asia, including China and India, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said most Asian countries belong to the third world and and
they experienced the same bitter sufferings in the past.
</P>
<P>
Only through their persevering and arduous struggle, were they
able to throw off the shackles of colonialism and gain their
national independence and national unification, she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, she said, all of them cherish dearly their hard-won
national independence and unity.
</P>
<P>
It is the sacred right of the Asian people to safeguard
national dignity and state sovereignty, choose independently their
own social system, the road to development and way of life and
reject external intervention in their internal affairs, she said.
</P>
<P>
It is also the basic guarantee for the prosperity of Asian
countries, she added.
</P>
<P>
He Luli was invited by the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust to
attend the Seventh Indira Gandhi Conference with the theme of "New
Century: Whose Century". The three-day conference is expected to
conclude Monday afternoon.

<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here today with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), who is here to report to the
central government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president noted that since Hong Kong's return to
the motherland over two years ago, the overall situation there has
been good and continues to improve.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Mr. Tung, the Hong Kong SAR government
has led Hong Kong residents to deal calmly with the impact of the
Asian financial crisis and related problems, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Now, Hong Kong has overcome the most difficult period, and "we
have every confidence in Hong Kong's future," the Chinese
president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the reason behind the success of the "one
country, two systems" principle in Hong Kong lies in the fact that
the central government, the people, and especially the Hong Kong
compatriots, have a firm belief in it.
</P>
<P>
Only when the principle of "one country, two systems" is upheld
can Hong Kong's stability and prosperity be guaranteed, Jiang said,
adding that it is also in the best interest of the majority of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the belief that "one country, two systems" will
achieve huge success in the Macao SAR, just as it has done in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang noted that the proper handling of
Hong Kong affairs calls for the unity of Hong Kong compatriots on
the basis of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also voiced his belief that under Mr.
Tung's leadership, Hong Kong will achieve greater developments in
the coming year.

State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office were present at

NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- He Luli, vice-chairwoman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China,
Monday said China and India can work together to make greater
contributions to the prosperity of the two countries in the coming
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Seventh Indira Gandhi Conference, He Luli, who
is also president of the Chinese People's Association for Peace
and Disarmament, said China and India, as the two largest
developing countries in the world, share similar national
conditions and experiences.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, as both countries are carrying out economic
reform, they can exchange experiences and expand mutually
beneficial cooperation in many fields such as politics, economy
and trade, science and technology, and culture.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral Exchanges and cooperation in areas like economy and
trade and science and technology have been on the increase in
recent years, she said. "However, this is not commensurate to the
geo-superiority, market capacity, and scientific and technological
level of the two countries and the potentials of bilateral trade
should be further tapped."
</P>
<P>
Some problems left over from history between China and India
are yet to be ultimately resolved, she said. "However, I am sure
that our common interests far outweigh our differences, neither
side constitutes any threat to the other."
</P>
<P>
"We should trust each other and promote mutual cooperation.
Stable, normal and friendly Sino-Indian relations will not only be
in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries, but
also be conducive to promoting peace, stability and development in
Asia and the world at large," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming 21st century, on the basis of mutual trust, the
peoples of China and India can certainly work together to make
greater contributions to the prosperity of the two countries, and
the development of world civilization," she said.
</P>
<P>

LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition
Conservative Party on Sunday restarted the task of finding its
candidate in the first ever election of a London mayor after its
first choice, millionaire novelist Jeffrey Archer, quit the race
over a 13-year-old scandal.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party Chairman Michael Ancram said they had
considered giving the nomination to former Transport Minister
Steven Norris but decided he would always be regarded as a
"second-best" candidate if they did.
</P>
<P>
Following a 90-minute meeting of the party's London mayoral
selection executive, he announced the party would be re-running
the selection procedure which should see the new candidate in
place by mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Tory leader, William Hague, accused millionaire novelist, Lord
Archer, of letting the party down.
</P>
<P>
Lord Archer could be facing criminal charges after the
weekend's revelations.
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard has confirmed it is considering criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Archer quit as the Conservative candidate for the May election
after a newspaper said he asked a friend to lie to lawyers to
provide an alibi in a legal case involving a prostitute.

<HEADLINE> Courageous Reform Urged by "Third Way" Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema and other "third way" leaders Sunday called for a
"courageous reform" for the future on the top-level summit
"Progressive Governance in the XXI Century" held in Italian
central city of Florence.
</P>
<P>
A "fearless vision" is needed as globalization brings both
risks and opportunities, said D'Alema, adding that it is not via
the markets alone that solutions to problems can be found.
</P>
<P>
The summit, also attended by European Commission President
Romano Prodi, U.S President Bill Clinton, Britain's Labor Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Socialist Premier Lionel Jospin of France,
Germany's Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardoso, focused on what has
been labeled the "third way" of government between the traditional
concepts of free-market liberalism and socialism.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Blair saw isolationism as one of the chief problems
facing politicians in the 21st century. It is only within the
international community and in an ongoing dialogue between
generations that solutions to problems can be found, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Jospin held up as an example France's political platform which
calls for greater growth, lower unemployment, equal opportunity,
the social integration of minorities, welfare reform and
enlargement - "in positive terms', and the insertion of the nation
into the "universal current of modernization" without losing its
identity.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the so-called German model is a social order
that seeks to strike a balance between social justice and a
dynamic economy. He called for greater budget discipline, saying
that nations with high public debts leave a heavy legacy behind
for future generations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged in the summit which ended Sunday evening that
more capital and technology be invested in the less developed
nations.

<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A landmark agreement to ease
the flow of people and goods between Thailand, Laos and Vietnam
will be signed on Friday by the transport ministers of the three
countries, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border agreement, scheduled to be signed in
Vientiane, is part of the proposed 350-million-dollar, 400-km East
West Transport Corridor project which will join the three
countries, the ADB said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is expected to approve a 57-million-dollar loan shortly
to rehabilitate parts of the road in Laos and Vietnam, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the agreement aims to simplify and harmonize
legislation, regulations and procedures relating to cross-border
trade between the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is mainly on principles and many of the details
have to be worked out," said Thomas Jones, a senior project
economist of the ADB which helped lay the groundwork for the
agreement through a series of studies and workshops.
</P>
<P>
"But the framework is essential -- it underpins the joint road
projects which are either under way or being planned to link the
three countries," Jones added.

ZHENGZHOU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Zhengzhou, capital city of
Henan Province in central China, has removed rubbish and debris
from a rampart built 3,500 years when the area served as the
capital of Shang Dynasty (B.C.16th-B.C.11th century).

A sewage ditch has been turned into a green belt outside the
rampart, and trees, grass and flowers have taken the place of the
garbage which used to be scattered along the seven-kilometer-long
rampart which was built by ramming mud.
</P>
<P>
The Shang ruins located in today's downtown Zhengzhou have been
under national protection since 1961, and the cultural relics
there are the largest and best preserved early Shang Dynasty
remains in China.
</P>
<P>
The ruins have been identified as having once been a palace
area, residences of slave owners and ordinary people, a workshop
area, water supply facility, and a sacrificial altar.

KUWAIT, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's

2002 World Cup to be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, said a
senior sports official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ryu Song Il, secretary general of DPR Korea's Olympic committee,
said they have no plans to apply for an entry before the December
7 draw in Tokyo for the continental qualifying tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Ryu, who is here to attend a general assembly meeting of the
Olympic Council of Asia, said that the competitiveness of the
national team has been on the decline for a long hiatus from major
international competitions.
</P>
<P>
Of Asia's 44 national football associations, Only DPR Korea,
Afghanistan, Yemen and Guam have failed to confirm their entry in
the upcoming draw.
</P>
<P>
Ryu also said that it is unlikely at this stage that DPR Korea
will form a joint team with South Korea to play in the World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after remarks by South Korean soccer chief
Chung Mong Joon who, upon returning from his recent visit to DPR
Korea, said that his offer to share some of 2002 World Cup matches
received a lukewarm reaction.

KAMPALA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 146 former rebels
of the Uganda National Rescue Front apologized to President Yoweri
Museveni for engaging in subversive activities that led to their

LUSAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been identified as
one of the countries in southern Africa with potential for
producing organic honey, a Zambian newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a recent seminar in Lusaka aiming to
promote organic farming for the southern African region,
particularly small and large farmers' groups, The Post reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released at the seminar, the gap for
organic honey world-wide is large as only a few countries are
capable of producing the product in the same scale and quantity
that Zambia would be able to.
</P>
<P>
Organic honey could play a role in Zambia's industry in future,
the report said, adding that much of the honey produced in this
country has the potential to be organic honey and is a viable
possibility for export and trade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the seminar showed that the organic product
share is expected to jump from roughly one percent to 12 percent
of the food sales in major markets in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Organic foods are grown with a commitment to respect biological
and ecological processes. Organic farming is based on improving
the soil's structure and fertility, and ensuring a balanced choice
of crops.
</P>
<P>
According to the seminar, over 100 countries produce organic
food and beverages in commercial quantities, whereas 65 are
developing countries including 27 countries in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Multi-Media Used in Teaching Traditional Chinese Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Modern multi-media technology
is providing an effective means for learning traditional Chinese
therapy which has been passed on from master to apprentice for
more than 2,000 years of history.
</P>
<P>
Although there are principles to be learned from medical books,
the unique diagnosing techniques which use human sensory organs
are hard to comprehend without learning with one's own eyes and
hands.
</P>
<P>
Multi-media technology can make it much easier and more
convenient to learn by recording presentations of experienced
doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and sending them to
students via a computer network, said Cao Hongxin, a doctor with
the Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
During his address to a national symposium on Chinese medicine
teaching held here in central-south China's Hunan Province, Cao
said that modern technology can overcome the difficulty of
learning traditional Chinese medical science and help spread its
influence.
</P>
<P>
The opening of a long-distance Chinese medicine education
center was announced at the symposium, the first of its kind in
the world, which will be run by the China Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine and will recruit students from
overseas beginning March next year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the center will coordinate with higher learning
institutes of traditional Chinese medicine in Beijing and Hunan
Province to set up 33 related courses, including diagnostics,
traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, and acupuncture, which
will be taught via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine has
developed 18 software programs to simulate the clinical use of
traditional Chinese therapy.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and Universities in Shaanxi, Zhejiang and Guangdong
provinces exchanged their experiences in using multi-media
technology to teach the ancient medical techniques.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese therapy has been under pressure from its
Western counterpart, which features treatment employing high tech
and east-to-take medicine. But, with improved services and
renovations, traditional Chinese medicine is now enjoying a
revival.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Blasted by Ottawa Chinese Canadians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Chinese Canadians
here expressed shock Sunday at the evidenced fatal consequences
induced by practicing Falun Gong, the banned evil cult in China,
and believed the Chinese government has been justified to ban the
cult.
</P>
<P>
The criminal facts are convincing and should be made better
known for common understanding of threat by any heterodox groups,
the viewers said after watching a documentary projected at the
Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The documentary, in both Chinese and English, shows horrible
cases of suicides and injuries directly linked to the cult, which
was launched without legal registration in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In one case, Tang Zhihua, a Falun Gong follower in Sichuan
Province in southwest China, cut off his two-year-old son's
genital and then his own because he believed the end of the world
was coming, which was predicted by Falun Gong leader Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 people have died as a result of practicing
Falun Gong and the documentary introduces the victims of the cult
in details.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is justified in banning the cult to
ensure social stability and the interests of innocent people, said
Guo Shen, a senior engineer here.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the unpopular practice of double standards, under
which the United States has never been accused of human rights
violation for its crackdown on Branch Davidian, while China is
attacked for banning a similar cult of evil.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Meng-Ty Tam of Huichun d'Acupuncture Chinoise said that he
has gained a better understanding from the documentary about Falun
Gong's anti-science and anti-social nature.
</P>
<P>
He blasted cult leader Li Hongzhi for calling on followers to
reject any forms of medical treatment for any kind of disease.
</P>
<P>
Many followers died because of Li's warning that if they
otherwise went to hospital or take medicine, his "sacred body"
would be taken away and he would be "no longer able to protect
them."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tam accused the cult of being unable to bear any
disagreement from either an individual or the government, although
it claimed "forbearance".
</P>
<P>
Other viewers pointed out that the so-called "non-political"
organization is, in fact, quite political as it is inciting anti-
Chinese government movements both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
They called for better popularization of the evidence to let
the world know more clearly about the evil nature of Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Advanced Beef Processing Line Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 22 (Xinhua)-- An advanced production line for
fast-food beef processing, the largest in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, began constructing here recently.
</P>
<P>
The production line will import advanced equipment and
technologies from Germany, Denmark and Japan, and the plant design
to reach production standards set by the United States and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the assembly line will be the most advanced one
in China with an annual production capacity of 40,000 tons of fast-
food beef.
</P>
<P>
As part of the beef processing project, two stock farms each
raising some 12,000 head of well-bred beef cattle have been set up
in Zhongjiang County and Wanyuan City, according to Mayor Xiang
Shoufu.
</P>
<P>
Another slaughterhouse is also being built now, and it will
have a yearly butchering capacity of some 50,000 head of cattle
and turning out 10,000 tons of beef when finished.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Hengyuan Stock Farm in the city has introduced
a special breed of beef cattle from Australia, and the farm will
allocate the calves to many farmers to aid their economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province used to be a large pig producing region, but
this year it has made an adjustment to its stock raising structure
and is making efforts to develop a beef cattle producing industry.
The new processing line is one of five key agricultural
development projects in the province.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Law to Pardon Honor Killers Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian House of Deputies
(lower house of parliament) has rejected a government proposal to
drop clauses in the Penal Code which pardons men who kill their
female relatives in the name of honor.
</P>
<P>
During a heated House debate on Sunday, a sweeping majority of
deputies turned down the proposal, warning it would "legalize
obscenity, adultery and destroy Islamic ethics," the semi-official
Jordan Times newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move dealt a heavy blow to human rights campaigners who had
been garnering signatures across the desert kingdom to cancel
Article 340, which they said seriously discriminates against the
rights of women.
</P>
<P>
The article pardons or hands down lenient prison terms ranging
from six months to two years to men who killed their female
relatives for alleged illicit affairs with men out of the wedlock.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Jordanian women died each year in the alleged honor
killings, and the executors are often their husbands, fathers,
cousins or other male relatives.
</P>
<P>
The government headed by Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh
had agreed to make amendments to the Penal Code to abolish
Article 340 under increasing pressure from human rights and press
groups.
</P>
<P>
However, while rejecting the government proposal, deputies of
the House lashed out at groups that had campaigned to cancel the
article, saying they represent neither the Jordanian society, nor
its Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies also blamed the campaigns against honor killings
as "byproducts of foreign attempts to infiltrate Jordanian
society and demoralize women."
</P>
<P>
During the House session, only one deputy from the Madaba
district spoke in favor of the government proposal to drop
Article 340, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Feminists and human rights groups said they were disappointed
at the House decision, which they said failed to reflect the will
of the people.
</P>
<P>
The national Campaign to Eliminate Crimes of Honor, an
independent organization, had garnered over 15,000 signatures
during a month-long campaign across the kingdom, and claimed that
70 percent of those it approached had signed the petition to
eliminate Article 340.

<HEADLINE> At least 29 Elephants Poached in Kenya Since April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 29 elephants have
been poached in Kenya since the partially lifting of a world ban
on trade in ivory in April this year, five times the average over
the past six years, according to an advisor to Kenya's Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
The advisor, Paula Kahumbu, said that the limited easing of a
worldwide ban is encouraging illegal poaching of elephants in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of legal trade in ivory was premature, the East
African Standard newspaper Monday quoted Kahumbu as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species banned all trade in ivory 10 years ago in an
effort to stem the slaughter of African elephants.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, it allowed Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to
sell 60 tons of ivory in stock to Japan on an experimental basis.

<HEADLINE> COMESA, Tanzania Negotiate on Later's Intended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) is still negotiating with Tanzania on
later's intended quit from the sub-regional organization, the
Zambia Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said in Lusaka at the
weekend that as consultations continues Tanzania remains a full
committed member.
</P>
<P>
A few month ago, Tanzania cited inability of its companies and
economy to effectively compete against other members who are
involved in a zero rating program as the reason to quit the
COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said that the 12-month notice of intentions to pull out
applies to Tanzania and during the period it continues to perform
as a full member.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania's goods continue to enjoy the special treatment
enjoyed by all other COMESA members, " the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the notice of intention to quit, Tanzania
continues to reduce its tariffs in line with the provisions of the
COMESA treaty.
</P>
<P>
The zero rating exercise will lead to the creation of a free
trade area in the sub-region by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 21 members, four have reduced their tariffs by 90
percent, six have reduced by 80 percent, one by 70 percent, and
three have reduced their tariffs by 60 percent.

LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Lord Archer was facing the prospect of both civil and
criminal proceedings after dramatically pulling out of the race to
be London mayor.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- John Major was under pressure from senior Tories to stand as
the Conservative candidate for London mayor in succession to Lord
Archer, who resigned Saturday following disclosures that he was
prepared to lie in a 1987 court case.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>

Northern Ireland.

<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>

The Guardian:

CAIRO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's exports to the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa member states stood at 27.3 million U.S. dollars
in the first two quarters of 1999, up by 107 percent from 13.2
million dollars the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bilateral trade volume hit 106.5 million dollars, up
by 36.3 percent from 78.2 million dollars in the same period of
1998, said Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef
Boutros Ghali Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ang Lee Hopes New Film Inspires Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua)-- "I'm trying to make some good
Chinese films to give Chinese speaking people some hope for their
own films," said Ang Lee, the Taiwanese director famous for
directing English-language films, at a recent conference.
</P>
<P>
His new film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" marks his return
to Chinese-language features, and with shooting currently underway
in Beijing it is attracting a flock of media coverage, some from
Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman" of 1994 won the Golden Bear Award
at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1995, Lee directed
his first English-language film, "Sense and Sensibility", which
went on to garner seven Academy Award nominations.
</P>
<P>
Described as "'Sense and Sensibility' meets martial arts," the
15 million-dollar film is based on a series of novels published in
Shanghai during the 1920s. Set during the Qing Dynasty in early
19th century China, it is the story of two women -- one an
aristocrat's daughter who disguises herself as a subversive outlaw,
and a woman warrior who is assigned to track down the mysterious
criminal.
</P>
<P>
Lee said martial arts are peculiarly Chinese and different from
Hollywood action. "It's new for me as well. The reason I chose
this topic and am shooting the film in Xinjiang, Hangzhou, Beijing
and Chengde is I'm trying to make a Chinese film."
</P>
<P>
"Even a small kid in Taiwan considers watching Chinese-language
films a sign of low taste. We're trying to attract Chinese
moviegoers and change the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
"Most Chinese films that become famous in the States are not
necessarily big at the box office. The Chinese-speaking population
is the largest in the world but why are they all going for English
films?"
</P>
<P>
Lee said he expects that half of his new film's audience will
be Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Talking of his earlier films "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat
Drink Man Woman," Lee attributed their success to the detailed
description of common Chinese human nature, which is shared by all
individuals. "It is not necessary to use foreigners to portray
human nature, but on the other hand, the unique Chinese culture
will never be replaced by that of any other country."
</P>
<P>
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" starring Michelle Yeoh, Chow
Yun-fat, and Zhang Ziyi will be released internationally next
summer.

KAMPALA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a
26 million dollar-loan to finance research and training farmers
in new farming technologies and boosting commercial farming in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be the second phase in a long-term program of
WB's assistance to agricultural research and extension in the
African country, according to a Monitor daily report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The six-year project will be implemented by the National
Agricultural Research Organization from 1999, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The loan will emphasize demand-driven, client-oriented
research and promote the active participation of farmers and the
private agri-business sector in research planning, implementation
and impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
The first two years will concentrate on moving existing
technology and research from the shelves of institutes to
farmers' fields, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The funding is available but it will be subject to the
approval by the Uganda Parliament, the WB Public Information
Assistant (Uganda) Agnes Biribwona was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> BOT Official Foresees Better Income in Thai Commercial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai commercial banks should
be recording higher operating income next year because of economic
recovery and lower provisioning requirements, the Nation newspaper
Monday quoted a Bank of Thailand (BOT) senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tarisa Watanagase, assistant governor of BOT's Financial
Institutions Policy Group, said that Thailand's banking system
will require a lower amount of additional provisions than this
year because some banks have set provisions above the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, has told
commercial banks to set aside at least 60 percent of required
provisions at the end of this year, 80 percent by the middle of
next year and 100 percent at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Tarisa said that the banking system has already set aside total
provisions of 800 billion baht (20.8 billion U.S. dollars), and
they need an additional 100 billion baht (2.6 billion dollars) for
next year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, non-performing loans (NPLs) have gradually declined
due to corporate-debt restructuring, she said.
</P>
<P>
It is a good trend because banks do not need a large amount of
new money to cover any rise in NPLs, she said.
</P>
<P>
Thai banks have struggled with bad performance this year
because they have high costs and have to put aside operating
income for loan loss provision, she said.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of this year, the net loss of Bangkok
Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, reached 40.85 billion
baht (1.06 billion dollars), while the second largest one, Krung
Thai bank, recorded a net loss of 44.5 billion baht (1.16 billion
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Agree to Stop Border Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The commanders of Pakistan
Rangers and Indian Border Security Force have agreed to
immediately halt cross-border firing and to make no attempts to
alter the status of the working boundary, reported a local
newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day biannual meeting, which concluded in
Lahore, capital of Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, the two
sides also agreed to put an immediate end to firing across the
border targeting innocent civilians, said The News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed exchange of firing along the working
boundary, joint patrolling, illegal border crossing and
maintenance of boundary pillars.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smuggling measures being taken by the two sides to prevent
the flow of contraband as well as narcotics were also discussed,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, exchange of firing across the Line of Control (LoC),
which divides the disputed Kashmir between the two South Asian
countries, were frequent.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan army sources, three people were killed
and five others injured in Indian firing near the LoC on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Huge Frozen Food Stranded in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Huge frozen food has remained
stranded in Chittagong, Khulna and Cox'x Bazar as well as several
other production points of Bangladesh due to disruption of
communications, The Financial Express reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Work stoppage at the sea port of Mongla and frequent strikes
called by the opposition political parties caused the disruption
hampering production and transportation of the sea food, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association apprehended that
the sector may not achieve its export target unless the situation
improves.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned about 274.43 million U.S. dollars by
exporting some 58.35 million pounds of frozen food in the 1998-99
fiscal year against the target of 350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh's share of frozen food in the
international marketer is less than two percent as against the
combined total of nearly 20 percent by India, Thailand and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to seafood exporters, Bangladesh has the capacity to
meet five percent of the international demand provided the
exporters are backed by proper policy support from the government.

<HEADLINE> Grant Gets off Canvas to Stop Golota in 10th Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Unbeaten Michael Grant was
hoping to make a statement Sunday night against Andrew Golota. He
did in the first round and again in the 10th round in Atlantic
City, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Grant survived a pair of first-round knockdowns to unleash a
barrage of punches and stop Golota midway through the 10th round
to assume the role as the heavyweight division's No. 1 contender.
</P>
<P>
Grant, who may be the most physically gifted of the top
heavyweights, had his chin and heart tested early by the hard-
punching Golota. He was dropped late in the first round but easily
beat the count of referee Randy Neumann. While dazed, Grant was
dropped again, just before the bell. He again beat the count, got
back to his corner and regrouped.
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I got knocked down in the first down this would be
a test of my faith," Grant said. "I wasn't going to get counted
out, I wasn't going to quit, it's not even in me. I sustained with
my ability and I used my god-given talent."
</P>
<P>
After an uneventful second round, Grant had a point deducted in
the third for holding and hitting. Golota, who has had problems
fighting within the rules, had a point taken away in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Grant began to gain confidence and appeared to be seizing
control in the fifth and sixth rounds. But Golota rallied and the
fight was tight heading into the ninth, when the Polish native put
together a strong round.
</P>
<P>
The first 60 seconds of the 10th round were uneventful until
Grant landed a powerful overhand right. Sensing Golota was hurt,
Grant landed a 15-punch barrage that included a right cross that
did heavy damage. Finally, Golota crumpled to the canvas but
managed to beat Neumann's count.
</P>
<P>
Neumann checked Golota and asked the fighter if he was ready to
fight. Golota did not respond. When Neumann asked again, Golota
responded no. Neumann asked a third time and Golota appeared to
shake his head no.
</P>
<P>
"(Trainer Don Turner) told me I had to knock him out, you know
what you got to do," grant admitted. "And still, I didn't go in to
knock him out. I tried to use my speed. Golota had a hard time
finding my jab when I was moving behind it."
</P>
<P>
"The only way he could win was to work, work, work," Turner
said."I told him the round before he was behind and he had to
knock the guy out. Forget about things and throw punches. We found
out he is a real fighter tonight."
</P>
<P>
At the time of the stoppage, Golota was comfortably ahead on
two scorecards, 86-81 and 87-80, and leading 85-83 on the third.
</P>
<P>
The loss drops the 31-year-old Golota to 34-4 while Grant
improved to 31-0 following his 22nd knockout.
</P>
<P>
While Grant is considered the top threat to unified champion
Lennox Lewis' three titles, he may have to wait at least another
fight to get his shot.
</P>
<P>
"That is the fight I want," the 27-year-old Grant said. "I have
wanted that fight since six fights ago. If they make the fight,
they make the fight, I am not going to pressure anybody to make
the fight. When my time comes, I'll be ready."

<HEADLINE> BOT Official Foresees Better Income in Thai Commercial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai commercial banks should
be recording higher operating income next year because of economic
recovery and lower provisioning requirements, the Nation newspaper
Monday quoted a Bank of Thailand (BOT) senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tarisa Watanagase, assistant governor of BOT's Financial
Institutions Policy Group, said that Thailand's banking system
will require a lower amount of additional provisions than this
year because some banks have set provisions above the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, has told
commercial banks to set aside at least 60 percent of required
provisions at the end of this year, 80 percent by the middle of
next year and 100 percent at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Tarisa said that the banking system has already set aside total
provisions of 800 billion baht (20.8 billion U.S. dollars), and
they need an additional 100 billion baht (2.6 billion dollars) for
next year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, non-performing loans (NPLs) have gradually declined
due to corporate-debt restructuring, she said.
</P>
<P>
It is a good trend because banks do not need a large amount of
new money to cover any rise in NPLs, she said.
</P>
<P>
Thai banks have struggled with bad performance this year
because they have high costs and have to put aside operating
income for loan loss provision, she said.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of this year, the net loss of Bangkok
Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, reached 40.85 billion
baht (1.06 billion dollars), while the second largest one, Krung
Thai bank, recorded a net loss of 44.5 billion baht (1.16 billion
dollars).

ISLAMABAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The commanders of Pakistan
Rangers and Indian Border Security Force have agreed to
immediately halt cross-border firing and to make no attempts to
alter the status of the working boundary, reported a local
newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day biannual meeting, which concluded in
Lahore, capital of Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, the two

boundary, joint patrolling, illegal border crossing and
maintenance of boundary pillars.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smuggling measures being taken by the two sides to prevent
the flow of contraband as well as narcotics were also discussed,
said the report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Huge Frozen Food Stranded in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Huge frozen food has remained
stranded in Chittagong, Khulna and Cox'x Bazar as well as several
other production points of Bangladesh due to disruption of
communications, The Financial Express reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Work stoppage at the sea port of Mongla and frequent strikes
called by the opposition political parties caused the disruption
hampering production and transportation of the sea food, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association apprehended that
the sector may not achieve its export target unless the situation
improves.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned about 274.43 million U.S. dollars by
exporting some 58.35 million pounds of frozen food in the 1998-99
fiscal year against the target of 350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh's share of frozen food in the
international marketer is less than two percent as against the
combined total of nearly 20 percent by India, Thailand and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to seafood exporters, Bangladesh has the capacity to
meet five percent of the international demand provided the
exporters are backed by proper policy support from the government.

<HEADLINE> Young Hungarians Launch Anti-Nuclear Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 21 (Xinhua) -- An organization composed of
young Hungarians on Sunday launched a signature drive to oppose a
possible deployment of nuclear weapons by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) in their country.
</P>
<P>
Vasarhelzi Arpad, chairman of the organization, the Left-Front
Worker Youth League Union, said at a news conference that the
Hungarian government should keep its promise "not to allow the
deployment of nuclear arms" made during the referendum last
November on whether the country should join NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization, which always opposes Hungary's entry
into NATO, considers that certain Hungarian leaders were
irresponsible when making remarks on NATO nuclear deployment.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian premier Viktor Orban told a press interview earlier
November that Budapest would have to consider a NATO request to
deploy nuclear arms on its territory in the case of a global
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The youth union leader called one all political forces in
Hungary to unite and oppose any deployment of nuclear weapons in
the Hungarian territory.
</P>
<P>
Hungary joined the NATO in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Grant Gets off Canvas to Stop Golota in 10th Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Unbeaten Michael Grant was
hoping to make a statement Sunday night against Andrew Golota. He
did in the first round and again in the 10th round in Atlantic
City, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Grant survived a pair of first-round knockdowns to unleash a
barrage of punches and stop Golota midway through the 10th round
to assume the role as the heavyweight division's No. 1 contender.
</P>
<P>
Grant, who may be the most physically gifted of the top
heavyweights, had his chin and heart tested early by the hard-
punching Golota. He was dropped late in the first round but easily
beat the count of referee Randy Neumann. While dazed, Grant was
dropped again, just before the bell. He again beat the count, got
back to his corner and regrouped.
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I got knocked down in the first down this would be
a test of my faith," Grant said. "I wasn't going to get counted
out, I wasn't going to quit, it's not even in me. I sustained with
my ability and I used my god-given talent."
</P>
<P>
After an uneventful second round, Grant had a point deducted in
the third for holding and hitting. Golota, who has had problems
fighting within the rules, had a point taken away in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Grant began to gain confidence and appeared to be seizing
control in the fifth and sixth rounds. But Golota rallied and the
fight was tight heading into the ninth, when the Polish native put
together a strong round.
</P>
<P>
The first 60 seconds of the 10th round were uneventful until
Grant landed a powerful overhand right. Sensing Golota was hurt,
Grant landed a 15-punch barrage that included a right cross that
did heavy damage. Finally, Golota crumpled to the canvas but
managed to beat Neumann's count.
</P>
<P>
Neumann checked Golota and asked the fighter if he was ready to
fight. Golota did not respond. When Neumann asked again, Golota
responded no. Neumann asked a third time and Golota appeared to
shake his head no.
</P>
<P>
"(Trainer Don Turner) told me I had to knock him out, you know
what you got to do," grant admitted. "And still, I didn't go in to
knock him out. I tried to use my speed. Golota had a hard time
finding my jab when I was moving behind it."
</P>
<P>
"The only way he could win was to work, work, work," Turner
said."I told him the round before he was behind and he had to
knock the guy out. Forget about things and throw punches. We found
out he is a real fighter tonight."
</P>
<P>
At the time of the stoppage, Golota was comfortably ahead on
two scorecards, 86-81 and 87-80, and leading 85-83 on the third.
</P>
<P>
The loss drops the 31-year-old Golota to 34-4 while Grant
improved to 31-0 following his 22nd knockout.
</P>
<P>
While Grant is considered the top threat to unified champion
Lennox Lewis' three titles, he may have to wait at least another
fight to get his shot.
</P>
<P>
"That is the fight I want," the 27-year-old Grant said. "I have
wanted that fight since six fights ago. If they make the fight,
they make the fight, I am not going to pressure anybody to make
the fight. When my time comes, I'll be ready."

JAKARTA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed over the weekend in sporadic communal clashes in Ambon and
some of its surroundings in Indonesia's Maluku province, according
to national newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Following overnight clashes which claimed five lives, the
violence resumed on Sunday in the Nania subdistrict.
</P>
<P>
Another two died from gunshots, which also injured five other
residents.
</P>
<P>
Several houses and shops in the nearby Mardika district were
earlier on Sunday set on fire by a group of unidentified people.
The dawn attack started with home-made bomb explosions and
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted eyewitnesses as saying that security
troops deployed to the scene were unable to take immediate action
to quell the unrest.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 houses were also reportedly torched or looted.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said violence involved residents in the villages of
Durian Patah, Waiheru, Negeri Lama, Nania and Lehitu.
</P>
<P>
The violence was sparked by an incident on Friday when a group
of villagers, believed to be from Lehitu, pelted passing cars from
the village of Nania.
</P>
<P>
Angered by their action, residents then fought back but were
quickly intervened by security forces who rushed to the area.
</P>
<P>
The unabated riots in the province have left infants facing
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency reported that in the last couple of
weeks that baby's milk was in short in markets across the
province.
</P>
<P>
Many vendors of basic foodstuffs have fled the province as
communal clashes, which have prevailed in the Maluku islands for
almost the whole year, are providing little indication of coming
to an end.
</P>
<P>
Over 350 people were reported killed in the series of worst
communal conflicts which have hit the spices-rich province since
January.

<HEADLINE> Pristina Airport Closed to Investigate U.N. Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo decided to close down the Pristina
airport Sunday to investigate the crash of a U.N. airplane.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug reported that all of the
24 people aboard were killed when the U.N. World Food Program
flight from Rome to Pristina struck a remote mountain 40
kilometers north of Kosovo on November 12.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities said that the flight over Kosovo
violated the Yugoslav sovereignty and the U.N. Security Council
resolution 1244. The peacekeeping force refused to cooperate with
the Yugoslav air traffic supervision organ and allowed the
airplane to fly over Yugoslav airspace illegally, which were the
direct cause of the crash, the authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Downs Hingis to Win Chase Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Second-seeded American
Lindsay Davenport played what she termed her best match ever to
dominate No. 1 Martina Hingis and win the Chase Championships on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After reaching the final twice before, Davenport dispatched
Hingis, 6-4, 6-2 in a little more than hour to win the WTA Tour's $
2 million season-ending event for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"Just going out to the match, I wanted to be really aggressive
and go for winners," said Davenport, who earned $500,000 for
winning her seventh singles title of the year.
</P>
<P>
"I played my best match ever, and to end my year with that is
really great," the winner added.
</P>
<P>
This season had the 23-year-old Davenport hold the No. 1
ranking for more than a month at the start of the year and for a
portion in the summer. She also capturd her second career Grand
Slam title at Wimbledon, and led the United States to victory over
Russia in the Fed Cup crown.
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old from Switzerland, Hingis fell to 1-2 in finals
here at Madison Square Garden. Last season, she defeated then-No.
1 Davenport in four sets, and in 1996 she lost to Steffi Graf in
five sets.
</P>
<P>
This year's final was only a best-of-three sets.
</P>
<P>
"I guess that was a pretty solid performance," said Hingis, who
received the runner-up check of $250,000. "It was probably her
best match against me, but it's tough to come back consecutive
days and play your best."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hingis won a tight two-set match over third seed
Venus Williams of the United States in the semifinals while
Davenport had an easier time against No. 6 Nathalie Tauziat of
France." In a match between the only players to hold the No. 1
ranking since March 1997,Davenport got off to an excellent start.
She broke serve right away,then held, taking a 2-0 lead with a
service winner and two aces.
</P>
<P>
After Hingis struggled to hold her next service game, Davenport
easily went up 3-1. The American broke again, continuing to pounce
on Hingis' second serve, which usually topped out at around 70 mph.
After losing her serve in the fifth game, Hingis tossed her racket,
bringing about a chorus of boos from a mostly packed house.
</P>
<P>
"I got a little frustrated about some calls, not like the way I
played, of course," Hingis said. "But I think I've been able to
control myself a little bit more. I missed some shots that I wasn'
t supposed to miss, but things like that (bad calls) makes it even
harder."
</P>
<P>
The release of anger must have been good for Hingis as she
gained one of the breaks back, and won her own serve to move to 3-
4. She went ahead love-30 on Davenport's serve but hit three
straight errors.
</P>
<P>
Hingis again held serve and moved within two points of evening
the match. However, Davenport regrouped, hitting an ace and
nailing a cross-court backhand winner. After Hingis' backhand went
wide,Davenport closed out the 36-minute set with a cross-court
backhand volley.
</P>
<P>
"That's why it's always important to get two breaks on Martina,
"Davenport said of Hingis' resurgence in the middle of the set."
Serving at 4-3 after being up 4-1, that was probably the most
nervewracking; even for the set at 5-4 and love-30, the few points
I was able to win in both games, to win that first set, because
she was definitely coming back, getting a little bit more
confident and not making so many effors."
</P>
<P>
The second set began more promising for Hingis, who easily held
serve. But Davenport charged ahead toward her 26th-career singles
title by winning the next three games. The Swiss teen held serve
one last time before Davenport tore through three more games. She
served three aces and a service winner to claim her second
tournament victory in New York, having won the U.S. Open in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Davenport was superior in almost every catagory. She finished
with nine aces, won 83 percent of her first serves, hit 36 winners
and just 12 double faults.
</P>
<P>
Hingis moved from singles action to doubles play, where she
paired with Russian Anna Kournikova to win their fifth title of
the year. The top seeds posted a 6-4, 6-4 victory over No. 4
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain and Latvia's Larisa Neiland. They
will share the $200,000 first prize.
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Kournikova also won the Australian Open, and
appeared in the final of the French Open. However, Hingis will
team with Mary Pierce to begin the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the women's final, Jana Novotna, who announced her
retirement after losing at the U.S. Open, was honored with a
ceremony.A video tribute was shown and Novotna was given serveral
gifts,including a mountain bicycle. She won 24 career singles
titles,including the 1997 Wimbledon crown, and 76 doubles
tournaments over a 12-year career.
</P>
<P>
The doubles match signaled the end of another career as Neiland
retired after 16 seasons. She won six Grand Slam titles -- two
women's doubles and four mixed-doubles crowns. Neiland, who also
competed under her maiden name of Savchenko, captured her 69th
career doubles title last month in Leipzig, Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- For the second time in two
months, Canadian Sebastien Lareau and American Alex O'Brien
defeated top-ranked Indians Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in
Connecticut, the United States for a major championship.
</P>
<P>
Lareau and O'Brien claimed their first ATP Tour World Doubles
Championship Sunday by making quick work of Bhupathi and Paes, 6-3,
6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The duo needed only 86 minutes to claim their eighth doubles
title as a team and fourth this season. They posted a 7-6, 6-4 win
over the Indians in September's U.S. Open final.
</P>
<P>
The day's victory will allow Lareau and O'Brien to finish No. 2
in the world behind Bhupathi and Paes when the final ATP doubles
rankings are released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Runners-up in 1996, Lareau and O'Brien pocketed a total of $170,
000 for the week, having accumulated $90,000 in winnings up to
today's match and an additional $80,000 for claiming the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
It was a disappointing end to the season for Bhupathi and Paes,
who also lost in the 1997 final to Rick Leach and Jonathan Stark.
</P>
<P>
The Indians won three titles in 1999 and became the first team
in 47 years to reach the final at all four Grand Slams, winning
the French Open and Wimbledon. They were seeking their 16th
doubles title together.

<HEADLINE> Croatia to Put Off Parliamentary Elections: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Croatia is to postpone the
planned December 22 parliamentary elections till January 27, 2000,
due to President Franjo Tudjman's health problems, a spokeswoman
from the presidential office said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted the spokeswoman, Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, as
saying that as the president was currently under intensive care at
hospital, he failed to sign the decision to hold the parliamentary
elections for December 22.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 77-year-old Tudjman has suffered internal
hemorrhaging and other complications after emergency intestinal
surgery on November 1, and received another operation on November
13. Now blood toxicosis is the major threat to his life.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at preventing a political crisis triggered by Tudjman's
deteriorating health, the ruling party submitted on Saturday a
bill to the opposition group in the parliament on how to cope with
the situation when the president is temporarily incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposed that powers should be transferred to
Parliament Speaker Vlatko Pavletic when the president was too sick
to perform his duties.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear when the parliament would make the decision
because it is in recess until November 27, when it is expected to
dissolve ahead of new parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman, who led his country to independence from the former
Yugoslavia in 1991, has been reportedly suffering from cancer
since 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan will pay a friendly visit to Myanmar soon, according to
an official announcement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first Thai high-ranking official to visit
Myanmar since the siege of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok on
October 1 by five Myanmar gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Surin's visit is seen as seeking ways to improve the strained
Thai-Myanmar relations following the incident.
</P>
<P>
Surin's trip also came more than a month after Myanmar closed
its border with Thailand and temporarily suspended fishing
concession in Myanmar waters by Thai fishing vessels as a response
to the Thai handling of the embassy siege incident.
</P>
<P>
Surin is expected to meet his Myanmar counterpart U Win Aung
and issues of the handling of the embassy siege, lifting of
fishing concession suspension, reopening of border and
resettlement of anti-government Myanmar students in exile in
Thailand will top the agenda of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Five Myanmar gunmen, who are all students, stormed their
country's embassy in Bangkok and held embassy staff, their
families and some foreigners as hostages on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully on the next day with all the 89
hostages freed before the gunmen were flown by the Thai side of
the Thai-Myanmar border after negotiations in exchange for the
hostages.

<HEADLINE> Owen May Drop to Under 21s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Wonder boy Michael Owen could
be picked for the England Under-21s' Euro 2000 play-off against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan claimed Under-21 boss Howard
Wilkinson has the right to pick the 19-year-old Liverpool striker
for the yet-to-be-arranged game even though he is a regular with
the senior side.
</P>
<P>
Owen failed to sparkle in England's two games with Scotland in
the Euro 2000 play-offs and Keegan believed he might benefit from
playing with the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said in the Independent on Sunday: "Although the nation
might see it as a real comedown if Michael was called into the
Under-21s, Howard has got the right to pick any of them."
</P>

He added: "Maybe he's still got things to learn. I've already
said to him he needs to work on his left side.
</P>
<P>
"But he's 19 years of age. He's got potential. He could hold
the ball up better, but it was more due to a lack of games and
lack of service," said Keegan.

Sunday.
</P>
<P>
England's Richard Burns took round one in his Battle of Britain

McRae another four places back.

But the time gaps are small compared to the major legs of the

<HEADLINE> West Ham Defeats Sheffield Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- West Ham United late rally gave
them a 4-3 victory over 10-men Sheffield Wednesday at the English
premier league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday had been in an edge to score their first away
victory of the season in the match. Bottom club Wednesday have
scored only once away from home all season -- an own goal in a 1-1
draw with fellow strugglers Bradford in August -- but they looked
set for a much-needed victory as they led 3-2 following Andy Booth
's 65th minute goal.
</P>
<P>
But referee Alan Wilkie reduced the Yorkshire side to 10
players after 67 minutes by dismissing Northern Irish midfielder
Danny Sonner for an innocuous-looking challenge on Paolo Di Canio
who writhed dramatically on ground.
</P>
<P>
A minute later, West Ham were level when Marc-Vivien Foe
scrambled the ball in after Trevor Sinclair headed across the
goalmouth and Frank Lampard settled it after 76 minutes with a
fierce left-footed drive into the bottom corner.
</P>
<P>
Wilkie had helped West Ham level matters at 2-2 in the 62nd
minute as Sinclair tumbled under a challenge in the area from Wim
Jonk although little contact appeared to have been made. Di Canio
tucked in the resulting penalty.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Paulo Wanchope had opened the scoring after 28
minutes with his sixth of the season before Petr Rudi made amends
for a bad miss with a pinpoint drive for Wednesday's equaliser 10
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Wim Jonk capitalised on Wednesday's growing confidence with a
48th minute goal after good work from Gilles De Bilde to put his
side 2-1 ahead but it was not to be Wednesday's day.
</P>
<P>
They have been bottom of the table for three months with only
one win all season.

<HEADLINE> TV Industry Faces Opportunities And Challenges After WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Whether domestic color TV
producers will face big challenges after China enters WTO has draw
the attention of many people recently.
</P>
<P>
Major players in the television industry have commented that
the WTO entry will not cause major price reductions in color
televisions produced in China. In fact, China's entry into the WTO
will facilitate domestic products to further establish their
status in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Chen Weihong, general manager of the Konka Group, commented on
the Sino-US bilateral agreement on China's accession to WTO by
saying that trade barriers for Chinese exports will be removed
after the WTO entry, helping Chinese TV makers expand their market
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that as many foreign competitors have established
production bases in China, China is fully capable of producing and
processing any basic TV materials domestically.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hongsheng, board director of the Changhong Group, said
that China's WTO entry will bring fiercer competition to his
company, adding that Changhong will no longer a "hero in the
domestic competition".
</P>
<P>
China produces 30 million color TV sets each year, but the
domestic demand is only 20 million.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Changhong Group, China's largest TV
producer, announced that it would slash the prices of its color
televisions. A number of leading domestic TV producers immediately
followed suit, including Konka and Panda.
</P>
<P>
Market observers say that the price war has reduced the number
of small color TV producers and help promote the concentration of
TV producers and the production of famous brand products.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China witnessed a similar price war. By the end of
that year, the market share of four big TV providers -- Changhong,
Konka, Panda and TCL -- skyrocketed more than 50 percent. A year
later, this figure climbed to 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that these changes are a sign that the domestic TV
market is becoming more established, with domestically-made color
TVs taking an eighty percent share. Slight changes in the price of
foreign TV will therefore not significantly affect the domestic
market.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservatives Search for London Mayor Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition
Conservative Party on Sunday restarted the task of finding its
candidate in the first ever election of a London mayor after its
first choice, millionaire novelist Jeffrey Archer, quit the race
over a 13-year-old scandal.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party Chairman Michael Ancram said they had
considered giving the nomination to former Transport Minister
Steven Norris but decided he would always be regarded as a
"second-best" candidate if they did.
</P>
<P>
Following a 90-minute meeting of the party's London mayoral
selection executive, he announced the party would be re-running
the selection procedure which should see the new candidate in
place by mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Tory leader, William Hague, accused millionaire novelist, Lord
Archer, of letting the party down.
</P>
<P>
Lord Archer could be facing criminal charges after the
weekend's revelations.
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard has confirmed it is considering criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Archer quit as the Conservative candidate for the May election
after a newspaper said he asked a friend to lie to lawyers to
provide an alibi in a legal case involving a prostitute.

<HEADLINE> Courageous Reform Urged by "Third Way" Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema and other "third way" leaders Sunday called for a
"courageous reform" for the future on the top-level summit
"Progressive Governance in the XXI Century" held in Italian
central city of Florence.
</P>
<P>
A "fearless vision" is needed as globalization brings both
risks and opportunities, said D'Alema, adding that it is not via
the markets alone that solutions to problems can be found.
</P>
<P>
The summit, also attended by European Commission President
Romano Prodi, U.S President Bill Clinton, Britain's Labor Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Socialist Premier Lionel Jospin of France,
Germany's Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardoso, focused on what has
been labeled the "third way" of government between the traditional
concepts of free-market liberalism and socialism.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Blair saw isolationism as one of the chief problems
facing politicians in the 21st century. It is only within the
