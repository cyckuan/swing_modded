<HEADLINE> Bombing Attack in Tel Aviv Kills 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty people, probably
including the suicide bomber, were killed and 126 others were
wounded during this afternoon's blast in the city center of Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
This was officially announced tonight by Eric Bar-Chen, foreign
press liaison official of Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The bomber blew himself up in crowds of people at around 4:00
p.m. local time (14:00GMT) just outside the Dizengof shopping
center, the busiest area in the city.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the scene and medical workers and other
volunteers rushed to the site to rescue the victims.
</P>
<P>
Buildings near the blast site were damaged by the large bomb,
which is reportedly between 10-15 kilograms TNT.
</P>
<P>
The explosion came just one day after a suicide bombing attack
in Jerusalem, which left 19 dead and 15 others wounded, and it is
the fourth bombing attack over eight days inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel army has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, following last Sunday twin bombing attacks in
Jerusalem and Ashkelon, barring Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, which decided to impose a list of new
security measures Sunday, is holding a special cabinet meeting at the
Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv at this hour to discuss the new
situation after today's bombing attack.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's leading woman
swimmer Penny Heyns today broke the women's world 100 metres
breaststroke record on the second day of the national swimming
championships at the King's Park Pool in Durban.
</P>
<P>
Penny Heyns, 21, clocked 67.46 seconds to erase the time of
67.69 seconds set by Australian Samantha Riley at the 1994 world
championships in Rome, Italy.
</P>
<P>
In her heat of qualifying, Heyns immediately streaked into a
commanding lead, but only reached the turn in a "slowish" 32.19
seconds, which was 0.33 seconds slower than Riley's split when
the Austrialian set her record.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Africa's queen of the pool torpedoed
through the last 50 metres to finish almost 10 metres clear of
her nearest heat rival, and the large crowd eruptd when she
touched.
</P>
<P>
Heyns's previous personal best was 67.84 seconds, 0.15 off the
record, when she won a world student games gold medal in Fukuoka,
Japan, last August.
</P>
<P>
Heyns, from Kwazulu/Natal province, is now studying psychology at
the University of Nebraska.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister Checks Pipeline in Southern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid arrived in Turkey today to check the condition of the
Yumurtalik-kirkuk pipeline, the United Nations-preferred route
for oil exports, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said that he was very positive about the progress of
talks with the U.N. but some points remained to be discussed
further.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry still practices restraint on the
prospects of opening the pipeline, given the conflicting signals
on whether or not Iraq has accepted U.N. resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
"We will welcome the opening of the pipeline in line with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions," Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Omer Akbel said at today's press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil minister will arrive in Ankara Tuesday and
participate in talks with Turkish energy ministry officials and
will pay a courtesy visit to Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said that the issues to be taken up in the talks between
the Iraqi oil minister and Turkish officials are "technical."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said officially late last week that Iraq must
formally accept resolution 986 rather than taking a face-saving
course of accepting its individual terms without mentioning the
resolution. Talks will resume in New York in one week on the
sale, which would allow Iraq to export two billion u.s. dollars of
oil over a six-month period to buy food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador To Nigeria Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria,
Walter Carrington, has returned to his duty post after he was
recalled last November, following the executions of nine Ogoni
activiets for murder in South Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In a statement isuued here today, Carrington said that while
away in Washington, he had taken part in "an ongoing policy
review of Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
"At this stage of the review, the administration has decided
that I should return to Nigeria in order to convey our concerns
and express our views on what is needed to move forward with a
credible democratic transition in Nigeria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Carrington noted that his return should not be misconstrued to
mean support for the three-year transition-to-civil-rule program
announced by the Nigerian military government.
</P>
<P>
"My return should not be interpreted as a lessening of U.S.
concerns over the length of the transition process or the human
rights situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, however, stated definitely that his government
"looks forward to renewing discussions with the Nigerian
leadership".
</P>
<P>
"Realizing the important role Nigeria has played in Africa, we
will continue to urge the government and the Nigerian people to
support the earliest possible restoration of civilian, democratic
government and respect for human rights in Nigeria," he
decleared.
</P>
<P>
Before Carrington's return to Nigeria, the European Union
countries which had recalled their ambassadors to Nigeria for
similar reasons, already sent their ambassadors back to Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Liberal Abandons Pro-US Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sa'eed Rajaie Khorasani, an
Iranian liberal, today declared that he had withdrawn his call for
resuming relations with the United States owing to its latest
pressure on this country.
</P>
<P>
Khorasani, member of parliament and former head of the Iranian
Mission to the U.N., said at a press conference here this evening
that he was forced to "reconsider whether the best proposal at
this juncture is to develop relations with the U.S. or to give it
a better thought."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Khorasani wrote a letter to Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei, calling for the resumptions of ties with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
However, the letter caused a backlash against Khorasani as he
became known as the only parliament member bold enough to support
ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that his previous pro-U.S. stance also led
to rejection of his candidacy by conservative right-wing known as
the Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC).
</P>
<P>
Even moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has to adopt
a tough stance toward relations with the United States because
of tremendous pressures and wide anti-U.S. sentiment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
As the elections campaign started last week in Iran,
Khorasani's name was conspicuously absent from SCC's
list. Nevertheless, he said he is running as an independent. He is
also trying to form his political party.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. conduct, particularly under Clinton
administration, led him to revise his views.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. support for Israel, saying that there
was clear difference between the two countries' positions on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is a very adamant supporter of Israel,
whereas we are a very adamant opposer of Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the U.S. is imposing pressure on the regional
states to usher them into peace with Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. pressure on Arab countries to start
commercial relations with Israel "is not justified."
</P>
<P>
Because of the U.S. support for Israel, he said, Iran could
not welcome good relations with it.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua)--Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov became the first officially registered candidate for
Russian presidency in a ceremony held at the Central Electoral
Commission's headquarters here today.
</P>
<P>
The initiative group which nominates Zyuganov submitted on
February 24 all registration documents and 1.7 million signatures
in his support as well as Zyuganov's income declaration for the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
The commission has already registered 94 initiative groups
which have nominated 78 candidates. A total of 15 groups support
incumbent president Boris Yeltsin, who declared on February 15
that he would run for a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov is expected to be the most strong rival for Yeltsin in
running for his re-election in the presidential polls scheduled
for June 16. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation led by
Zyuganov won 157 seats in the 450-member State Duma, the lower
house of the Russian Parliament, in last December's elections.

TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani today wrapped up his two-day official visit to Tehran and
he expressed hope that Iran will continue its good offices for
ending the crisis in his country.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Afghan
president appreciated Iran's role for solving the problems that
have plagued the Afghan nation during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said that Iran has
undertaken fresh efforts for ending clashes between rival factions
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani did not specify what kind of support Iran
is committed to offering to its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Afghanistan accused Pakistan of trying to perpetuate
civil war in Afghanistan. The two claimed that Pakistan sends in
Taliban forces after giving them military training to overthrow
the Kabul government and pave the trade route to Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said talks with his Afghanistan
counterpart in Tehran focused on the progress of the peace
initiative in that country.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, the Iranian president expressed hope that
Rabbani will further build up relations with other heads of state
in his upcoming visits to other regional countries.

JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua)-- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo today expressed South Africa's "revulsion" at
the bomb blast in Israel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, Nzo said: "Our revulsion at
these cowardly acts is surpassed only (by) our desire to see the
unremitting continuation of the quest for a lasting negotiated
peace in that region."

The bomb exploded on a bus as it travelled through the heart
of Jerusalem's main shopping and entertainment district early on
Sunday, killing 19 people including the bomber, and injuring 10
others.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim fundamentalist organisation, Hamas, claimed
responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Nzo also urged those involved in the middle east peace process
not to be diverted by extremist actions.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's explosion came only a week after two suicide bombings
by Hamas killed 29 people including the bombers.
</P>
<P>
The South African Jewish community yesterday also extended
condolences to the families of the innocent victims. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The second Arab-Russian Businessmen
Forum opened here today with the aim of developing economic
relations between Arab countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Supply and Trade Ahmed Goweili said in his
opening speech that the forum, with the participation of more than
250 Arab and Russian businessmen, is a landmark in the development
of Egyptian-Russian ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the importance of reviving Egyptian-Russian
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1995, he said, the annual volume of trade between
the two countries was estimated at 350 million U.S. dollars on the
average, only about one third of the volume in 1991, which was put
at more than 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries have great potentials in
promoting bilateral trade exchange.
</P>
<P>
The four-day forum will probe means of activating Egyptian
exports to Russia, local media reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian leading businessmen have expressed the hope that the
forum would broaden the scope of trade between Arab countries and
Russia and encourage mutual investment, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The forum would also discuss settling Egypt's debts to Russia,
totaling 950 million Egyptian pounds (279 million U.S. dollars),
reports said.

<HEADLINE> EU External Relations Commissioner Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Hans Van Den Broek, External
Relations Commissioner of European Union (EU), arrived here today
for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, the Dutch Commissioner said "we are
visiting a partner that is preparing for full membership of the EU
and therefore one of the main points of discussion will be how
preparations are continuing, what progress is being made, what
incentives have been given."
</P>
<P>
He said the EU officials, who will attend the ninth meeting of
the EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee starting today, "will
likely to be informed what the perspectives are for a political
settlement (of Cyprus problem), which we consider obviously to be
extremely important."
</P>
<P>
Van Den Broek said he plans to meet with representatives of the
Turkish Cypriot side during his current visit, despite Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash suffered a heart attack Sunday, in a
bid to contribute to the efforts aimed at finding a solution to
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said he will examine ways on how the EU can make a
contribution, together with others, to the special envoys of the
U.N. Secretary-General in finding the means for a political
solution."
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the EU officials, Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides said the EU Commissioner's visit takes place at a
very crucial period and "we look forward to the meetings during
which we will brief him on the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Another issue on the agenda, the Minister added, is the
island's accession course. "We'll have the opportunity to inform
the EU officials on the harmonization process and how the
structured dialogue between the EU and Cyprus goes on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion, applied for
EU full membership in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers decided on March 6, 1995, to start
accession talks with Cyprus six months after the end of the EU
1996 Intergovernmental Conference.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 4 (Xinhua)-- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
today urged Zambian youths to participate in development
activities and enhance democracy and peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba made the call in a speech this evening to
launch this year's Zambia youth week whose theme is
"participation, development and peace".
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the youths should take part in development
activities in their communities because there was so much that
needed to be done and time was not on the side of both the
government and the youths themselves.
</P>
<P>
Allowing the youths to freely participate in enhancing the
young democracy of the country would enable maintainance of peace
required to carry out the development programs already embarked
upon by the government, chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the efforts of those youths who were engaged in
various activities in the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president advised the youths to be alert and
not be cheated by some politicians who would use them to cause
confusion in the presidential and parliamentary elections later
this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Withdraws Temporarily From Tubmanburg, Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG has "temporarily withdrawn" from Tubmanburg
until heavy weaponry captured by a Liberian armed faction is
returned, ECOMOG Commander Maj.-Gen. John Inienger said today.
</P>
<P>
Inienger told newsmen in Liberia's capital Monrovia that
fighters of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J) captured
several pieces of heavy artillery, including seven mortar tubes
and two 1.22-mm guns, last December, when they attacked
peacekeepers deployed in Tubmanburg, some 60 km northwest of
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 peacekeepers were killed in the fighting that
lasted more than nine days.
</P>
<P>
The fighting also uprooted more than 20,000 people from their
houses.
</P>
<P>
Inienger was reported as saying, "several attempts to get
ULIMO-J leader Roosevelt Johnson to release the weapons have all
been to no avail," and adding that efforts by Liberian
government officials and grand elders of the Krahn tribe to
retrieve the weapons have been "thwarted by Johnson".
</P>
<P>
The commander explained that ECOMOG has withdrawn "because the
continued holding of these weapons by ULIMO-J not only poses
threats to the peacekeepers, but to the peace process" in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal leaves ECOMOG troops deployed in Buchanan,
Kakata and Gbarnga in central Liberia, and Greenville City in
southeastern Liberia. enditem

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A New Era Starts in Turkey (by Zheng Jinfa) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- After long years of rivals, two
center-right parties in Turkey have inked a historic protocol for
the formation of a five-year coalition government, thus ushering
in a new era in the country. But the new government faces a
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the protocol between Motherland Party (ANAP)
Chairman Mesut Yilmaz and True Path Party (DYP) leader and
caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is of great significance in
three aspects: reconciliation at the center right, establishing a
system of rotating premiership, and constant consultation with the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, Yilmaz will head the coalition government
on a rotating basis until the end of this year, then Ciller will
take over as prime minister for the next two years. In the fourth
year, Yilmaz will take another turn and in the fifth and final
year, the partnership will be led by a deputy from the DYP until
new elections.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Ciller confirmed that she would
not take part in the coalition government while Yilmaz leads
it. "Someone had to make a sacrifice, and i stepped forward,"
said Ciller, adding: "For us, the promises made before the public
constitute enough guarantees."
</P>
<P>
In the past, Ciller had accepted the idea of a "rotating
premiership," but she insisted on getting the post first, thus
leading to the collapse of the coalition talks between the ANAP
and the DYP.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz also said that his ANAP would fully honor the
commitments undertaken in the protocol.
</P>
<P>
The coalition between the ANAP and the DYP is still 15 seats
short of an absolute majority in the 550-strong parliament. But a
formal pledge by Democratic Left Party (DSP) leader Bulent Ecevit
to support the coalition government in the vote of confidence
ensures its survival.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that the finance portfolio, a bone of
contention between the partners, had in the end gone to the ANAP
and the treasury was given to the DYP.
</P>
<P>
Both Yilmaz and Ciller were under strong pressure to
compromise for the coalition government, which was awaited for
over two months.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was assigned by President Suleyman Demirel to form a
coalition on February 3 after pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
Chairman Necmettin Erbakan and Ciller failed to find partnership
in the parliamentary political parties respectively.
</P>
<P>
Just when the ANAP was about to form a coalition government
with the RP, Ciller made a large compromise and revived the plan
for the coalition formation by agreeing that Yilmaz could take
the premiership first.
</P>
<P>
A majority of over 70 percent of the Turkish citizens support
the coalition government by the ANAP and the DYP in order to keep
the secular, democratic and contemporary character of the republic.
</P>
<P>
The RP opposes Turkey's 43-year-old membership of the NATO. It
is also against a customs union between Turkey and the European
Union, which the RP chairman considers as part of the Western
plot to hold the Moslem world under its economic domination.
</P>
<P>
The protocol between the ANAP and the DYP provides for the
following:
</P>
<P>
-- The enterprises or services run by the public sector,
including public banks, will be rapidly privatized;
</P>
<P>
-- A program for the fight against corruption and for
transparency in state services will be implemented;
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey will continue to follow a constructive policy for the
settlement of problems in the Balkans, the Caucasus and the
Mideast;
</P>
<P>
-- Strategies will be developed to allow Turkey to maintain and
enhance its position as a leader country in its region;
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey will continue making every effort to further improve
its relations with the Turkic Republics and the countries in the
Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
However, the coalition government may not be up to the task of
taming high deficits and runaway inflation, though it has gained
strong support from the majority of the Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
Any new government in Turkey will have to tackle inflation, now
over 80 percent, contain public deficits of about 6 percent of
the gross national product, and narrow the trade gap, estimated
at over 12 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, economic growth has slowed sharply from last
year's level of 7 percent. The turkish Businessmen and
Industrialists' Association now puts the figure closer to 3.3
percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The coalition partners want to put some serious order into the
economy saving measures, speed up privatization starting with
state-owned banks and revamp the social security system. However,
the ANAP and the DYP face some severe handicaps.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Raise Missing Persons Issue in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek government declared today it
would raise the missing issue in Cyprus in the relative
international organizations following Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash's statement on the problem.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, who has ruled the northern part of the divided Cyprus
since 1974, said in a weekend interview with a private Cypriot
television channel that 1,619 Greeks and Greek Cypriots missing in
the 1974 event should be presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told a press
briefing that Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos would raise the
issue at the Turkey-European Union Customs Union Council and seek
explanations from his Turkish counterpart.
</P>
<P>
the Greek government would also send a letter to U.N. Secretary
General Boutros Boutros Ghali who was dealing with the missing
persons issue, while it would further brief non-governmental human
rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Helsinki
Watch, Reppas added.
</P>
<P>
the missing persons issue is one of the major problems which
prevents an overall solution to the long-standing Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The east Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been divided into
Greek Cypriot South and Turkish Cypriot North since 1974 when
Turkey sent troops to take control of one third of its territory.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa, Austria Sign Tax Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Austria
today signed an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Cape Town by South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and Austrian Ambassador to South Africa
Franz Palla, who is heading a high powered Austrian trade
delegation to the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mbeki hailed the agreement
as a catalyst for more Austrian investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian delegation also reaffirmed its support for a
South African free trade agreement with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the recent rumours about Mandela's ill-health,
Mbeki dismissed reports that foreign investors were jittery about
Mandela's health and that this was affecting foreign investment in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Economic Chamber President Leopold
Maderthaner agreed that Mandela's health was not an issue for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The real concern is South Africa's high level of taxation and
its labour legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Austrian delegation held talks with
Deputy President F W de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues discussed were obstacles to foreign
investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
These include the increasing rigidity of South Africa's labour
market, its corporate taxation rates, which were higher than
competitor countries, difficulties for foreign companies in
obtaining work permits for their expatriate employees and
problems in raising loans in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Informed about Denktash' Health Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has been officially informed about the condition of the health of
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash who suffered a heart attack
Sunday, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, the spokesman said
President Clerides was informed by the United Nations
Secretary-General's deputy representative to the island Gustave
Feissel.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Cyprus president had conveyed the message
that the authorities of the Republic were ready to provide any
assistance to the Turkish Cypriot leader, including his transfer
to a hospital in the southern areas, if it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Denktash' sudden illness will affect in any way the
course of the efforts for a Cyprus settlement, the spokesman said
it was too soon to say.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Denktash was admitted to a hospital in
the Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia after a heart
attack on Sunday morning, but his doctor said his condition was
stable.
</P>
<P>
The 72 year-old Turkish Cypriot leader is said to be suffering
from coronary thrombosis and is expected to be in the hospital
for a week.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has been a leader of the Turkish Cypriot community
since the 1970s. He became "President" in 1983 when Turkish
Cypriots unilaterally declared independence and formation of the
so-called "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only
recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Claims Responsibility for Tel Aviv Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas has claimed responsibility for the
suicide bombing attack in the center of Tel Aviv this afternoon,
which killed at least 12 people and wounded some 100 others.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller to Israel Radio's Arabic section claimed
responsibility for the attack in the name of Hamas, saying the
bomber was Salah Abdul Rarim, 24, a Palestinian from the West Bank
town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television said the bomber blew himself up in crowds of
people at around 4:00 p.m. local time (14:00 GMT) just outside the
Dizengof shopping center, the busiest area in the heart of Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Buildings and several cars near the blast site were damaged by
the large bomb which is reportedly between 10-15 kilograms TNT,
and most of the windows in that area were also broken.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv Mayor Ronny Milo said that it seemed as if the bomber
was intending to enter the crowded Dizengof shopping mall, and
changed his mind due to the heavy security presented at the site.
</P>
<P>
An eye witness said that the bomber was carrying two baskets
in his hands and had been wondering in the area first and then
blew himself up in crowds of people, among them were children
came to celebrate the Purim holiday in the Dizengof center.
</P>
<P>
Purim, which begins tonight, is a Jewish festival that
celebrates the deliverance of the Jews of ancient Persia from a
plot to slaughter them. Jewish children traditionally dress up in
costumes for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the blast site and medical workers rushed to
the area to rescue the wounded people, and the usually busy
streets have been closed to all traffic.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Israeli Chief of Staff
Amnon Shahak and other army and security officials also went to
the scene, and they were jeered by angry crowds who gathered at
the site.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat condemned the terrorist attack, promising
to fully cooperate with the Israeli government to fight against
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Today's suicide attack came just one day after a Hamas bomber
blew up a No. 18 bus on Jaffa street in the center of Jerusalem,
which left at least 19 dead and over 15 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombing was also the fourth suicide bombing attack
conducted by Hamas inside Israel in eight days, and it was
occurred just a few meters from the site where a terrorist blew up
a bus in October 1994, killing 22 people and wounding dozens
others.
</P>
<P>
Israel army has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, following last Sunday's twin bombing attacks in
Jerusalem and Ashkelon, barring Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres announced that Israel is at all-out war with Hamas
following this Sunday's suicide bombing in Jerusalem, and more
than 2,000 security reinforcements had been brought into Jerusalem
to guard public transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Israel government, which decided to impose a list of new
security measures Sunday, is holding a special cabinet meeting at
the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv at this hour to discuss the
new situation after today's bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been pressing the PNA and Arafat to crack down on
the infrastructures for Islamic extremist groups inside the
autonomous area control by the PNA, following a series of suicide
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA today organized a mass rally, which was attended by
Arafat and other senior Palestinian officials in the Gaza City,
calling for a stop of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat said Sunday that he would ban all armed
groups inside Palestinian-controlled area, agreed to intensify
efforts to disarm them, and vowed to arrest gunmen in the radical
Islamic movements.

<HEADLINE> Food Security Is Vital To Sustainable Development, Says ECA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- K. Y. Amoako, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), stressed today that food secugity is vital to sustainable
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Amoako made the remarks while addressing the meeting of the
Committee of Experts of the First Session of the Conference of
African Ministers responsible for sustainable development and the
environment here.
</P>
<P>
Amoako said, africa is the only continent where food
production per person has declined over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
This dismal performance, together with the continent's high
population growth, has revived interest in whether food
production can keep pace with population, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said africa's three-percent population growth over the past
30 years has put immense pressure on the continent's fragile
eco-systems.
</P>
<P>
He said this session will focus on the relationship between
food security, population, the environment and human settlements.
</P>
<P>
"One of the five major program areas on which we will focus in
future is entitled: ensuring food security and sustainable
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, African countries cannot effectively improve food
security, or look after the environment, or improve human
settlements, "without a central assault on poverty."
</P>
<P>
He described sustainable development as Africa's topmost
priority and called upon the conference to face the challenges of
sustainable development and environment in Africa into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the conference was to get policymakers and
planners to bring the environment into all development work, he
added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Spring Pleased with Consultations going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring
said today that he was "very pleased" that consultations on
elections in Northern Ireland have started at Stormont in Belfast,
capital of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
Spring and Britain's Ulster Secretary Patrick Mayhew presided
over the latest talks on the damaged Northern Ireland peace
process.
</P>
<P>
According to the Anglo-Irish joint communique issued in London
last Wednesday, an elective body will be produced following the
current consultations among the British and Irish governments and
political parties in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The delegates to all-party negotiations to be held on June 10
will be chosen from the elected organization.
</P>
<P>
The largest Catholic political party, the Social Democratic and
Labour Party (SDLP), the neutral party, the Alliance Party, and
small loyalist parties are discussing with Spring and Mayhew the
plan for elections in Northern Ireland the content of the planned
all-party talks on the future of the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
Spring told the BBC Radio that the remaining parties, mainly
the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party, would
have discussions with British and Irish governments in London
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Spring said that he was disappointed that Sinn Fein, political
wing of the IRA, has been excluded from the consultations as the
IRA has not reinstated its ceasefire as demanded in the
Anglo-Irish joint communique.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Diplomat Vows to Wage War against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel will track down terrorists
anywhere in the world and wage a comprehensive war against Hamas
and other terrorist organizations, an Israeli diplomat said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to condemn Sunday's suicide
bombing attack on a bus in Jerusalem, the second within a week,
killing 20 people and wounding over a dozen, Israeli ambassador to
Cyprus Shemi Tzur also warned that Israeli-Syrian peace talks
might be jeopardized by what he described as "the different
general atmosphere" that prevails in the aftermath of the attack.
</P>
<P>
"If such terrorist attacks continue, they can affect the peace
process between Israel and the Palestinians," the ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
"If the peace process is jeopardized, it will influence the
whole region," Tzur said, noting that progress in the Middle East
peace efforts will have positive influence on other issues
including the settlement of Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "there are now doubts among many Israelis whether
this price is worth paying for peace. Maybe it was a mistake to
go into the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the world at
large to help Israel put an end to such attacks.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Arafat's decision to outlaw Hamas, Tzur said Israel
would encourage and support Arafat in his battle against militants
because both sides will benefit.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat also appealed to Syria and Lebanon to help Israel
stop terrorist attacks such as the two recent suicide bomb
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Lagos May Be Washed Off In 30 to 40 Years, Says Planner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lagos, Nigeria 's fast growing city
and commercial capital, may be washed off within the next 30 to
40 years because of a lack of management of its coast, an
official of the Town Planners Registration Council (TOPREC) of
Nigeria has warned.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen here at the weekend, TOPREC Vice-
President Raphael Kumapayi noted that time was of the essence,
before the "city of many rivers" would be submerged.
</P>
<P>
He explained that lagos, the former political capital of this
west African country, had a fragile coastline.
</P>
<P>
Kumapayi said that a study of the character of the soil of the
city was not done before all the structures, including high-rise
buildings, were put in place.
</P>
<P>
"All the structures are carried by sedimentary sand," the
TOPREC vice-president said, adding,"the sand ought not to carry
too much weight as is the situation at present."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the coastal problem of the city was
worsened by the prevailing phenomenon, known as global warming,
and the rise in sea level in the city as well as its increasing
polulation.
</P>
<P>
Lagos now has a polulation of around six million. A UN report
released last year indicated that Lagos would be the tenth most
populated city in the world by the year 2000. enditem

<HEADLINE> African Countries Called To Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- African countries were today
called to face the challenges and make progess.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Ethiopian Minister of Works and Urban
Development Haile Asegide while opening at Africa Hall here a
4-day meeting of the Committee of Experts of the First Session of
the Conference of African Ministers responsible for sustainable
development and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Haile said "the laudable political independence African
countries achieved more than three decades ago and the colossal
natural resources they possess have brought about negligible
improvements in the welfare of their people".
</P>
<P>
"Virtually four-fifths of the region's population is now
wallowing in abject poverty with most of this suffering from
acute food insecurity particularly in rural areas," he said,
adding that "the African poor, who were equivalent to 16 percent
of the world's destitutes, are likely to make up 30 percent of
the total by the turn of the century."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that urban poverty and food insecurity are also
becoming matters of grave concern in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that urban population of the region, which was
estimated at 23 percent in 1970, surged to 34 percent in 1990 and
is expected to leap-frog to 47 percent by the year 2000, thus
exacerbating the poverty and food insecurity situation and
reducing the agricultural labor force in the region.
</P>
<P>
After referring to various initiatives made by african
countries to extricate them from the dilemma's of poverty, the
Ethiopian minister said these "are all indicative of the
political will to face the challenges of sustainable development
in the region".
</P>
<P>
The limited success African countries have achieved should not
hamper the continued marshaling of all available resources and
capacities to attain the long term development objective, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which will meet every four years, was
established by the Resolution 757 adopted in May 1993 at the
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) Conference of Ministers
responsible for social and economic development and planning.

least in the short-term, in sympathy with inflation,'' the company
said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here described the January inflation rate as
''horrific'', but said there were signs it would fall towards the
end of March this year.
</P>
<P>
Edmore Tobaiwa, an economist from the Zimbabwe National
Chamber of Commerce, said propects for a fall in inflation,
partricularly during February and March, were bright. ''by the
end of March, we expect inflation to start coming down, but not
drastically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, currently under a shadow program of the
International Monetary Fund, is keeping its fingers crossed
that inflation will reach 17 percent by mid-year.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged To Cooperate In Attracting Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister today said
the private and public sectors in Africa should cooperate to
attract direct foreign investment to the world's poorest
continent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the delegates at a five-day workshop on investment
promotion in Harare, acting finance minister Herbert Murerwa said
that a strong promotional programme was crucial in attracting
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He described the private sector, the engine for economic
growth, as a key in the quest for investment.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa, who is also minister for industry and commerce, said
the rapid changes of the investment environment needed to spread
to the private sector, partricularly in the provision of
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The investment potential in Africa remains under-tapped. This
is because when countries on the continent opened up their
economies, there were no equivalent investor groups to
immediately seize the available opportunities, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is organized by the Zimbabwe Investment Centre
in conjunction with the multilateral investment guarantee agency.
The delegates from Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, South Africa, Malawi and
Zimbabwe attended the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Tension Rises over Falklands Fish Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Tensions between Britain and
Argentina were increasing because of the disputes over fishing
rights in waters around the Falkland Islands, British newspaper
the Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that yesterday British vessels forced two
Argentine craft to pay for licences to fish in waters off the
islands.
</P>
<P>
British naval vessels had also stepped their presence in waters
surrounding the islands, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, Guido Di Tello, the Argentinian foreign
minister, warned yesterday that a planned visit to London by
President Carlos Menem might be in doubt because of the latest
development.
</P>
<P>
"We are handling with caution the trip to London... We don't
want a trip until the conditions are appropriate," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, in London the British Foreign Office played down the
rift, saying it was surprised at Di Tellos's reaction.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Defence spokesman also denied the reports on
increased British naval presence, saying: "We often have a ship in
the area. I am not aware of any increase in numbers there."
</P>
<P>
The dispute follows the Antarctic Fishing Convention which came
into force this month. Britain argues that the convention allows
it to take action against vessels fishing in waters around South
Georgia, 800 miles south east of the Falklands.
</P>
<P>
But Argentina has maintained that Britain has no right to
charge fees for the right to fish in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Global Air Traffic Up in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The world's airports handled over 2.2
billion passengers and some 45 million tons of cargo in 1995, up 5
percent and 6 percent respectively from 1994, said the Geneva-based
Airports Council International (ACI) in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, aircraft movements rose by just 2 percent, said the
report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
Every region in the world posted growth in both passenger traffic
and cargo volume, with the only exception of Africa, which reported
negative growth of 0.3 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report said that North America remained on top of the list by
handling over 1 billion passengers and 21.2 million tons of cargoes
last year, each up 2.9 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by Europe, which handled nearly 644 million
passengers and some 9.7 million tons of cargoes, 6.8 percent and 7.1
percent respectively more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific region came the third place, showing a 7.6 percent
increase in passenger traffic with a total of some 359 million
passengers, as well as a 9.1 percent growth in cargo volume, which
topped 9.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The strongest growth in passenger traffic was reported in the
Pacific, followed by Europe, and Asia, up 5.4 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
As for cargo volume, greatest increase was registered in the
Latin America and the Caribbean region, at 14.3 percent. Asia came
the next with a 14.1 percent growth, and was followed by the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific also led the field in growth in aircraft movements, up
5.9 percent, followed by Europe, up 4.5 percent and Asia, up 4.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
Movements were flat in North America, and fell by 1.5 percent in
Latin America/Caribbean and 3.4 percent in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The top ten airports regarding passenger traffic were: Chicago
(OHD), Atlanta (ATL), Dallas/Ft Worth (DFW), London (LHR), Los Angles
(LAX), Tokyo (HND), Frankfurt (FRA), San Francisco (SFO), Denver (DEN)
and Miami (MIA).
</P>
<P>
The top ten airports regarding cargo volume were: Memphis (MEM),
Tokyo (NRT), Los Angeles (LAX), New York (JFK), Hong Kong (HKG),
Frankfurt (FRA), Miami (MIA), Louisville (SDF), Chicago (ORD) and
London (LHR).
</P>
<P>
According to Paul Behnke, ACI's Director of Economics, 1995 was the
fourth year in a row of strong passenger growth. Would growth
continue at this rate, passenger traffic would double in 12 years,
namely over 4 billion passengers by the year 2007, he added.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenges, he said: "Airports will need to build new
infrastructure and maximize the use of existing facilities by the
use of new technology, as well as by streamlining passenger and
cargo flows."
</P>
<P>
ACI was founded in 1991, with membership of over 430 international
airports and airport authorities, running some 1,150 airports in more
than 140 countries around the world.

<HEADLINE> Mandela To Undergo Full Medical Check-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela, who returns from a three-day visit to west Africa
tonight, will spend the next three days at a Johannesburg private
clinic undergoing a battery of tests to confirm he is in good
health.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued in Cape Town today by
Mandela's office, the comprehensive check-up, which takes place
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, has been approved of by the
president and his doctors.
</P>
<P>
"Both the president and the doctors are confident that this
routine check-up will confirm that the president is in good
health and lay to rest speculation on this matter," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The medical report by Mandela's doctors would be made public
once the tests were completed, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela indicated at a press conference on Friday that he
would undergo a thorough medical examination in an attempt to
dispel rumours about his failing health once and for all.
</P>
<P>
He said the public would believe a report emanating from his
doctors that he was healthy, more than denials of the rumours
from his office.
</P>
<P>
The recent rumours about Mandela's ill-health circulating
around the Johannesburg stock exchange sent the local
currency rand to record lows on financial markets.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Former Defence Minister's Murder Trial Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua)-- The murder trial of South
Africa's former Defence Minister General Magnus Malan and 19
co-accused has been postponed for a week after about one-hour
appearance in the Durban supreme court today.
</P>
<P>
Malan and his co-accused faced 13 counts of murder arising
from the massacre of 13 people in Kwazulu/Natal Province in 1987
and charges of conspiracy to murder members of political
organisations in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Today's court proceedings lasted less than an hour and were
dominated by legal technical details.
</P>
<P>
Members of the seven defence teams submitted that insufficient
time had been granted to study particulars of the charges against
the accused.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, an application for a postponement was approved by
Justice Jan Hugo, who said the accused should not be pressured
because of the significance of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Defence Lawyer Klaus Von Lieres Und Wilkau told the court the
additional document were received by some defence teams only on
Sunday, leaving insufficient time for the teams to prepare an
adequate defence.
</P>
<P>
Justice Jan Hugo said the court would uphold the accused's
right to scrutinize documents relating to their case.
</P>
<P>
In a response to Malan's murder trial this morning, National
Party (NP) leader and Deputy President F. W. de Klerk said in
Cape Town that prominent African National Congress leaders with
temporary immunity should be treated no differently from Malan
and his co-accused.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was aligning himself with remarks made by NP's
justice spokesman Danie Schutte at the weekend that Malan's trial
was based on "double standards".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's Freedom Front (FF) leader Constand
Viljoen said Malan's murder trial might fuel violence in
Kwazulu/Natal and would not contribute towards reconciliation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Although the FF could not talk on behalf of the accused, there
was no doubt the officers charged with murder were men of
integrity who had loyally served all the people of South Africa,
Viljoen said in a statement in Cape Town. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Acts To Save Its Largest Steel Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
looking for equity partners to save the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel
Company (ZISCO) from collapse, Industry and Commerce Minister
Herbert Murerwa said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the financial resources needed by ZISCO were
beyond the cash-strapped government's means, hence the need for
private investors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the government has to convert ZISCO's huge
debt, now exceeding 110 million U.S. dollars, into equity before
investors can inject their money into the company.
</P>
<P>
ZISCO, located in central Zimbabwe and one of southern
Africa's largest steel companies, is 91.7 percent owned by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The company is facing a serious viability crisis, and no
decision has been made on how to revive its operations despite
numerous studies which have been submitted by foreign
consultants.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Up, Spending Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Personal income increased
by a small 0.1 percent in January while consumer spending fell a
steep 0.5 percent in the month, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported here today..
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the increase in personal income
was the smallest since they remained unchanged last August. The
consumer spending decline was the largest since it plunged by 0.6
percent in August 1992 and also the third in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Personal income totaled 6.25 trillion U.S. dollars in
December, up from 6.24 trillion dollars in November. Spending
totaled 5.01 trillion dollars, down from 5.03 trillion dollars the
previous month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report combined the December and January figures, which
were delayed mainly due to a government shutdown caused by the
federal budget impasse.
</P>
<P>
Personal income rose 0.6 percent in December, resulting in a
6.1 percent increase in 1995 compared with 4.9 percent in 1994.
The annual increase was well above the 2.5 percent rate of
inflation, as measured by the government's Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending in December was up by 0.9 percent, pushing it
up 4.8 percent in 1995, slower than the 5.5 percent gain in the
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income--income after taxes--rose 0.3 percent in
January after jumping 0.7 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The combination of income and spending means that Americans'
saving rate--savings as a percentage of disposable income--was 5.3
percent, the highest since a 6.3 percent rate in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for
inflation. When adjusted, disposable income was unchanged after
rising 0.6 percent in December. Spending fell 0.8 percent, erasing
an 0.8 percent advance the previous month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said that the consumer spending in the country
would remain weak this year because of the slower income increase
and a heavy debt burden on consumers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A one-week workshop on
environmental reporting for journalists from sub-saharan Africa
started here today.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is focusing on competency and confidence
reporting on environmental issues in sustained ways to effect
policy changes and better environmental management in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
Participants include 15 journalists from Zimbabwe, Zambia,
Malawi and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's Environment and
Tourism Minister Chen Chimutengwende said, "the media situation
is still underdeveloped in Africa and, as a result, more
environmental issues were being ignored or neglected by editors."
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed environmental issues had become
paramount to the development of Zimbabwe hence the need to be
given more media coverage.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the journalists attending the workshop to improve
their coverage of environmental issues and to effect positive change
in environmental management and policies at local, national and
regional levels.
</P>
<P>
He said it was vital for the media to play its role in
facilitating dialogue between policy makers and people through
opening and balanced reporting of issues on the ground.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of Zambia's
independent "Post Newspaper" Fred Mmembe and its Managing Editor
Bright Mwape were sent to prison today after surrendering
themselves to parliament for contempt of the house.
</P>
<P>
The duo who have been in hiding for some time surrendered
themselves to parliament this morning without the columnist Lucy
Sichone, who is also charged with contempt of parliament.
</P>
<P>
They were briefly taken to police force headquarters before
Mmembe was sent to central prison while Mwape was taken to
Kamwala remand prison.
</P>
<P>
"The duo are being indefinetely sent to prison and right now
we are negotiating with prison authorities for their status in
prison," said their lawyer Sakwiba Sikota before he drove off
with Mmembe to central prison.
</P>
<P>
Parliament last month found Mmembe, Mwape and Sichone quilty
of contempt and summoned them to appeal before the bar of the
house. But they failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the national assembly Robison Nabulyato ruled that
the three had deliberately lowered the dignity of the house
through contemptuous articles on the proceedings in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Then the trio went underground and police offered a reward of
about 2000 US dollars to anyone with infromation leading to their
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Consultations on Ulster Elections Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Consultations on elections in
Northern Ireland among the British and Irish governments and
political parties has started today on Belfast, capital of the
conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring are presiding over the latest talks in a bid
to salvage the damaged peace process bombed apart by the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Mayhew sent out invitations to eight political
parties in Northern Ireland, which are considered to have shown a
commitment exclusively to democratic and peaceful means in
settling conflict in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the largest
Catholic political party in Ulster, Alliance Party, which keeps
its neutral position in the conflict, and small loyalist parties
will discuss with Mayhew and Spring the plan for elections in
Ulster and content of the planned all-party negotiations on the
future of the province to he held on June 10.
</P>
<P>
But the two unionist parties, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), indicated that they won't attend
the talks in Belfast today because they see presence of the Irish
foreign minister as a gesture of interfering in the +internal
affairs+ of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble and DUP leader Ian Paisley said they
would meet the British and Irish governments later this week at
Westminster, not at Stormont in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA, has not been invited to
the consultations because the IRA so far has not restore its
ceasefire as demanded in the Anglo-Irish joint communique issued
in London last Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus to Make Larger Jumbo Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Boeing and Europe's Airbus
Industrie are racing to develop the world's largest passenger jet,
with Boeing likely taking the upper hand, The USA Today reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Boeing will possibly win. The paper said
that Boeing is expected to announce plans later this year for two
larger versions of its 747-400, the world's biggest jet with 420
seats.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based jetmaker is working on plans for a 747-600X
jet that would seat 500 passengers and fly 6,500 miles. A second
jet, the 747-500X, would seat 430 and fly 7,083 miles -- about
1,000 miles more than the 747-400.
</P>
<P>
Some airlines are seeking larger jumbos so they can fly more
passengers to congested airports such as longdon's Heathrow
without adding flights. And they want longer-range jets so they
can fly non-stop routes such as New York-Hong Kong and
London-Tokyo, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has dominated the jumbo-jet market for years and doesn't
want rival Airbus to get a piece of the lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
Boeing says it is talking with 16 potential customers for the
new jets, including United Airlines, British Airways and Japan
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has a proposal to build a 530- to 570-seat jet, the
A3XX, but says it isn't close to being launched, according to
the report.

<HEADLINE> Sub-saharan Property Tax Seminar Opens In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A four-day regional seminar on
property tax in sub-saharan Africa opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, aimed mainly at improving property tax systems in
the region, is being attended by about 40 delegates from
Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean Vice-president
Joshua Nkomo said the exisitng combination of tax exemptions "can
have a significant negative impact on the financial position of a
local authority".
</P>
<P>
Properties exempted from paying tax include institutions or
bodies owned by the government and religious and charitable
organizations, such as universities and hospitals which are not
run for profit, according to Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
In any case, these properties are serviced by the authorities
at a cost which must be met," he said, adding "there is thus a
case for revisiting what is currently a long list of properties
which are exempted from" property tax.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Zimbabwean Local Government, Rural and
Urban Development Minister John Nkomo appealed to governments to
amend laws enacted during the colonial era on the exemption of
certain property.

<HEADLINE> British Oil Output Set for Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Oil production in the UK is on
track for a record of 2.71 million barrels a day this year, says a
report published today by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based
energy consultants.
</P>
<P>
The forecast figure represents a five percent increase from
last year's average output of 2.58 million barrels a day, which in
turn was a 3 percent rise from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the expected rise in production in the UK
this year will be the result of a less extensive offshore
maintenance season and the start-up of 15 new fields.
</P>
<P>
Six fields, Douglas, Foinaven, Harding, Lennox, Magnus South
and Pelican, are due to start production in the first half of the
year. They will have a combined output of 150,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Most of the remaining nine mew fields are small, with total
output estimated at 30,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend in North Sea production is set to continue for
some years, says the report, with output reaching as much as three
million barrels a day towards the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
"New technology, cost reduction measures and an attractive and
stable fiscal regime" are some of the factors behind the growth in
oil output, the consultants added.
</P>
<P>
It does not foresee the decommissioning of any big platform
this year in spite of many of the earlier fields reaching the end
of their productive lives.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Left-wing Forces Form Bloc to Back Zyuganov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25 Russian left-wing
parties and movements signed today an agreement to form a bloc to
back communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov for his candidacy in
the June presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stressed that "all activity within the framework
of the election campaign of the single candidate from the popular
patriotic forces of Russia will be conducted in keeping with an
agreed plan and with the participation of all interested parties
on the basis of regular working consultations on current issues."
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the left-wing forces told reporters that the
agreement, which is binding on all the signatories, was open for
signing and provided the basis for unification of all left-wing
and patriotic forces in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation led by
Zyuganov, other prominent parties and movements in the bloc
include former Soviet prime minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's "Power to
the People" movement, Mikhail Lapshin's Agrarian Party, and the
Union of Communists Parties-the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union headed by Oleg Shenin.
</P>
<P>
The Agrarian Union, the Russian Young Communist League, as well
as the "Spiritual Heritage" movement also signed up their support
for Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
However, three other left-wing organizations -- the Labor
Russia movement, the Russian Communist Workers Party and the
Russian National Union -- refused to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, 51, who was present at the signing ceremony, said he
hoped for cooperation between the new bloc and such politicians as
former Russian vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, retired General
Alexander Lebed and other leaders of the centrist forces.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in forging solidarity with these people
because we have no major differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zyuganov, the left-wing bloc has "a moderate,
well-balanced program," which will be published after a further
discussion in March.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov is seen as the most powerful rival to President Boris
Yeltsin who is seeking a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, pro-Yeltsin forces held a meeting in Moscow to
form a coalition to back Yeltsin's re-election bid.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Work Praised at Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Eighth National
Committee of the Chinese Poeple's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) agreed that various committees of the CPPCC
scored marked achievements in their work last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 CPPCC members attending the Fourth Session of
the CPPCC National Committee, which opened Sunday, discussed a
report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National
Committee today in 49 panels.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huiguang, secretary of the Communist Party committee of
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that the CPPCC is
playing a bigger role and exerting an greater influence in the
public.
</P>
<P>
Li Ziqi, former secretary of the Communist Party provincial
committee of Gansu, said that the CPPCC has been doing a better
job. "I believe our organization can play an important role in
carrying out the country's medium- and long-term development
programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Song Kexiang, a CPPCC member from Hunan province, said that the
CPPCC has made three breakthroughs last year: its work became more
standard and systematic, more participation in the country's
policy-making process, and increased contacts with the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qitao, deputy general manager of the China Nuclear
Industry Corporation, and Zhou Darong, a professor at the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Science, shared the view that visits by
CPPCC leaders, including chairman Li Ruihuan, to foreign countries
promoted understanding of the outside world on Chinese-style
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Members from Hong Kong and Macao also spoke highly of CPPCC's
work last year. Leopold Tang Hsiang-chien, a Hong Kong
entrepreneur, said the advisory body made a great contribution to
the drafting of the country's Ninth Five-year Plan and long-term
goals for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, participants at the panel discussions also aired
views on how to improve CPPCC work.
</P>
<P>
Yang Di, former deputy secretary of Shanghai municipal party
committee, said the advisory body should better perform its duty
of supervision and offer more proposals on tackling issues of
public concern.
</P>
<P>
Others urged the National Committee to help them to gain more
authority in the supervision of economic and social situations,
and increase contacts with all social circles so as to better
reflect public opinion.

<HEADLINE> Canada Denounces U.S. Anti-Cuba Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien says that the United States is overstepping its legal
boundaries with its new anti-Cuba legislation and that his country
is using all its efforts to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, introduced after Cuba downed two U.S. aircraft
nine days ago, would punish any foreign country with direct or
indirect business ties to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the action of the government of Cuba in shooting
down the two planes, but we never accept the notion of
extraterritorial application of American laws," Chretien told
reporters in Grenada Sunday in his first public comment about the
proposed anti-Cuba trade bill now before the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We have to respect the jurisdiction of every country and I
said so to the President of United States," Chretien added.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian prime minister is in Grenada to for a summit
meeting with Caribbean leaders. The Cuba dispute will come up
today, as formal talks start with Chretien and the 14-member
Caribbean Community and Common Market.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica, Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago are the three
Caribbean nations with the largest and most direct interests in
Cuba. It is believed that they will join Canada in voicing strong
opposition to the U.S. legislation and a statement from the summit
is also expected on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"It's more than a problem of business," Chretien was quoted as
saying by today's Canadian newspapers. "It is also a problem of
legal principle," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jia Zhijie is one of the few
provincial party leaders who brought a computer to the current
session of the National People's Congress (NPC) for his own use.
</P>
<P>
Jia, a NPC deputy and Party secretary of the central China's
Hubei Province, is joyous each time talking about computer.

leading officials should take the lead in learning how to operate
computers.

his colleagues as the fourth subjects for compulsory learning,
only after Deng Xiaoping's theories on building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, theories on socialist market economy, and
foreign languages, especially for cadres below the age of 45
across the province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial party secretary himself set an example in
learning computer operation, and other officials followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Jia often acquainted himself with economic information
displayed on his computer and write articles on it, said his
secretary. "The computer has become one of his treasures."
</P>
<P>
When Jia Zhijie attended the previous annual NPC sessions, he
had to bring with him a large pile of written material. This time,
he is quite easy with a computer.
</P>
<P>

and he can feed all the useful information into his computer to
facilitate his future work.

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
is expected to increase its 1980 GDP eight folds by the end of the
century and to realize modernization by the year 2010, said Lu
Ruihua, governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
The province will concentrate on effecting a shift in its
economic structure and economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
"This way, it is possible for Guangdong to maintain an annual
growth rate of 12.9 percent from 1991 to 2010," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the province is expected to have a GDP of 1,600

between Guangdong and poor regions in interior China under the
unified leadership of the central government and help central and
western regions achieve prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong, the governor

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China is
giving priority to environmental protection, and is closing down
240 enterprises discharging pollutants into the Huaihe and Chaohu
river valleys.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution has become a serious environmental problem in
recent years in the Huaihe and Chaohu. To tackle the problem,
focus has been placed on the chemical oxyen demand and on
closing down polluters, with calls for a 15 percent drop in the
COD this year.
</P>
<P>
Half of all the enterprises should meet standards for COD
control. 12 other mills should attend to the problem within a
designated period of time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the provincial government will strengthen controls
on newly-launched projects in the two river valleys, while
licences will be required for large and medium-sized enterprises
to discharge pollutants.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Henan provincial government in
central China has ordered all paper mills with an annual capacity
of less than 5,000 tons to be closed down by the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Chinese Economic Growth Beneficial to All: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The rapid development of the
Chinese economy is beneficial to other countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, an economist from Hong Kong said here today.
</P>
<P>
A long-term development blueprint China is to implement will
make it the locomotive of economic growth in the region in the
next century, Mun Kin-chok, a professor at Chinese University of
Hong Kong told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The uplift of the Chinese economy will provide great impetus
to the economic development of other countries in the Asia-Pacific
region," said Mun, who is here attending the Fourth Session of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
As economic growth slows down in Europe and the United States,
China has maintained a double-digit growth rate, the economist
said.
</P>
<P>
"Though finetuned to eight percent for the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), China's economic growth rate is still aspiring," Mun
said.
</P>
<P>
By that rate, China's national gross product will reach 12
trillion yuan (about 1.4 trillion US dollars) by the year 2010 and
its population of well over one billion is also a huge consumer
market, which the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia
and Malaysia has desired, according to Mun.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore China will provide many opportunities for economic
development in Asia-Pacific countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that rapid economic growth on the Chinese mainland
over the past ten or more years has accounted for more than 60
percent of the economic prosperity in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging there does exist competition between China
and other developing countries in Asia in future development, Mun
said that such competition will be overshadowed by the
supplementary economic features.
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, the economist noted, the expected
economic takeoff of China will be a "win-win" for all.

CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian security authorities
today foiled a terrorist plot and arrested 41 members of a
terrorist group, the state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted an Interior Ministry source as saying that many
documents and booklets "on the erroneous ideas of the terrorist
group" were also seized in a bust made by the security forces in
Sharqia governorate, east of the Nile Delta.

<P>
The agency, which did not identify the name of the group, added
that a lot of foreign currencies were found with the arrested.

The Egyptian security forces have fiercely cracked down on
the country's Islamic militants who have launched a violent
campaign since 1992 against the government in an attempt to
install strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested are very likely to be suspected Islamic
militants.

MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
proposed a series of actions to solve the common problems that
beset Asian and African countries at the 35th Meeting of the
Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC) that began here
today.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said issues of environment, women, children and migrant
workers as well as transnational crimes like terrorism and drug
trafficking are threatening the world's oldest civilizations and
youngest democracies.
</P>
<P>
He called for punitive sanctions on the countries that refuse
to adopt measures to protect and preserve the environment,
particularly the seas and seabed minerals.
</P>
<P>
He voiced support for the establishment of an international
criminal court and proposed the finalization of an international
criminal code that outlines the felonies recognized by the AALCC
member states as crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The president called attention to crimes against children,
which he said should be included in the list of crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also called for international cooperation in easing the
plight of economic migrants in Asia and Africa, saying these
people who are forced to flee their homelands need compassion and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
The AALCC, set up on November 15, 1956, serves as an advisory
body to its 44 members in the field of international law and as a
forum for Asian-African cooperation in legal matters.

<P>
The members expressed the intention at a group disscussion,
part of the ongoing fouth session of the Eighth National Committee

A member from Hong Kong said contacts among members from the
territory should increase so that there will be more coordination
when they work for a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Another member said CPPCC members from Hong Kong should

<HEADLINE> Universe About 15 Billion Years Old: Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The universe is about 15 billion
years old, a United States research group said after calculating
the distance between stars.
</P>
<P>
The finding resolves the paradox arising from earlier estimates
of the age of the universe of only about 10 billion years, which
conflicts with the age of the oldest stars it contains -- 13
billion years, The Time reported today.
</P>
<P>
The head of the team from the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, Dr. Alan Sandage, said the discovery "eliminates the
idea of a crisis in cosmology," a representative theory of which,
the Big Bang theory, traces the universe back to a tremendous
explosion of a highly compact substance.
</P>
<P>
The team measured the absolute brightness of supernovas with
the Hubble Space Telescope, and then calculated their distance
from the Earth by comparing how bright they appear with how bright
they actually are.
</P>
<P>
The team compared the peak brightnesses of six supernovas in
different galaxies which they measured and a seventh measured by
another team, and found the figures are remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
After knowing the speed of the stars' movement and their
distance, the scientists worked out that the remotest stars were
thrown away from the center of the explosion 15 billion years
ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Multi-party cooperation and
political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) is of great significance for building socialism
with Chinese Characteristics, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
made the remark when he joined group discussions held by the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Jiusan
Society, whose members are attending the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"Persisting in and improving the system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party is an important political condition for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, over the past year, the CPPCC National
Committee and local committees have been actively participating in
the management of state affairs and raised valuable suggestions
on the country's reform, opening up, economic growth,
overall social progress, and reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has, in its turn, been supporting the work
of the CPPCC, Jiang said, expressing the hope that CPPCC
committees at various levels would contribute more to the
country's socialist modernization cause.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Communist Party's proposal for formulating the
Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) and long-term targets for the
year 2010 has great significance for China's socialist
modernization drive. He expressed the hope that CPPCC members
would speak their minds freely to make the development program
better.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said,"United front work was an important treasure
for achieving revolutionary successes in the past, which resulted
in the founding of New China. This treasure should be used even
better today when our country is pushing for modernization and
working for the reunification of the motherland."
</P>

Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, was
with the president when the latter attended the discussions.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Get-together of "Rich and Poor" Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- "It is more important to help
train people in poverty-stricken areas than merely offering them
economic aid," said Wu Renbao, a deputy from a rich village in
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
His views are shared by deputies invited to a get-together this
afternoon in a northwest Beijing hotel. The deputies, from Ningxia
and Heilongjiang, are here to attend the fourth session of the
8th National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The discussion, sponsored by Wu Renbao, head of Huaxi
Village, centered on cooperation between east and
west China and on poverty-relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
With 1,500 people, Huaxi last year produced total revenues of
two billion yuan with 200 million yuan in profits and taxes. Li
Peng, the Chinese premier, called the village "the future of rural
China."
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Huaxi Village, two "Huaxi" villages have been
established respectively in northwest China's Ningxia, a backward
muslem region, and Heilongjiang, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
"Some 70 million people in China are still poverty-stricken. We
Huaxi people have the duty to help them," Wu said at the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
Wu plans to relocate 1,000 households of poor peasants from
Xihaigu, the poorest part of Ningxia, to another village in the
same region to help them stand up by themselves by supporting them
in agricultural production. In Wuzhan, a town in Heilongjiang, Wu
intended to help increase income for the 50,000 local people by
land reclamation and the development of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
By now, more than 200 households in Xihaigu have moved to the
new location where a chicken farm and a small iron plant are being
prepared. Land reclamation has accelerated in Wuzhan,
Heilongjiang, which is expected to produce 600,000 kilograms of
rice this year.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance people's economic awareness in economically
backward regions like what Huaxi is doing is the key to
prosperity," said Sun Dezhi, a farmer deputy from Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
What Huaxi has been doing is a symbol of cooperative relations
between east and west China, said Dong Jialin, an NPC deputy and
director of Ningxia Regional Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Said Wu, "The central and western regions of China are rich in
natural and human resources. When people in east China help their
brothers and sisters there, they are helping themselves as well as
others."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The four economic co-operative
zones centered on Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing and Shanghai in the
Yangtze River Valley are playing manifestly more important roles
in the area's development.
</P>
<P>
An economic coordination meeting, which opened here today,

billion yuan, generated profits amounting to 2.3 billion yuan,
lent and borrowed funds amounting to 270.3 billion yuan and
obtained a total transactional volume of 100 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Aidid Captures Strategic Town In Territorial Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 400 militiamen led by
Somali warlord General Mohamed Aidid On Sunday captured Dolow, a
strategic town bordering Ethiopia, according to field radio
communication from Dolow today.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid has been capturing a number of towns and regions
since he left Mogadishu six months ago. And Dolow has been the
last strong hold of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA), Aidid's
major rival in southwest Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the invasion, Aidid's men faced no resistance
from the RRA forces who had abandoned the town before the attack,
said the report, adding that only two civilians were killed by
stray bullets.
</P>
<P>
The capture of the border town is not only important for Aidid's
territorial expansion but economically strategic as well.
</P>
<P>
Dolow, which lies on the border line that divides Somalia and
Ethiopia, is about 50 km north of the Somalia-Kenya borders
where commercial dealing are active daily.
</P>
<P>
Aidid is likely to impose his taxation program on the
border town very soon once the hit-and-run attacks of the RRA
subside and the area is stablised.
</P>
<P>
It is also widely believed that General Aidid will continue
his advance towards capturing the rest of the three major towns
in Southern Somalia, namely, Kismayo, Bardera and Garbaharrey.
</P>
<P>
RRA forces are now reported to be scattered in the jungles
surrounding the towns, launching their hit-and-run insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
This attack on the last town controlled by RRA
came only a day after a heavy fighting had erupted between General
Aidid's militiamen and those of the RRA at the outskirts of
Baidoa, another town in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Drivers from the area said the town and its surrounding
villages were calm today with Aidid's militiamen supported by by
armed wagons manning checkpoints at the entrances of the
villages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the raw between the religious leaders and the
politicians of north Mogadishu has been settled temporarily after
a meeting convened by the north Mogadishu faction leader, Ali
Mohamed, last night.
</P>
<P>
The massive demonstration aimed at supporting the influential
Islamic Court and protesting the constitution of Ali Mahdi's
political party, the United Somali Congress of the Somali
Salvation Alliance was postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The rally, organised by chairman of the Islamic Court, Sheikh
Mohamud and scheduled for Tuesday, called for applying democracy
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Sharia Implementation Committee, Sheikh
Muhidin, said the constitution of the alliance was not needed at
all.
</P>
<P>
"We are already enjoying the Constitution of Allah, and no
man-made constitution is required in the Muslim countries." he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government Wins Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new government headed by
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti today won a vote of
confidence after a three-day debate in the Parliament on the
policy statement Kabariti delivered last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "parliamentary government," in which 22 deputies hold
ministerial posts, won 57 out of the total of 77 votes, an
indication of the strongest support the government has secured
from the parliament since 1989.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day debate which focused mainly on the
government's policy vis-a-vis Iraq, dozens of lawmakers took
floor, criticizing the government for making "unnecessary tension"
in its ties with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Taher al Masri, a former prime minister, said there were
regional and international parties that harbor negative intentions
 towards Iraq and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against being used by those parties, demanding a
commitment by the government not to interfere in the internal
affairs of Iraq, "not just out of concern for (that country)
and its integrity, but also out of concern for Jordanian
stability, security and investment climate."
</P>
<P>
Another deputy said that the Jordanian people oppose the
government's policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The government has recently stepped up its criticism of the
Iraqi regime but stressed that it will not interfere in the
internal affairs of that country and its policies are only
aimed at helping the Iraqi people and maintaining the
territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kabariti government was formed on February 4 shortly
after the former Prime Minister Zeid Ben Shaker and his
government resigned.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Opening of NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, carries an editorial tomorrow hailing the opening of
the annual session of National People's Congress (NPC), a
conference to discuss matters of vital importance.
</P>
<P>
The session will play a decisive role on how the Chinese nation
will enter the 21st century and the conference is of far-reaching
significance, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Since the session will examine and approve the Ninth Five-Year
Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the
Long-Term Target for the Year 2010, the conference will play a key
part in the process of national economic and social development in
the key historical period.
</P>
<P>
In view of the experience in the past year as well as in the
last five years, the editorial says, China has scored historical
achievements in reform, opening-up and socialist modernization.
The goal to quadruple the GNP in 1980 to be reached in 2000 has
been attained five years ahead of schedule, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The past five years have been the best years in the periods of
all the eight five-year plans China has implemented," the
editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
When China was approaching the end of the Eight Five-Year Plan
(1991--2000) period, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee set forth a proposal on the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996--2000) for National Economic and Social Development and the
Long-Term Target for the Year 2010, which forwarded China's new
goals.
</P>
<P>
These goals are: to complete the second-phase strategic goal in
modernization drive and quadruple the per-capita GNP in 1980 by
the year 2000 and quadruple the figure in 2000 by the year 2010.
This will enable the Chinese people to live a more affluent and
comfortable life and form a fairly complete socialist market
economy, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
"We are at an important juncture of transition from the 20th
century to the 21st century," the editorial says, adding that "it
is the mission and a glorious, proud task for the people of our
generation to write the most magnificent trans-century chapter."
</P>
<P>
The system of the people's congress is the fundamental
political system of China. The practice in the past few decades
have proved that the system conforms to China's national
conditions and to the aspirations of the people, and that it
enables the country to unite people of various nationalities to
achieve great tasks, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
While hailing the important role played by the people's
congresses in adopting and implementing the previous five-year
plans, the editorial believes that the NPC's Fourth Session will
make fresh and greater contributions to the formulation of the
long-term target for the year 2010 and turn the blueprint for the
next five years and 15 years into reality.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Continues Efforts To Settle Yemeni-Eritrean Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is continuing its efforts for
a peaceful settlement to the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the Red
Sea islands of Hanish, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted Moussa as saying that
difficulties do exist in solving the problem, but it is important
that the dispute does not lead to a military confrontation between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moussa did not rule out the possibility of holding a tripartite
summit of Egypt, Yemen and Eritrea to settle the dispute, but he
said certain conditions must be met before it could be held.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when Yemen and Eritrean
fought a fierce battle over the islands. The Eritrean troops
occupied the island of Greater Hanish, claimed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
France and Ethiopia have also tried to mediate a solution to
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described as good and positive a reported statement by
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres that the Middle East peace
process should continue despite Sunday's suicide bombing on a bus
in Jerusalem, which left 20 people dead, including the bomber,
MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt agrees with Peres to keep negotiations going provided
that the reported statement was true, Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Benefits from Attending Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese official today
had an earful of suggestions on developing agriculture from
members of China's top advisory body and briefed them on farming
conditions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and vice premier
in charge of agriculture, took part in a panel discussion of
the Fourth Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The discussion was attended by CPPCC members from agricultural
and forestry sectors.
</P>
<P>
Jiang listened to the discussion attentively and expressed his
appreciation for all suggestions and proposals put forward by the
members. "They tally well with conditions of our agriculture and
are very constructive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party's proposal for formulating China's economic
development plan, he said, has set forth goals to be achieved in
farming in the next five and 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, Jiang said, China faces difficulties as
well as favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
Existing problems include reduction of arable lands, frail
basic facilities, low capacity to fight natural disasters,
shortage of funds, low production capacity and scientific
standards, and heavy burdens for farmers, he told the members.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the vice premier said, the problems have caught
the attention of the Party Central Committee and the State
Council, and the central authorities are taking measures to have
them solved.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that CPPCC National Committee members
would support agriculture as always and contribute more
suggestions and proposals in this regard.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President Returns Home From 3-Nation tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
returned home today after a 10-day tour of India, Singapore and
Thailand, during which he attended the first Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) in Bangkok on March 1-2.
</P>
<P>
The president's tour is aimed at promoting his country's
economic expansion into South and Southeast Asia and reinforcing
Seoul's diplomacy with non-aligned countries.
</P>
<P>
He said on arrival at the Seoul Airport that national strength
would be fostered by pushing ahead more forcefully with
globalization and updated information technology in all areas of
the national administration
</P>
<P>
"I earnestly ask the citizens to fully support and participate
in fulfilling the mission of the times to build a world-class
country in the 21st century", he said.
</P>
<P>
On his meetings with leaders of some countries during the ASEM,
Kim said he made it clear to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto that Tokto Island is considered Korean territory in
terms of both history and international law.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have slipped to a record low
in years because of Japan's fresh claims to Tokto (Takeshima)
Island in the East Sea (Sea of Japan).
</P>
<P>
Referring to the third ASEM conference which will be held in
Seoul in the year 2000, Kim said it will "provide the momentum
needed to elevate our country's international status in an
epoch-making manner."

<HEADLINE> What in No. Four Pit of Qin Shi Huang's Mausoleum? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 4 (xinhua) -- A kind gesture by an emperor to
pardons thousands of criminals may be the answer to a mystery at
the site of China's famous terracotta warriors.
</P>
<P>
The first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), Qin Shi
Huang, had 8,000 terracotta warriors and horses buried in three
pits attached to his mausoleum to guard him in the nether world.
</P>
<P>
The so-called terracotta army has now become one of world's
most important attractions. The three famous pits were discovered
in 1975, exposing their incredible life-like figures to the
outside world for the first time in over two thousand years.
</P>
<P>
But few people have been able to solve the answer to the
question, what was the purpose of an empty fourth pit. It was
found located in the middle of the three pits.
</P>
<P>
What was - or should have been - inside the pit, experts have
pondered for years.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zhongyi, director of the Museum of Terracotta Warriors and
Horses of Qin Shi Huang, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
has now revealed for the first time, a possible answer.
</P>
<P>
The fourth pit is 4.8 meters deep, extending for 48m in a
west-east direction and 96m in a north-south direction.
</P>
<P>
Said Yuan: "The depth of the pit is the same as the other
three, " adding that the Fourth Pit made the whole layout of the
pits balanced.
</P>
<P>
Yuan says that during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC),
at the end of which Qin Shi Huang conquered the other six states
and unified China, the army was established into the left, right
and middle branches.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, Number One Pit contains the right branch,
Number Two contains the left, while Number Three serves as the
headquarter pit.
</P>
<P>
But where was the middle branch at the site? Some
archaeologists are now convinced that the Number Four Pit is the
missing middle branch.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, explorations have shown that there was probably
nothing in the pit. This was confirmed last year when
archaeologists excavated the pit and found it empty.
</P>
<P>
"The reason why it is empty, perhaps, can be found in
historical records, " Yuan says.
</P>
<P>
"Records of the Historian", a book written by Szuma Chien, a
famous Chinese historian of the First Century BC, has shown that
Emperor Qin Shi Huang had accepted a suggestion from a minister to
pardon the criminals who were obliged to build his mausoleum. They
were drafted into the army to fight against uprising peasant
forces.
</P>
<P>
"May be the Number Four Pit was thus unfinished," says Yuan.
</P>
<P>
But he points out that the empty pit is still valuable,
because it was built by people more than two thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
Now the pit has been buried again, except for the northwestern
corner. A glass cover has been placed in the corner, where
man-made traces can clearly be seen, so that tourists can see for
themselves the pit from which a live army was able to march away.
It will also enable experts to do research work.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Strict Measures to Control Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has decided
to take strict measures to control the increasing foreign workers
in the island country.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent decision announced by Ministry of
Interior, an amended bill regarding illegal foreign workers will
soon be tabled before the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides that employers who illegally use foreign
workers will face penalties of fines up to 5,000 Cyprus pounds
(about 10,000 U.S. dollars) and a three-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
At present, the fine for illegally employing foreign
workers is only 200 pounds (about 400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last week, officials from the Interior and Labour Ministries
had a meeting with trade unions to work out the later-announced
bill, which stipulates strict criteria for the employment of
foreign maids in an effort to reduce the number by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, there are about 5,500 foreign house
maids in the government-controlled southern part of the island,
where there is a population of about 620,000, and a total of
22,000 foreign workers, of whom 12,000 are illegal.
</P>
<P>
There are also 1,100 foreign artists, 4,800 offshore company
employees and 2,500 foreign employees in the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions have lodged complaints to the government about
the negative impact of foreign workers on the island.
</P>
<P>
In hundreds of cases foreign workers force Cypriots into
unemployment, because they are prepared to work for lower
wages.
</P>
<P>
Official records show that in many local industries there are
more foreign workers than Cypriots. In addition, the presence of
foreign workers on the island has caused some social problems,
bringing about a negative impact on the Cypriot customs and
culture.
</P>
<P>
Lured by more profits, some foreign workers get involved in
illegal work such as drug trafficking, and they are more often
than not the victims of exploitation because they are not in a
position to seek government help.

<HEADLINE> hke-- Intel Admits Latest Pentium Chips Faulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest manufacturer of
computer chips, Intel, admitted that its latest Pentium Pro chips
have a serious fault that slows computers' speed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time within 18 months that Intel admitted
deficiencies in its silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
The flaw in the latest chip does not affect the accuracy of the
data but slows the chip in certain circumstances, the Daily
Telegraph reported.
</P>
<P>
"In a worst case scenario, it was probably operating at about
10 to 20 percent of what people would expect," Intel said.
</P>
<P>
Intel has sold about 100,000 of the Pentium Pro chip sets to
computer manufacturers and it said that 1,000 or 2,000 of those
chips may contain the flaw and need replacing.
</P>
<P>
A tiny calculating error in Pentium chip -- the flagship in
Intel's portfolio until the advent of the Pentium Pro -- forced
the company to replace the chips for users' computers.

resulting in 90 percent of livestock being frozen to death. It
also caused major fuel and food shortages among the near 20,000
local population, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the two organizations said they worked out an
emergency aid plan after investigations in the disaster-stricken
area.
</P>
<P>
Medecin Sans Frontieres is an international humane
organization, based in France. Tibet Develop Fund is a Chinese
non-government organization, launched by late 10th Banchan Lama
and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice-Chairman of the Eighth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The officials said they plan to deliver another four million
yuan worth of aid to the snowstorm victims in the near future. The

LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Racial discrimination and violence
are rampant in Britain, inflicting troubles to millions of Britons
in everyday life, according to a report of a civil rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
The organization, named Liberty, made the claim in its report

Discrimination, the Guardian newspaper said today.

The report details incidents of discrimination against

<HEADLINE> Iranian President's Daughter Defies Ban on Satellite Dishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The daughter of Iran's moderate
president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today attacked the ban on
satellite dishes, saying that the ban was the result of a wrong
policy.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot limit the satellite or video movies. I believe
that the policy of limitation and banning is a wrong policy,"
said Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani, daughter of President Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
She said in an interview with liberal daily Akhbar that Iran
had no choice but to strengthen its native culture to fight
against "cultural invasion."
</P>
<P>
"We have to use our own cultural resources in order to
fight against cultural invasion. We have no choice but to
enrich our own cultural phenomena," she said.
</P>
<P>
Faezeh Rafsanjani, 33, is known for her liberal views on
women's participation in politics, management and sports. She is
running as a candidate for the Parliamentary elections to be
held on March 8.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried in a weekly, Faezeh Rafsanjani
was first rejected by the Guardians Council. But her name finally
found its way onto the list of 3,232 qualified candidates for the
crucial parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
She has repeatedly come under attack by the rightist
publications, especially for her efforts to promote sports among
the Iranian women.
</P>
<P>
She added that communications had become so advanced that
cultural invasion was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Iranian armed policemen have
confiscated 2,250 satellite dishes as part of the efforts to
contain the influence of the Western culture.
</P>
<P>
The controversial issue of satellite has been hotly debated in
Iran for well over one year and the Iranian Majlis (parliament)
finally approved the bill of ban on using satellite equipment in
April 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, manufacturer, distributor and illegal
users of satellite equipment will be punished with confiscation
of all satellite equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign organizations such as embassies and news
agencies are permitted to use satellite facilities, but they
should have a license issued by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Faezeh Rafsanjani also told the daily that she was against
any group's monopoly over the parliament.
</P>
<P>
She denied that Iran has allowed the participation of the
opposition in the elections under political pressure from
abroad, saying that the decision was made in view of the
"needs of the people and the revolution."
</P>
<P>
"Some 17 years after the victory of the revolution, it is
high time we allowed others to take part so that the
monopoly would be destroyed," she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Children under age 18 in the
United States have come to bear the brunt of sex offenses, the
Justice Department said in a report released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The department estimated that 43,552 state prison inmates
raped or sexually assaulted children under 18 in 1991. That
represents 65.5 percent of the estimated 66,482 state inmates
convicted of raping or sexually assaulting victims of all ages.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that more than half the child victims of rape
or sexual assault were aged 12 or younger, with three-fourths of
them being female.
</P>
<P>
The government found that 97 percent of the prisoners who had
attacked children were male, nearly 70 percent of them being white.
</P>
<P>
As of last September, 14 states had adopted what is categorized
as community notification statutes, providing some degree of
notice to a community when certain sex offenders were released
from prison. They were Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New York,
Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department study was based on interviews of 14,000
inmates at 277 prisons in 45 states during 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shenyang Accounting Firm
(SAF) has become the second in China to join a leading
international accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
The first is an accounting firm in Shenzhen, a special economic
zone in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
After becoming a member of the Britain-based Moores Rowland
International, which has 120 members in more than 70 countries and
regions, the SAF will be allowed to use Moores Rowland's name in
conducting business when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The SAF will also be helped by accountants and other experts
from Moores Rowland's other members, get involved in business in
China undertaken by Moores Rowland's members, and use Moores
Rowland's service network to provide auditing services for its
clients in floating equities at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The SAF is a leading accounting firm in China and is one of the
few accounting firms the Chinese government has approved to audit
listed companies.
</P>
<P>
"Our co-operation with the SAF will enable us to offer more and
better services for clients with investments in Liaoning," said
Charles Maynard, Moores Rowland's chairman.
</P>
<P>
The SAF's director Huang Yuguo said, "Our joining Moores Rowland
International shows that China's accountants have been recognized
by overseas peers."
</P>
<P>
China needs at least 300,000 certified public accountants in
building a market-oriented economy. Joining hands with leading
international accounting firms will help train accountants and
improve management for China's auditing market.
</P>
<P>
To date, most of Chinese accounting firms are managed by the
government. Allowing international accounting institutions to
accept Chinese accounting firms as their members indicates that
China is making efforts to bring its accounting and auditing
systems into line with international practice.

China's communications and railway transportation system needed
further development to meet the demands of progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China, a leading grain,
cotton, and oil-bearing crop base, is making preparations for
spring planting as thoroughly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The area's five provinces and autonomous regions had crop and
livestock losses as a result of droughts, floods, frost, and
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is to expand acreage for
cotton, maize, and water melons using plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's Xihaigu area, which was hit
by severe droughts for four consecutive years, plans to grow more
autumn crops, because it receives less rain in spring, and to
boost vegetable production.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai's provincial government has earmarked 15 million yuan
in loans for agriculture to be used to purchase fine wheat and
rape seeds from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province has launched a massive campaign of capital
construction and irrigation projects on farmland, resulting in
14,000 new water wells, 597 pumping stations, and 1,000 km of
reinforced dykes.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province called on each farm household in arid areas to
build a 100-sq-m water collection pool and to dig two water
storage wells as a principal form of dealing with the long dry

<HEADLINE> Horse Armor Found in Noble Tomb from 1,500 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A set of traditional horse armor,
more than 1,400 years old, has been found in a noble tomb in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The armor, discovered in Beipiao city, dates from the Southern
and Northern Dynasties (420-589).
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that similar relics have been found
previously in Jilin city, which used to be part of Koguryo (2th
Century BC-668 AD). But similar items have also been discovered in
Korean Peninsula and Japan Archipelago.
</P>
<P>
"That indicates that the Japanese archipelago and Korean
Peninsula accepted influences from ancient China, with Koguryo as
the media," experts say.
</P>
<P>
The horse armor was found in a three and a half meter long
wooden coffin, which was over a meter wide and almost a meter high
-making it the largest coffin found in a group of noble tombs in
Beipiao.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 relics have been unearthed from the tombs,
including pottery jars, iron axes and swords, bronze basins and
gold ornaments.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists are paying special attention to a gold needle no
longer than five cm. "It is rarely found," they say.

<HEADLINE> Profile: From Orphan to NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- When Mrs. Chen Lunfen came to
check in today for the annual session of the National People's
Congress (NPC), many of her acquaintances could hardly recognize
her. She can now stand and her legs are no longer handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old NPC deputy from Beijing is two centimeters
taller since last year when her legs were cured by an orthopedic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
More than four decades go, she got handicapped because of
malnutrition after she was sent to an orphanage run by Americans
in 1947 when she was just one year old.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, more than 90 percent of the orphans at the
nursery died, but I was fortunate to survive," Chen said. "Had the
government not taken over the nursery in time, I would have died."
</P>
<P>
Chen grew up at a children's welfare institute after New China
was founded in 1949, and successively entered primary and middle
schools and secondary vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
"In these schools, the state provided me with studying and
living expenses and, even during the hard years of temporary
difficulties in early 1960s, we orphans in the welfare institute
had more food rations than ordinary residents," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
Upon graduation from secondary vocational school in 1969, Chen
started to work in a state-owned factory as an engineer. She is
now having a happy family, and her son was recruited by a
university in Beijing last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, then 32-year-old Chen Lunfen was elected a deputy to
the Fifth National People's Congress and subsequently attended the
Sixth, Seventh and Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
"In China, orphans, under the loving care of the state, enjoy
full political and democratic rights when they grow up," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Chen is working with other NPC deputies to put forward a motion
to increase the supervisory function of the people's congress.
</P>
<P>
As an NPC deputy, Chen said, she often goes on inspection tours
in other parts of the country, during which she witnesses the
improved conditions in China's welfare institutions. This shows
the importance the Chinese government has attached to the
children's welfare institutes.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her indignation at the groundless accusations
fabricated by some foreign organizations and media against the
children's welfare institutions in China.
</P>
<P>
"I have lived in two orphanages under two kinds of social
systems. At the American-run nursery I suffered a lot, but I grew
up and lived happily at the welfare institution of new China.
Today, I am an NPC deputy," she said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladeshi PM's Proposal Offers Little to Resolve Political Crisis (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's political impasse will
remain as long as the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
and the opposition refuse to make substantial comprise, analysts
here said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia Sunday offered to form a
non-party government to supervise future national elections, only
to be rejected by the mainstream opposition minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, also chairperson of the BNP, promised in a
radio and televised speech Sunday night that a bill would be
introduced in the first session of the newly-elected sixth
parliament to amend the constitution for forming a non-party
government during all national elections in the future.
</P>
<P>
The ruling BNP along with some small parties and independent
candidates took part in the February 15 elections that were
boycotted by the mainstream opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties had been pressing for holding the
elections under a neutral undertaker government and for the
resignation of Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia also said steps would be taken to hold the seventh
parliamentary elections as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
She urged all political parties, including the mainstream
opposition parties, to immediately come to negotiations with an
open mind and discuss the proposal for the non-party government
and other related issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition rejected her offer minutes after the
speech.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activists in Dhaka, Chittagong and some other
districts blasted bombs, damaged motor vehicles, torched buses and
clashed with police and BNP supporters in their protest against
the "move to legalize (February 15) farcical polls."
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami (People's)
League (AL), the Jatiya (National) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami
-- called for a dawn-to-dusk general strike in the capital and
some other districts on March 6.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the opposition rejected the new proposal
because the offer did not meet their demand for the cancellation
of the February 15 elections and resignation of the present
"illegal" BNP government.
</P>
<P>
"If Begum Khaleda Zia realizes the necessity of holding
elections under a neutral caretaker government, firstly, she will
have to cancel the February 15 polls; secondly, her government
should resign immediately and, thirdly, she should make
categorical declaration for holding elections under a non-party
neutral caretaker government within a specific time frame," said
AL President Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
She added it would be impossible to find a solution on the
basis of the "ill-motivated speech" of the prime minister that
"did not specify any framework."
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, BNP workers and supporters brought out a series
of spontaneous and jubilant processions hailing the prime
minister's speech.
</P>
<P>
They praised the speech as of great help to resolve the
political crisis in Bangladesh and urged the opposition to
contribute in opening up a new era of strengthening the country's
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats here said the prime minister's address is
actually in line with the ruling party's strategy to confront the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the BNP had to defy the opposition's boycott
to hold the February 15 elections to fulfill constitutional
obligation after the dissolution of the fifth parliament.
</P>
<P>
With many flaws and a low turnout on the polling day, the
government now has to take steps to legalize its rule, said the
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the BNP has stepped up its crackdown on the
opposition's violent activities and arrested some prominent
opposition leaders as a head-on blow.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the BNP and government repeatedly talk about
peaceful resolution to the political crisis as they know the
opposition will not accept the offer unless the February 15 polls
is canceled and the present government resigns, the diplomats
added.
</P>
<P>
With the ruling and opposition parties still a world apart and
making no true compromise, the political situation will remain
tense.
</P>
<P>
The key problem now is the legality of the February 15 polls.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Putting New Housing System Into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A new housing system, focusing on
housing commercialization and public fund-raising for housing
construction, is being carried out in the urban areas of east
China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 some 65 cities and counties in the province
had established the accumulation fund-collection system for the
purpose of improving housing conditions for local residents,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
So far, the 11 major cities directly under the provincial
government have accumulated over two billion yuan for housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the accumulation fund is handled by a
special housing fund administrative center, which takes charge of
its safe operation and appreciation.
</P>
<P>
At present the province has loaned a total of 1.1 billion yuan
for housing construction province-wide by taking advantage of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some major cities of the province such as Zhenjiang,
Wuxi, Xuzhou, Changzhou, Nanjing and Yangzhou have also provided
mortgage loans for residents to purchase residences.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Suzhou City, a leading tourist resort in southern
Jiangsu, had granted loans totalling 31.5 million yuan by the end
of last year for 2,391 households to buy houses.
</P>
<P>
The province still pays great attention to the construction of
economical and practical housing for residents with financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Also, the province is doing its best to cut construction costs
or reduce part of the housing construction taxes so as to lower
housing prices for people with limited incomes.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone Jiangsu constructed 1.25 million sq m of the
low-cost housing and completed more than one million sq m of
residences, enabling 17,000 households with average per capita
living space of less than 4 sq m to move into well-equipped and
spacious residences.
</P>
<P>
The provincial source said that the selling of publicly-owned
flats and the raising of housing rents have spurred the
commercialization of housing in the province.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 71 cities and counties of the province have made
headway in selling the publicly-owned houses to residents. For
example, Changzhou City in southern Jiangsu has so far privatized
58 percent of the city's total housing property.

<HEADLINE> Mosques Turn into Election Headquarters in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the crucial
Parliamentary elections, Iranian mosques are turned into election
headquarters in a bid to safeguard the Islamic system ruled by
clergymen.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian daily Jomhuri Eslami reported that angry
readers have called in to express their disgust over the election
activities in the mosques by the candidates of March 8th
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Mosques should be used to encourage people to take part in the
elections. It should not be used to publicize individual
candidates and factions," callers said.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of any political party or any platform, mosques
are transformed into election headquarters publicizing only
candidates proposed by the right-wing Society of Combatant
Clergies (SCC) headed by hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
SCC which controls the parliament has strong links to all
clergies who run the mosques. It also influences the Bureau of
Mosque Affairs (BMA) which oversees all the mosques' activities in
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here noted that SCC is fully supported
by Ali Khamenei, both revolutionary and religious leader.
</P>
<P>
In response to wide spread rumors in the country, Ali Khamenei
today issued a statement, saying that he has issued no order on
approval or refusal of the eligibility of candidates running for
the Fifth Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The leader's office even threatened that legal action will
be taken against those who make such claims.
</P>
<P>
An opposition group Sunday charged that BMA refused to give
them permission to hold meetings at the mosques.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Movement of Iran (FMI), a liberal opposition group
which boycotted Friday's elections, said in a statement faxed to
Xinhua that mosques were directed by BMA not to issue permits for
their meetings.
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of mosques in Iran run by an estimated
150,000 clergymen. The mosques have historically played an
important role in Iran's politics.
</P>
<P>
They were used as the center of political activism that led to
the downfall of Moahammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Christians in Western countries who visit their churches
once a week on Sundays, devout Moslems visit the mosques five
times a week. Some 95 percent of Iranians are Moslems, which
explains why mosques play an important role in their lives, both
as a religious and political center.
</P>
<P>
In poor neighborhoods of Tehran and in the provinces, the
mosques are involved in practically every aspect of the people.
</P>
<P>
A political scientist at Shahid Beheshti University who spoke
on condition of anonymity said that this year's elections were
influenced by the clergies and the merchants who wanted to buy
people's votes.
</P>
<P>
"Mosques control the political dialogue. Rather, they create
a form of political monologue. The merchants provide food items
to the people in exchange for their votes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only alternative to mosques are the universities which
are controlled by the government. That leaves no room for
free expression of opinion before the elections," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have admitted that there are candidates
that are trying to buy people's votes by providing food items
to the voting public.
</P>
<P>
Even Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that candidates
who want to get votes by providing financial incentives had to be
eliminated from the race.
</P>
<P>
Jomhuri Eslami reported today the supporters of a candidate
in Karaj, a city 45 kilometers west of Tehran, sold eggs
below the market price to the people on the streets.
</P>
<P>
"The truck carrying the eggs had posters of the candidate
on it," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that in the absence of political
parties with clear platforms, Iranians who decide to vote can
be easily swayed by the wrong motives, either religious or
financial.
</P>
<P>
There are four major factions competing for 270 seats in this
week's elections but there are yet no political parties in
Iran.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Military Lifts Curfew For March 17 Presidential Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's second round of
Presidential election is to take place on March 17, Head of State
Julius Maada Bio announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"We accept the results of the Presidential and Parliamentary
Elections and hope people would turn up to vote massively in the
runoff of the presidential elections," Brigadier General Bio said
in a broadcast to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the oldest party in the west African state, the
Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), won the most votes in the
February 26 Presidential Election but not enough for an outright
victory, according to the results announced by the Central
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
SLPP leader Ahmad Tejan Kabbah won 35.8 percent of the votes
and will face a runoff ballot against his nearest rival, john
Karefa-Smart of the United National People's Party, who won 22.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bio's military government lifted the 8 a.m. to 6
a.m. curfew imposed a week ago to "give the two presidential
candidates the chance to campaign".
</P>
<P>
Observers say Bio's statement marks a big step for the
democratization process as there were doubts whether the army
would accept the results of the elections and allow the
presidential runoff to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Rebel attacks broke out during the elections held last week by
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the peace talks between
the military government and the RUF rebels had ended in vein at
Abidjan, Cote d'Voire on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Confirms Rule Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European soccer governing
body UEFA Monday announced they would scrap its transfer system
and limit on the number of European Union players in teams playing
in its competitions.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as a result of pressure from the European Union
following the judgement in the Bosman Case last December which
ruled that UEFA's transfer system and its limits on the number of
foreign EU players appearing in EU teams contravened EU laws.
</P>
<P>
A Commission spokesman revealed that they had received a letter
from UEFA and the latters confirm that the transfer system for
out-of-contract players moving across frontiers in the EEA
(European Economic Area) "is no longer applicable".
</P>
<P>
The EEA is formed of the 15 European Union states, Norway,
Liechtenstein and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the previous obligation to pay
compensation for transfer was no longer applies.
</P>
<P>
UEFA had also said they were to end the so-called 3+2 system
under which a club is limited to fielding three foreign players
and two assimilated players. An assimilated player is one who has
been with the club for five years and has come up from youth
teams.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Booming in "Silk Road" Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thriving cities along the ancient
"Silk Road" are becoming ideal destinations for an increasing
number of Chinese and overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that the cities, including Xi'an,
Dunhuang, Turpan, Yining, Kashi and Urumqi had received a total of
150 million Chinese and overseas tourists by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province, where the ancient Silk Road
started, is the most booming of the tourist cities. Last year this
city, near which were found the world-renowned life-sized
terracotta horses and warriors of the Qin Dynasty (BC 221-207)
earned 80 million US dollars from tourism, accounting for over 30
percent of its total exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang in Gansu Province is another beneficiary of tourism
since over 170,000 overseas tourists have visited its Mogao Grotto
of ancient murals since 1990, bringing about 200 million US
dollars in earnings. The previously isolated town has been turned
into a booming modern medium-sized city in the desert.
</P>
<P>
Turpan in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region attracts
tourists by the remains of the ancient cities of Jiaohe and
Gaochas well as the thriving grape cultivation and unique Uygur
folklore. During a grape festival last August, the small city
received over 20,000 tourists and earned over five million yuan
(602,400 US dollars) in tourism earnings.
</P>
<P>
Yining City on the Sino-Kazakhstan border, which was a major
pass on the Silk Road, has received about 120,000 tourists from
the Commonwealth of Independent States since it opened in 1992,
earning a total of 44 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that tourism in the over 20 cities along the
Silk Road will continue to boom in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Remark Israel's Agression in 1978 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- As the 18th anniversary of an
Israeli large-scale invasion into Lebanon is approaching, Lebanese
House Speaker Nabih Berri called here today to name March 14 as
a "National Day."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in the Parliament Building, the
Shiite house speaker called for a regard of March 14 as a
"National Day against the Israeli practices and its continuous
occupation in the South and Western Beqaa."
</P>
<P>
"What are you doing for the South and Western Beqaa if you know
and remember the brutality of the Israeli practises which still
continue?" asked Berri, who is also the head of the pro-Syrian
Amal Movement. The movement is one of the armed Lebanese factions
engaged in a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
He called on the world to remember and recall what Israel has
done and is still doing against the local residents in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri asked the Lebanese people to carry out activities on
March 14 to remark the Israeli aggression, announcing that a joint
conference of the Parliamentary Committee for Foreign Affairs and
the Committee for the Human Rights will be held on that day for
this purpose.
</P>
<P>
And he called on the Information Ministry, as well as the
local public media, to launch a propaganda campaign to expose the
Israeli practises to the world.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Lebanese political parties, professional
and trade unions to take initiatives to respond his appeal.
</P>
<P>
Under the guise of a retaliatory raid for a killing of
32 Israelis by Palestinian commandos, Israel unleashed the
"Litani Operation" on March 14, 1978, in a purpose to clear the
Palestinian fighters out of southern Lebanon and eliminate a
threat for the security on its northern border.
</P>
<P>
Before an international interference forced an Israeli
withdrawal, 2,000 Lebanese and Palestinians were killed and
250,000 were displaced.

SEOUL, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will repatriate Tuesday
two sailors of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
who were rescued on February 29 after their ship sank in the East
Sea (Sea of Japan).

<HEADLINE> ASEAN For Southeast Asian Nations Only: Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will face the risk
of losing its identity if its membership was opened to countries
outside Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told the
Seventh Southeast Asia Forum here today that the ASEAN belonged to
only the 10 nations of Southeast Asia, namely, Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, plus
Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said ties with non-Asian nations could be fostered
through some other means such as bilateral relations, dialogue and
common participation in large regional processions.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the report that Singapore recently raised the
possibility of Australia and New Zealand joining the seven-nation
ASEAN, the Malaysian foreign minister said: "We must draw the
line. I suggest we hold the line in Southeast Asia which is what
the ASEAN is all about."
</P>
<P>
"Identity, as we all appreciate, is a very serious matter
indeed. If we tamper with it or blur the lines, then we run the
risk of losing ourselves and our commitment to the identity. In
this case, it is ASEAN that is at risk." Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also said that when ASEAN's membership reached 10, its
priority should be consolidated, and the grouping would finally be
able to realize its full potential.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for consultation and consensus-building
in the face of challenges from the expanding membership. He said:
"I think we should find it increasingly in our mutual interest to
curb the occasional temptation for unilateral initiative without
adequate prior consultation."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from all 10 Southeast Asian nations attended the
forum.

<HEADLINE> PC Member Says Islamic Extremists Get Weapons from Israeli Mafia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Palestinian Council
(PC) said today that the Palestinian Islamic extremist groups
receive weapons from Israeli mafia.
</P>
<P>
Jamil Tarifi, in an interview with Cairo-based Sawt Al Arab
(Voice of Arabs) Radio, condemned Sunday's suicide bombing attack
on a bus in Jerusalem, which left 19 people dead.
</P>
<P>
He said that the groups which carried out such violent acts
receive money and weapons from outside the Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Tarifi added that even the Israeli mafia sells weapons to these
groups, urging the Israeli authorities to rein in the mafia.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed responsibility
for the attack and the two suicide bombings in Israel on February
25, which killed 26 people, in addition to the two assailants.
</P>
<P>
Tarifi, who did not directly refer to Hamas, said that the
extremist groups carried out their acts from areas not under the
control of the Palestinian Authority, which is ready to cooperate
with the Israelis to safeguard security.
</P>
<P>
Such terrorist acts should end as they are against the interest
of the Palestinian people, he said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Sunday's statement by Israeli President Ezer
Weizman that Israel should halt negotiations with the Palestinian
side, Tarifi said peace talks should be pushed forward and peace
agreements between the two sides should be quickly implemented.
</P>
<P>
Israel should release the Palestinian prisoners and stop
confiscating Palestinian lands, he added.

<HEADLINE> Child Abuse on Rise In HK -- Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The soaring incidence of child
abuse in Hong Kong has aroused wide attention in the territory,
according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Social Welfare Department handled 575 cases of
child abuse in 1995, a 28-percent rise from 450 the previous year,
the English-language newspaper Hong Kong Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police figures show that about 40 percent of the total number
of child abuse cases were reported in the northern New
Territories, where the rapid development of new towns has brought
a drastic increase in population.
</P>
<P>
The Prince of Wales Hospital, which is located in the New
Territories, almost received one abused child a week last year,
and the total number was about 50, 38 percent higher than that of
1994, said Dr Wong Wing-kin of pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the victims suffered from minor injuries,
and toddlers aged two or younger were often injured severely, most
on the head, said Dr Wong.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of cases happened to boys at the age of five to
nine, whose parents believe that physical sufferings would teach
their children a good lesson. Sexual abuses victims were more
likely to be girls above 10.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said that about 70 percent of child abusers were the
parents.
</P>
<P>
The Social Welfare Department has decided to set up eight more
district committees on anti-child abuse, in addition to the
present five.
These organizations will carry out publicity events and issue
publications to draw attention to this social problem, says the
paper.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, child abuse which endangers a child's life can
get 10 years in jail. Those found guilty of ill-treatment or
neglect of a child would receive a maximum penalty of three years
in prison.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Official on China's IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) - China has taken substantial,
practical and effective action, and has already made notable
achievements in intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, a
senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua correspondents, the official of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said, "China
has strictly observed relevant international conventions and
bilateral agreements on IPR protection."
</P>
<P>
"China's sincere position towards IPR protection, and the
capability of fully undertaking its international obligations,
have been widely appreciated and supported by world opinion," the
official added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a socialist legal system for IPR
protection with Chinese characteristics has been set in place, and
China has made unprecedented progress in terms of the pace of IPR
legislation.
</P>
<P>
On law enforcement, the official went on to say that Chinese
IPR laws provided for a complete set of judicial and
administrative routes for IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
China has gradually established IPR courts in provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions across the country in a bid
to strengthen IPR protection through judicial means.
</P>
<P>
The official said that for the same reason, an IPR court is
scheduled to be set up by the Supreme People's Court, based on its
specialized collegial panels.
</P>
<P>
"China's IPR law enforcement has been powerful and effective,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June 1995 China's courts had
received 3,052 patent cases and 2,551 had been heard.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional statistics 3,248 patent cases had been
received by the end of October 1995, and 2,847 had been heard.
</P>
<P>
Under Chinese law, patent infringers may be sentenced to
fixed-term prisonment of up to three years.
</P>
<P>
As for trademark protection, in 1995 the number of trademark
registration in force topped 530,000, with those from foreign
countries or regions recorded at about 80,000.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20,000 trademark infringement cases were handled last
year throughout the country, including 1,362 foreign-related, and
276 infringers have been transferred to the judicial system to
have any criminal responsibilities investigated.
</P>
<P>
China has raised the maximum sentences from three years to
seven years for trademark law infringers.

<HEADLINE> Afforestation Increase In Shanghai's Pudong New Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The afforestation rate in
Shanghai's Pudong New Area has gone from 5.5 percent to 12.5
percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Success in increasing the amount of green areas has been
attributed to the city's general plan for urban construction by a
local source.
</P>
<P>
The plan says that green areas in residential sections, in new
medical or scientific research units, or in large public
facilities should be no less than 30 percent of the total area,
and land alloted for afforestation purpose should be no less than
20 percent of the total area.
</P>
<P>
The local government has also set a goal of an afforestation
rate of 35 percent and an average per capita green area of 20 sq m
in Pudong by the early years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the general plan for urban construction, all 10
development zones and 28 towns in Pudong should work out designs
for afforestation when they are developing construction plans, or
they will not be allowed proceed with the development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Pudong New Area still set up a special
supervisory group to check the rate of afforestation. The group
has the right to halt building work in space intended for
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises are also subject to the
rules. According to the general urban construction plan, these
enterprises should make 35 percent of the land they purchase or
rent green, or they will not be given approval.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Develops Selenium-rich Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of 20-odd diseases
resulting from lack of selenium is expected to decline
considerably with the growing of selenium-rich crops on a large
scale in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The province, one of the country's leading grain producers,
harvested 200,000 tons of selenium-rich wheat and 100,000 tons of
selenium-rich paddy rice in 1995 by spraying seleniferous liquid
from the air at the crops' optimum growth period.
</P>
<P>
The acreage sown to seleniferous crops will be expanded to
200,000 ha this year, said a provincial official in charge of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The practice, developed by two research institutes in
Heilongjiang, can raise the content of selenium in crops by up to
33 times.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that people in two-thirds of China suffer from
selenium-deficiency-related diseases such as Keshan disease,
Kaschin-beck disease and diabetes. The same problem is found in 41
other countries worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes Measures To Improve Transport Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The confederation of zimbabwean
Commuter Omnibus Services (COZCOS) has announced several new
measures to improve Zimbabwe's transport services.
</P>
<P>
These measures include ensuring passenger safety, removing
overcharging, easing traffic congestion and a fair distribution
of services to all areas, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
COZCOS was formed last year by 60 commuter omnibus operators
from around the country to negotiate issues of concern to the
commuter transport industry.
</P>
<P>
The organisation said it was going to deal with the problem of
commuter hassling by rank marshals and to improve the rank
management system by ensuring that rank marshals were trained in
customer care, public relations and assistance, wore identification
badges while on duty and these will have to pass a police security
vetting exercise before qualifying for the job.
</P>
<P>
On the flouting of traffic regulations by commuter omnibuses,
COZCOS said it would implement fully all the provisions of the
traffic regulations that have been gazetted.
</P>

ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Both Pakistan and Iran are keen
to end the Afghan crisis but have adopted different ways to do so,
a visiting senior Iranian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Pakistan's Institute of Strategic Studies,

may have some differences on the Afghan issue, there is goodwill
from both sides to end the suffering of the Afghan people."
</P>
<P>
It had been reported that Iran recognized the legitimacy of the
Afghan current government led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran also wanted to keep Rabbani factor in the central position
of any possible future Afghan government.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan had the opposite views on these two issues.
</P>
<P>
Sarmade said, "Both Iran and Pakistan want to solve the Afghan
problem and we can cooperate and collaborate in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Sarmade arrived here Sunday on an official visit to Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Air Tanzania Makes Profit in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Air Tanzania made a profit
of 1.15 million U.S dollars during the 1994/95 financial year, an
encouraging sign that the airline business is recovering.
</P>
<P>
The Air Tanzania Corporation (ATC) Board Chairman, Joseph
James Mungai, said here today that this was an increase of 78
percent over the 1993/94 profit of 650,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mungai told Xinhua in a telephone interview that these
developments were "very encouraging", compared with the first 15
years in the ATC history when the airline had been "technically
bankrupt".
</P>
<P>
the ATC boss said between July 1994 and June 1995, the
operating revenue of the airline was 25 milliion U.S. dollars
with the costs as high as 23.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The improved performance was the result of an on-going
implementation of a comprehensive survival action plan launched
in 1992 to reduce costs, increase revenue and improve services,"
said Mungai.
</P>
<P>
The corporation had since been pursuing successfully efforts to
operate on a commercial basis through a disciplined and dedicated
workforce, he said.
</P>
<P>
Services and management were improved on the ground and air.
</P>
<P>
On all major domestic routes, the flights were operated with
jets while the frequency of Mwanza was increased to once per day
or more in response to passenger demand.
</P>
<P>
The ATC also attached top priority to schedule integrity
maintenance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Mungai promised that the corporation would
continue to do its best to meet the needs and expectations of its
customers.

<HEADLINE> Joint Ventures Between Malay, Chinese Races Remove Suspicion: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today said joint ventures between the country's
Malay and Chinese businessmen showed the removal of suspicions
between the two races.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing a gathering here organized
by the Malay Chamber of Commerce of Malaysia and the Associated
Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malay-Chinese joint ventures in the country
marked the beginning of mutual trust and a sense of sharing
between the businessmen of the two races.
</P>
<P>
"We are fortunate as we are able to forge this cooperation and
to reduce suspicions between the races," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed Malay and Chinese Malaysians are
playing equally important roles in the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"The good relationship in Malaysia has produced excellent
results," he said, describing it as something to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahathir, Malay companies are now employing
Chinese managers and executives while Malay managers and
executives are working in Chinese-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good achievement, a commendable one, and I am
confident such a situation can continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
With Malay-Chinese joint ventures increasing in Malaysia,
Mahathir expressed the hope for the close cooperation to eradicate
"alienation" between the races.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, all parties can benefit and all can be
successful," he said.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market today
rose at the news of a change of government after the federal
election last Saturday but computer glitch at the Australian Stock
Exchange (ASX) prevented it from setting a new record.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries index climbed 10.2 points to 2,323.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Computer software of the automatic trading system at the ASX
went wrong early in the morning and forced the session to be
delayed until 12:30 local time.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers said that investors gambled in a "blind market"
during most part of the day. Despite the inconvenience, a strong
market sentiment after a landslide victory of the Liberal-National
coalition in the election pushed the local bourse higher.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said if it were not for the computer malfunction, the
local bourse could have easily surpassed its record high of
2,340.6 points set on February 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 271.93 million shares, valued at

<HEADLINE> Industrial Exhibition Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>

<P>
YANGON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A nine-day Myanmar industrial
exhibition opened today in Bago, a city 80 kilometers north of
Yangon, the second this year following the one in Mandalay in
early January.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council
(SLORC) Senior General Than Shwe and other Myanmar leaders and
government ministers visited the exhibition, which was inaugurated
by SLORC Second Secretary Lieutenant General Tin Oo.
</P>
<P>
The two exhibitions were held to bring about cooperation
between the 13 industrial zones in the country, which include Bago
and Mandalay.
</P>
<P>
The Bago exhibition is also aimed at promoting private
industries and developing industrial production and management
techniques as well as imparting technical know-how to private
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
State and private industrial companies in the country display
their products at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has lately launched a series of efforts
to develop the country's private industries, including the opening
of a state-private industrial development bank last month.
</P>
<P>
Private industries accounted for some three quarters of the
country's industrial growth in the 1994-95 fiscal year, which
stood at 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's annual economic
growth rate averaged eight percent in the past four fiscal years
from 1992-93 to 1995-96.

poverty alleviation programs as well as state job creation
measures, local credit funds and guest worker programs. About
34,000 skilled workers should find work on their own.

The unemployment rate in Ho Chi Minh city stood at 6.22
percent, while the figure for Hanoi reached 7.2 percent and
Haiphong 7.26 percent.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Procedure Law To Be Amended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Major changes will be made to
China's 17-year-old Criminal Procedure Law to better protect the
rights of citizens, a spokesman for China's top legislature said.
</P>
<P>
"Significant revisions" will be made to strictly define the
roles of each judicial sector, namely, public security bodies,
procuratorates and courts, said Spokesman Zhou Jue at a press
conference held here today for the 4th session of the Eighth
National People's Congress, which opens tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The amendments are expected to improve cooperation and
coordination among law enforcement agencies in combating crimes
and enhance supervision over each other to prevent the abuse of
power, he said.
</P>
<P>
The amended law is expected to give procuratorates a greater
role in supervising law inforcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The amended law is also expected to better protect the rights
of the people by shortening the period of detention and by
boosting the roles of both the prosecution and the defence, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers will be allowed to contact their clients at the stage
of investigations rather than seven days before the court opens.
</P>
<P>
"These new stipulations will be conducive to the uncovering of
criminals accurately, punishing the guilty, and preventing the
innocent from being punished," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pending amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law indicates
that the pace of legal reform is picking up speed, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Vows to Adopt Tough Measures against Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has declared that he would take
tough steps against those harming Palestinian interests.
</P>
<P>
In a special address broadcast on Palestinian Television and
Radio in Gaza Sunday night, Arafat said that the PNA would use
what he called "an iron fist" against those who try to hurt the
Palestinian national interests and Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was apparently referring to the armed wings of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and the Islamic Jihad
although he did not mention them by names.
</P>
<P>
The severe statement came after the Hamas militants carried
out another suicide bus bombing attack in Jerusalem Sunday morning
killing 18 people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres declared a "total war"
against Hamas and other Radical Islamic groups and urged Arafat to
take tougher punishing steps against Hamas. The PNA announced to
outlaw all the paramilitary groups belonging to various
Palestinian organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, an aide to Arafat said
that Arafat had also called on Jordan and Syria to outlaw the
military wings of the radical Islamic movements.
</P>
<P>
The aide explained that Hamas groups in Jordan and Syria are
responsible for the suffering of the Palestinian people and
harming the Palestinian interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Movement (Fatah) is due to
hold a demonstration in Gaza today to protest violence and
condemn Sunday's bus bombing.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers, Additional Police Brought into Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The deployment of 1,000 soldiers
and 1,200 additional policemen in Jerusalem is scheduled to start
today, according to an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The decision of bringing extra forces to Jerusalem was made
Sunday at a special cabinet meeting of the Israeli government,
following a suicide bombing attack on a No.18 bus in the center of
Jerusalem, which at least killed 19 people and wounded 15 others.
</P>
<P>
The report said that additional forces will largely be used
for protecting the public transport system, a mission which was
difficult for police to handle because of the large forces needed
to protect 500-600 buses operating at peak times.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli Transport Ministry will convene a
special team today in charge of implementing the plan to hire 800
guards for the security of public transportation.
</P>
<P>
The guards, some of them wear civilian clothes and others wear
uniforms, will go through a one-week course before they go on
duty.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, following the suicide bomb, Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres announced at a press conference a list of new
security measures to fight against the terrorist, which includes
the reinforcement of security personnel inside Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, an angry Peres declared his commitment to
"separation" between Israel and the Palestinians, adding that
about 300 million shekels (100 million U.S. dollars) would be set
aside to implement the separation.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the Israeli army is planning to
establish a two-kilometer wide security strip which will divide
Israel from the Palestinians in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Strip will run from Jenin area in the north of the West
Bank to Har Hebron in the south, and Palestinians who have home
and land in the strip will receive special permits to be in the
area.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Charge of Drug Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
strongly rejected a U.S. report accusing Iran of drug production
and drug transit.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement carried in today's English daily
Tehran Times, Iran's Headquarters for Anti-Drug Campaign said that
the U.S. claim is a baseless report prepared annually by the
U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
The State Department, in its annual report on anti-drug efforts
released on Friday, said that Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria
and Syria were listed as major drug producing and drug transit
countries.
</P>
<P>
Qodratollah Asadi, an official from the headquarters, was
quoted as saying that the U.S. statement was politically motivated
in order to put Iran's anti-drug policies into question.
</P>
<P>
He said almost all international organizations, including
delegations from International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) and
United Nation Drug Control Programs (UNDCP) have visited
installations built up along the borders to fight against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Iran's endeavors to pursue an effective anti-narcotics campaign
has never received aid from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has even opposed equipping of Iran and
Pakistan law enforcement forces by the U.N. along the joint
borders. the official added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has no right to interfere
in anti-drug campaign of other countries. Only UNDCP and
INCB are authorized to supervise anti-drug programs and prepare
their report on performance of each country.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that it had seized 126 tons of opium, 2 tons
of heroin, 11 tons of morphine and 15.8 tons of hashish in
1995.

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China has always supported the United Nations in its
activities for promoting peace and development, and that China
stands for appropriate reform of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with Freitas Do Amaral,
president of the 50th Session of the UN General Assembly, in the
Great Hall of the People here.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Do Amaral on his first China trip, Jiang

multi-polarization becoming increasingly conspicuous, economic
factors becoming more outstanding in international affairs and the

Commenting on the role of the United Nations, Jiang said the UN
has been playing a positive role in maintaining world peace, in

In the world today, featured by intertwined contradictions, it
is more necessary than ever for the UN to play this role, Jiang

the mission entrusted to it by the times, "it is necessary to
conduct appropriate reforms in the UN, he noted, adding that the
people of all countries hope that the UN will make even greater
contributions for a more splendid world in the next century under
the principles prescribed in the UN Charter.

Council and a developing country, has played an important role in
the international and UN affairs, Do Amaral said. He also briefed
the Chinese president on UN reform.

Amaral arrived here last Saturday to start his official China
trip. During his stay he has had talks with Chinese Vice-Foreign
Minister Li Zhaoxing and exchanged views on UN reform and the
financial crisis in the UN.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain and Jordan are to sign
an agreement to link their stock markets on Tuesday.
</P>

Bahrain is one of the main financial centers in the Gulf
Area. There are 37 firms on the Bahraini stock exchange with
total market capitalization of 1.7 billion dinars (4.5 billion
U.S. dollars)

<P>
The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United

<HEADLINE> UAE Glass Imports Treble in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The import of glass by the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has more than trebled in value over the
past five years due to the increased demand for tempered glass by
the booming construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The value of glass imports rose from 9.45 million U.S. dollars
in 1990 to 26.12 million dollars in 1994. It is estimated that in
1995 it had exceeded 30 million dollars, underscoring the growing
demand for glass in modern high-rise buildings, according to a
study by the Emirates Industrial Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, gross glass imports by the UAE
were 34,201 tons of which 281 tons were re-exported. This shows
the local demand in 1994 was 33,920 tons, which was more than
double the demand in 1990 of 13,770 tons.
</P>
<P>
The report also advised investors enterning glass manufacturing
to examine options offered in this industry. "Flat glass
manufacturing should be eschewed for the time being. However,
finishing, including application of reflective coatings, is
desirable as it can generate high value-added," it added.

<HEADLINE> Funds Deadly Needed In Zimbabwe's Health Ministry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health and
Child Welfare will receive another 129 million Zimbabwe Dollars
(13.7 million U.S.Dollars) from the treasury soon to avoid
collapse of the health delivery system.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the weekend, Minister of Health and Child
Welfare Timothy Stamps said that the government had realised that
health is ''a first'' priority.
</P>
<P>
''The additional 129 million will enable the ministry restore
the health delivery system to the 1994/95 financial year levels,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
''I indicated in my 1994/95 report that the level achieved
that year was much lower than it should have been due to a
shortage of resources,'' said Stamps, adding that half a loaf was
better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the ministry ran into trouble after it
was found that it had overspent. Due to unavailability of funds,
the ministry failed to pay its suppliers. In response, the
suppliers refused to make deliveries to hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals went without food, others without medicines as
the delivery system crumbled.

<HEADLINE> New Australian PM to Take Office on Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister-elect
John Howard today said the new federal government would be sworn
in on Friday and that he will meet the leader of the National
Party later in the day for talks on the composition of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
"It is anticipated the new ministry will be sworn in on Friday,
and I will be talking to the leader of the National Party and
incoming Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer later this afternoon
about the proportionalities of the Liberal-National Parties and
the coalition government arrangement," he said.
</P>
<P>
At his first press conference in Sydney since the
Liberal-National coalition won a landslide victory in the federal
election on Saturday, Howard said the Liberal Party would meet on
Wednesday to elect its leader and deputy leader.
</P>
<P>
Howard and his deputy Peter Costello are expected to be
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
But Howard declined to reveal details of the arrangement of the
new government, saying an announcement of the composition of the
coalition government would be made later this week.
</P>
<P>
The National-Liberal coalition defeated the Labor Party in the
election, winning at least a 44-seat majority in the House of
Representatives. But it is unlikely to win control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Howard promised a quick and smooth transition of the
government. He said that the new government would keep in touch
with the people and retain a sense of perspective and humility.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 4 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan police headquarters
today released mug shots of six Tamil rebels now supposed to be in
Colombo on a suicide mission, and requested public help to trace
them, according to police sources here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that such information could be conveyed to
police emergency units or police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Colombo police headquarters also released the names of six
other rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
without the photographs, inviting public information that could
lead to their arrest.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is reportedly planning to launch bombing attacks in
the capital Colombo. Government security forces have adopted
stringent security measures to guarantee the safety of the
capital, in particular its business center -- the Fort since the
end of February.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a 13-year war against the government
in the north and east of the island country in their bid for a
separate Tamil state.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4, (Xinhua) -- No matter how the method of
choosing Taiwan's leaders changes, it will not change Taiwan being
part of China, a spokesman for the NPC said at a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about his views on the coming
"election" in Taiwan, Spokesman Zhou Jue said,"There is only one
China in the world, the People's Republic of China is the only
legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China.
</P>
<P>
"Use of a different method for choosing Taiwan's leaders can in
no way change the fact that Taiwan is a region of China and
leaders of Taiwan are leaders of a region of China.
</P>
<P>
"It is futile to attempt using the method of producing leaders
in Taiwan to make them legitimate. And China is opposed to using
the leader-choosing method as a pretext to interfere in its
internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has always wished that leaders
on both sides of the Taiwan Straits meet with each other for talks
under the principle of one China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities would come back to the
"one China" stand in action as well as in words," he said. "Only
under such circumstances can a meeting of leaders from both sides
have significance."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Assess State Company Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has set up a special
import monitoring team to assess every state company project
before it is implemented, the local daily Kompas said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper over the weekend, State
Minister of National Development Planning Ginandjar Kartasasmita
said the team will work to ensure that state company projects
remain on track of the government's development program.
</P>
<P>
He said many state agencies often prefer imported products for
their projects, which is against the government policy.
</P>
<P>
The decree to set up the team, issued last Tuesday, will make
sure that unnecessary imports are curbed to encourage the use of
domestic products in government and state company projects.
</P>
<P>
The special team also has the authority to shelve or reschedule
projects that could put pressure on the current account, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance Saleh
Afiff, the team is directly responsible to President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
By setting up the import monitoring team, the Indonesian
government is seeking to strengthen the country's economic
self-reliance and to promote state companies as a market for
domestic products, said the newspaper.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Economic and
Technological Development Zone attracted a record 305.8 million US
dollars in Chinese and overseas investment last year, according to
today's "Beijing Daily".
</P>
<P>
The amount is equal to 66 percent of the total investment

</P>
<P>
Flexible policies are being pursued in the zone to encourage
investors from other parts of China and the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Rejects Prime Minister's Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's main opposition party
leader Sheikh Hasina has rejected a three-point proposal made by
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia in a radio and television speech
last night.
</P>
<P>
The proposal included a dialogue with the opposition and the
introducing of a constitution amendment bill in the newly-elected
parliament to approve all future national elections under a
non-party government.
</P>
<P>
Describing the proposal as a plot to constitutionally legalize
the "farcical polls" of February 15, Hasina said there was no
specific time frame in the speech for the elections under a
neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"She (Khaleda) did not mention when she would resign or when
the next general elections would be held," said Hasina, president
of the Awami (People's) League (AL), the biggest opposition party
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The offer for a dialogue is nothing but a bluff keeping
thousands of political leaders and workers behind the bar and
continuing killing and repression," the AL president said.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda's speech was her first major policy announcement after
the February 15 elections, which were boycotted by all mainstream
opposition parties and held amid widespread violence and alleged
rigging.
</P>
<P>
Her proposal came a week before the opposition's nonstop
non-cooperation campaign which is scheduled to begin on March 9 in
a bid to force the government to annul the February 15 elections
and resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hasina warned the government against giving constitutional
validity to the "one-party election," saying "the present
political crisis cannot be resolved on the basis of that so-called
election since the people have rejected it."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said opposition activists blasted bombs, damaged
motor vehicles, torched buses and clashed with police in Dhaka
after the prime minister's address to the nation on last night.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators marched in the street chanting anti-government
slogans demanding the immediate resignation of Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the prime minister's address, the mainstream
opposition parties have announced a dawn-to-dusk hartal (general
strike) in Dhaka and its adjoining districts on March 6.

</P>
<P>
A large stock of explosives was found not long ago at a cache

In addition to the LTTE, the sources said that smugglers and
pirates also operate in the area.

There have been several cases where pirates have struck off
shore and ransacked cargo vessels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The British Tourist Authority
(BTA) is kicking off its major tourism promotion campaign in
Thailand this week with the official opening of a tourism office
in the capital today, a local press report said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the office is aimed at attracting Thai
English-language students, young professionals and families to
Britain as tourists.
</P>
<P>
The BTA is planning to spend at least 160,000 U.S. dollars in
1996-97, mainly on printing promotional materials including
guidebooks and brochures, to draw more visitors to Britain.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, some 268,000 Britons toured Thailand, but only 52,000
Thai tourists went to Britain. The BTA aims to narrow the gap with
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that one of the major obstacles to
tourism promotion is the visa problem. Britons do not need visas
to visit Thailand, while thais must obtain visas to travel to the
west European country.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Have Better Notary Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- This capital of China has plans to
build a wrong-case compensation system for public notarial
institutions in a bid to improve notarial services, reports
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuming, director of Beijing Justice Bureau, said that his
bureau "is designing a rule on compensating clients for errors
made by notaries and notarial institutions."
</P>
<P>
If notaries and notarial institutions provided erroneous
certification, resulting in a client's failure in a case,
business, or other matter, the client should receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
"The city hopes to achieve an accuracy rate in notarized
documents of 99 percent this year," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has set up a special commission to investigate
professional malpractice and mapped out a "notaries penalty rule."
</P>
<P>
Notarial work can play a more important part in the growing
market economy, said he. "Notaries should explore the possibility
of providing notarial services concerning mortgage loans, real
estate, intellectual property rights, construction contracts and
other financial affairs."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the 244 public notaries at 24 notarial institutions in
Beijing provided services in 170,000 cases, involving property
valued at 10.2 billion yuan, up 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There were 34,900 domestic civil cases, 12,538 economic cases,
and 123,327 foreign-related cases, of which 12,680 were economic
matters, a rise of 33 percent," Zhang said.

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the International

According to reports reaching here on Monday, senior IOC
officials said that they would demand an explanation from world
swimming body FINA when the IOC and FINA meet in Lausanne this

Australian world champion and world record holder Samantha
Riley was given a warning instead of a two-year ban by FINA for
testing postive at last year's World short course championships in
Rio de Janeiro.
</P>

American Jessica Foschi tested positive for steroids but had
her two-year ban overturned last month by the U.S. swimming board.

IOC officials feared that the light sanctions imposed on the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Big-screen televisions are
becoming more and more popular across the China -- particularly
with newly-married couples.
</P>
<P>
Around eight million couples marry in China each year and many
of them are opting for a big, expensive TV set for their first
home, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
As living standards rise, young couples now have a greater
disposable income and are keen to keep up with new trends, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese retailers have reported good sales of sets with
large and medium-sized screens.
</P>
<P>
Sales of TVs with screens of over 64 centimeters increased
sharply. But the best sellers were TVs with 54 cm screens,
according to an investigation of China's 80 largest retail stores.
</P>
<P>
More than 650,000 colour TVs were sold between January and
November last year, up 24.3 percent over the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
While domestic TV manufacturers are capable of competing with
their foreign counterparts in producing medium and small screen
color TVs, they are not so competitive in making large screen
color TVs due to backward technology, insufficient capital and
lack of promotion. As a result, imported large screen TVs almost
dominate the domestic market, while the prices between imported
and domestic-made ones differ greatly.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Children Targets of Most Sex Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Children under age 18 in the
United States bear the brunt of sex offenses, the Justice
Department said in a report released today.
</P>
<P>
The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that
about two-thirds of the approximate 66,482 state inmates convicted
of raping or sexually assaulting victims during 1991 attacked
children under 18.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department report was based on interviews of 14,000
inmates at 277 prisons in 45 states during 1991.
</P>
<P>
It also found that more than half of those child victims were
age 12 or younger and three-fourths of them were female.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that 97 percent of the prisoners who had
attacked children sexually were male, and were more likely to be
white, nearly 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Starting last September, 14 states adopted what is categorized
as community notification statutes, providing some degree of
notice to a community when certain sex offenders were released
from prison.
</P>
<P>
They were Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Oregon,
Tennessee, Texas and Washington.

Talking about the 1997 return of Hong Kong to China's
sovereignty, Cheung said he is optimistic that closer links
between Hong Kong and the mainland will benifit Hong Kong
Telecom's business.
</P>
<P>
The firm has three branch offices on the mainland currently, in
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Over the weekend, it signed an
agreement with the State Education Commission to donate one
million Hong Kong dollars (130,000 US dollars) annually for three
years to support primary education in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheung, Hong Kong Telecom earned a profit of 1.3
billion US dollars last year, and has more than 15,000 employees.

<P>
BUCHAREST, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and two
others injured as a bus collided with a train today at Timis in
western Romania.
</P>
<P>
This is probably the worst since a January 26 incident in which
a bus crashed onto a passing train at Constanta, killing 12 people
and injuring 17 others.
</P>
<P>
Officials reported 14 such incidents in January alone, which
resulted in 15 deaths and dozens of injuries.

<P>
A total of 154 bus-train collisions took place last year,
killing 29 people and injuring 48 others.
</P>
<P>
Dumitru Ciobotea, director of the Romanian traffic police,
blamed bus-train collisions on reckless driving on the part of bus
drivers. He warned that drivers should pay more attention to
traffic signals at highway and railway crossroads.

STOCKHOLM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner
edged out veteran Mikael Appelgren in a five-set thriller to win
the men's singles title at the Swedish national table tennis
championships in Karlskrona on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, hailed as one of the sport all-time greats, used his
wickedly deceptive serves and topspin play to beat Appelgren
20-22, 15-21, 21-15, 21-16, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Waldner looked lackluster at the beginning and made quite a few
unforced errors to lose the first two sets. The former world
champion then found his form and took three sets in a row.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 world champion Joergen Persson and rising star Thomas
von Scheele finished joint third.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals earlier, Waldner downed Persson 3-2 while
Appelgren overcame Scheele 3-1.
</P>
<P>
In the women's final, Pernilla Pettersson routed Assa Svensson
3-0.
</P>
<P>
Erik Lindh combined with Persson to take the men's doubles with
a 2-0 victory over Peter Karlsson and Scheele.

WELLINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dairy industry
missed out on more than one billion NZ dollars in earnings during
the past two years due to the rise in the NZ dollar, according to

<HEADLINE> Americans Downsizing Their Dreams (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Job security was not yet an American concept," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the job insecurity is the most acute since the Depression
in 1990. Job elimination occurred in any age, any gender and any
professions. And this in turn "has produced an unrelenting angst"
that is shattering people's notion of work and self and the very
promise of tomorrow, even as the president proclaims recently that
the economy is "the healthiest it has been in three decades" and
even as the stock market has rocketed to 81 new highs last year,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
And more often than not, people who lose a full-time job get a
new one that pays less than the old, or is only part-time,
according to Labor Department figures.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that people's living was greatly affected by
lay-offs, which also has a great impact on social development. It
has rubbed "salt on the very soul of the country," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of families have to scale back their
lifestyles. Two-thirds of those in the Times poll said that in
recent years, the uncertainty of their economic future had
compelled them to curtail their day-to-day spending. One-fifth
said the cuts had been "severe."
</P>
<P>
Compounding this frustration are stagnant wages and an
increasingly unequal distribution of wealth. Adjusted for
inflation, the paper said, the median wage is nearly 3 percent
below what is was in 1979. Average household income climbed 10
percent between 1979 and 1994, but 97 percent of the gain went to
the richest 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many Americans have reacted by downsizing their expectations of
material comforts and the sweetness of the future. Half of those
polled by The New York Times thought it was unlikely that today's
youth would attain a higher standard of living than they have.
Well-educated Americans seem to be more pessimistic. Two-thirds
doubted that today's children would live better.
</P>
<P>
Workers are looking for various kinds of means to reserve
their rice bowls, including working harder and shrewder. The
majority of people polled said they would work more hours, take
fewer vacation days or accept lesser benefits to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Of those being polled, 63 percent, compared with 47 percent in
the whole population, want the government to do something about
job losses.
</P>
<P>
The paper said a growing number of people are asking themselves:
What are the safe jobs? What, in short, is an American dream
worth dreaming?

<HEADLINE> Americans Downsizing Their Dreams (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- More Americans are downsizing
their dreams for the future as they have found an increasingly
insecurity of their jobs over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times Sunday carried a lengthy article analyzing
the changes of the country's job market. According to statistics
of the Labor Department, more than 43 million jobs have been
erased in the United States since 1979. The figure is equal to a
third of all the jobs in the country today, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three-quarters of all American households have had a
close encounter with lay-offs since 1980, according to a new poll
by The New York Times. Half more people, about 3 million, are
affected by layoffs each year than the 2 million victims of
violent crimes, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The poll also indicated that entering the 1990s, workers with
at least some college education make up the majority of the
lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
The rate of job loss hit a peak of 3.4 million a year in
1992 and has remained nearly that high ever since, according to
government statistics.
</P>
<P>
"During most of the 1980s, roughly one in 25 workers lost a
job" in any two-year period, said Thomas Nardone, an official from
the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. "In the 1990s,
this has risen to one in 20 workers."
</P>
<P>
People running into acquaintances don't ask how their job is,
but whether they still have it, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the increased lay-offs to rapid
technological progress that "lets machines replace hands and
minds;" efficient and wily competitors; and the ease of
contracting out work.
</P>
<P>
Some economists herald the downsizings, messy as they are, as
necessary to compete in a global economy. American companies will
recapture their past dominance in world markets, and once again be
in a position to deliver higher income to most workers, they said.
</P>
<P>
But others predict that creating such fungible workforces will
leave businesses with dispirited and disloyal employees who will
be less productive.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that since 1979, more jobs have been
created than destroyed. There has been a net increase of 27
million jobs in America, enough to easily absorb all the laid-off
workers plus the new people beginning careers, and the national
unemployment rate is kept at a low standard.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Insecurity Back In Northern Uganda by Cai Guozhong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan People' Defence
Forces (UPDF) has since mid-February closed some roads in
northern Uganda, due to the penetration of the rebels of Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) into the region from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The LRA was founded in April l987 by Joseph Kony, a
32-year-old former catechist in a catholic parish after he fell
out with the catholic church.
</P>
<P>
Most rebels fled into Sudan in October, l994, after the UPDF
intensified attacks on them.
</P>
<P>
In October l995, the rebels fled deeper into Sudan because
their camps in Parajok, Palotaka and Owiny Kibul in Sudan were
raided by the Sudanese People's Liberation Army led by John
Garang.
</P>
<P>
Between October l995 and early February this year, there had
been no activities taken by the rebels to distabilise northern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, on Feb. 6, about 570 rebels entered Kilak County in
Gulu District, over 300 km north of here, from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 8, the rebels ambushed and killed Kiiza Auru, a
veterinary officer in Moyo District, and his driver. They also
clashed with the UPDF on Oyingi Bridge.
</P>
<P>
After entering northern Uganda, the rebels hit Nwoya County,
130 km from Ugandan-Sudanese border. They killed 14 people,
abducted 12 others, took 55 goats, burned 499 granaries, 300
huts, 12 shops, two trailer trucks, a tractor and rendered 257
families homeless.
</P>
<P>
On Feb 28, the UPDF launched an attack on the rebels at
Pachilo near Atiak, killing 33 rebels and injuring over 60
others. Seven UPDF soldiers and two civilians were also killed
and 18 UPDF men were wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the battle, LRA leader Kony was shot and wounded on the
shoulders and another LRA officer Lt. Col Charles Otim was
wounded on the left thigh.
</P>
<P>
It is said that after meeting heavy blows from the UPDF the
rebels are heading towards Kilak Hills, which are forested and
has many caves. Observers here believe if LRA rebels take Kilak
Hills as their base, it will be a headache for the UPDF to
eleminate them.
</P>
<P>
However, Brigadier Joram Mugume, a commander of the UPDF, told
newsmen on Friday that there was nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
The army was definitely capable of containing the situation,
he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkey Returns Protest to Greece over Naval Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today protested Greece for
its violation of the right of innocent passage through Turkish
territorial waters last week.
</P>
<P>
A brief statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that
the protest was made to the Greek Embassy's counselor.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Greece protested against Turkey last
Friday, saying that a Greek missile boat and a Turkish coast guard
vessel had collided near a disputed islet in the eastern Aegean
Sea. Greece also claims that the vessel was violating Greek
national waters.
</P>
<P>

the Turkish boat when the bow of the Turkish ship touched the
stern of the Greek boat.
</P>

<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Interior Awad
Khaleifat and Minister of Water and Irrigation Samir Kawar left
here today for Gaza, carrying a message from King Hussein to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The King, in his letter, expressed support to the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and expressed views of bolstering
bilateral cooperation to counter the recent suicide bombings in
Israel, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, today phoned
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres to express Jordan's
condemnation of recent suicide bombings against Israelis, the
latest of which occurred in Tel Aviv today, killing 12 people and
injuring over 120 others.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti phoned his
Israeli counterpart to voice his government's deep shock for the
latest terrorist attack against Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
The four terrorist bombings in Israel in the past week claimed
the lives of more than 60 people and made great negative impact
upon the ongoing Israeli peace talks with the Palestinians and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has pledged to cooperate with Israel, the PNA and other
regional powers to root out terrorism and extremism.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher said Sunday while
commenting on the bus bombing in Jerusalem that the prime
minister told Peres that Jordan "will not sit idle" and only
condemn terrorism but will do whatever it can to make sure the
"forces of evil do not succeed" in their efforts to torpedo the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Muasher also said Jordan supported and valued an initiative by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to convene an international
meeting to counter terrorism, which he described as a phenomenon
that requires international cooperation.
