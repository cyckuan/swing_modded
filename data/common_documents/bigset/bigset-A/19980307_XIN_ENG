<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges Washington Full Compliance With Nuclear Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) Friday urged Washington to fulfill its obligations
of an agreement under which Pyongyang froze its suspected nuclear
program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Korea Central News Agency, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "the U.S. has not taken
substantial measures to ease its sanctions but made empty talk for
years."
</P>
<P>
"And it (Washington) has made little progress in the
construction of light-water reactors (LWRs) under the pretext of
internal problems ... though it is more than two years since the
LWR supply agreement was adopted," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot but express deep concern over this insincere
attitude of the US toward the implementation of the framework
agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK signed a framework agreement with the United States in
1994, promising to freeze its nuclear plant. In return, Washington
agreed to ease its trade sanctions against Pyongyang and arrange
for international financing and supply of two modern reactors.
</P>
<P>
"We lost no time to freeze our independent nuclear power
facilities we had built with colossal funds and labor. We are
promoting the safe storage of spent fuel in the final stage."
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we have sincerely fulfilled our obligations under the
agreement, which the U.S. administration has officially confirmed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said U.S. fulfillment of its side of the agreement
was "lagging behind our sincere efforts."
</P>
<P>
"It does not make any sense to victimize our independent
nuclear power industry continuously with hopes pinned on the
light-water reactors that are not sure to come."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can predict what will happen unless the US seeks new
practical measures and takes decisive action to implement its
obligations under the agreement as scheduled," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Turkish Cypriots' Cooperation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) External
Relations Commissioner Hans Van den Broek Friday called on the
Turkish Cypriots to look toward future in dealing with the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day visit
to the island, Van den Broek described his visit not as a big
breakthrough but as a preparation for the opening of Cyprus-EU
accession negotiations, due to start on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said he held useful talks with President Glafcos
Clerides, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and George
Vassiliou who will head the Republic's negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU official expressed regret for Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash's refusal to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
Denktash turned down a request by the EU official for a
meeting in protest against the EU's decision to start accession
talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said he was encouraged by the fact that the
Cypriot government "is very much dedicated and seriously
considers how the interests of Turkish Cypriots can also be
respected in the arrangements for negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that Turkish Cypriot cooperation is
much required, expressing the hope that "Turkish Cypriots will not
concentrate on the present and the past but look clearly also
toward the future."
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said the Turkish Cypriot community will gain much
if a federal Cyprus enters the EU.
</P>
<P>
"I continue to hope that the Turkish Cypriot community will
also be able to accept that a common future (with the Greek
community) is a better solution than a separate one in relative
isolation," the EU official said.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that Cyprus' membership would help reunify the
island and wants the Turkish Cypriots to participate in the
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek also reaffirmed that the EU will not recognize
the breakaway state unilaterally declared in 1983 by the Turkish
Cypriots in the northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkey's attitude toward the EU, Van den Broek
said Turkey remains a key partner for political and economic
reasons and for reasons of good neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the EU regrets the interruption in its dialog
with Turkey resulted from Ankara's anger over EU's selection of
Cyprus as accession candidate. He expressed the hope it will only
be temporary, pointing out that a development in relations with
Turkey could have a certain impact and reflection on the attitude
of the Turkish Cypriot community.
</P>
<P>
British envoy for Cyprus and representative of the EU
presidency David Hannay accompanied Van den Broek for the visit to
the island.
</P>
<P>
Hannay has said that Cyprus' EU membership negotiations can
start without the Turkish Cypriots, but cannot be conducted
without them.
</P>
<P>
Denktash and Turkey reject Cyprus' accession before Turkey
itself joins the EU.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Army on High Alert on Yugoslav Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Defense Minister Sabit
Brokaj said Thursday that military forces stationed in the
country's northern part bordering Yugoslavia have been on high
alert to deal with any contingency in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Brokaj, as quoted by media reports here, made the remarks when
addressing inquiries to the People's Assembly, or parliament,
Thursday evening as a response to the recent escalated ethnic
violence in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Tension heightened in Kosovo last weekend after a Serbian
police patrol and local ethnic Albanians, who account for 90
percent of the regional population, engaged in a fierce cross-fire
that killed four policemen and 16 Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said Albanian troops have prepared for a
further escalation of the conflict, but denied any more military
movement to the border region at the present time.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Interior Minister Neritan Ceka
pledged to the parliament that Albania's frontier forces have been
ready to handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony for the reopening of a copper mill on Thursday,
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said his government would
"stand together with brothers in Kosovo, ready at all times to
help them carry out their justified national aspirations."
</P>
<P>
The Albanian parliament, however, ruled out the possibility of
military intervention into the Kosovo conflict.

<HEADLINE> BJP, Allies to Work Out National Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
and its allies decided Friday to set up a coordinating body and
formulate a national agenda by next Monday for effective
governance.
</P>
<P>
BJP leader Jaswant Singh told reporters after a two-hour
meeting between top leaders of BJP and its allies that those
present were unanimous in having such an agenda which would be
adopted by all the allies before the constitution of the 12th Lok
Sabha on March 12.
</P>
<P>
Singh declined to reveal details of the agenda, saying they
would be made known when the agenda is finalized on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, another leader of the BJP, Naveen Patnaik, made it
clear that the agenda would not contain any controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
BJP remains India's largest political force following the
just-concluded Lok Sabha elections but failed to win the necessary
majority to form a new government on its own.
</P>
<P>
Its prospects for forming a new government have brightened as
its opponents, the Congress and the United Front, are still
divided over the nature of their collaboration.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
streamline its family planning program to spur prosperity in the
country, Minister for Population Welfare Syed Abida Hussain said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the "Preliminary Findings of Pakistan
Fertility Planning Society Survey 1996-97," Abida said the
public's response to the family planning program is "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Abida called on those engaged in family planning services to
work with passion to create awareness among the public in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Without checking over-population, Abida said, it is impossible
to ensure the provision of education, health, information and
communication facilities to people and enable them to enjoy a
happy life.
</P>
<P>
She called on the people to have a small family and urged the
promotion of education, especially for women.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the National Institute of
Population Studies, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan now has a high population growth rate of about 2.7
percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia Outraged at Latvia's Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin Friday strongly denounced his Latvian counterpart
Guntars Krasts's allegation that Moscow was involved in
Russian-speakers' protest action in Riga, the capital of Latvia.
</P>
<P>
"How is it possible to go to such lengths as to claim that
Russia allegedly put pensioners on the picket line," said
Chernomyrdin, extremely indignant at the statement.
</P>
<P>
With such premiers like Krasts, said the Russian prime
minister, the relations between Russian and Latvia can degenerate
into very dramatic developments.
</P>
<P>
"It is inadmissible to trample underfoot human rights in Europe
at the end of the 20th century. There is no justification for
this," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Krasts has stated that "the picket of pensioners outside the
Riga Duma on March 3 might be a Russian provocation," an Itar-Tass
news agency report said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the right and status of the Russian-speakers
remains key obstacle in the growth of relations between Russia and
Latvia since the Baltic state gained independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
There are some 700,000 Russian-speakers in Latvia, among them
only 4,500 have been given the Latvian citizenship.

MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Prime ministers of the Commonwealth

promote cooperation within the bloc, reported Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Signed at a day-long session of the CIS Council of Heads of
Governments, the documents call for transnational corporations, a
common CIS agricultural market and cooperation in military and
judicial affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, a few documents failed to get unanimously signed.

Speaking at the end of the assembly, Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin urged the CIS members to speed up the building
of a free trade zone within the framework of the commonwealth to
deepen and develop their contacts.
</P>
<P>
He called on removing all artificial barriers and developing
all that promotes integration of the organization.
</P>

Chernomyrdin pointed out the fact that Russia's trade turnover
with other CIS members totalled 30 billion U.S. dollars last year
proves that "We need each other."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Calls for New Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf
Denktash Friday called on Cyprus' re-elected President Glafcos
Clerides to cooperate in creating a new Cyprus based on the
existence of two sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
In a letter from Denktash to Clerides, a copy of which was
faxed to Xinhua, Denktash laid down three main criteria for a
reconciliation on Cyprus: to delineate the boundaries, to settle
the exchange of property and security matters.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Denktash said "I am convinced that the best way
to build a better future is first to reach a common understanding
on the guiding principles which will shape that future."
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental point in the circumstances of Cyprus is
clearly the sovereign equality of the two sides based on the
principles of symmetry and mutual respect," added the Turkish
Cypriot leader.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia. The Turkish
Cypriots declared a breakaway republic in norther Cyprus in 1983,
which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained about 35,000 troops to protect the
minority Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash pointed out that neither Turkish Cypriots nor Greek
Cypriots have exclusive rights over the independence and
sovereignty of Cyprus and the balance established between Turkey
and Greece has to be respected and preserved.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stressed that "efforts to build a worthwhile future
for both our peoples must therefore be based on the acknowledgment
of the existence and equal status of our respective states."
</P>
<P>
"What needs to be done now is to work out an arrangement which
will enable the two states to resolve certain basic matters,
specifically the final settlement of reciprocal property claims,
security issues and the delineation of borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for both of us to show the necessary
leadership so that the future generations do not bare the bitter
experiences that both you and I have endured," said Denktash in
the letter.
</P>
<P>
He added "our primary aim must be the immediate achievement of
a working relationship between our two states so that peace,
stability and mutual trust can be secured and the danger of a new
conflict is averted."

BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today called on the United Nations Security Council to hold an
urgent meeting to seek measures to stem further escalation of
violent conflicts in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in Kosovo as "highly explosive",
Kinkel also urged the UN to extend its military presence in the
Republic of Macedonia which borders Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
must also employ all available instruments of preventive
diplomacy, including sending its special envoy Felipe Gonzales of
Spain again to Kosovo and an expansion of the OSCE peace mission
in Albania and the Republic of Mazedonia.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also called for an immediate
meeting of foreign ministers of the region with the international
contact group consisting of the United States, Russia, France,
Britain, Germany and Italy in a bid to seek coordinated actions in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Germany had a special interest to seek a solution to the Kosovo
crisis because of the presence of about 140,000 Kosovo-Albanian
refugees in Germany, Kinkel stressed.
</P>
<P>
"what is extremely necessary now is the beginning of a dialogue
between Belgrade and the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo about
the future of the Serbian province," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated his warning on Thursday that "Belgrade's
return ticket to Europe is dependent on its attitude on the Kosovo
issue".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Kinkel also warned militant Kosovo-Albanians to stop
terrorist activities, stressing that terrorism, provocation and
violence would not serve their cause and would not be tolerated by
the international community.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The value of building permits
declined in January in Canada, due in part to the ice storm in
central and eastern parts of the country, Statistics Canada
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Overall, municipalities issued 2.6 billion dollars (1.8 billion
USD) building permits, down 9.9 percent from December, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Of these, non-residential construction intentions declined 19.5
percent to 1.1 billion dollars, while home building intentions
fell 1.3 percent to 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Municipal services, including those for building permits, were
severely curtailed because of the ice storm that knocked out power
supplies to Montreal, eastern Ontario and part of the Maritimes.
</P>
<P>
The value of permits were down 21.0 percent in Quebec, and 6.0
percent in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the total value of building permits issued across the
country was still 8.7 percent higher than the same month in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Registers Robust Job growth in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States registered a
robust job growth in February, bringing down the nation's
unemployment rate to a 24-year low of 4.6 percent, the Labor
Department said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate declined from 4.7
percent in January and December and matched November's 4.6 percent
rate, which was the lowest since October 1973, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a drop in mortgage rates, to a four-year low of just
under 7 percent, there has been increased demand for new homes.
Employers created a greater-than-expected 310,000 jobs, on top of
375,000 in January. That included 41,000 new construction jobs and
17,000 jobs in the finance industry.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the severe rain and ice storms in some parts of the
country have stimulated hiring for cleanup and rebuilding, and
this winter's weather has been generally mild in many parts of the
country to allow the continuation of construction activity that
ordinarily would have been curtailed, as an analyst put it.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of strong growth included temporary help firms,
52,000 jobs; computer and data processing, 20,000; health
services, 25,000; government, 36,000, and transportation, 34,000,
mostly at airlines and trucking firms.
</P>
<P>
Retailing added a relatively mild 15,000 jobs and payrolls
declined by 2,000 jobs in both mining and manufacturing. It was
the first drop in manufacturing in five months and may reflect
reduced import demand for Asian countries suffering from financial
instability.
</P>
<P>
It was noticed that the Asian crisis seems to have helped the
U.S. job market by pushing interest rates down. The percentage of
adults with jobs, 64.2 percent, which was at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly wages increased a robust 0.6 percent to 12.60
U.S. dollars, which is up 4.1 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
By demographic group, the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent for
adult men, 4.3 percent for adult women, 14.7 percent for
teen-agers, 3.9 percent for whites, 9.7 percent for Hispanics and
6.8 percent for Hispanics.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's unemployment rate fell to
the rate of 9.6 percent in February, marking a seven year low in
adjusted terms, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistics Office announced earlier Friday that the
number of people claiming unemployment benefit in Republic of
Ireland had dropped to a seasonally adjusted 238,000 in February,
a seven year low.
</P>
<P>
That implied a standardised unemployment rate of 9.6 percent
for Ireland, down from 9.7 percent in January and below the 10.2
percent average in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the encouraging jobless figure, Irish Deputy
Prime Minister Mary Harney said: "Ireland's unemployment rate is
below that of the economic powerhouse of the EU, Germany. That is
certainly something that should be posted on the worldwide web
today."
</P>
<P>
Harney stressed that the latest figure underpinned her belief
that unemployment in Ireland could realistically be halved over
the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls on Zimbabwean People to Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday urged the people to unite and to guard against being used
by white racists, the Zimbabwean News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an rally in Hurungwe of northwest Zimbabwe, Mugabe
said: "Some members of parliament elected on a party ticket are
now saying the ruling party has overstayed in the government and
that Mugabe should step down as president."
</P>
<P>
"Look out for those people who speak ill of the party because
they are being used by white racists," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is in-house and factional fighting in the ruling
ZANU (PF) because people are being used by disgruntled white
farmers whose land is designated and business people opposed to
ZANU (PF) rule.
</P>
<P>
Land, he said, should be given to the people and those against
this are fighting the party, adding that all land taken from the
whites should be redistributed leaving them with just enough.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also took a swipe at the foreign press, newspapers and
radio stations which now portray him as anti-white for
designating land and redistributing it to the black majority.
</P>
<P>
Those given land should ensure that agriculture continues to
flourish to confound critics such as the Commercial Farmers Union
which seems to think blacks cannot grow maize, soyabeans and
cotton on a commercial basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to ensure success of the blacks, there is need
for support in the form of fertilizers, seed and tractors, but
not knowledge because blacks had already shown to have it.

<HEADLINE> Cardiovascular Drugs Linked to Suicide Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Some drugs used to treat heart
problems may increase the risk of depression and suicide,
researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Sweden have found a significant correlation between
the use of calcium channel blockers, a relatively new class of
drug prescribed for angina and high blood pressure, and the
incidence of suicide.
</P>
<P>
The research team, led by Dr Anne Melander at Malmo University
Hospital in Sweden, surveyed 152 Swedish municipalities with a
total population of 7.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
In a separate part of the study, the researchers found a
five-fold increase in suicides among those taking calcium channel
blockers compared with users of other anti-hypertensives.
</P>
<P>
"Calcium channel blockers should be considered a possible cause
of depression and suicide." they concluded in the British Medical
Journal.
</P>
<P>
The authors suggested that the drugs may interfere with
neurones and other mechanisms which affect moods and emotions.
They called for further investigations into the effects of calcium
channel blockers.

<HEADLINE> Malawian Kwacha's Devaluation Troubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malawian Kwacha's devaluation of
about 60 percent due to the scarcity of foreign exchange in the
country's currency market continues to trouble local businessmen
Thursday, Zambia News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of foreign exchange in the past weeks has pushed
down the Kwacha from 15 to 24.26 against the U.S. Dollar,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a businessman as saying that "to get travellers'
cheque has even become difficult and three weeks now I have been
waiting to go to South Africa but my bank says it has no foreign
currency."
</P>
<P>
The scarcity has been brought about by the central
government's over-expenditure. The result, eonomists say, is that
the measure put some brake on the country's in-flows of the much
needed foreign aid sued in balance of payments support.
</P>
<P>
A team from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Malawi
last week for discussions with Malawian officials on the current
economic situation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The team, which once went to Malawi last November, is to
review government's measures to redress the weak areas of its
economic management.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Last Tin Mine Ceases Work in England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Europe's last tin mine, South
Crofty pit in the county of Cornwall in western England, closed
Friday, ending 4,000 years of production in the area, according to
a BBC television report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper tin production in Latin America's Bolivia and Brazil
has been blamed for the closure of the mine.
</P>
<P>
This means the loss of 200 jobs and marks the end of a long
mining tradition in southwest England.
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of a way of life. There's not a lot of prospects
for us around here," said mine captain Paul Bray.
</P>
<P>
However, union officials insist that the mine is still a viable
business.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mine's days have been numbered since
the UK government turned down a request from its owners for a 5.9
million pounds (9.6 million US dollars) subsidy to see it through
a period of low tin prices.
</P>
<P>
The heyday of South Crofty pit, a small mine which produced
2,100 tons of tin in 1996, came during the industrial revolution
of the 19th century, and in the 1850s and 1860s there were some 50
pits in Cornwall, and the county produced most of the world's
copper and tin.

<HEADLINE> Southern African MPs Urged to Promote Gender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Parliament
Speaker Edna Madzongwe Friday urged legislators from the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to promote gender equality
and security for women and children.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to women parliamentarians from African and European
countries attending a four-day conference on gender equality and
personal security here, Madzongwe noted that parliament is the
central nstitution to promote women's participation in
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
She said that while some countries in southern Africa had
adopted specific legislation dealing with gender-based violence,
others were still lagging behind.
</P>
<P>
She urged the conference hopes to come up with a SADC draft
declaration on the prevention of violence against women and
children.
</P>
<P>
Director of United Nations Information Center Ceciwa Khonje
said in her paper there were alarming statistics of gender-based
violence.
</P>
<P>
"More women are injured in accidents of domestic violence than
in car accidents, rapes and mugging put together," said Khonje.
</P>
<P>
She said that surveys showed that in the United States, a
woman was being beaten every 18 minutes and raped every six
minutes, while in an unspecified African country a woman was
being raped every minute.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is sponsored by the Association of West European
Parliamentarians for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The organization was formed in 1984 to mobilize European
members of parliament to fight against apartheid in South Africa.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army has killed about
120 armed bandits in central Gitarama Prefecture, state-run Radio
Rwanda announced Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commander of the Gitarama Brigade, Karenzi Karake, had
confirmed the information.
</P>
<P>
According to Karake, the Rwandan army lost eight soldiers,
including one officer, while 12 others sustained injuries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied media reports saying that the above
officer was brutally killed by the insurgents who decapitated
him.
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday last week, the Rwandan army is pitted against
armed insurgents who attacked three communes north of Gitarama
town from their harbor in northwestern Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The three communes where security was disturbed are
Nyakabanda, Bulinga and Rutobwe, north of Gitarama town.
</P>
<P>
Mopping-up operations to dislodge the enemy from some hills of
the Ndiza region were continuing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, military sources in Gitarama indicated that it will
not take long to have the militiamencompletely rooted out of
that region.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Saturday's attack was triggered by the intense
military and logistical pressure the Hutu insurgents are faced
with in northwestern Rwanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- European stock exchanges were
urged Friday to cooperate among them to face tougher and more
complex competitive conditions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of a European Stock Exchanges Forum
here, Cypriot Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou
stressed the need for cooperation among national stock exchanges,
given the globalization of the securities market, which leads to
tougher and more complex competitive conditions.
</P>
<P>
The one-day forum, held by the Federation of European Stock
Exchanges and participated by some 30 bourses in European
countries, mainly deals with the issue of emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou also said the meeting is indicative of Cyprus'
interest in building up close relations and cooperation among the
stock exchange authorities of European countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that given the openness of the people of Cyprus and the
island's forthcoming accession to the European Union, it is not
surprising that the two-year-old Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) has
already begun to develop its relationship with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent measures announced by the Cypriot
government to boost the stock market in Cyprus, Christodoulou
said that the long-term development of any securities market must
be based on sound legislative and operational fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
In view of this reality, he added, the Cypriot government has
given emphasis to the establishment of appropriate legal and
operational framework that will ensure investors' confidence and
market transparency.
</P>
<P>
CSE Chairman Dinos Papadopoulos also stressed at the meeting
that one of the CSE objectives is to play an important role in
the strategy to further develop Cyprus as a regional business
center.

to the bill, piloted by Labor MP Mike Foster, had been completed
by the close of the session.
</P>
<P>
The MPs campaigning to ban fox-hunting accused their opponents
of using disgraceful delaying tactics to stop their bill becoming
law.
</P>
<P>
The bill to ban fox hunting is bitterly opposed in the
countryside, and about 250,000 rural people marched through London
last week to protest against what they see as a growing threat to
their way of life.
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed sympathy for
the goal of the bill, he is reluctant to antagonise an
increasingly vocal countryside lobby.
</P>
<P>
Animal rights activists presented a one million signature
petition in favour of the bill, which would outlaw hunting with
hounds, to Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Its advocates had hoped the government would either provide
more debating time or allow an amendment to outlaw hunting to be
added to a Criminal Justice Bill it is to present to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bill is to be discussed for a further five hours next
Friday, but it is almost certain then to be abandoned because no
further time is available for debate.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Imports Fertilizer for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government has
imported 368,000 tons of fertilizer for 1998 production year, the
National Fertilizer Industry Agency of Ethiopia has announced.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here Friday, General Manager of the agency
Zeleke Desalegne said that fertilizer whole-sale price
deregulation issued recently by the government facilitates the
sale of fertilizer to the peasant at a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government decided to lift the regulation on
fertilizer price aiming mainly at enhancing free fertilizer trade
actively across the nation, saying that the newly introduced
system creates a fertile ground for fertilizer suppliers to carry
out their activity freely and effectively in all parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, the consumption of
fertilizer in Ethiopia has increased significantly over the past
few years following the expansion of the extension program and
the rising awareness of the peasant about the advantages of
applying the item.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said, the Ethiopian government has also
devised mechanisms to closely inspect the proper distribution of
quality fertilizer to the peasant this year.

<HEADLINE> 3 Pro-Israeli Soldiers, Boy Wounded in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli-backed South Lebanese
Army (SLA) soldiers and an innocent boy were wounded in
guerrillas' clashes with Israeli troops and SLA in south Lebanon
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local Orient Radio said that an SLA member was wounded when
guerrillas detonated a bomb near the SLA post at the village of
Hadais in the western sector of the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place at 1:00 pm local time (1100GMT) when
the SLA members were changing shifts, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said they saw several missiles
landing near the village in suspected Israeli retaliation for
guerrilla's attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the morning at the village of Mashgala in the western
sector of the zone, a boy was wounded under the Israeli
fire. Several cars of civilians were also damaged.
</P>
<P>
In another development, two SLA members were wounded during
five offensives launched by guerrillas in the SLA-controlled
Jezzine, just north of the occupied zone, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer area in south
Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer zone with the aim of preventing
guerrillas' cross-border attack from its north, the tit-for-tat
clashes between them have occurred almost everyday.

HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday reiterated his country's commitment to international
peace-keeping assignments within the framework of the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Addressing about 500 Zimbabwean soldiers just-returned from
peacekeeping duties in Angola, Mugabe said as a member of the U.N.
and the OAU, Zimbabwe would assist, wherever possible, to solve
the pervasive problems of conflict.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when welcoming the troops at Magunje, 200
km northwest of Harare, according to the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president also prayed for durable peace in
Angola, the war-ravaged southern African country, which is
teetering on the brink of renewed war again as U.N. peace keepers
pull out at the end of their mandate.
</P>
<P>
"With the U.N. mandate in Angola having effectively ended on
January 21, 1998, it is our sincere hope that peace will prevail
permanently and thus no loss of innocent lives and destruction of
property will any longer be experienced in that country," said
he.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is chairman of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Angola,
said this at a time the peace process wound up but with clouds of
war still hovering in the Angolan skies.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian president Benjamin
Mkapa stressed Friday that sound infrastructure in the east
African region is important to attract foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
In talks with three ministers from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
in the State House here, Mkapa said that setting up monumental
projects in the infrastructure field would have positive impact
on both donor and recipient countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector has to be serviced by a good
infrastructure because if there is none, the sector would be
discouraged to invest in developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers briefed the Tanzanian president on their recent
tour of some developed countries, saying they have got
preliminary pledges to assist the inter-regional road work
construction and that a donors' conference was expected in June
in Tanzania's northern city of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The ministers met president Yoweri Museveni of Uganda before
their visit to Tanzania and they will pay a courtesy call to
Kenya's president Daniel Moi in a similar mission.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Women organizations in
Ethiopia have called for respect for women's rights and equality
between women and men to mark this year's International Women's
Day which falls on March 8 or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Friday, women's affairs standing
committee of the House of People's Representatives of Ethiopia
said the delay in issuing laws pertaining to women's rights has
impeded benefits which members of the fair sex could have savored
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, efforts underway to realize the
enactment of the laws would come true only with active
involvement of women organized under their associations.
</P>
<P>
The women's affairs sector in the Ethiopian prime minister's
office said in a statement Friday that women should mark the day
vowing to look for a sustainable solution to their common
problems through the instrumentality of their associations at all
levels leading to the formation of an umbrella organization.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on women to intensify their struggle to
set up their organization, saying the Women's Day will be
observed with great significance attached to the advantages of
association.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association Friday
organized a meeting here to mark the International Women's Day.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Shen: Sanctions against Libya Should be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The sanctions against Libya
should be lifted as soon as possible, Chinese Deputy Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofeng stressed on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shen made the remarks after the United Nations
Security Council finished its informal consultations on the issue
of Libya in which no agreement was reached on lifting the
sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
"Today the Security Council came back once again to review
sanctions on Libya. Regrettably, no consensus was reached. We
hope all parties concerned could show some flexibility and the
Council can take a step forward in this issue," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"China does not favor any kind of sanction against any country
including sanctions on Libya. So we support the request by the
Arab League and the Organization of African Unity for an early
lifting of the sanctions," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that such sanctions instead of doing any
good to the settlement of the issue have the potential of further
intensifying the conflict. Sanctions have not only brought
sufferings to its people, but also undermine the economic and
social development of the country. These sanctions have had
harmful impact on third countries too," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The key to solve the Lockerbie case is for parties concerned
to reach an agreement as soon as possible on where and how the
trial of the two suspects should be held. We are of the view that
the three options put forward by the Arab League and the
Organization of African Unity are constructive and should be
supported. We are also in favor of an open debate on the Libya
issue as soon as possible," Shen added.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under sanctions since 1992 for failing to hand
over two suspects in the 1988 mid-air bombing of a Pan American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Readjusted in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Prices of liquid fuel in
Mozambique is readjusted Friday, with lighting oil and Jet A1
prices reduced to a large extent while prices for gas and fuel
oil up a bit.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued here Friday by the Ministry
of Mineral Resources and Energy, lighting oil is now sold at
2,250 Meticais (about 19 U.S. cents) per liter, 29 percent lower,
while Jet A1 is reduced by 25.8 percent at 2,688 Meticais (23
U.S. cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The prices for petroleum and diesel oil are down by three
percent and 8.3 percent respectively, at 56 cents and 41 cents
approximately per liter.
</P>
<P>
Gas and fuel oil are up by 1.7 percent and 4.3 percent
respectively, at about 57 cents and 21 cents per liter.
</P>
<P>
The prices are the highest allowed for the capital Maputo,
Matola city, Beira in central Mozambique and Nacala in the north,
said the release.
</P>
<P>
Taking transport into account, prices in other regions could
be increased accordingly, it added.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is not an oil-producing country. Its liquid fuel
prices are adjusted with the imported oil prices and the U.S.
Dollar exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The latest fuel price change is in January. Since then,
prices for imported oil had been down by about eight to 20
percent, while the Dollar had been appreciated by about 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The retail fuel prices in Mozambique is quite high, which has
caused some people to drive to the neighboring country for
refilling.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reaffirms Endeavor to Implement Deal With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf reaffirmed that Iraq will endeavor to implement
the accord signed with U.N. Chief Kofi Annan so that the
international embargo may be lifted as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency Friday,
al-Sahhaf said that the efficient and objective implementation of
the accord, signed here on February 23 on peacefully ending
Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspection, would create an effective
atmosphere to accelerate the lifting of the embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he asserted the necessity of a balanced approach by
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction to avoid any biased practices.
</P>
<P>
A balanced approach would also afford the U.N. Security Council
and the international community the opportunity to discover that
whatever Iraq has said is the right thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that UNSCOM would accelerate the steps to
enable the Security Council to debate the lifting of the
U.N. sanctions as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. They can only be lifted after the UNSCOM verifies that
Iraq has destroyed all the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. arms inspection teams, including a large group
led by Scott Ritter, a controversial U.S. arms inspector, made
surprise visits to 12 suspected sites Friday, including three
sites not under their regular monitoring, said a spokesman for
Iraqi National Monitoring Department.
</P>
<P>
The arms inspectors received full cooperation from the Iraqi
side and no problem was reported.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, called by Iraq as a "trouble maker," returned to
Baghdad on Thursday with some 50 inspectors.
</P>
<P>
He was prevented from carrying out arms inspection in
mid-January on grounds that the composition of his 16-member team,
including nine Americans and five Britons, was imbalanced.
</P>
<P>
Ritter told reporters that the sites he inspected Friday did
not include the presidential sites, which will be carried out
under special arrangements by Annan.

<HEADLINE> S. African Security Guards End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A two-week strike by
security guards finally came to an end on Friday evening when the
unions and employers signed an agreement in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Security Employers' Association
(SANSEA) and unions in the sector agreed on a 14 percent wage and
benefits package -- 10 percent in wage increases, three percent
in provident fund contributions and one percent as an annual
bonus.
</P>
<P>
The settlement was a victory for both parties and it was
unfortunate that there were injuries to non-striking workers and
damage to property, SANSEA chief negotiator Don Masterson said.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement which has been reached is a compromise
settlement but it does take us a step closer to the type of
conditions we would like to see in the industry," unions'
representative Randall Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He said the strike helped workers achieve an important social
benefit, a provident fund.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 security workers began a nationwide strike on
February 23, demanding a 12 percent across-the-board salary
increase, a six percent company provident fund contribution, a
100 percent annual bonus, and double pay on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
The unions by Friday afternoon reduced their demand to 14
percent, including salary and provident fund.
</P>
<P>
The employers offered a package of 13.5 percent -- 10 percent
on wages, three percent on provident fund contributions and half
a percent as the annual bonus.
</P>
<P>
The parties negotiated amid applications to the Labor Court by
employers for the strike to be declared illegal and unprotected.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Appeal Court in Johannesburg on Thursday upheld last
week's Labor Court judgement that the strike by security guards
was legal and protected. The appeal by SANSEA against the
judgement was dismissed with costs.

UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Jayantha Dhanapala, head of
U.N. Special Group for inspections of Presidential Sites in Iraq,
will travel to Baghdad Monday to prepare for the Group's
inspection activities there, it was announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The detailed inspection procedures have been finalized and
they will be presented to the U.N. Security Council Monday,
spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Group was set up under the agreement reached between Annan
and Iraq on February 23 during Annan's trip to Baghdad to solve
the crisis over U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said an inspection team led by
American Scott Ritter resumed inspections in Iraq Friday. They
viewed three sites which were all declared sensitive by Iraq, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, there was full cooperation on the Iraqi side and
inspectors were able to inspect all of the sites to their full
satisfaction," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, previously branded a U.S. spy by Iraq, returned to
Baghdad Thursday and is expected to stay into the middle of next
week. His team is on the continuation of the work interrupted in
January.
</P>
<P>
Denying a press report that Executive Chairman of U.N. Special
Commission on arms inspections in Iraq (UNSCOM) Richard Buttler
did not inform Annan of Ritter's dispatch, Eckhard said Annan was
well aware of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Annan will meet Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahaf on the subject of oil for food program here Monday.

<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Air Forces will
participate in the NATO manoeuvres in Portugal from March 9 to 21
with 16 F-16 fighters and 41 personnel, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, codenamed "Strong Resolve '98", is bound to be
held in the Monte Real air base in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Troops from Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Britain,
Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and the United States will also
participate in the manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
Military officials from these countries will exchange
information during the exercises.
</P>
<P>
Greece has announced that it will not allow Turkish military
jets to fly to Portugal over its air space, Turkish military
sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the NATO and historical
rivals, have always refrained from meeting each other in NATO
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries have been at odds over the
limits of air space, sea-bed mineral resources, sovereignty over
islets in the Aegean as well as the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Tensions in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz expressed grave concern on Friday over the clashes between
Serbian police and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A written statement released by the Prime Minister's Office
said that Yilmaz held a telephone talk with President of Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milosevic on the tensions.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told Milosevic that Turkey is closely monitoring
developments in Kosovo, adding that Ankara is worried that the
escalating tension might disturb all the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey is in favor of a solution to the
clashes which could maintain the territorial integrity of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will go to Belgrade this
weekend to deliver Milosevic a message from Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel concerning the Kosovo situation, Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo escalated on March 1 after an armed conflict
which led to the deaths of four policemen and 16 Albanians. Ethnic
Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population in Kosovo,
have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Fearing the Kosovo unrest could further disstablize the Balkan
region, some countries, including the United States, the European
Union countries and Russia, have urged the Milosevic government to
deal with it in a cautious and proper way.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has close ties with Albania and ethnic Albanians
in the Balkans, has called on both parties involved in the
conflicts to solve their disputes through dialog.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Entrepreneurs Welcome Institutional Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Managers of China's state-owned
enterprises, who have long suffered from government bureaucracy,
seem to be the most enthusiastic supporters of an institutional
restructuring plan proposed by the State Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was submitted on Friday to the ongoing First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
lawmaking body, for examination, has become one of the most
popular topics in group discussions of the legislators.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers representing the country's business community agreed
that the existing structure of government institutions is an
outcome of central planning, and has hampered the development of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly support this reform plan, which I think is quite
appropriate," said Liu Hanzhang, a deputy from north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is president of the Handan Steel Corporation, a
successful state enterprise that has been made a model of reform,
said that since a lot of government departments with redundant
functions have the right to directly interfere with enterprise
management, the enterprises have been prevented from seeking
development according to market demand.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, great powers possessed by these departments
also gave rise to the practice of trading power for money,
breeding corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious problem of the current government structure
is its restraints on economic reforms," he said. "It's inevitable
to step up political restructuring when economic restructuring has
developed to a certain stage."
</P>
<P>
According to the State Council reform plan, China will cut its
central government departments from 40 to 29, and abolish 15
departments directly managing specific industrial sectors, such as
ministries of machine-building industry and coal industry.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this round of institutional restructuring will
start in local governments as soon as possible, and set free a
large number of state-owned enterprises," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Shi Jun, a deputy from east China's Shandong Province, said
that under a market economic system, enterprises have an
increasingly larger host of investors, a big difference from the
period of a planning economy, when the bulk of investment for
enterprises came from the government.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, it's no longer appropriate for the
government to retain the power of examining and approving every
new move in enterprise management," he said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive intervention in microeconomic development will also
diminish the macro-control capabilities of government departments,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cai Dongcheng, another deputy from Hebei who is the boss of a
pharmaceutical corporation, said that the most direct beneficiary
of institutional restructuring would be the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
He called for early legislation on institutional restructuring
to ensure a successful government reform.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Cross-Strait Shipping, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- There has been a breakthrough in
the issue on direct shipping across the Taiwan Strait as normal
channels have been established, but there remains a gap from the
direct links of trade, air, shipping and mail service.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, minister of communications, gave these remarks
today at a panel discussion of Taiwan deputies at the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which
opened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told the Taiwan deputies that four seminars have been
sponsored between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan on direct
shipping service, which resulted in the agreement of the mainland
and Taiwan businessmen in some issues. Non-governmental
organizations across the straits have been set up to promote such
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ships are seen sailing to and from major ports in the mainland
and Taiwan, Huang said. More than 1,100 voyages by 10 mainland and
Taiwan companies had been made across the Taiwan Straits,
transporting a total of 145,000 TEUs by the end of January this
year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from one mainland shipping firm, Huang said all the other
shipping companies have made profits from the cross-strait direct
shipping.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that such shipping links are only in the
initial stage because of the "no customs connection and no entry"
policy of the Taiwan authorities. However, he added, "It is a
breakthrough compared with no connection in the more than 40
decades."
</P>
<P>
Huang went on to note that improvements have been made in
shipping environment and conditions as Taiwan has put into use the
light buoy and lighthouse installations, which has provided safety
guarantees for cross-strait shipping.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities, which used to impose strict limits upon
mainland-funded shipping companies, have allowed that solely
mainland funded shipping companies to dock at Taiwan seaports,
the minister said.

<HEADLINE> NPC and CPPCC Sessions Continue Discussing Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Over the past several days,
participants in the first sessions of China's supreme organ of
state power and leading advisory body have been discussing a
government work report and three other reports.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC) and members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) heard and
discussed the reports.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan,
Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing have joined some NPC and
CPPCC groups in discussions on reform of state-owned enterprises,
reemployment of laid-off workers, strengthening the fundamental
role of agriculture, revitalizing the country with science and
technology, sustainable economic development and institutional
restructuring of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Most NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members regard
the government work report as "pragmatic" and "inspiring", saying
achievements made over the last five years, as summed up by the
report, have laid a good foundation for the country's
trans-century development.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, problems mentioned in the report demonstrate
that the Chinese leadership has remained sober-minded.
</P>
<P>
On March 6, the NPC deputies and CPPCC members heard reports on
national social and economic development, the country's finances,
and institutional restructuring of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the deputies and members hold the view that the
intensity of institutional restructuring this time surpasses all
previous programs.
</P>
<P>
They said institutional restructuring is the pressing need of
economic restructuring and is conducive to economic and social
development. They expressed the hope that reform measures can be
carried out as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In the coming two days, the participants will continue to
discuss these reports.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Calls for Laid-off Workers to Be More Cared for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior women official today
called for the whole society to show solicitude for laid-off
female workers on the eve of the International Women's Day, which
falls on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairperson of the All-China Federation of Women,
said that female workers used to be in a disadvantageous position
in finding jobs as compared with men. The government and all
social sectors should offer them assistance in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Though women in China have long ago acquired an equal status
with men, there are still more illiterate women than men. And
poor educational background makes it more difficult for the women
laid0ffs to get new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many work units are reluctant to recruit female graduates or
laid-offs, she said, adding that women should on no account be
discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she urged the Chinese women to give full play to
their advantages in employment and asked women's federations at
all levels to come to their aid.

<HEADLINE> Gulf FMs to Discuss Iraq, Iran Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) started a meeting of foreign ministers Saturday in Saudi
capital Riyadh to discuss the situations in Iraq, ties with Iran
and the Middle East peace process, the Kuwaiti News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah described a recent agreement signed
by the United Nations and Iraq as a crucial step to accomplish
arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan reached the agreement with
Iraq on February 23, under which Iraq will grant free access to
presidential sites to a special inspection team comprising
U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq and senior diplomats appointed by
Annan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's refusal to allow the U.N. arms inspectors search for
weapons of mass destruction in presidential sites has prompted the
United States and Britain to unleash military threat to force its
compliance with the U.N. Special Commission charged with
eliminating the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sabah urged Iraq to comply with the agreement, and expressed
the conviction that its implementation would be guaranteed, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq must adhere to the implementation of all U.N. Security
Council resolutions concerning the liberation of Kuwait ...," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 but was driven out during 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh-based Gulf Cooperation Council, a political,
economic and defense alliance, consists of six Arab countries of
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar,
Bahrain and Oman.
</P>
<P>
On Iran, the ministers will manifest optimism on prospects of
improving ties with Tehran in the light of an ice-breaking visit
to the council members by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
last year, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the Gulf Arab states and Iran, which were strained
following Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, started warming up after
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami assumed power last
August.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has said that improving relations with Gulf Arab
countries is one of Iran's top priorities. This has been welcomed
by the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
But the ministers are expected to reaffirm the council's
steadfast position on three disputed Islands of Abu Mussa, Greater
and Lesser Tunbs in the Gulf, which are currently controlled by
Iran, but also claimed by the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arabs support UAE's proposal to settle the issue
through arbitration by the International Court of Justice of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also discuss the Middle East peace process,
according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab countries insist that Israel must stop hampering
the process and abide by the land-for-peace principle.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Defends Handling of Russian-Speakers' Rally in Riga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Latvia defended Saturday the
dispersing of a rally of Russian-speaking protesters in front of
City Duma in Riga by Latvian police on March 3 as "a legal and
self-defense act."
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ziedonis Cevers told an extraordinary meeting
of the cabinet that the police acted "within the bounds of the
law," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The police used batons only for the purpose of self-defense,
Cevers said, adding that they "have the legitimate right to use
this special means for self-defense in such situations."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Latvian police pushed and dispersed a group of
mostly elderly Russian-speakers protesting against the high cost
of living.
</P>
<P>
Latvian Prime Minister Guntars Krasts has said the incident
might have been instigated by some forces interested in breaking
down Latvian-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Krasts also alleged that Moscow might be involved in the
protest by a group of elderly Russian-speakers in the Latvian
capital of Riga.
</P>
<P>
The allegation caused strong repercussions from Moscow. On
Friday, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin sternly
denounced the allegation.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Russian presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky warned that Moscow could limit trade with Latvia
over the recent violation of the rights of Russian-speakers in the
Baltic country.
</P>
<P>
A team responsible for Russia's foreign policy has recommended
that President Boris Yeltsin take steps to limit economic
relations with Latvia, the spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Latvia, whose economy relies considerably on Russian energy
supplies and resale of Russian exports, should be "more loyal with
regard to Russia's interests," Yastrzhembsky said.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nicolas Burtin of France won his
first ever World Cup downhill on Saturday and Hermann Maier became
the first Austrian man since 1970 to take the overall title in a
men's World Cup race in Kvitfjell of Norway.
</P>
<P>
Burtin, cameout strongly from three knee injuries between
December 1994 and January '97, flashed down Kvitfjell's Olympic
course in a winning time of one minute, 44.07 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Schifferer of Austria, the World Cup downhill champion
this season, skied out on the upper part of the 3,035-meter course
designed by former Swiss downhill great Bernhard Russi. That
mishap enabled compatriot Hermann Maier to clinch his first
overall title while sitting at home in Austria.
</P>
<P>
The last Austrian man's overall champion was Karl Schranz, who
won his second in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Maier, a two-time Olympic champion in Nagano last month didn't
compete in Kvitfjell because of a back injury. He was injured
during a World Cup race in South Korea after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
With only five races left and a maximum of 500 points at stake,
Maier leads Schifferer 1,625 points to 1,034.

<HEADLINE> China To Increase Capital Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top banker announced here
today that China will increase fixed assest investment by 270
billion yuan (32.5 billion US dollars) in 1998, a rise of more
than 10 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the Peoplel's Bank of China, said
the plan is launched to guarantee the attainment of the government
growth target of eight percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
"While we don't abandon the appropriately tight monetary
policy, we should increase money supply properly, the investment
in fixed assets in particular, so as to guarantee that the
economic targets are met," said Dai at a press conference hosted
by the on-going NPC session here today.
</P>
<P>
In face of the recent Southeast Asia financial turmoil, there
is all the more impressing need for China to develop the internal
market and expanding domestic demand as well, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China has a high saving rate, with the national deposit pool
expanding by some 800 billion yuan (96.4 billion US dollars)
annually. "Therefore conditions are available for increasing
investment," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the central bank has removed lending
quotas imposed on the state banks, which are allowed to make loan
decisions on their own but have to be held responsible for their
profitability.
</P>
<P>
As banks are granted more autonomy, the actual investment is
very likely to exceed the planned figure, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
According to the top banker, investment priority will be given
to leading infrastructure projects, such as railway, highway,
municipal works, environment improvement and private housing
projects.
</P>
<P>
"Financing of the projects under construction and Sino-foreign
joint venture projects already approved will be accelerated and
new projects that have passed feasibility studies will also get
funding support," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Residential housing is another area to get the full bank
support. Dai revealed that the loan for private housing
construction will reach between 100 billion yuan (12 billion US
dollars) and 150 billion yuan (18 US dollars), doubling that of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the focus will be shifted from private housing
development to expanding the scope of mortgage loans, so as to
enable more people to afford their own houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will prohibit to divert the funding for building luxury
hotels, high-grade office buildings and villas so as to prevent a
possible resurgence of a new round of bubble economy," Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
To further increase the strength and lending capacity of the
state banks, the Ministry of Finance is going to issue special
treasury bonds, and the central bank has also projected to cut the
compulsory minimum reserve ratio from current 13 percent to 8
percent, the central bank governor said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- On the question of China's
reunification, "We place our hope not just on the Taiwan
authorities but more on the Taiwan people," Chinese Vice-Premier
Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark in a group discussion attended by deputies
of Taiwan origin to the National People's Congress, in session
here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Qian reviewed three major events in cross-Strait relations over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
First, President Jiang Zemin made an eight-point proposal in a
speech he delivered around the Spring Festival of 1995. Giving a
concrete expression to the principles of "peaceful reunification"
and "one country, two systems," the proposal has won universal
support from people at home and abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, the return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the
motherland, which has set a vivid example of how the "one country,
two systems" policy has been implemented.
</P>
<P>
Third, the tension triggered by the visit of Lee Teng-hui to
the United States, which has since eased.
</P>
<P>
The three events show that the principles of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems" are the best option
for resolving the Taiwan question, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those attempting to create "Taiwan independence," "Two Chinas"
or "One China, one Taiwan" will get nowhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing cross-Strait exchanges, Qian said, trade between the
two sides exceeded 20 billion U.S. dollars in 1997. Cross-Strait
visits totaled one million in number.
</P>
<P>
People in Taiwan are in favor of direct links of postal, air
and shipping services and trade between the two sides. It is the
Taiwan authority who have set up road blocks, he said. And that is
why greater hope is placed on the Taiwan people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Conditions Not Mature To Make RMB Fully Convertible: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- There will be no change in China's
resolve to make its currency fully convertible, but the country
will take a more prudent, cautious approach in handling the
progress, according to Chinese central bank governor.
</P>
<P>
"The direction will remain unchanged. But the financial crisis
in Southeast Asia reminds us of handling the process with
meticulous care and in a down-to-the-earth-manner," said governor
Dai Xianglong at a press conference organized by the on-going NPC
session here today.
</P>
<P>
China made the decision in 1993 to gradually realize the full
convertibility of RMB yuan, though without setting a timetable, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
The country has already made yuan convertible under the current
account. However, said Dai, "conditions are not yet ripe to realize
full convertibility under capital account."
</P>
<P>
"A premature announcement of yuan's full convertibility will
be determental not only to the interests of the country, but to
that of the investors from overseas," the central bank governor
said.

<HEADLINE> BJP Leader Appeals for unity in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Atal Beharl Vajpayee, former
Indian prime minister and leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), tried to allay fears among other sections following his
election as BJP leader in the parliament Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now about to get an opportunity at the center. There
should be no apprehensions about BJP in anyone's mind," Vajpayee
said in his address to the newly elected parliamentarians from his
party .
</P>
<P>
Recalling his resolution expressed during the debate on the
motion of confidence of his short-lived government in 1996 that he
would come back with adequate votes, the prime ministerial
candidate said that the party has now returned with more support.
</P>
<P>
BJP and its allies have secured 257 out of the 535 contested
seats in the first three phases of the four-phase elections to the
Lok Sabha, the Lower House of Parliament, but failed to pass the
crucial figure of 273 seats to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old veteran politician said that the BJP has now
reached each and every corner of the country both geographically
and socially.
</P>
<P>
It is not because the BJP did not have people's support but
might be due to inadequate effort on its own part, he explained,
adding that the party would have to take the support of allies.
</P>
<P>
The BJP and its allies decided on Friday to reduce the areas of
conflict and keep all contentious issues out of a national agenda
to be drafted by a coordination committee set up on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contentious issues include abrogation of Article 370 of the
Constitution, construction of a Ram temple and introduction of a
uniform civil code.
</P>
<P>
During consultations with leaders of the poll-partners over the
past few days, Vajpayee is said to have made it clear that faced
with the challenge of running a government with an uncertain
majority, it would be fatal to pursue any conflict agenda.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining hate was not on BJP agenda, he told the BJP
parliamentary group Saturday, saying that his government would
ensure security, prosperity and happiness of all sections.
</P>
<P>
"We don't consider different religions as obstacles but as
symbols of our cultural richness and that which represented unity
in diversity. We should take them all together," Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all political parties to play a constructive
role in evolving a consensus to tackle major issues facing the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Now that elections were nearly over, it was time to get down to
work and set aside the war of words which all parties had indulged
in during the elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee assured that a BJP government under his leadership
would fulfill the aspirations of the people on the basis of a
national agenda being worked out by the BJP and its allies.
</P>
<P>
In politics, he said, the opposition can not be considered as
an enemy but as one with whom there were differences of view
points.

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Forests in China's Hebei
Province had 2.75 million tourists in 1997, providing 40 million
yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Harnessing Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today emphasized
the importance of taming the Yellow River, China's second longest,
in a group discussion attended by deputies from Henan Province to
the National People's Congress, in session here since last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Yellow River has not caused any major flooding in the last
50 years but, fundamentally speaking, the danger of flooding has
not been uprooted," the premier said. "This calls for great
attention to the taming of the river."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng talked about the importance of the ongoing Xiaolangdi
Project near Luoyang, Henan, for the Yellow River's harnessing.
</P>
<P>
"The project will play a major role in flood prevention and
sand control," the premier said. "Efforts must be made to complete
the project and relocate affected people as scheduled."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the river's harm comes mainly from soil
erosion in the upper reaches of the river. "This calls for efforts
to conserve water and soil there," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged people along the Yellow River to pay attention to work
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Once soil erosion on the Loess Plateau is brought under
control, the amount of silt rushing down the Yellow River will go
down sharply," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng pointed out that the river is not rich in water
compared with the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
With water use on the rise along its length, the Yellow River
often dries up along its lower sections, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He called on provinces and regions along the river to make the
best use of the river's limited water and promote the development
of a water-efficient agriculture.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The reforms of the state-owned
enterprises and government institutions will prompt personnel
structure to be improved and more competent people to be tapped

</P>
<P>
"We should make concerted efforts to tackle the problem so as
to lay a good foundation for future development," he said.
</P>
<P>
On revitalizing the country with science and education, Li said
more efforts should be made to facilitate the shift from the type
of examination-oriented education to the one that stresses the
students' quality development, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Dealing With Water Pollution in Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Anhui Province has
treated polluted water in the Huaihe River basin and Chaohu Lake
area to stop the degradation of the local environment.
</P>
<P>
The provincial governments have spent 830 million yuan (about
100 million US dollars) on treatment projects and general water
quality is at Category-3 levels. All sources of industrial
pollution along the river now meet discharge standards.
</P>
<P>
A water treatment project on Chaohu Lake is using a
140-million-U.S. dollar loan from the Asian Development
Bank. Waste water discharged into the lake will be cut by 35.7
million tons, or more than half, when the project is completed.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, there will be 55 urban sewage treatment
plants built at a cost of 5-6 billion yuan in the Huaihe River
basin.
</P>
<P>
A series of local environmental regulations has been worked out
and law enforcement inspections have been made across the province
to ensure that the 757 polluting enterprises closed down in 1996
do not start up operations again.

<HEADLINE> Forum to Attract More Investment to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A two-day high level inter-
national conference on attracting trade and investment to Africa
is expected to open here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizing committee, "The Addis Forum",
which was sponsored by a group organizations and international
firms, those taking part in the conference include government
representatives and business executives from 16 African
countries, and heads of corporations and business concerns from
15 countries in north America, Europe, the Middle East and South
East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni are among the keynoters during the conference
which organizers say "will be devoted to answering the theme
question of the conference: how to attract investment to Africa."
</P>
<P>
Africa attracts the lowest share of foreign direct investment
(FDI) in the world. According to the 1997 world investment report
published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), FDI rose by 10 percent in 1996 to a record
of 349 billion U.S. Dollars. However, of the 349 billion dollars
in FDI, developing countries received 129 billion U.S. Dollars,
and only 5.3 billion U.S. Dollars flowed to Africa and Africa's
share of FDI thus represent 1.5 percent of global FDI and 4.1
percent of developing world FDI.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top advisory
body expressed confidence in the government's ability to tackle
the unemployment problem and offered ways to combat unemployment
at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
A solution for layoffs is to boost economic development,
especially to develop the service industry that employs big
numbers of workers and expand medium and small-sized enterprises,
said Dong Fureng, a well-known economist, at the press conference
sponsored by the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, in session here since last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A key task at the present stage is to reform the social
security system, build an unemployment insurance system and
accelerate the development of a labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers engaging in self-employed commercial
businesses should be granted preferential treatment in taxation
and, in the meantime, laid-off workers should change their way of
thinking when looking for jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Daneng, an executive vice-president of the China
Vocational Education Society, said his organization has opened
training courses for 150,000 workers and helped 30,000 laid-off
workers find new jobs in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Hu Deping, a member of the China Society for Promoting the
Glory Undertakings Program said entrepreneurs in non-public
sectors have invested 5.16 billion yuan in launching 2,300
projects and training 260,000 people in poverty-stricken areas in
the past four years. They will play an even bigger role in the
reemployment of laid-off workers.
</P>

The Glory Undertakings Program is launched by private
businessmen in China to help the poor.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A nightmare scenario about Indonesia is haunting the Clinton
administration, the IMF and other policy-makers around the
world. Discontent in the island nation over soaring food prices
and joblessness could engender an explosion of violent unrest that
would frighten investors in neighboring economies and cause the
entire Asian financial crisis to deepen anew.
</P>
<P>
-- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott call on independent
counsel Kenneth Starr to quickly wrap up his investigation and
suggested that Congress could consider censuring President Bill
Clinton for his conduct if there is not enough evidence to impeach
him.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to name a
Russian co-deputy chairman of the commission on disarming Iraq.
Scott Ritter, an American weapons expert whom Baghdad barred in
January, has returned to Iraq, and inspectors visited three
sensitive sites without incident.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate Appropriations Committee grudgingly offered its
support for the Clinton administration's request for money to
pay for military missions in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, but
criticized Gulf allies for not helping defray the cost of the
recent buildup in the region.

<P>
CHANGSHA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Construction Bank of China
plans to grant mortgage loans of over 30 billion yuan to help
ordinary Chinese citizens purchase housing.
</P>
<P>
The projected loan volume is slightly less than total loans the
bank has granted to individuals since the 1980s, according to
information released by a bank official during a recent seminar held
in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Housing loans were previously limited to people working for
either state institutions or companies. However, loans for this
year will be granted to anyone with sufficient personal assets and
the capacity to make loan and interest payments, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Bank loans of some 490 million yuan have already provided over
12,000 Hunan families with an opportunity to purchase new
homes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Region Experiencing Good Time for Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region has entered a good period for its rural economy, with the
regional government giving priority to agriculture in its
development plans.
</P>
<P>
The region, in northwestern China, produced 2.5 billion kg of
grain on nearly 800,000 ha in 1997, the same as the previous
year's record high.
</P>
<P>
It also had big increases in the amount of meat, eggs, milk,
vegetables, fruits, and aquatic products. Township and village
enterprises reported nine billion yuan in output value last year,
up 27 percent, and accounting for 70 percent of the region's rural
production. Farmers per-capita income amounted to 1,580 yuan in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of poverty-stricken people in the southern
mountainous area is down from 69 percent to 25 percent of the
total population.
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, Ningxia has increased spending on
agriculture by more than 10 percent and established grain, dairy,
sugar beet, vegetable, beer, fruit, meat, and fur production
centers and 140 enterprises to process these goods.
</P>
<P>
The region has also developed 640 agriculture industrialization
organizations, which did 6.5 billion yuan in business last year
and helped the industrial and service sectors in rural areas make
up nearly 50 percent of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Agronomy also played a role. The southern mountainous area used
plastic sheeting on more than 30,000 ha of corn last year, which
increased grain output by some 20 million kg.

<HEADLINE> China To Increase Capital Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top banker announced here
today that China will increase fixed assest investment by 270
billion yuan (32.5 billion US dollars) in 1998, a rise of more
than 10 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the Peoplel's Bank of China, said
the plan is launched to guarantee the attainment of the government
growth target of eight percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
"While we don't abandon the appropriately tight monetary
policy, we should increase money supply properly, the investment
in fixed assets in particular, so as to guarantee that the
economic targets are met," said Dai at a press conference hosted
by the on-going NPC session here today.
</P>
<P>
In face of the recent Southeast Asia financial turmoil, there
is all the more impressing need for China to develop the internal
market and expanding domestic demand as well, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China has a high saving rate, with the national deposit pool
expanding by some 800 billion yuan (96.4 billion US dollars)
annually. "Therefore conditions are available for increasing
investment," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the central bank has removed lending
quotas imposed on the state banks, which are allowed to make loan
decisions on their own but have to be held responsible for their
profitability.
</P>
<P>
As banks are granted more autonomy, the actual investment is
very likely to exceed the planned figure, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
According to the top banker, investment priority will be given
to leading infrastructure projects, such as railway, highway,
municipal works, environment improvement and private housing
projects.
</P>
<P>
"Financing of the projects under construction and Sino-foreign
joint venture projects already approved will be accelerated and
new projects that have passed feasibility studies will also get
funding support," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to beef up the lending strength of the
state banks, he noted, the Ministry of Finance planed to grant
them special treasury bonds and, more important, the central bank
has projected to cut the compulsory minimum reserve ratio from
current 13 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Residential housing is another area to get the full bank
support. Dai revealed that the loan for private housing
construction will reach between 100 billion yuan (12 billion US
dollars) and 150 billion yuan (18 US dollars), doubling that of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the focus will be shifted from private housing
development to expanding the scope of mortgage loans, so as to
enable more people to afford their own houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will prohibit to divert the funding for building luxury
hotels, high-grade office buildings and villas so as to prevent a
possible resurgence of a new round of bubble economy," Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
To further increase the strength and lending capacity of the
state banks, the Ministry of Finance is going to issue special
treasury bonds, and the central bank has also projected to cut the
compulsory minimum reserve ratio from current 13 percent to 8
percent, the central bank governor said.

<HEADLINE> Charity Undertakings Make Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Charity undertakings in China such
as those assisting poor mothers and school dropouts have made much
headway, according to leaders of charity organizations speaking at
a press conference today sponsored by the ongoing First Session of
the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
With an effort to help poor mothers, Project Happiness was
launched in 1994, according to Wang Guangmei, widow of late
Chinese president Liu Shaoqi and director of the charity's
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 yuan (240 US dollars) is given to an impoverished
mother so that she can start a small business. When the life of
the mother has improved, the money has to be paid back. And the
money is then loaned to another mother.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fund is used for education on medical care,
child bearing and farming.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, more than 30 million yuan had been raised
for Project Happiness, 68 projects had been carried out and nearly
30,000 poor mothers had become beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the China Youth Development
Foundation, said at the press conference that Project Hope has
assisted 1.847 million children to resume their education since
the foundation initiated the project nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,200 Hope primary schools have been set up across
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope has played an active role in working together with
the government to boost elementary education in impoverished
areas, Xu Yongguang said.
</P>
<P>
The goal of Project Hope is to help 2.5-3 million children from
poor families and establish over 7,000 Hope primary schools
throughout the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Coal Industry in Northwestern China Gets Re-employment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A project in China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has been designed to help poverty-stricken coal
miners who have been laid off the job establish businesses by
providing low-interest loans and unemployment relief.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is one of China's six coal centers and has over 100,000
coal workers. In the '90's, about 15,000 workers were laid off to
improve efficiency. However, one of these people, Chen Fengqing,
made a lot of money in two years' time by establishing a chicken
farm in 1995, and then expanded her business to raising pigs and
running a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
She is just one example of laid-off people in the industry,
according to Song Tianyou, the vice-director of the coal
department. He attributed her success to the expanded
re-employment project. Coal enterprises in the region used various
ways to help the unemployed. By the end of 1997, about 8,600
people had found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Song said that Ningxia's coal industry has 14 trades in
industrial, agricultural, and service work, with 488 factories,
430 products, and 20,000 employees. In 1997, the output value of
these was 700 million yuan, and profits, 60 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Developing labor-intensive industry is one way to solve the
problem, and unemployed people are being encouraged to open up
wasteland. Last year, farms in mining areas produced 4.3 million
kg of grain, 2.2 million kg of fruit, and 800,000 kg of meat,
fish, and eggs, all of which provided both salaries for workers
and more food for local tables.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels May Intervene in Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) said Saturday that it will verify if its members are among
eight hostage-takers in the Davao Penal Colony (DAPECOL) in
Kapalong, Davao del Norte, the Southern Philippines, and may
intervene in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Eight inmates of the Davao Prisons and Penal Farm Thursday
morning took five female prison employees hostage inside the
DAPECOL reception and diagnostic center, demanding the ouster of
the prison superintendent and construction of a mosque inside the
penal colony and talks with government officials.
</P>
<P>
Some people reportedly said that two or three hostage-takers
are MILF members and suggested that the MILF should intervene in
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Philippine News Agency, Al Haj
Murad, MILF vice chairman, said Saturday that the rebel group will
verify if the hostage-takers are MILF members.
</P>
<P>
But he said that "whether they are MILF members or not, we are
open to suggestions what we can do to save the critical situation
involving victims from the weaker sex."
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said that after Jesus Dureza, presidential
assistant to Mindanao, failed to end up the hostage crisis Friday,
people are seeking his intervention in the release of the five
female hostages.
</P>
<P>
The hostage-takers are armed with hand grenade, firearms and
bladed weapons, the Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the government already agreed to dismiss
the prison superintendent Jose Poblacion Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The rest of their demands were still being negotiated as of

An Iraqi delegation headed by al-Sahhaf will discuss with Annan
the steps to be taken regarding the increase of oil Iraq is
allowed to sell under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Under a new U.N. Security Council resolution which was passed
by the 15-member council on February 20, the amount of oil Iraq
can sell would increase from 2 billion U.S. dollars to 5.2 billion
dollars over six months.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has said it is unable to pump more than 4 billion
dollars worth of oil in six months due to the decline of oil
prices in world market and lack of spare parts in its oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister will also continue negotiations
with Annan on the implementation of the Iraq-U.N. accords signed
on February 23 during the U.N. Chief's Baghdad trip.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords, Iraq had agreed to open its presidential
palaces to a special group composed of senior diplomats appointed
by Annan and experts drawn from the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons and the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been unable to sell its oil on the open market since
the U.N. sanctions were imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The oil-for-food deal, which began in December 1996,
allows Iraq to sell a restricted amount of oil to buy food and
medicine for its 22 million people suffering under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can not be lifted unless the U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that Iraq has been disarmed of biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Getting More Chinese Farmers To Industrialize Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of farmers in
China's Sichuan Province have begun to implement industrial
management of agriculture and increased per-capita income by 280
yuan annually in 1997, which is 40 percent more than unimproved
areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province spent 755 million yuan on 435 projects
of this type to develop nearly 640,000 ha of agricultural
production bases, with 46 billion yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
Specialized farmers' associations at different levels have
promoted the process. The Farmers' Watermelon Association in
Leshan city, for example, has close contacts with 100,000
watermelon growers in 54 counties, and accounted for a 60-70
percent share of the province's watermelon market.
</P>
<P>
A joint stock cooperative system has also been introduced, and
more importantly, large enterprise groups have been encouraged to
join the campaign to industrialize local agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government to Protest Against Denktash's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is to
lodge a protest against the content and the substance of a letter
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash sent to President Glafcos
Clerides on Friday, local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The government considers the letter as totally unacceptable
both in terms of substance and ethics. The President and his
Foreign Minister will take the necessary measures on both
counts," government spokesman Christos Stylianides was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the press reports, Rauf Denktash's letter was
communicated to Clerides by a senior U.N. official. But the letter
was sent back after Clerides refused to accept it because it was
written on "official" paper.
</P>
<P>
"The fact it was written on the paper of the pseudo-state and
signed by 'President' Denktash is unacceptable," Stylianides
said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Denktash and Clerides have communicated
by letters in the past but have avoided using titles.
</P>
<P>
In his three-page letter, Denktash essentially rejected any
notion toward a united federal Cyprus and reiterated his
long-standing demand for recognition of his breakaway republic,
which was unilaterally declared in 1983 in northern Cyprus and
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktash demanded that efforts for a future settlement should
be based on the "acknowledgement of the existence of equal status
of our respective states."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the international community, which recognized the
Republic of Cyprus, have been trying for decades to reunite the
divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal federal state, but so far
little tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's position on the Cyprus issue has been hardened
following the European Union's (EU) decision to start accession
talks with the Cypriot government on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader has ordered suspension of bicommunal
contacts since last December in retaliation for the EU's move.

<P>
FUZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Border inspectors in China's
Fujian Province have gotten some results in their crackdown on the
smuggling of drugs, firearms, and people in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Provincial border police found 261 cases of people smuggling
last year, involving 2,262 people, and arrested 263 ringleaders
and accomplices.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered 99 cases of smuggled goods, worth 55
million yuan (6.6 million yuan), and seized 175 kg of heroin, 82
kg of "ice", and a number of smuggled firearms.
</P>
<P>
Priority has been given to controls on different types of
ships, which are an essential part of smuggling activities,
according to one frontier inspection force officer who said that,
in 1997, the force increased its size, held professional training
classes for its frontier guards, and set up a marine police
emergency system, all of which increased its effectiveness.

LANZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The telephone, which is a
common instrument in major cities of today's China, has special
significance to people in northwest China's Gansu Province. For
them, it provides one way to a well-off life.
</P>
<P>
Kang Kegui in Kangjiaya, a county known for its poverty, said
he has become wealthy by using a telephone, which has allowed him
to contact his customers more easily.
</P>
<P>
"In the sales prime time, my telephone fees are always over
10,000 yuan per month," Kang said. He is a potato dealer. Every
year, he sells 50,000 tons of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
In other impoverished areas in Gansu such as Dingxi, Longnan
and Tianshui, telephones were put in the most eye-catching places
and in families who needed phones for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 telephone subscribers sign up every year in
Gansu. To meet the growing need, the provincial government puts
more than 1 billion yuan into telecommunications construction per
year.

<HEADLINE> China's Govt Institutions Restructuring Significant: HK Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers Saturday
hailed the central government's institutional restructuring
program as being of far-reaching importance.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring plan under which the government's ministries
and commissions will be slashed from 40 down to 29 was explained
by Luo Gan, state councilor and secretary-general of the State
Council, at the First Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in its editorial Saturday that the
restructuring plan has taken into account both the needs of
China's reform and development, and the burden that the society
can bear.
</P>
<P>
The editorial noted that China is simultaneously facing grave
challenges and good chances for development. The trend for
international financial and economic integration and lessons from
financial turmoil in Asia has demonstrated that the establishment
of a highly efficient, well coordinated and standardized
administrative system which separates functions of the government
from those of the enterprise will play an important role in
maintaining China's economic growth, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao in a commentary Saturday described the
institutional restructuring of the State Council as "a
revolution," saying restructuring of government institutions is
urgently needed to deepen economic reform and promote economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
It is also a necessity in bringing the government closer to the
people, the daily said, adding this will surely bring benefits
by promoting the market economy and attracting foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
A commentary carried by The Hong Kong Commercial Daily Saturday
said the restructuring of the institutions shows the government's
determination to implement the principle of governing the state
and exercising administration by rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong people warmly welcome the plan because it was
worked out after summing up the historical experience and
earnestly considering the social needs, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of a socialist legal system will provide a
powerful guarantee for the implementation of the principle of "one
country, two systems" in Hong Kong, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Wooden Houses Giving Way to Brick in Rural China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Some old two-story wooden
structures in rural parts of an autonomous county of Qianjiang
Tujia and Miao minorities in Chongqing, in southwest China, are
giving way to brick houses.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers lived in thatched sheds that they shared with
livestock. Then later, as two-story wooden structures became more
affordable, the family would live upstairs and the animals
downstairs.
</P>
<P>
One farmer, Li Liangping, a Tujia who is in his late 40s, who
moved into a new brick house recently after years of living
together with his animals under the same roof, says, "Wooden
houses were much better than sheds, but the terrible smell from
downstairs was really hard to tolerate, especially in the hot
months."
</P>
<P>
But, some great changes have taken place in China's rural areas
since the reform and opening-up drive of the late 1970s, and now
75 percent of the villages in the county have roads or highways
leading out and 80 percent have electricity. Per-capita income of
farmers was 1,250 yuan and they produced 700 kg of grain.
</P>
<P>
Li's family earns more than 10,000 yuan annually from crops and
pigs, and outside the five-room house there's a neat pigpen. And,
70 percent of his neighbors have new brick houses.
</P>
<P>
"The disappearance of the wooden buildings means a new chapter
in efforts by local farmers to fight poverty, and it is better for
environmental protection because less wood is used," says Lei
Guofang, an official in charge of the county's poverty relief
work.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Airlines to Sell Its Shares in ENHAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Airlines is ready to sell
its shares in Entebbe Handling Services Limited (ENHAS), The New
Vision reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to top aviation sources yesterday, the state
enterprise is in a desperate need for capital to resuscitate its
operation. Uganda Airlines wants some three billion Uganda
Shillings (some three million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
ENHAS was formed in 1994 to activise the services for handling
visitors and break the monopoly of Uganda Airlines in the
services. ENHAS is a profit earning enterprise. Uganda Airlines
have 50 percent of shares of ENHAS.
</P>
<P>
Majority shareholders of ENHAS showed their interest in buying
the shares. The privatisation unit of the country is arranging
the sale, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Airlines itself is one of the state enterprises to be
privatised by the end of 2,000 year. Uganda has a plan to
privatise its big state enterprises such as Uganda Electrocity
Board, National Water and Sewerage Corporation. The country has
already sold part of its shares in Uganda Commercial Bank.

<HEADLINE> Pak Has Not Postponed Legal Course Against U.S.  : Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has not postponed its
option of filing a suit against the United States on the issue of
F-16 planes, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided in principle to file the suit, we are making
preparations for it," the spokesman told a weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether a law suit against the U.S. would in any way
hamper relations between Pakistan and the U.S., the spokesman
said: "I hope it will be seen as a reflection of our fair demand."
</P>
<P>
"We are well within our rights to demand supply of the planes
or return of our money," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan entered into a contract with the U.S. in 1989 for
purchase of sixty F-16 aircraft and paid 658 million U.S. dollars
for the purchase.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the planes have been delivered nor the money
refunded to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said on February 26
this year in the National Assembly that "we are in the process of
preparing ourselves for legal recourse in a U.S. court and have
engaged a law firm to study all aspects of the matter."
</P>
<P>
He also said that an amicable and early resolution of the F-16
issue with the U.S. is on top of the Pakistani government's
agenda.

<HEADLINE> Pingxiang, Trade Center along Sino-Vietnamese Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The small city of Pingxiang,
which was an important military area in China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, has become an important trade center along
the Sino-Vietnamese border.
</P>
<P>
The crowds of servicemen are gone, replaced by pedlars and
traders who jostle each other on the streets. The bullet-pocked
houses have been replaced by tall buildings and nearly 1,000
restaurants, beauty shops, and other stores that do business all
night long.
</P>
<P>
One restaurant owner says he's never troubled by theft or
robberies. Most business people are females, and some, known as
"open air bankers", carry bags of money and provide foreign
exchange services. Some restaurants have outdoor areas with
chafing dishes and beer in the early spring.
</P>
<P>
People have been coming here to do business since the early
1990s, as Sino-Vietnamese relations improved. In the last five
years, the city's exports and imports have had an average annual
increase of 20 percent, and in 1996, were valued at 1.23 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city has 160,000 people, and a large "floating
population". The local Huayue Travel Agency has anywhere from
1-day to 9-day trips to Vietnam, with a three-day group visit to
Hanoi only priced at 250 yuan per person.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Buy Trainer Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African Air Force
(SAAF) has announced that it is planning to buy 24 jet trainer
aircraft to replace its aging Impala fleet in early next century.
</P>
<P>
SAAF spokeswoman Lavern Machine said at the weekend that the
trainers would be funded by cutting back the number of fighter
aircraft the SAAF hoped to buy from 48 to 38.
</P>
<P>
"We have to stay with that budget," Machine said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Jane's Defense Weekly published in
Britain, the SAAF has planned to link its selection of a trainer
to that of the light fighter.
</P>
<P>
This would make both British Aerospace, which is presently
offering the Swedish Gripen fighter, and German Daimler-Benz
Aerospace, which is offering the AT2000 fighter, the leading
contenders to bid for the trainer contract.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Improving Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's main agricultural areas are
making an effort to readjust agriculture at a time when buyer's
markets are growing in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province is one example. From 1991 to 1995, farmers'
incomes had an annual average increase of 25.1 percent. But last
year, the figure dropped to 12.8 percent, even with the record
harvest. It had a good harvest for the third consecutive year in
1997, with a high level of production of major crops. But, most
crops ran into sales problems, and farmers' incomes were affected
as a result.
</P>
<P>
A striking contrast could be found in aquatic and meat
products, where there was rapid growth and good sales because
high-quality fish and lean pork got a large market share, industry
insiders say.
</P>
<P>
So, the provincial government decided to focus on market
adjustments, instead of the old increasing or reducing the size of
the crop-growing area. It plans to increase quality rice acreage
from the present 20 percent to 60 percent, and to encourage
diverse economies in rural areas and developing brand-name farm
produce and by-products.
</P>
<P>
The province will also place priority on industrializing
agriculture and on science and technology in agriculture and
increasing farmers' earnings. It is now working on getting local
universities and agricultural research institutes to work on
seeding projects and processing techniques.

<HEADLINE> Telephones Help People Escape Poverty in Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The telephone, which is a
common instrument in major cities of today's China, has special
significance to people in northwest China's Gansu Province. For
them, it provides one way to a well-off life.
</P>
<P>
Kang Kegui in Kangjiaya, a county known for its poverty, said
he has become wealthy by using a telephone, which has allowed him
to contact his customers more easily.
</P>
<P>
"In the sales prime time, my telephone fees are always over
10,000 yuan per month," Kang said. He is a potato dealer. Every
year, he sells 50,000 tons of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
In other impoverished areas in Gansu such as Dingxi, Longnan
and Tianshui, telephones were put in the most eye-catching places
and in families who needed phones for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 telephone subscribers sign up every year in
Gansu. To meet the growing need, the provincial government puts
more than 1 billion yuan into telecommunications construction per
year.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin stressed
national unity and called for greater efforts to safeguard social
stability, quicken economic development and social progress in
areas inhabited by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark today in separate group discussions
attended by deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
from the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
With equal emphasis on reform and development on one hand and
solidarity and stability on the other by the local government,
Tibet has achieved remarkable economic growth and social progress
since the third national conference on Tibet-related work was held
in 1994, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have won significant victory in the fight against splittism
in Tibet. The region has maintained social and political stability
and the people there are living a happy life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that our autonomous system implemented in
ethnic areas and the ethnic and religious policies of the
Communist Party of China are correct, the president said.

"If we compare the old Tibet with the new, anyone who respects
facts can make a fair judgment which is dark, backward, autocratic
and trampling on human rights and which is bright, progressive,
democratic and respecting human rights," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The great achievements scored in economic and social fields in
Tibet since liberation show that only the region practises
democratic reform, takes the socialist road and sticks to reforms
can Tibet be saved, developed and made prosperous, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is a big family composed of 56 ethnic groups. For years,
people of all nationalities have a close relationship, are united
and work for the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
This is an important driving force for enriching the Chinese
civilization and a source for the strong vitality, cohesiveness
and creativeness of the Chinese nation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the long period of revolution and construction led by the
Communist Party of China, officials and the broad masses of people
of all ethnic groups have made their due contributions. They
cooperate with, support, complement and improve one another. This
is an important advantage for strengthening national unity, and
promoting the common development and prosperity of all ethnic
groups.

While joining in the panel discussion of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Regional delegation, Jiang noted that at present,
Xinjiang enjoys social and political stability, economic
prosperity, ethnic unity and a solid defense at its frontier
regions, and that people of all ethnic groups there enjoy a
contented and happy life.
</P>
<P>
He highly praised officials and people of various ethnic groups
in Xinjiang for contributing greatly to the region's stability
and development.
</P>
<P>
After hearing speeches of several Xinjiang deputies, Jiang put
forth his suggestions for the work in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of resolutely maintaining stability
in Xinjiang, which he described as a region with great strategic
significance in northwest China and also with a concentration of
multiple ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping social and political stability in this region has a
bearing on the overall situation," he said, adding that the Party
Central Committee has attached great importance to Xinjiang's
stability and development and has repeatedly discussed about
relevant work in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that facts have proved the correctness of the decision
made by the Party Central Committee concerning the work in
Xinjiang, and that the autonomous regional Party committee and
government have carried out in real earnest the Party Central
Committee's relevant policies for the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there remains a lot of hard work to do in
maintaining stability in Xinjiang, and that it's still an arduous
task to oppose ethnic separation, maintain ethnic unity and
safeguard national unity.
</P>
<P>
"The tree may prefer calm, but the wind will not subside. It
will be a long-term task to fight splittism," Jiang said.

He urged leading officials across Xinjiang to uphold the
Party's ethnic and religious policies and implement the essence of
the central government regarding the autonomous region's work down
to the grassroots levels.
</P>
<P>
On the local economic and social growth, Jiang said Xinjiang
has abundant resources and good prospects for development.
</P>
<P>
The central government has made Xinjiang an area to maintain
China's sustained and rapid economic growth in the development
strategy for the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000)
and first 10 years in the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to turn Xinjiang into a
major petrochemical and cotton production base, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Xinjiang has rich nonferrous mineral resources, he
added. These are favorable conditions in promoting Xinjiang's
development.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that Xinjiang can catch up with other
provinces and autonomous regions in economic growth, and overtake
them and charged itself to the forefront in China's modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will, as always, give a powerful
backing to the region's work," he said while expressing his hope
that the cadres and masses of multi-ethnical people can work to
maintain unity and conduct in depth-reform so as to effect a rise
in Xinjiang's economic development and social progress.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls for Improved Farming Techniques and More Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today called on
local governments to maintain sober-minded about the weakness of
agriculture in the national economy though farming production
scored great progress over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the appeal while joining in a penal discussion by
members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, 16 CPPCC National Committee members, who
are here for the First Session of the CPPCC Ninth National
Committee, made speeches concerning agrotechnical advances,
protecting grain production and forests, improving water
conservation, mechanizing farm work, and alleviating the burden on
farmers.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the speeches with a meticulous care, Li said that
the growth of agriculture depends on stable policy, more input and
still better use of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"We should stabilize the household responsibility system with
renumeration linked to output. This is decided by China's present
realities," he said, adding that the initiative of farmers must be
protected.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology are vital factors that contribute to the
increase in agricultural production over the past several years,
but the rate of contribution lags far behind that in developed
nations, the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he urged local officials to spare no effort to
publicize latest and effective farming techniques, such as using
chemical fertilizer and plastic film sheets and applying fine
strains in a still more scientific way.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Premier Li Peng voiced agreement with the CPPCC
National Committee members in the view that more funds should be
allocated in agriculture, saying that apart from government input,
rural collective units, individual farmers and other sectors of
society should encouraged to invest more in agricultural
production.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Gives Thumb Up For HK Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's central government has a
high opinion of the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region in maintaining Hong Kong's stability and
economic prosperity since it was returned to China eight months
ago.
</P>
<P>
This was made known by Li Ruihuan, a member of the Politburo
Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, when he took part in a group discussion attended by
people from Hong Kong and Macao as members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, in session here since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the HKSAR government has exercised effective
administration in Hong Kong and that the Hong Kong people have
maintained their original lifestyle. The region has seen a vibrant
economy and social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
These prove the correctiveness of the "one country, two
systems" policy and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's belief that
Chinese people in Hong Kong can govern Hong Kong well, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed satisfaction at the work of Tung Chee Hwa,
chief executive of HKSAR, and of people of different walks of life
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li said the central government has always supported the work of
the HKSAR government. The most fundamental support, he said, is to
fully respect "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy for Hong Kong as prescribed in the Basic Law of
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The success of the "one country, two systems" policy in Hong
Kong and the continued prosperity of Hong Kong will be of great
significance for reform and opening up programs in the mainland,
for Macao's smooth return, and for a peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan question, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan noted Macao will return to the embrace of the
motherland in a little more than one year. Macao compatriots have
seen clearly the bright prospects of Macao in the implementation
of the "one country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong and are
expecting the day for its return to the motherland. "This is the
most favorable condition for a smooth transition in Macao," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Prepares to Face Challenges in Globalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Saturday that his country has to prepare itself to
face new challenges in a globalized economy of today.
</P>
<P>
The South Asia, particularly Pakistan, is poised for rapid
growth in the wake of new emerging markets in the Central Asia,
said Sharif while addressing a meeting of heads of multi-national
companies in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's economy has been opened up for investment in many
sectors including agriculture, infrastructure and service sector
and the government has taken various measures to attract foreign
direct investment on repatriable basis, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He urged multi-national companies to establish their production
facilities in Pakistan to tape potentials in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are now ready to cater to all the needs of foreign
investors," Sharif said. He also said that the government is
considering to establish a permanent body to look into problems
faced by multi-national companies operating in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan on
Saturday, the meeting was organized by the Board of Investment of

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A rapid development of non-public
economic sectors is providing job opportunities for laid-off
workers discharged by bloated state-owned firms, according to
deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress, in session here
since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Qin Chaozhen, director of the Hebei Provincial Economic
and Trade Commission, said his province will dismantle 700,000
obsolete cotton spindles this year, which will result in 48,000
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The laid-off workers, however, will be trained before getting
new jobs, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei provincial government will spend 200 million yuan
this year financing reemployment programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
National spending for reemployment programs is expected to
total 10 billion yuan this year, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
According to Qin, while some state enterprises are downsizing,
businesses of other ownership forms are now offering an increasing
number of jobs. Private clothing factories in Lixian and Rongcheng
counties in Hebei are recruiting more workers. Cashmere processing
alone employs 100,000 workers in the province's Qinghe county, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Yang Zhenbin, a vice-president of Anhui
Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, private businesses
have shown great interest in employing state-owned workers who are
regarded as being well-trained, experienced and disciplined.
</P>
<P>
A deputy from Wenzhou, in east China's Zhejiang Province, said
that one third of the 420,000 workers at state-owned enterprises
in the city have lost their jobs in downsizing programs, but so
far not a single one of the laid-off workers has ever visited the
municipal labor bureau for a job. Almost all of them have found
new jobs in collective and private businesses, become
self-employed or started businesses of their own, he said.

<HEADLINE> Highland Tibetans Have Enough Vegetables to Eat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Residents on the high plateau have
easy access to fresh vegetablest, Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the
Tibet Autonomous Regional government, said today at a panel of the
ongoing First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Owning to harsh natural conditions and backward cultivation
techniques, local Tibetans had to eat merely radish, potato,
cabbage and a few other varieties of indigenous vegetable, and
supplies were even more dearth during the frigid winter-spring
season.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the introduction of greenhouse, plastic sheeting and
high-altitude cultivation methods, local vegetable production has
increased, and Tibetans are now able to eat fresh vegetables all
year round, Gyaincain Norbu said.
</P>
<P>
Around the capital city of Lhasa, ten large vegetable growing
centers with a combined area of 1,200 ha have been opened.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the autonomous regional government has encouraged
and assisted farmers and herdspeople to raise pig, cattle and
chicken so that the diet of local residents, either in urban
areas, or rural and pastoral regions have enriched and become
varied, the chairman said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Breast Cancer Patients Surviving Longer: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. women with breast cancer
are surviving much longer now than in the past, said a study
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Average survival period after diagnosis, according to the
study, rose from 4.4 years in 1965 to 7.2 years in 1993 among
women whose breast cancer tumors had spread to nearby lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
For those not suffering from cancer spread, the study conducted
by the American Cancer Society said, the average survival period
rose from 8.5 years in 1963 to 11.7 years in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The finding was drawn from studies on the records of 25,000
breast cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
The study attributed the phenomenon to better and earlier
detection, increased use of chemotherapy and radiation along with
surgery, as well as better techniques for finding that cancer
cells had in fact spread.
</P>
<P>
U.S. women have an overall one-in-eight chance of developing
breast cancer in their lifetime, it said.
</P>
<P>
More than 180,000 U.S. women are diagnosed with breast cancer
annually, and 40,000 of them die of the disease, according to the
study.

<P>
"Accelerating government restructuring is urgently needed in
the process of establishing a socialist market economy, and it is
also a common wish of the Party and people," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Party and government leaders across the country must reach a
real common understanding, and earnestly carry out the government
reform with confidence, a high sense of responsibility and
discipline, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only by so doing can we attain the goal of downsizing the
government, improving officials' competence and strengthening the
management of enterprises, and improve government work to a new
level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also heard the legislators' opinions on a government work
report delivered earlier by Premier Li Peng at the ongoing NPC

<HEADLINE> Gas Supply Disrupted in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Efforts are being made to bring back
normal gas supply to Bangladesh capital Dhaka after gas supply was
cut off in many parts for the third consecutive day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of engineers and workers have been sent to repair the
damaged pipeline that disrupted gas supply on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The main pipeline of the Titas Gas Transmission and
Distribution Company Ltd., the sole gas supplier of the city, was
damaged when the pile driver hit the underground pipeline during
the construction work of a residential building of Bangladesh
Television near Rampura TV complex, reports said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the city plunged into an unprecedented gas
crisis following the incident, and the authorities termed it as an
act of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
But Titas Gas officials said the accident occurred due to
alignment problem of the plot where the construction work was
going on.
</P>
<P>
Gas supply was partially resumed in different affected areas on
Thursday evening, but didn't last long, and low-pressure gas
supply was reported on Friday afternoon but was cut off in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best. It will take only five to six hours
after reaching the damaged point of the line at 22 feet under the
ground," Muqtadir Ali, managing director of Titas Gas was quoted
as saying Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Steel Plant to Stop Raising Output for Environment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's third largest steel
producer, the Capital Steel Corp. in Beijing, which is also known
as "Shougang," has decided this year not to raise its output any
more, partly for soothing local residents' growing complaints
about air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"We'll shift our attention to the variety, quality and
marketability of our products, and intensify efforts to curb
pollution," said Bi Qun, president of Capital Steel, who is
attending the ongoing session of the Ninth National People's
Congress as a deputy.
</P>
<P>
Due to rapid economic growth and a population surge, the
Chinese capital has witnessed a fast decline in environmental
qualities in recent years. Local residents are most upset by the
city's worsening air pollution.
</P>
<P>
About 30 kilometers to the west of Tiananmen Square in downtown
Beijing, Capital Steel, which employs 210,000 workers, is regarded
as a leading air polluter for its huge daily discharge of
industrial dust and other harmful materials.
</P>
<P>
Though there is not yet a plan to move the behemoth out of
Beijing, Bi said, "We're ready to close a branch factory next to
the new railway station in the city."
</P>
<P>
Capital Steel, which had stressed output increases for decades,
last year produced eight million tons of steel, eight percent of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
"We used to expect a yearly output of 10 million tons, but now
we have realized the conflicts between our ambitious goal and the
strategy of sustainable development China has adopted since the
early 1990s," Bi noted.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the current NPC session on
Thursday, Premier Li Peng reiterated that economic growth must not
be pursued at the expense of resources and the environment.

<P>
China has maintained the world's highest economic growth for
several years, but problems like resources depletion and
environmental deterioration are also looming large in this most
populous country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Xiaoke, another NPC deputy who is an executive council
member of the Chinese Society of Environmental Science, said that
environmental problems, if not handled timely and properly, could
do serious harm to China's reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
"However, the central authorities have shown great resolution
and taken really fast action in environmental protection in recent
years. I did'nt quite expect that," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bi, Capital Steel last year spent 100 million yuan
(about 12 million US dollars) fighting pollution, something quite
unthinkable a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing today, drivers have been required to use unleaded
gas, natural gas from northwest China is replacing coal as the
city's main fuel, and residents can see weekly air quality reports
released by the municipal government through the local media.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin said that the city would seek new
economic growth mainly from the hi-tech sectors, and that the
municipal government would force all local enterprises to adopt
the strategy of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has ordered all industrial enterprises
across the country to either meet state standards for pollution
control before 2000 or get closed. By the end of 1997, more than
60,000 enterprises had been shut down for causing serious
pollution.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Brings Back Hopes from US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars overseas have
submitted a host of proposals for the on-going session of China's
top legislature, with a hope that China will still be stable
politically and prosperous economically and have a still
higher-degree of democracy.
</P>
<P>
One of these messages was brought back by Su Xiaoqing, a
teacher from Guizhou Medical College and currently a visiting
scholar of entomological biology in North Carolina University in
the past two and half months.
</P>
<P>
"On February 18, I was informed by my husband through e-mail
that I was elected deputy of the National People's Congress
(NPC)," said Su, who immemdiately hurried to Beijing from the US
for the current session.
</P>
<P>
Prior to her return for the conference, she said many
students studying in the United States went to visit her and
asked her to pass on their messages to the NPC annual session.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that there should be some more NPC deputies to
be elected from among the scholars studying overseas. "These
scholar deputies can promptly bring back the knowledge, and
information on the related subjects to China's highest organ of
power," she quoted a Chinese student as saying: "It is helpful for
the motherland."
</P>
<P>
In the last two day, Su said she was inspired at hearing
Premier Li Peng's government work report and State Councillor Luo

that she had felt the urgency for institutional restructuring and
reforming higher education.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses Cameroun of Arms Build-up on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Friday accused Cameroun of
deploying no fewer than 5,000 troops with heavy weapons on the
disputed Bakassi Peninsula, thus causing fresh tension in the
area.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Defense Ministry in Lagos said, "Cameroun
is building massively in the Bakassi Peninsula. More than 5,000
troops with heavy weapons and vehicles have moved to the border
with Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria repeated its condemnation of foreign assistance to
Cameroun on Bakassi, saying that six European nationals were
involved in the deployment.
</P>
<P>
"The massing of troops by the Camerounian government indicates
that they are preparing to attack and occupy some settlement in
the area," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria said it views the concentration of troops by Cameroun
at the border as an affront and appealed for restraint. It said
Nigeria is committed to amicable solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The statement also accused Cameroun soldiers of attacking
Nigerian civilians in the last two weeks, resulting in the death
of an unspecified number of people.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have been clashing since early 1994 on
Bakassi, a territory of about 1,000 square kilometers and
believed to be rich in fishery and oil resources.
</P>
<P>
The case was filed to the International Court of Justice by
Cameroun in 1994 and is currently being heard at Hague, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Nigerian lawyers at Hague have
accused Cameroun of nurturing an ambition to seize the disputed
area to enlarge its maritime frontier and gain a much larger zone
than it could obtain through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers urged the court to decline adjudication and allow
bilateral and multilateral mechanism to resolve the dispute, the
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Spindle-Cut Drive Exerts No Impact on Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) shared the view that
the endeavor to reduce spindles will not effect cotton production
in northwestern Xinjiang, China's largest cotton producer.
</P>
<P>
The cotton output in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, makes up
a quarter of China's total annual output. Two thirds of Xinjiang's
cotton output is transported to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lequan, secretary of the autonomous regional Party
Committee, said "in the wake of a nationwide agricultural
restructuring, the domestic demand for cotton far exceeds the
supply, but added that "we should still tap production potential,
increase cotton output year by year and and raise the quality of
cotton varieties."
</P>
<P>
China expects to cut 10 million obsolete cotton spindles to
bring the number of spindles nationwide to 30 million in the next
three years, in a bid to invigorate its textile industry.
</P>
<P>
"If the country retains these obsolete spindles, it is
hard for the ailing textile industry to get out of red," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry is expected to operate on a fairly
large scale and embark on a road of sustained growth upon the
completion of the readjustment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will back cotton production in the upper and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Xinjiang region and adopt a
series of preferential policies, including allocation of more
funds for cotton production and implementation of the export
refund system.
</P>
<P>
According to participants in today's panel discussion, cotton
production will still be a profitable industry in Xinjiang and,
with increased output, local cotton growers will have more income.
</P>
<P>
Relevant sources disclosed that China will invest 11.15 billion
yuan (1.34 million US dollars) in building cotton production bases
in its Ninth Five-Plan period (1996-2000). Some 3.25 billion yuan
(390 million US dollars) have so far been used. Under this scheme,
Xinjiang is going to produce 1.5 million tons of cotton by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a woman NPC deputy and cotton expert called for still
greater efforts to be made for application of agro-science and
control of cotton diseases and insect pests.

MAPUTO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- After the local elections have
been postponed for three times, the ruling Mozambican Liberation
Front (Frelimo) senior official said the party rejects any
further postponement for the elections.

<HEADLINE> Ground Solid for Stable Exchange Rates of RMB: Economist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A noted economist said that the
foundation is solid for the Chinese currency renminbi (RMB) to
have stable exchange rates against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign exchange market, supply and demand decides the
relative prices of different currencies, said Xiao Zhuoji, a
professor from Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, there have been adequate supplies of US dollars on
China's foreign exchange market, and demand for RMB has kept
increasing. The demand and supply of US dollars and RMB are
basically balanced, while demand for RMB is bigger than supply,
Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has lasted successively for three years, and the
trend is expected to remain unchanged," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
China's balance of international payments is good, and the
country's foreign exchange reserves have increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1997, China experienced a surplus in both current
and capital accounts. Its foreign exchange reserves increased from
21.2 billion US dollars in 1994 to 139.9 billion US dollars at the
end of 1997, providing an important condition for RMB's stable
exchange rates against the US dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The structure of China's foreign funds and foreign debts is
rational," Xiao said. At the end of 1997, China had used more than
320 billion US dollars of foreign funds, two-thirds of which had
been foreign direct investment with the rest being loans, or
China's debt.
</P>
<P>
Long and medium-term debts make up 88 percent of China's
existing foreign debts, and short-term debts account for only 12
percent; annual repayment rate is less than ten percent. Payment
servicing debts each year is about 10 billion US dollars, or seven
percent of the country's foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
"This also acts as an important condition for the RMB's
stability," the professor said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Strict supervision over the financial market and gradual
opening-up of the country's financial business have helped
stabilize the exchange rates of RMB, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiao Zhuoji, the opening-up of China's foreign
exchange market was carried out in three steps. In early 1994, the
dual exchange rate system was replaced by a unified system. RMB
was made convertible under the current account in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The third step is to make RMB fully convertible. Because
convertibility under the capital account is not ready yet, RMB
cannot be converted freely yet.
</P>
<P>
The process of step-by-step opening-up conforms to China's
present economic strength, its foreign exchange supervisory system
and its ability to adapt to the international market, he said.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is also a reason why China is able to resist
raids from speculative foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
A booming economy and low inflation are also stabilizing
conditions for the Chinese currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
A stable RMB is conducive to a steady development of China's
own economy, to stabilizing economic relations between China and
other countries and regions, and to foreign investment, the
economist said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the RMB's stable exchange rate will enhance the
confidence of southeast Asian countries in extricating themselves
out of the financial crisis as soon as possible.

LUANDA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Fernando Vilalonga, Spanish State
Councillor for International Cooperation and Foreign Affairs,
said here Friday that Spanish government is "confident" of the
success of Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Vilalonga said on finishing his three-day visit to the country
that though Angola faces many difficulties, both the government
and the former rebel -- the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), have expressed their strong
desire for peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNITA should live up to its promises for peace
and the government at the same time should take flexible actions
in holding talks with UNITA in solving all the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
There could not be another war in the country, Vilalonga said,
as both sides have expressed "constructive and positive"
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government would contribute to the peace and
reconstruction of Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
Spain would offer Angola 200 million U.S. Dollars loan this

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Cuts Civil Service by 24 Percent over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian government has
reduced its civil service from 355,000 to 271,000, a 24 percent
cut, over the past five years to make it more effective and
efficient, an official has said.
</P>
<P>
George Yambesi, director of the policy development in civil
service department, told an Eastern and Southern African
consultative meeting in northern city of Arusha Friday that the
civil service would be further cut to 225,000 in accordance with
a proposed new service employment policy.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the new policy would provide broad
guidelines on instituting a merit-based civil service to enhance
salaries for professionals and top civil servants to levels
comparable to those in the private sector and raise the minimum
basic salary to the minimum living standard.
</P>
<P>
"A new code of ethics and conduct and a performance
measurement oriented staff appraisal system will also be
instituted," he told senior servants from Kenya, Uganda, Zambia,
Zambabwe, South Africa, Mozambique and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
A survey in 1996 indicated the civil servants in Tanzania were
the lowest paid comparing with other countries in the region,
Yambesi said, partly because of a prevalent existence of ghost
workers on the payroll.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Used to Upgrade China's State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A large number of unprofitable
state-owned enterprises in northeastern Liaoning Province have
been revitalized thanks to technological upgrading with use of
foreign funds in recent years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Liaoning has absorbed 3 billion U.S.
dollars to carry out technological transformation in 2,200
state-owned enterprises, 32 percent of which were large and
medium-sized ones, said Provincial Governor Zhang Guoguang today,
who is a deputy to the ongoing First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPV) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The annual output value of the firms that have been retooled
with foreign funds climbed to 18 billion yuan, (2.17 billion US
dollars), or one third of the figure gained by Sino-foreign joint
ventures in Liaoning. Their export value came to 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars, making up 65.3 percent of the export of local joint
ventures and 24 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Introduction of investment from overseas has assisted local
state-owned industrial firms to pool their stocked assets
with a total value of 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province boasts more than 1,000 large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises, or one tenth of the national total.
However, nearly half of the these enterprises, built in the 1950s
or 1960s, are equipped with obsolete facilities, and their products
are not so competitive.
</P>
<P>
Using their workshops, sites and existing equipment as capital
stock, local state-owned enterprises were encouraged to form joint
ventures with overseas partners over recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian-based Bingshan conglomerate, is a case in point. It
has formed 18 joint ventures with the United States, Japan, Italy
and Hong Kong, bringing its total assets to 4 billion yuan (482
million US dollars). Its sales value topped 2.5 billion yuan (300
US dollars), and exports reached 28 million US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The new timetable for the Angolan
peace process mapped out Friday sets March 31st as a new deadline
for the final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new timetable for peace was the result of the proposal by
UN Deputy Representative to Angola Behrooz Sadry, after three
days of discussion.
</P>
<P>
Antinio Dembo, vice chairman of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), issued a communique Friday
to start the total disarmament of its military forces Friday as
outlined in the new proposal.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's communique promises to disband all the remaining armed
men in 15 spots throughout the country on March 11 and 15, and
all the officials at the Bailundo City, UNITA headquarters, would
be deprived of their military ranks by March 19.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal was out after UNITA undertook a series of
sabotage activities against the peace deal signed in Lusaka 1994,
and the February 28 deadline for final peace was broken in the
country.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members on High-Tech Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A high-tech industry can take
shape and develop to drive China's economic growth sustainably if
the government takes realistic measures to boost its development,
said members of China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Gu Shengzu, a member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and a Wuhan
University professor, said development of a new and high-tech
industry is the key to enhancing China's comprehensive strength
since new and high technologies have great potential to boot
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Gu has put forward several proposals at the ongoing session of
the CPPCC National Committee, including one on the establishment
of a high-level co-ordinating mechanism and the mapping out of a
unified strategic plan to boost the development of a high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the commercialization of high and new
technologies involves high input, high risks and big economic
returns. Owing to high input and high risks, he said, only 10-15
percent of patented technologies in China -- more than 20,000 a
year -- and provincial-level recognized research results -- 25,000
a year-- are put to commercial use.
</P>
<P>
The first proposal put forward during the ongoing CPPCC session
is about encouraging risk investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to developing a high-tech industry is to have people
with genuine technological know-how, said Xiong Xingmei, a
professor from Tianjin-based Nankai University, who suggested that
preferential policies be adopted to encourage more Chinese
students studying overseas to return.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shu, a CPPCC national committee member and vice-chairman of
China Association for Science and Technology, proposed providing
popular education on science and technology, suggesting that more
science and natural museums be built across the country.

<HEADLINE> Police Station Raided in Coastal Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Armed raiders attacked a police
station in Kenya's Coast Province Thursday night, slashed an
officer on duty and fled with a G-3 rifle and 20 rounds of
ammunition, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which took place in Mariakani Police Station
between 8:00 to 9:00 p.m., is the second attack on a police
station in the province in the last six months, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Five suspects have been arrested and taken to coastal capital
Mombasa for further interrogation following a swoop in the town
which netted an estimated 70 suspects.
</P>
<P>
"We can not rule out anything but I do not want to comment
until the investigations are completed," Coast police boss
Japheth Mwania said.
</P>
<P>
According to Constable Jacto Chibo, who now is admitted at the
hospital with leg and head wounds, the raiders whom he estimated
between eight and 10 in number, had posed as relatives who wanted
to see an inmate.
</P>
<P>
"I told them to wait outside the gate while I checked the
report office but they pounced on me with machetes and swords in
a bid to steal the rifle but I clung to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
They slashed his head and arms as they struggled to steal his
gun.
</P>
<P>
His colleagues at the reporting desk then opened fire on the
attackers who retreated into the town and disappeared before a
massive swoop was launched a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
Police sources confirmed that all outlying police stations had
been ordered to provide reinforcements to Mariakani area as fears
of another attack mounted.
</P>
<P>
Chibo said that the raiders told him that they "would be back
with reinforcements later."
</P>
<P>
According to Mariakani residents, police reinforcements
arrived from a nearby General Service Unit and went into the town
arresting anyone in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Scores of residents had by Friday camped outside the Mariakani
Police Station waiting to see their relatives who had been
divided into several groups and placed under heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
Mariakani town remained tense the whole day Friday and
businessmen complained of poor business as many people stayed at
home waiting for the situation to return to normal.
</P>
<P>
Last August, heavily armed raiders attacked Likoni Police
Station in Mombasa District, and killed 13 people, among them six
policemen. The raid was the start of an orgy of violence which
left over 70 people dead within a month.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Promotes Women's Income by Small Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian government has
provided a total of 501 loans worth 1.56 billion Tanzanian
Shillings (1 USD equals 670 TSh) to women over the past four
years to promote their income, a senior official was quoted as
saying by local media Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ms Shamim Khan, the Deputy Minister for Industries and Trade,
said at an exhibition for products made by women here to mark the
International Women's Day that the loans were issued to women
entrepreneurs to finance more than 1,000 projects.
</P>
<P>
She said that as a sign of social and economic development of
the Tanzanian women, about half of the people employed by the
informal sector nationwide between 1991 and this year were women.
</P>
<P>
However, Ms Khan also expressed dissatisfaction over the
present unequal distribution of the ntional income, saying that
women labour was heavily exploited despite their handsome
contribution to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is now normal among women since they do not enjoy the
full slice of their income," the deputy minister added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African High Commissioner to Tanzania has
underscored the need for men and women to forge closer
partnership to achieve common development goals.
</P>
<P>
Madame Tandi Rujabe Rankoe also commended the women for
preserving African cultural heritage through artistic works
Thursday when she launched a cultural show entitled The African
Women Night here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Director of the British Council in Dar es Salaam
has urged the women to engage themselves in economic activities
so as to improve their lives and overcome poverty.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Rosemary Hilhorst said at the Women Handicraft Exhibition here
that women had to be active in forming joint ventures to develop their
skills and knowledge to make their income-generating projects more
successful.

<HEADLINE> Stablizing Currency Not a Political Consideration: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor
said that maintaining a stable RMB value is not the personal will
of Chinese leaders, but a reflection of both supply and demand on
the exchange market and overall performance of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the Chinese yuan has actually
appreciated and the country's foreign currency reserve has grown
by 120 billion U.S. dollars to 140.3 billion US dollars by the end
of February, Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of
China, said at a press conference hosted by the on-going NPC
session earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, Dai said#,
China's export and investment from overseas this year will be
likely affected, but several factors are working to help balance
international payment.
</P>
<P>
The labor cost in China is generally much cheaper than in
Southeast Asian countries, and there is no sign that toy and
textile export as the country's predominant export items will be
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
"It is entirely possible that China will have a trade
balance, even a moderate surplus," said the central bank
governor, who further predicted that the foreign capital inflow
this year would be around 30 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's foreign debt is not big in size and 80
percent of which is long-term debt, therefore there is no need to
convert the Chinese currency to pay foreign debts, explained Dai.
</P>
<P>
"China's foreign exchange reserve will continue to grow this
year, though not in a pace as fast as last year," said Dai. "So
the pressure for RMB to further appreciate is declining, but it is
certain that yuan will not depreciate."
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asian is currently showing
signs of subsiding, said the Chinese top banker."I believe that in
one or two years the economy in Southeast Asia will recover and
reembark on the road of development."

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Delta to be Attractive Investment Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River Delta in Shandong
Province, east China, is expected to become another new investment
zone in the country, according to a deputy to the National
People's Congress, in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Shi Jun, mayor of Dongying City, Shandong Province, said
Shandong is making plans to boost the development of the delta
area and the central government is very interested in the project.
</P>
<P>
Shi said, of the country's three famous delta areas created
respectively by the Pearl River, the Yangtze and the Yellow River,
only the Yellow River Delta area remains to be exploited on a
massive scale. The other two have achieved rapid economic growth
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the Yellow River Delta area has China's second largest
oil field, the Shengli, and half of the area is still waste land,
which can be turned into fertile fields.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, the delta's development has a strong appeal
for international organizations; the central and provincial
governments have put the delta's development on their agendas as a
priority item; and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
has decided to support the delta's development as its priority
project in China in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the delta has become one of the
country's key bases for agricultural development. Dongying City in
the delta has been approved by the central government to be a
coastal economic development zone, enjoying preferential policies
from the state. Shandong Province has massive plans to build the
area into major production bases for energy, chemicals, farm
products and aquatic products, according to Shi.

<HEADLINE> Mayor of Shenzhen on Necessity of Planned Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The eight percent economic growth
rate for China's national economy in 1998 as proposed by the
government is "necessary" and "possible," according to Li Zibin,
mayor of Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
In China with a big population, ten million people enter the
labor market each year. With slower growth, employment will become
difficult and the society will not be stable, said the mayor who is
in Beijing attending the National People's Congress as a deputy to
the country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Without a certain speed of growth, revenues and expenditures
will be hard to balance, nor can increasing material and cultural
needs of the people be met, he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is driven by three factors, namely investment
in fixed assets, consumer demand and exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, investment in fixed assets
has constituted half of the driving force behind China's high
economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This year planned investment in fixed assets will increase by
10 percent over last year, providing a guarantee for a right
economic growth rate," Li Zibin said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that investment should be channeled mainly into
five areas: farming-related projects, infrastructure and energy,
high-tech industries, residential housing and technical upgrading
of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In cities and towns, reform aimed at commercializing
residential housing is expected to make real estate development a
new growth area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should study the rural market with a view to
providing more marketable goods to farmers. In the meantime,
farmers should be assisted to raise their income and have less
burden so that the rural market can be activated.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difficulty lies in export, and solutions in this
regard must be worked out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Shezhen was made a special economic zone in 1980, it has
had stunning growth economically, with its GDP having increased
from 196 million yuan in 1979 to 113 billion yuan (13.6 billion US
dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The city has set its economic growth rate at 14 percent for
this year, the highest among 35 major cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the special economic zone exported 25.5 billion US
dollars worth of goods, 14 percent of the national total, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can feel the heavy responsibility," the mayor said. "We
will do our utmost to contribute to fulfilling the national
eight-percent growth goal."
</P>
<P>
The eight-percent economic growth rate for China's national
economy in 1998 was proposed by Premier Li Peng in his government
work report he delivered last Thursday at the opening session of
the National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Faces Huge Budget Deficit, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait may face the second
largest budget deficit since Gulf war in 1998-99 fiscal year if no
action was taken to rectify the steep decline of oil prices, a
report by a governmental economic consultant agency said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shall Economic Consultants said in its weekly economic
report released Friday said that the budget deficit for the fiscal
year 1998-99 (July 1 to June 30) is expected to exceed the 2
billion Kuwait Dinars (6.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This will be the highest after the 5.349 billion dinars (17.65
billion U.S. dollars) deficit registered in 1990-91 fiscal year
when Kuwait has to pay the cost of liberation from Iraqi
occupation.
</P>
<P>
The report said that initial information indicate that public
expenditures may reach 5.19 billion dinars (17.12 billion
U.S. dollars) against 3.127 billion dinars (10.3 million
U.S. dollars) in revenues, leaving a deficit of 2.063 billion
dinars (6.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Unofficial figures showed Friday that in fiscal year ending
June 1997, Kuwait posted a budget surplus of 502 million dinars
(about 1657 million U.S. dollars) for the first time in 15 years,
mainly as a result of higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the Kuwaiti revenues are from oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was granted a new production quota of 2.19 million
barrels per day from 2.0 million barrels per day during the first
half of 1998 under a new OPEC output ceiling agreed last year.
</P>
<P>
But an anticipated increase in revenue was not resulted
because of a steady fall in oil prices over the past four months
to their lowest in four years and it is expected Kuwait GDP would
slow down this year resulted from over production of some OPEC
member countries and bad economic situation in Asia which imports
about half of Kuwait's oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shall expressed pessimism about the possibility of reaching
an agreement among OPEC members in the near future to stop the
decline in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
It did not expect OPEC to hold an emergency meeting in the
near future, suggesting that the current situation should be
allowed to continue for another two months or until the oil
prices drop below 10 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's current oil exports sales in the world market is at
10 to 11 U.S. dollars a barrel comparing with a 16 U.S. dollars
high last year when the world oil market saw an average prices of
21 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait government bodies were recently asked to reduce their
expenditures by 25 percent in the remaining period of the fiscal
year 1997-98 due to the drop of oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Oil Minister Issa Al-Mazidi Friday called on fellow
OPEC member Venezuela and other OPEC over-produces to cooperate
with the rest of the cartel to help turn round the slump of world
oil markets.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the prices would rally and settle at a just and fair
level for both producers and consumers.

HANOI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam lost their third foreign
coach in two years after Colin Murphy resigned from the position,
an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who is currently holidaying in Britain, resigned for
"personal reasons," the federation official said.
</P>
<P>
"His contract expired in November. The two sides were unable to

Trade union daily Lao Dong said Saturday that Murphy had asked
for 7,000 dollars a month in his new contract but that the
federation would have rejected it.

</P>
<P>
They had complained of lack of cooperation from the
authorities, poor living and working conditions.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM in Norway for Mideast Deadlock Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was in Oslo today in the hope that Norway, who brokered
the landmark Middle East peace accords in 1993, can help put the
stalled peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, who met the
Israeli premier, said Norway was prepared to help revitalize peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we are here indicates that we have not given up
on Oslo," Netanyahu said after arriving at Oslo's international
airport.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he will discuss with the Norwegians the opening
of the Palestinian airport and an industrial park in Gaza, the
settlements and the reinitiation of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The now deadlocked Oslo accords were signed after a string of
secret talks hosted in Norway in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The accords, which entailed mutual recognition between Israel
and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, established a
detailed timetable for Israel's disengagement from occupied
territories and stipulated that a permanent settlement of the
Palestinian question be in place by December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will meet Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek on
Saturday. Earlier, Vollebaek told Norwegian NRK radio he did not
expect any breakthrough in the peace process during Netanyahu's
visit.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who has made stops in Spain and Germany, will travel
to London on Sunday.

Moreover, many deputies are unanimous in their view that China
had stood the test of the Southeast Asian financial crisis and the
global financial turmoil arising thereafter, thus contributing to
the regional economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi said, "The achievements made in the
past five years prove that the Party Central Committee is capable
of seizing the overall situation in spite of the rapidly changing
domestic and international situation."
</P>
<P>
The government work report has made a penetrating analysis of
problems that have cropped up in the country's reform and
opening-up, according to many deputies. All this suggests that
China's leading body is sober-minded, bold and resolute in their
work internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
One of them is Yan Haiwang, provincial Party secretary of
northwestern Gansu province. Yan is quoted as saying that China's
difficulties can be surmounted and all problems be overcome on the
way forward, as long as the whole Party and the entire people have
a clear understanding of the country's situation.

"Managing Well Large Enterprises While Adopting a Flexible
Policy Toward Small Ones"
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation for
the term "Managing Well Large Enterprises While Adopting a
Flexible Policy Toward Small Ones" mentioned in Chinese Premier Li
Peng's government work report to the Ninth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Managing Well Large Enterprises While Adopting a Flexible
Policy Toward Small Ones" are two important measures adopted by
the Chinese government to put forward the reform of state-owned
enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
It means that the state will concentrate on managing well large
state-owned enterprises or enterprise groups and loosen control of
smaller ones in a bid to improve their vitality.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese Government announced that large
state-owned enterprises were the backbone of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The state has given priority to boosting development of
1,000 large state-owned enterprises while relaxing control of
240,000 smaller ones with an aim to let them to survive in market
competition.
</P>
<P>
The state encourages small enterprises to experiment with all
forms of management and organization that reflect the law of
social production and invigorate enterprises. The joint stock
system and joint stock partnerships have been introduced on a
trial basis in various parts of the country to invigorate the
national economy.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Association Between Strong Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a kind of merger in nature. But the two or more parties
involved don't work for the aim of annihilation. Large scale
industrial and commercial enterprises, which have connections in
production, carry out effective annexation in a bid to take each
other's strength, increase product varieties and accumulate more
assets.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages the association between
strong enterprises, describing this form of assets reorganization
an effective way to the development of state-owned enterprises.
It is conducive to capital operation, development on a large
scale and improvement of state-owned enterprises'
competitiveness on world market and rational readjustment of
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin stated, in his report at the 15th
national congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), "By using
capital as the bonds and rely on the market forces, we shall
establish highly competitive large enterprise groups with
trans-regional, inter-trade, cross-ownership and trans-national
operations."
</P>
<P>
Association between strong enterprises is undoubtedly
beneficial to the formation of large enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government stresses that the merger and
reorganization must keep to the market-oriented principle.

<HEADLINE> Observation of NPC &AMP; CPPCC: Central Authorities' Ability of Commanding Overall Situation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Central collective leadership is
fully capable of commending the overall situation in China and
leading the people across the country to attain its cross-century
blueprint for development.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached by deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) First Session in their panel discussions
on Premier Li Peng's government work report delivered on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the previous successful and fruitful five-year term, they
cited it as an "extraordinary period", which have laid a solid
foundation for accomplishing the goals set for China's Ninth
Five-Year Plan and its long-range development objective for the
year 2010" and said it would be recorded in the annals of the
Chinese history".
</P>
<P>
Deputies from across China attributed the decisive factor for
China's successes during this period to the correct leadership of
the Party Central Committee and the State Council and their
capability to commend the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
Tian Chengping, secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party
Committee, noted that the achievements scored over the past five
years, especially a number of big events occurred in 1997, show
the policy decisions made by the central authorities headed by
Jiang Zemin are correct. It proves to be a matured, staunch and
prestigious collective leadership.
</P>
<P>
Whether China's reform will be successful in the years ahead
hinges upon the correctly handling of relationship among reforms,
development and stability, said Wang Tao, a deputy from China's
northernmost Heilongjiang Province, who is also a senior adviser
of the China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Lin Qinglin, secretary of the Hainan CPC Provincial Committee,
acknowledged that China maintained a "high growth rate" and "low
inflation" with a "soft landing". The reason behind the success
should go to the farsightedness of the Party Central Committee as
well as matroeconomic control policies it has introduced to China's
economic field.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Provincial Governor Shu Shengyou, Jiangsu Provincial
Party Secretary Chen Huanyou and a number of other deputies hold
that the third generation of the central collective leadership
acquired a deep understanding of China's specific conditions,
successfully experimented with Deng Xiaoping Theory and gained an
initiative in acute competitions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation for
the term "further progress under stable conditions" mentioned in
Premier Li Peng's government work report to the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Further Progress under stable conditions" is a principle
policy adopted by the Chinese government in formulating
macro-economic policies over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The Central Economic Conference, held at the end of 1997,
stated that China would continue to implement the principle of
"Further progress under stable conditions" in the economic field
this year.
</P>
<P>
Stabilization refers to practising a moderately tight financial
and monetary policy, curtailing inflation, promoting
agricultural development, preventing and eliminating financial
risks, promoting social security system and maintaining a
macro-economic and social environment.
</P>
<P>
To achieve an advancement, China must make a breakthrough in
the reforms of state-owned enterprises, financial systems and
other aspects.
</P>
<P>
The country will make progress in economic restructuring,
draw up measures to solve key social problems, raise the level
of opening to the outside world and improve the quality and
efficiency of the national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
On the premise that China is to maintain a fairly rapid
economic growth. Stabilization and advancement completement and
promote each other.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation for
the term "Large and all-inclusive, small and all-inclusive"
mentioned in Premier Li Peng's government work report to the Ninth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Under China's planned economic system in the past, all
localities blindly sought to build an industrial structure that
is inclusive of all products, and all businesses sought to have
the capability to perform all social functions.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this practice, much investment was put into
similar projects and facilities unnecessarily, resulting in a
serious waste of resources and funds.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered at the Fifth Session
 of the Eighth National People's Congress, Premier Li Peng suggested
that greater efforts be made to adjust the industrial structure
to solve this long-standing problem.

BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand received in January
703,741 tourists from all over the world, who brought to the
country about 26 billion baht (604 million US dollars), the Nation
newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite a significant drop in tourist arrivals from South
Korea, Indonesia and Japan, the number of tourists visiting the
country in January jumped by 13.62 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
More tourists from Eastern Europe and the Middle East should be
attributed to the sharp rise.
</P>
<P>
The government has projected a seven percent growth in tourist
arrivals this year, or a total of 7.72 million. It also expects
that spending per person will rise due to the weakness of the
baht.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Economic and Social Development
Board, this year's target is to generate 272 billion baht (6.05
billion US dollars), up from last year's 233 billion baht (5.2
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Stops Deforestation: Government Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica has eventually stopped
its deforestation process after years of efforts, a government
report published on Friday showed.
</P>
<P>
The report said the success should be contributed to the
nation's environmental policy adopted in 1997, which, instead of
promoting deforestation for agricultural development, sought to
control lumbering and create new ways to protect forests through
economic means.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the policy reversed the deep-rooted practice that
banks did not accept lands of forest as a security for loans.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50,000 hectares of forests in Costa Rica were cut
every year in the 19870s. But since then, lumbering started to
decrease and came to a halt in 1997 after 10 years of efforts in
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
Satellite maps show that forests now cover 40 percent of the
country, a figure well above the 10 percent average for other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has also launched an international program, seeking
funds to preserve its forests. It has joined other wooded
countries to seek compensations from big atmosphere polluters
since forests are major absorbent of gases that cause the hothouse
effect.

<HEADLINE> Albright in Italy for Talks on Iraq, Balkan Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright started an official visit to Italy Friday for talks with
Italian leaders on bilateral relations and issues of Iraq, the
Balkans and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival at the Ciampino airport, Albright said
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his government hope to find out
the full truth about the February-3 cable car tragedy in northern
Italy as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Albright met with Italian President Oscar Scalfaro later in the
day, but details about their talks are not immediately known. She
will meet with other Italian leaders on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, a U.S. Marine aircraft -- EA-6B surveillance
plane -- sliced a cable car line near Cavalese, killing all 20
people on board.
</P>
<P>
The incident strained relations between Washington and Rome.
"But we are allies. We have responsibilities to each other.
That's why our troops have been here with Italy's permission for
so many years," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
She added that Washington will do everything to find out the
full truth and ensure nothing similar will happen again.
</P>
<P>
Just few hours after Albright landed here, Francesca Trombino,
attorney for U.S. colonel Richard Muegge, the commander of the
EA-6B plane, was hammered to death by an unidentified man near her
office.
</P>
<P>
But police are not sure whether Trombino's death is linked with
the cable car tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Solution to Plane Deal Expected During PM's Visit </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Solution to the dead-locked deal
of Thailand's purchase of eight F/A 18 jet fighters from the
United States is expected to be settled during Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai's visit to the US next week, the Bangkok Post quoted
a senior official as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said that Thai and
US officials agreed in preparatory talks in Washington earlier
this week that "there must be a solution to the issue."
</P>
<P>
Officials offered three options for the five F/A jet fighters:
finding a third country to buy the planes, extending period of
payment or having the US take the planes back for the use of its
own armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Cash-strapped Thailand can no longer afford to spend some 18
billion baht (409 million US dollars) on the eight fighter planes
it earlier ordered.
</P>
<P>
The pentagon had made clear that the matter would have to be
discussed by Prime Minister Chuan, who is also defense minister of
Thailand, and President Clinton during their meeting scheduled for
March 13.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to lift Foreign Exchange Volatility Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will heed
the suggestion of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to allow
the peso to float more freely against the dollar at the spot
market by lifting the volatility band.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a memorandum of economic and financial
policies forged between the Philippine government and the IMF, the
Manila Standard newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the memorandum set conditions for the
country's 1.8 billion dollar standby credit arrangement with the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the Philippine government will eliminate
the volatility band entirely soon to "improve the function of the
interbank foreign exchange market."
</P>
<P>
The Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP), the owner and
operator of the Philippines' electronic foreign exchange market,
already expressed openness to the proposal, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the allowable daily fluctuation of the peso against
the dollar at the foreign exchange market has been placed at six
percent of the weighted afternoon average of the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The volatility band was first introduced in 1994 to shield the
local currency from wild market swings. The band was scrapped
after the central bank devalued the peso last July, but was
re-imposed last October to prevent the fast depreciation of the
local currency.
</P>
<P>
BAP earlier opposed moves to lift the band, saying it has been
serving its purpose given the abnormal market conditions.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, the Philippine currency has appreciated
from 45 pesos against the dollar to 40 pesos to the greenback.

<HEADLINE> Thai Prime Minister to Holds Talks with Soros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
is scheduled to hold talks with international financier George
Soros in New York, Saturday's Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said Friday that
Soros "will be one of the 300 businessmen to dine with the prime
minister in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations."
</P>
<P>
An informed source said that after the dinner, Chuan will meet
Soros to exchange views on the Asian economic crisis as well as
talk about opportunities to invest in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The source, who refused to be named, said Soros has expressed
appreciation of the Chuan government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan is expected to pay an official visit to
the United States between March 11 to 17, during which he will
hold talks with US President Bill Clinton and travel to New York
and Los Angeles to meet US businessmen as well as Thai nationals.
</P>
<P>
Soros, who is chief executive of the Quantum Fund, has been
blamed by some ASEAN politicians for sparking Asia's crisis by
speculating on regional currencies and stampeding investors into a
sell-off.
</P>
<P>
Media reports in Bangkok on Wednesday said Soros was
considering investing in Thailand by pumping 650 million dollars
into the country's Nakornthai Strip Mill Plc.
</P>
<P>
He had already bought a five-percent stake in the Thai
electronics company GSS Array Technology Plc. last week.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Banking Reforms Underway, Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Banking reforms are now in full
swing in East Asia, where many banks, besieged with increasing
non-performing loans or huge debts, are struggling for their
survival.
</P>
<P>
The reform process started eight months ago, when the region
was hit by a financial crisis, the worst in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
During the past months, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia and the Philippines have taken drastic measures to reform
their banking sector, including take-overs, forced closures and
mergers of troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
However, problems in the banking sector are so deep that the
on-going reforms are expected to meet formidable challenges,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
No doubt, the banking sector has played a very important role
in East Asia's fast economic growth in the last two decades. But
mis-management and poor banking regulations in some countries have
resulted in a mountain of non-performing loans and foreign debts,
threatening the normal operation of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
In most of Southeast Asian countries and South Korea,
non-performing loans accounted for around 20 percent of total bank
loans, and East Asian banks, excluding Japanese banks, have owed
171 billion US dollars to international banks by last July.
</P>
<P>
As the eight-month-old financial crisis is still lingering in
the region, the situation in the banking sector may get even worse
this year with the rising of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, analysts said, bad bank loans may rise to more
than 25 percent of total lending by 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the banking reforms, East Asian countries have
closed or taken over some banks whose liabilities far outweighed
their assets to prevent new financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Following Indonesia's closure of 16 commercial banks and
Thailand's 56 financial firms last year, South Korea shut 10
merchant banks in January.
</P>
<P>
In February, the Thai central bank seized control of two
mid-sized banks, First Bangkok City Bank PCL, and Siam City Bank
PCL, leaving five of the country's 15 banks under government
ownership.
</P>
<P>
As banks are pillars of national economies, East Asian
governments cannot close all banks in trouble and have to bail out
most of them.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, the bailout has proved costly and would
become a heavy financial burden for governments.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand said last week that it has spent 25.46
billion dollars since Mid-1996 to prop up troubled financial
institutions, but a large proportion of that money is expected to
be unrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
By secretly spending an amount greater than last year's
government budget to keep the Thai financial system afloat, the
central bank drained the nation's resources. New tax increases
will be necessary to pay for the lending, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that unless the governments inject public
money into the financial system, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand
will face the prospect of a prolonged credit crunch, tight
liquidity, bank runs and lack of confidence in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the weakness of the banking system, East Asian
governments have ordered bank recapitalizations to consolidate the
banking sector either though mergers or injection of new financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, five private banks merged into one in January
with new assets of 5.9 billion dollars. By June this year, 50
banks in the country are expected to be merged into 12 banks,
banking sources said. In Malaysia, 40 financial companies were
ordered to merge with each other and the merger deals must be
finalized by March 31.
</P>
<P>
But the recapitalization also needs government support and the
bill is huge, economists said. They estimated that the
recapitalization plan will cost Thailand 15 billion to 25 billion
dollars, and South Korea 34 billion to 54 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As part of the banking reforms and a way of seeking financial
resources to enhance the sector, Thailand has recently revoked
laws barring foreigners from owing majority stakes in banks, and
foreign investors can now buy majority voting shares in its 91
financial companies, including the 56 closed last December, and 15
commercial banks. Indonesia has also decided to allow 100 percent
foreign ownership of its banks.
</P>
<P>
All these reform moves taken by East Asian countries will
surely help put their house in order, but the recovery of the
banking sector may take several years because of the scale of
problems, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Encourages More Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Governments of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to relax the entry
regulations in the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) scheme to
allow the entry of prospective foreign investors in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Bulletin newspaper Saturday quoted Melito Salazar,
Philippines' trade and industry under-secretary, as saying that
the entry rule was relaxed last week after ASEAN members adopted a
pre-investment approval scheme at the request of the United States
ASEAN Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the AICO scheme only allows the participation of firms
already operating and organized in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
But now, Salazar said, a prospective ASEAN investor or a
foreign company planning to invest in ASEAN can apply for an AICO
arrangement in advance subject to certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
These conditions include a one-year time frame in which the
prospective investor is expected to file his application for the
AICO project, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said that at present only 15 applications for the
region are being processed with only Volvo and Sunden Corp.
receiving green light.
</P>
<P>
Volvo plans to establish an assembly plant in Thailand, while
information technology company Sunden Corp. wants to set a base in
Thailand and Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A protracted drought in the
Amazonian region of Brazil has killed thousands of cattle,
Brazilian official sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the drought has also caused water supply
problems to the population of several places in the state of
Roraima, in the north of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Roraima state Agriculture Ministry reported that the state
has already registered the death of 12,000 heads of cattle because
of the longest ever drought in the Amazonian region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said 300 to 400 heads of cattle die every day of
thirst and hunger.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian state of Roraima, bordering Venezuela, has a herd
of approximately 400,000 heads of cattle.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the inhabitants of the Paracaima
municipality, about 220 kilometers from the city of Boa Vista, the
capital of the state, are supplied by tank trucks with water
brought from Santa Elena de Uairen, in the south of Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Efes Beats Cibona in Euro Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Efes roared back from a 12-point
deficit to beat Cibona Zagreb in their European Cup quarter-final
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Efes went through as it also won the first leg in front of its
fanatical home crowd 75-59.
</P>
<P>
Cibona built a healthy 40-28 lead in the first half after
leading by as much as 14 poitns thanks to some good defending and
long range shooting.
</P>
<P>
Efes came back strongly in the second half, starting 8-0.
Their top scorer with 26 points, Ufuk Sarica, dominated this part
of the game, keeping the Istanbul team in touch with Cibona.
</P>
<P>
Some sloppy attacking cost Cibona dearly towards the end of the
regular play, with Efes' American forward Brain Howard sinking one
of his two free throws for a 65-65 tie and the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
Efes' playmaker, diminutive Macedonian Petar Naumoski, stepped
in to take charge but his counterpart, Damir Mulaomerovic, scored
three points seconds from time for 76-76 and the second overtime.
</P>
<P>
Efes again built a four-point lead but young Cibona centre
Sandro Nicevic, coming from the bench for fouled-out veteran
Dzevad Alihodzic, equalised from the free-throw line for 85-85,
missing a chance to seal the game in the final second.
</P>
<P>
By the time the game entered the third overtime, Efes had their
best players Naumoski and Sarica sidelined for collecting five
fouls each but Cibona failed to capitalise.
</P>
<P>
Murat Evlyaoglu took control by scoring important points,
including a three-point jumper from seven metres for a six-point
lead that destroyed Cibona's hopes.
</P>
<P>
Cibona's American pointguard Kenneth Atkins scored on the break
to bring his team within reach at 98-100 with some 10 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
He then grabbed the ball under the basket just as it was thrown
back into the field, but then missed an easy lay-up for the
equaliser.
</P>
<P>
The Turks broke away and centre Mirsad Turkcan slam-dunked
unchallenged for the final 102-98 and a place in the
quarterfinals.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area in China's
Shanghai has worked out methods to get more investment to fill the
gap in capital in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Pudong expects to need 240 billion yuan by the year 2000, but
only 180 billion yuan has been made sure, leaving a gap of 60
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will decrease the price of land and houses in
the area to help investors hold down production costs. Large
projects and high-tech projects will be the first beneficiaries of
the measure.
</P>
<P>
Unreasonable fees will also be stopped with more stringent
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Domestic companies from other parts of the country that have
not enjoyed the same policies as their Shanghai counterparts in
loans and foreign trade, will be encourage to settle in the area,
which promises to solve these problems one by one.
</P>
<P>
After seven years of work, the Pudong New Area has taken shape
in Shanghai, and 4,900 foreign-funded projects have been approved,
backed by 15 billion US dollars of contractual foreign
investment.

<P>
HELSINKI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were killed and 36
seriously injured on Friday when a train derailed in central
Finland, the worst train crash in the country's history.
</P>

NANNING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China had 111,000 km of inland
waterways by 1997, with 50 deepwater berths, and 260,000 boats
handling 22 million tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, about 1,740 kilometers of inland
waterways were improved, 31 major berths added, and handling
capacity increased by 10.95 million tons, while 850 million tons
of goods were shipped in 1997, 16.4 percent more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A supervisory system was established on the Suzhou river, a
part of the Sunan Canal in Jiangsu Province, for the first time in
the construction history of China's canals.
</P>
<P>
China has also put more money into inland waterway
construction, and the Ministry of Communications has set up an
inland waterway shipping fund, while central and local governments
have spent 6.13 billion yuan on it for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
China will construct 20 waterways with a total length of 15,000
km, along with berths and guarantee facilities. The state will
make all key inland waterways navigable in 30 years.

His latest memory about the crash in the mid-night of August
31, 1997, in the Alma tunnel is that the Mercedes which was
carrying Diana, Dodi Al-Fayed and himself was pursued by two cars
and one motorcycle after they left the Hotel Ritz, and that Diana
called the name of Dodi after the crash.

<HEADLINE> China Awaits Word on Temple of Heaven's Inclusion on UNESCO List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Temple of Heaven, considered
China's largest and best-preserved royal family altar, has
retained its style and ancient charm because of the Chinese
government's efforts to protect the historic site.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has officially applied to the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
for the altar's inclusion on its World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
Located in the southern part of Beijing, the Temple of Heaven
used to serve as a place for the emperors of the Ming (1368-1644)
and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties to worship heaven and pray for a
good harvest.
</P>
<P>
Worshiping Heaven, a traditional rite to offer sacrifices to
heaven, was conducted by Chinese emperors to consolidate their
rein, because they regarded themselves as sons of heaven.
</P>
<P>
The sacrifices were abolished by the government of the Republic
of China. The Temple of Heaven became a historic site and was
opened to the public as a park in 1918.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
ancient structures in the Temple of Heaven have all received
additional protection. The State Council listed the temple as a
historic place of interest under state protection in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Beijing municipal government has allocated
special funds for maintenance of the temple on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhichang, a senior engineer with the Temple of Heaven, said
the temple contains ideology on traditional Chinese morphology,
and represents the highest level of construction for a sacrificial
altar in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The name, location, overall arrangements, design and color of
the Temple of Heaven all reflect the understanding and aesthetic
conceptions of the Chinese nation accumulated for 1,000 years, Xu
said.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Province To Build Energy-Storing Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province plans
to invest 5.5 billion yuan (about 670 million US dollars) to
construct a large energy efficient power station in the scenic
Mount Taishan Valley.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which will feature four turbogenerator units rated
at 200,000 kw each, is designed to use excess energy by pumping
water from the lower to the upper reservoir. Excess water stored
in the upper reservoir will flow through turbines to the lower
reservoir to generate ample power when needed.
</P>
<P>
Shandong currently has a total generating capacity of 16.5
million kw, with the gap between peak and low demand standing at
four million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Heavy losses result from the fact that generating units have to
be deactivated during periods of low demand. However, the new
energy efficient station is designed to ensure the overall
operation of the local power network.
</P>
<P>
Shandong currently ranks second amongst the nation's provinces
in terms of power generation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Expected To Be Largest Construction Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will become the largest
construction market in Asia and even in the world within a few
years, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's rate of investment has increased rapidly in recent
years, with investment in fixed assets totaling more than 390
billion yuan in the 1991-1995 period, more than three times the
figure for the 1986-1990 period, experts said in a research report.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will invest another 1.6 trillion yuan in fixed assets
during the 1996-2000 period, triple the previous five years,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Based on these calculations, Shanghai would be the largest
construction market in Asia and even in the world.
</P>
<P>
Urban transportation-related infrastructure construction will
be a major part of the market. Major projects include the subway
system, ring roads, cross-river projects, an international airport
and deep-water harbors.
</P>
<P>
Housing is another boom area of the Shanghai construction
market, as the municipality plans to build 50 million square
meters of housing in the 1996-2000 period, with total investment
estimated at more than 150 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Investment in renovating the inner city and developing tourism
as well as commercial and cultural facilities will also be great,
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the construction market will be bolstered by
industrial restructuring, technical renovation, relocating
factories away from the downtown area and the development of
high-technology industries and new industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area, a rising finance and trade zone separated
from downtown Shanghai by the Huangpujiang River, is expected to
contribute a great deal to the boom, as its construction
investment accounts for 30 percent of the municipality's total.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the Shanghai construction market is so
huge that competition will increase among domestic and foreign
construction companies.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Urges More Female Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the European
Union (EU) must take necessary steps to boost women's employment
and address the reasons behind higher women's unemployment, an EU
official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, European commissioner for employment and social
affairs, made the remark Friday in Brussels at a celebration of
International Women's Day which falls on March 8.
</P>
<P>
He said that women had accounted for the entire growth of the
EU's workforce over the last 10 to 15 years and their employment
had risen from only 54 percent of that of men in 1975 to over 70
percent at present.
</P>
<P>
"If we think about how Europe's working population is set to
diminish in the near future as the greying of the population takes
place, we begin to see just how important women's participation is
to our future prosperity," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Jobs Summit, which was held in Luxembourg
in November 1997, and its Employment Guidelines had set a clear
policy line of promoting equal opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the 15 member states to take necessary measures to
increase the employment rate of EU women and to investigate the
reasons for higher women's unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"They have signed up to do more about reconciling work and
family life. They have agreed to raise the level of care
provision. They are committed to addressing the particular
problems faced by women returning to work after an absence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the theme of the 1998 Women's Day, the campaign in
favor of the women in Kabul, Flynn said, "The denial of the human
rights of Afghan women and girls is absolute and it is appalling."
</P>
<P>
"The brave Afghan women who have sought to oppose and highlight
injustice deserve all our support. We must make their cause our
cause," the commissioner said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Presses for More Funds to Troops in Bosnia, Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen pressed the administration's case Friday for 1.85
billion U.S. dollars in emergency money to help maintain U.S.
forces in both the Gulf and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, testifying before the Senate Appropriation Committee,
Cohen and General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, ran into congressional skepticism over the price and
duration of both missions.
</P>
<P>
Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the senior Democrat in
the committee, complained of what he called an "open-ended"
operation in Bosnia and a do-it-alone strategy in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Byrd criticized the administration for telling Congress the
troops would be home by June 30, and then breaking its promise.
"To put it charitably, the administration was being very
disingenuous," Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told the committee there were now about 34,000 U.S.
troops in the Gulf, most of them on ships. "We intend to keep that
level of force there as long as necessary," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
On Bosnia, Cohen conceded that the administration would not be
able to bring troops home by June 1 as it had earlier promised.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to fix an end date as such," he said. However, he
said that U.S. troops in Bosnia would be reduced from the current
8,500 to about 6,900.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many positive things had been achieved in Bosnia,
including an improving economy, the surrender of indicted war
criminals, the return of refugees and a reduction of rival
soldiers in the field.

<HEADLINE> Diana's Bodyguard Reveals Nothing New to French Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard of
late Princess Diana, revealed nothing new during Friday's hearing
with French judge Herve Stephan.
</P>
<P>
Rees-Jones only confirmed what he told the British tabloid
"Mirror" a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
His latest memory about the crash in the mid-night of August
31, 1997, in the Alma tunnel is that the Mercedes which was
carrying Diana, Dodi Al-Fayed and himself was pursued by two cars
and one motorcycle after they left the Hotel Ritz, and that Diana
called the name of Dodi after the crash.
</P>
<P>
But he told the judge that memory about the crash was coming
back to him little by little.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer of Rees-Jones, Christian Curtil, said after the
one-hour hearing at the Palace of Justice in Paris that his client
confirmed the content of the interview published by "the Mirror"",
although it was not he himself who sought to publish the story.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Rees-Jones said the British embassy in Paris
was in charge of the security of Rees-Jones when he travelled this
time from London to have the hearing, the fourth summoned by judge
Herve Stephan.
</P>
<P>
When he had his last hearing in Paris in December, Rees-Jones
was protected by the Hotel Ritz, owned by the Al-Fayed family.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Al-Fayed, the father of Dodi Al-Fayed, told the British
press recently that he was almost sure that Diana was killed in a
conspiracy.

<HEADLINE> Blair Defends Economic Policy, Welfare Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Friday his Labor party is both the "party of economic
competence and the defender of the welfare state."
</P>
<P>
In his speech to Labor's Scottish conference, Blair said
economic strength was the key to securing a second term.
</P>
<P>
The message comes less than a fortnight before what Blair said
would be a "Budget of confidence".
</P>
<P>
"It will push forward reform of the welfare state by the
promotion of work and independence because New Labor, not the
Tories is the party of enterprise today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country now has the best chance for generations to
secure real long-term economic strength. "But it can't be done
unless we take a tight grip on public spending, unless we take
tough decisions needed to secure stability and compete with the
rest of the world. "
</P>
<P>
Blair said sound economics did not have to compete with his
party's obligation to fund the benefits and health system.
</P>
<P>
"We are the party of the welfare state," he said. "I will never
turn my back on the sick, disabled and those unable to look after
themselves."
</P>
<P>
He repeated his case for thorough reform of the system to get
the support to people most in need.
</P>
<P>
"The true mark of obligation to the welfare state lies in the
absolute commitment to ensuring that, from generation to
generation, it is able to serve those who need it more
effectively. That is our commitment," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Grants Aid for Civil Society Development in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Friday approved 5 million
ECUs (some 6 million U.S. dollars) in aid for civil society
development in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Tacis program, which the commission adopted
Friday in Brussels, will provide support to three hey target
groups -- non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media and the
education sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a statement that it would use nearly
half of the aid to strengthen the institutional capacity of
Belarusian NGOs and enhance public awareness of democratic issues
by targeting more than 30 NGOs in the whole Belarusian territory
to develop their capacity through different activities.
</P>
<P>
The media support program aims to address the needs of
independent Belarusian journalists by providing them with training
and know-how designed to strengthen their professional abilities
as well as to open local media to the experiences of counterpart
organizations in other European states.
</P>
<P>
Another program, called the Institutional Twinning Program,
aims to support east-west cooperation of institutes providing
education and training to the younger generations.
</P>
<P>
"The younger generations are the future of Belarus and should
therefore be facilitated in the learning of principles and values
that govern an open democracy," the commission said in the
statement.

<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UNDP Promises Full Potential for Women as Equal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) will continue to take firm actions to
advance and enable women to realize their full potential as equal,
indeed critical, partners in development, UNDP Administrator James
Gustave Speth said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of commemorating International Women's
Day, Speth said this is an opportunity to remind the world that
human rights cannot be attained without the rights of women to
equal employment, education, health and freedom from abuse.
</P>
<P>
Speth said the support for sustainable human development is
directed toward decent living standard and human dignity through
the realization of all human rights -- economic, social, cultural,
civil and political.
</P>
<P>
He said these rights are invisible and ally equally to all, and
they specifically include the right of women everywhere to live in
equal terms with men.
</P>
<P>
The administrator said at UNDP, firm actions have been taken to
advance women throughout ranks, both at the Headquarters and at
the country level, through the introduction of measures to build a
more gender sensitive and enabling work environment.
</P>
<P>
Speth said commitment has also been made to bring gender
consideration into the mainstream of the organization's work at
the Headquarters and where the programs are served.
</P>
<P>
He added he has asked UNDP resident representatives to lend
their support to the preparation of country reports to the
Commission on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.

<HEADLINE> UN Deputy Secretary-General Urges Women to Recommit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette Friday urged women to recommit
themselves to ensure that equal rights of men and women as
enshrined in the United Nations Charter become a reality.
</P>
<P>
Opening a panel discussion at the United Nations headquarters
commemorating International Women's Day, Ms. Frechette said that
the movement of women's rights was one of the momentous in the
history of humankind.
</P>
<P>
She said that the relationship between the non-governmental
organizations and governments was often adversarial and that it
needed not be so.
</P>
<P>
She said achieving the goals of the women's movement required
the building of truly global partnership of solidarity, a
partnership which came alive at the 1993 World Conference on Human
Rights held in Vienna, and the 1995 fourth World Conference on
Women held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this year marked the fifth anniversary of the
Vienna Declaration and Program of Action, Ms. Frechette said human
rights had been a watershed in the recognition of women's rights
as human rights and human rights as women's rights.
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action, the world
saw the first truly comprehensive plan in 12 critical areas of
concern to the advancement of women, said Ms. Frechette.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Invites Syria to Resume Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Friday launched a new appeal to Syria for the resumption
of dialogue and again expressed Israel's readiness to withdraw
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to meet the Syrians around the negotiation table and
find the means to solve this conflict which has last already 50
years," said Mordechai after a meeting with his French counterpart
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel is seeking to re-establish peace and
security in southern Lebanon and to let Lebanese resume control of
that part of territory, in order to "prevent the threat of
terrorism from weighing on Israeli citizens."
</P>
<P>
"When the Lebanese army and government could guarantee the
security in southern Lebanon, we could implement the Resolution
425 of the U.N. Security Council in such a way as envisaging a
redeployment of Israeli troops," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Israel has no choice but to stay in southern
Lebanon and "make order reign" if the threats from terrorism are
not removed.
