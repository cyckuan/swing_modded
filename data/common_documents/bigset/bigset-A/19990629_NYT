FLASH FLOODS HAVE KANSAS CITY GASPING AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As Kansas Citians prepared for work Monday
morning, torrential rain triggered flash flooding, trapping people
in their cars and homes and inundating low-lying streets and
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a matter of hours the rain clouds moved on and the sun
shone brightly as people surveyed the damage.
</P>
<P>
   But the storms might return as soon as tonight, bringing more
rain to already saturated ground. The National Weather Service
forecasts a 40 percent chance of rain tonight and a good chance of
thunderstorms Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 5 inches of rain fell on parts of the city Sunday and
Monday, pushing the year-to-date total to 10.5 inches above normal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike flooding Oct. 4, when 11 persons died, no lives were lost
in Monday's storms. But damage was extensive in both floods. On
Monday, buildings collapsed, sections of interstate were closed,
power was knocked out and people had to be rescued from rising
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. reported about 20,000 customers
were without power Monday morning because of lightning and downed
trees. Service was restored to all but about 2,500 by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On the Missouri side of the state line, a young girl reported
seeing another child swept away by Deer Creek near Castle Drive in
Lake Tapawingo. Searchers from the Central Jackson County Fire
Protection District and the Missouri Water Patrol found a backpack,
tricycle and clothing but concluded the items were carried from the
yards along the creek.
</P>
<P>
   In Blue Springs, a pregnant Kansas City woman was rescued a few
hundred feet from Station No. 2 of the Central Jackson County Fire
Protection District.
</P>
<P>
   Between 8 a.m. and noon, the Kansas City Fire Department
responded to 88 flood-related calls, according to spokesman Brad
Humston. During an average 24 hours, the department handles 130
calls for all types of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Village Green Apartments near Brush Creek and
the Paseo were spared the devastation of October, in which hundreds
were left homeless. But the rain flooded at least six townhouse
basements.
</P>
<P>
   On the Country Club Plaza, the Brush Creek flood control project
worked as designed, containing the water and channeling it
downstream.
</P>
<P>
   In east Kansas City, water converged from three directions on a
low spot near 40th and Oakley streets, overflowing two small street
drains before gurgling over the curbs and into elevated yards. Then
it kept climbing.
</P>
<P>
   James Robertson, who lives on the west side of Oakley, knew
something was wrong when his telephone went dead. As he stepped out
of bed to check the phone, his feet touched water. He looked out
the window and saw his neighbor's white 1985 Monte Carlo floating
south.
</P>
<P>
   Across Oakley, Kathy Newberry was watching the car drift when
she heard a basement window shatter. She opened her basement door
and saw water rushing across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God!'' she exclaimed, aware it was too late to save
childhood photographs she recently had stored there. The water
surged through the window until it filled the basement to within a
foot of the main floor, ruining a freezer, refrigerator and two
washers and dryers.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Robertson, three girls, ages 8, 11, and 12, paged
their parents to return home as water swept into their bedroom,
soaking plush red carpeting installed after the October flood
caused $25,000 damage to the house. The girls didn't know what to
do until an aunt, who lived five houses north, appeared and told
them to follow her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take one wrong step, you float away,'' said 11-year-old
Reeva Ford, who feared she was going to die as her aunt trudged
through the thigh-high water to save her and her two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The aunt, 27-year-old Nikko Ford, had crossed the street in high
water and then clutched trees to keep her balance as she walked to
the girls' home. She had the two older girls lock their arms around
her elbows and held the youngest girl in front of her as they
headed back up the street.
</P>
<P>
   They cried as they waded, unable to swim and afraid of what
might happen if they slipped.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' parents, Catherine and Dana Ford, returned home to a
scene they've witnessed at least five times since 1977. In the
house, water squished from the carpet with every step. Outside,
shovels and other large tools had been swept out of Dana Ford's
work truck and hurled against a neighbor's fence. Mud caked the
truck's seats. The Monte Carlo, purchased just two weeks earlier
for $2,500, was soaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flood insurance doesn't cover your vehicles,'' said Catherine
Ford, who is upset the city had not enlarged the drainage system in
front of her house despite repeated floods at that location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is eventually going to lose their life out here,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst flooding was reported in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters there pulled more than 25 persons from flooded
houses and stalled cars; three buildings collapsed; and
intersections were closed from Kansas 32 in Bonner Springs to
Southwest Boulevard in eastern Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters waded through knee-high water to rescue two persons
from a house in the 1400 block of Washington Boulevard in Kansas
City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is worse than October,'' said a neighbor, Maxine Elmore.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of McBratney Optical Service in the 1400 block of
Minnesota Avenue collapsed after the foundation of the house next
door crumbled against the building.
</P>
<P>
   McBratney employee Linda Fuqua got stuck in high water near 18th
Street and Washington Boulevard, apparently just moments before the
roof of her building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't have gotten stalled, I would have been inside this
building,'' she said. ``Somebody was watching over me.''
</P>
<P>
   High water forced officials to shut down Interstate 35 at 18th
Street and at Interstate 635 from about 9:45 to 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A couple and their dog were rescued by neighbors from their
flooded mobile home in the Woodland Acres mobile home park in
Kansas City, Kan. Rick Mendenhall and Rhonda Aipperspach escaped
through a window into the arms of men secured to utility poles by
ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did what neighbors are supposed to do,'' said one of
the rescuers, who identified himself only as Joe.

REQUIREMENT HAS PARENTS SCRAMBLING TO OBTAIN CHILDREN'S SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARA ROSE WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Every year about this time, parents scramble
to obtain the vaccines their children need to enter school. But the
rush is more intense this year in Missouri, where seventh-graders
cannot enter school this fall without a hepatitis B shot.
</P>
<P>
   Last week more than 200 people showed up at a Blue Springs
church where the Jackson County Health Department established a
satellite clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people who came and saw the line and just left,''
said Win Edwards, Blue Springs middle school nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back later, and there were still lines,'' Edwards
said. ``There are going to be lines and people are going to have to
wait because the law is that there will be zero tolerance. If a
student hasn't got the shots they can't even get through the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas the hepatitis B shot is required this year for entry
into kindergarten, but most children already have received the
vaccination, which has been given to newborns since 1994, said
Rosie Howlett, a nurse with the Unified Government Department of
Health in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas health officials are recommending hepatitis B shots for
children who will be 11 years old on or before Sept. 1. But the
shots won't be required for seventh-graders until next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect some lines but nothing like what is happening in
Missouri,'' Howlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B is a liver ailment spread through blood and other
body fluids. In this country, 300,000 people _ mostly young adults
_ are infected annually, according to the Unified Government
Department of Health. The disease kills 5,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include fatigue, low-grade fever and sometimes
jaundice. The disease spreads most commonly through sexual contact
and intravenous drug use. But infectious-disease experts are
increasingly concerned about teen-agers and hepatitis B because of
the popularity of tattooing and body piercing.
</P>
<P>
   That, in part, is why health officials wanted adolescents to be
vaccinated before they engaged in risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri the vaccination lines are certain to get longer as
the school days approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents usually procrastinate until August and then it is
extremely crazy. The line goes all the way outside, and people get
hot and angry,'' said Bill Schmidt, administrator of the Jackson
County Health Department in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri school districts will admit seventh-graders if they can
show they have had at least one shot in the three-shot hepatitis B
series. But health officials warn that the second shot is due 28
days after the first, and the third shot is due five months later.
Students who don't follow through could be asked not to return to
school until they have been immunized.
</P>
<P>
   ``With somewhere in the neighborhood of 70,000 seventh-graders
in Missouri, we are talking about a lot of kids who have to have
this vaccination,'' said Sue Denny, health program representative
for the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   In the Blue Springs School District alone, 500 to 600 students
still need their first shots. Blue Springs was one of several
districts that did not participate in an in-school immunization
program run by the Mid America Immunization Coalition in Kansas
City and local health departments.
</P>
<P>
   That program was launched in 1995 to curb the spread of
hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kinder, deputy superintendent in Blue Springs, said the
district will participate in the immunization program this year.
</P>
<P>
   But even where in-school immunizations were offered, large
numbers of students were not vaccinated, said Leanne Glenn, a nurse
with the Kansas City Health Department. For example, she said, only
30 percent of the sixth-graders in the Kansas City School District
took advantage of the program.
</P>
<P>
   At local health departments in Missouri the shots are free. But
it could cost as much as $175 for the shots at a private
physician's office. In Kansas the shots cost a small administration
fee that varies from county to county.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Health Department officials and school district nurses
are doing mass mailings that explain the requirement to parents of
seventh-graders. Still, officials are concerned that many children
will show up at school this year without shots.
</P>
<P>
   To head off some of that chaos, some districts are asking for
proof of immunization when students pre-register for classes or
pick up their schedules late in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have to realize it is out of our hands here at
school,'' Edwards said. ``Seventh-graders have to have these
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   For information about immunization clinics, call the city or
county health department in your area.

OFFICIALS CHECKING BACTERIA THAT MADE GIRLS SICK FOR SIGNS OF E.
COLI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN BROOKS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Epidemiologists have re-created in laboratories the elusive bug
that they believe caused severe stomach illness in almost 60
students and instructors who attended a University of North Texas
drill team camp a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although that brings them closer to discovering the origin of
the outbreak, the investigation is far from over, officials said.
On Monday, technicians prepared to send samples for further testing
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bacteria. We don't know his name,'' said David
Bergmire-Sweat, an epidemiologist at the Texas Department of Health
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria has some of the characteristics of E. coli O157:H7,
which killed more than a dozen people on the West Coast six years
ago, but it doesn't appear to be the same one, Bergmire-Sweat said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that state technicians won't be able to isolate it
until they can grow enough of it to survive the trip to Atlanta, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said they suspect it is E. coli, a bacteria
commonly found in healthy humans and animals that when mutated can
cause diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, cramping and related symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our discussions of it, it is a very reasonable
possibility,'' said Paul Mead, a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more stool and blood samples are being collected and
sent to labs at the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   State and Tarrant County health officials said they have
interviewed almost 150 students during the weekend _ both sick and
well _ to try and establish links.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge is that gastrointestinal illnesses are
more common in summer months, said Bob Jones, an epidemiologist at
the Fort Worth Public Health Department, which is aiding the county
and state in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials must differentiate between routine cases and illnesses
associated with the outbreak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure it's significant, as opposed to something
that just normally would be happening anyway,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have identified 58 students and instructors who became
ill after attending a drill team camp June 9-11 at the University
of North Texas in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   Their symptoms include diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting,
dizziness and fever.
</P>
<P>
   One instructor and one student, a 16-year-old Colleyville
Heritage High School drill team member, were hospitalized with
kidney problems.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was in fair condition and on kidney dialysis Monday at
Baylor Medical Center in Dallas. No information was available on
the instructor, who was at Medical City Dallas, health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have not speculated on where the illness
originated. More than 700 students from 36 schools, including some
from Kansas and Oklahoma, attended the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the university has hosted other camps for drill
teams and cheerleaders, and there have been no reports of
illnesses, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli has hundreds of strains that can live in the intestines
of healthy humans or animals. Most don't cause problems until a
mutated strain produces Shiga toxin, named for a Japanese scientist
who isolated the dysentery bacterium in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The toxins cause the severe stomach illness associated with E.
coli bacteria infection.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli, commonly associated with undercooked hamburger meat,
also can be transmitted through unpasteurized juices and unwashed
ground crops such as lettuce and cantaloupes. Food can also be
infected by handlers who do not wash their hands after using the
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli and shigella, a bacilli that also can cause dysentery,
can usually be treated with antibiotics, Jones said. Most of the
drill team members who became sick have recovered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, health officials are receiving scattered reports of family
members who are reporting similar symptoms.

OFFERMAN, RED SOX HAVE A BLAST

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maybe it's time to stop trying to figure out how to
improve these Red Sox. Just sit back and enjoy a rather remarkable
stretch of offense and pitching.
</P>
<P>
   You certainly won't see much better offense than the season-high
21-hit attack that finished off the Chicago White Sox Monday night,
14-1. It was such a treat that most of the 24,616 at Fenway Park
hung around wondering how good this team can be, rather than
worrying about the 1 1/2-game deficit to the Yankees in the
American League East. That comes later. Much later.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be fun to watch Bret Saberhagen pitch well enough to
get his fourth victory and second in a row. Normally, seven innings
of work just isn't enough for the veteran righthander. But when you
throw 60 strikes in 79 pitches and unlease a changeup on
righthanded batters who were praying for a curveball, it's OK to
quit a tad early with an 11-0 lead. Afterall, Pedro Martinez got
the night off after just five innings of a 17-1 rout of Chicago
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Saberhagen has to be pleased with himself,'' said Sox
manager Jimy Williams. ``He was very consistent, around the plate,
changed speeds and out in front of hitters. Saberhagen knows how to
pitch. When you kill bat speed, that is the whole key. He did well
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads you directly to one Jose Offerman, much maligned in
some circles despite the fact he is hitting .301. Offerman had four
hits, including two home runs, and a career-high six RBIs. His
second home run was a seventh-inning grand slam, the first of his
rather interesting career. Sooner or later Red Sox fans will forget
about numbers and accept him as a fine player. His teammates do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose had a wonderful night,'' said Nomar Garciaparra, who had
quite a night himself (4 for 5, two doubles) in improving his
average to .362. ``It's nice to see a teammate come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Offerman, who doesn't say a lot, felt good about Monday
night. The multiple home runs were a career first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exciting game for me,'' said Offerman, who had
entered the game in a 2-for-23 skid. ``I know I was in a slump but
I never gave up. I just kept on working. The grand slam? Yeah, I
can finally say I got one.''
</P>
<P>
   And by doing so, he earned the praise of his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offerman really had a special night,'' said Williams. ``But it
doesn't surprise you because he is a professional hitter. I know he
expects a lot out of himself. I just hope that kind of a game can
jump-start him and get him going again.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox scored 11 runs in four games and lost three of
them. Boston scored victories of 6-1, 17-1 and 14-1 in which it
collected 48 hits. The only loss was a 7-6 slugfest in which the
Red Sox blew a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 hits were the most since the Sox had 24 in a 17-1 loss at
Texas Aug. 5, 1997. The Sox have won 11 of their last 15 games and
are 19-9 against the AL Central. Since Chicago and Boston meet
again this weekend, it will be easy to see if Monday night's
demolition was real or just Memorex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good tonight,'' said Saberhagen when asked about his
performance. ``But I think there is room for improvement. I had a
good changeup. But my curveball was so-so. Fortunately, I think I
recognized it early on and went to the changeup a little bit more
to righthanded hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago helped. They come out swinging. And when you have a
team swinging early, you're going to get more strikeouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen may not be 100 percent happy but his teammates are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's important,'' said Garciaparra. ``But then our whole staff
is important. It's good to have him back and have him healthy out
there. He hasn't missed a beat, which is really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox struck early and never looked back. Singles by Troy
O'Leary, Creighton Gubanich and Darren Lewis highlighted a
three-run surge in the second inning. In the fifth, Offerman hit a
home run off lefthander Mike Sirotka. Boston scored three more runs
in the sixth, in which it sent nine batters to the plate. The Sox
had six singles in the rally _ five after two were out.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's slam in the seventh followed singles by Lou Merloni,
Jason Varitek, and Lewis. Boston capped off the night with three
runs in the eighth.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Dream could be over in Houston.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets have been negotiating an agreement in which Hakeem
Olajuwon, a Houston basketball institution for almost two decades,
would be dealt to the Toronto Raptors for two players and two
first-round draft picks, sources close to the talks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have been talking to Raptors officials for more than
two weeks but had not completed the deal as of late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations, however, became more intense Sunday and Monday and
could lead, sources said, to some slight changes in the offer,
potentially including another draft pick or player.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets officials, citing club policy, refused to comment about
the trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is there will be fewer free agents in the
future under the new collective bargaining agreement,'' a source
close to the trade talks said under the condition of anonymity.
``You can already see more players signed with their teams because
they get more money with their current teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free agency as we once knew it has been curtailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, the Rockets' most successful and celebrated player in
a 15-year career that followed three seasons at the University of
Houston, led the Rockets to NBA championships in 1994 and '95.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is a league moratorium on trades until Aug. 1, the
Raptors would have to select players on the Rockets' behalf during
Wednesday's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets would acquire the Raptors' two first-round
selections, the fifth pick (acquired from Denver) and the 12th pick
(Toronto's own). The Raptors also would send former Rockets
center/forward Kevin Willis and guard/forward Doug Christie to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are under contract for one more season. Because
Toronto would be under the salary cap, it would be able to take on
Olajuwon's $14.3 million salary without precisely matching the
salaries of the players dealt.
</P>
<P>
   Willis played two seasons with the Rockets before he was traded
to Toronto last June for Roy Rogers and two first-round draft picks
(with which the Rockets drafted guard Bryce Drew and forward Mirsad
Turkcan). Willis, 36, averaged 12 points and 8.3 rebounds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Christie, 29, played 3{ seasons for the Lakers and Knicks before
he seemed to blossom in his three full seasons in Toronto. He
averaged 15.2 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 1998 and a
career-best 16.5 points and 5.2 rebounds in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said, however, that the draft choices would be the
primary motivation for making the trade. The No. 5 pick would be
the Rockets' highest draft position since selecting Olajuwon with
the first pick of the 1984 draft. The No. 12 pick also could bring
a top prospect as scouts have described the upper echelon of this
season's draft as 13 players deep.
</P>
<P>
   But by dealing Olajuwon, 36, the Rockets would begin a
rebuilding process in the wake of a disappointing first-round
playoff loss to the Lakers, the team's second consecutive ouster in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also could affect forward Charles Barkley, who is
considering retirement and has said he wanted to return only if he
thought the Rockets were title contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had planned to eventually rebuild around Scottie
Pippen, signed to a five-year, $67 million contract before last
season, with free-agent additions following the expected
retirements of Barkley after next season and of Olajuwon after the
2000-2001 season. But with the changes in the league's collective
bargaining agreement, most of the league's top players have
re-signed with their current teams, rather than wait for free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams have to build differently than they once did,'' a source
said. ``The draft and exceptions will be the main way people will
add to their team because high-priced free agents won't be out
there as much.''
</P>
<P>
   This past season, Olajuwon made a strong comeback from a knee
injury suffered during the 1997-98 season. He averaged 16.4 points
per game in '97-98, his first season averaging fewer than 20 points
per game.
</P>
<P>
   But Olajuwon bounced back to average 18.9 points per game in
1999. He averaged 9.6 rebounds and 2.5 blocked shots. He also
seemed to grow stronger as the season progressed. Over the last
third of the regular season (17 games), he averaged 19.5 points,
10.6 rebounds and 3.2 blocked shots. But he was outplayed by
Shaquille O'Neal in the playoffs, averaging only 13.3 points as the
Lakers won the first-round series 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets honored Olajuwon before the season's last
regular-season home game, May 5, unveiling a plaque in Compaq
Center commemorating his status as the NBA's all-time blocked-shots
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The day before that game, Olajuwon said he considered getting to
play his entire career in Houston and becoming so closely
identified with his adopted hometown an ``ideal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an attachment,'' Olajuwon said. ``I think it's an
ideal situation. How many players get to go to college in one city,
get drafted in that city, play 15 years of his career in that city,
then be part of the group to bring the first championship to the
city? When you look at all the things that have happened, it's all
in the same city.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon helped lead the University of Houston to the NCAA Final
Four in each of his three seasons with the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has been named to the All-NBA first team six times and
is a 12-time All-Star. He started eight All-Star Games (none was
played this season).
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon was the 1993-1994 Most Valuable Player, and was the NBA
Finals MVP in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has been the foundation of this team for 15 years,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said before the season's final
regular-season home game. ``He's had a tremendous influence on my
life and on basketball and this city. He went to college here, and
he won championships here. He was a part of bringing the joy to
this city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have him as your mainstay, a guy of character like
that, it makes things easier. For me, it's made my job so much
easier to have a star like him. We came from a franchise that was
just an also-ran, fair team to one of the models in this league, a
place where people want to be. He's a very, very big reason that's
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments have made the trade more difficult, sources
said. But Monday, time appeared to be running out on sentiment.

MAYBE it's just the aftereffects of all those tamales, burritos and
jalapeos I consumed at the San Antonio Spurs' victory party. A
recurring bad Dream.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least that's what one hopes when word comes that the Rockets
have been negotiating for the better part of two weeks on a deal
that would send Hakeem Olajuwon to Toronto for draft picks and a
pocketful of beans.
</P>
<P>
   One thought on the subject:
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, three more thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   No. No. No.
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you want to continue to peddle that ``we-are-fam-uh-lee''
line of which the Rockets, particularly on the basketball
operations side, are so proud.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you really want the franchise to stand for something
other than a 7 percent increase in the already exorbitant price of
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   If you trade Hakeem, you end the dream, the fantasy, that has
been his truly remarkable 15-year NBA career and our ride to the
most wonderful of places with him. And you become merely another
factory that sells widgets off the loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   You can rationalize away the disloyal act by saying it is being
done in the name of business. And so that, in two years, you can
say you got something in return before Olajuwon walked out the door
into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But what you give up is more than just a player on the downside
of a brilliant career, more than a commodity to be bought, sold or
traded. You have given up a piece of your history, your essence,
your soul. And you don't ever get that back.
</P>
<P>
   Bird was a Celtic, Magic a Laker, Jordan a Bull, Isiah a Piston,
and coach Rudy Tomjanovich was _ and is _ a Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T, more than anybody with a hand near the trigger on this
deal, knows what it means to wear one _ and only one _ uniform for
an entire career. He, in fact, vetoed a trade and retired rather
than play for another team.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of local icons, let's get this straight: Earl Campbell
should never have been a Saint. Nolan Ryan should never have been a
Ranger. And we should all be spared the sight of Hakeem taking that
last Dream Shake in a garish purple uniform with a cartoon dinosaur
on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, as usual, are making no comment whatsoever on a
potential trade. But the phone lines from Canada work both ways,
and it is known that Raptors coach Butch Carter is pushing to close
a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets field phone calls about most all of their players
all of the time. So what's the big news? This time, according to
sources, they are listening, ears pointed in excitement each time
Toronto attempts to tweak the offer.
</P>
<P>
   What they should have done _ and still could do _ is listen and
politely tell the Raptors they can't and won't have any interest.
And it should be Rudy who hangs up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon made Rudy T's career as a coach, giving him the engine
to drive a very basic offense and the linchpin to secure the
defense, not to mention the heart of a champion that has become the
coach's tag line. Without Hakeem, Rudy T doesn't have two
championships on his rsum, doesn't have a house in River Oaks and a
contract that averages $5 million per year, and isn't coaching the
U.S. Olympic Dream Team in Sydney next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Rockets' first-round playoff elimination in May, many
voices in the organization have been whispering that Hakeem no
longer has the drive, the fire, to win. One can only wonder what
they might say about Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   We know Olajuwon is 36 years old and no longer at the peak level
of the 1994 and 1995 championship seasons. But he still averaged
18.9 points and 9.6 rebounds and was voted third-team All-NBA this
year. To even entertain offers of draft picks for him is the
equivalent of the surgeon trading in the woman who put him through
med school for a younger, firmer trophy wife.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the No. 5 picks in the draft over the past five years:
Vince Carter, Tony Battie, Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Juwan
Howard. Only one, Garnett, is a franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the No. 12 picks: Michael Doleac, Austin Croshere,
Vitaly Potapenko, Cherokee Parks and Khalid Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Add in Kevin Willis and Doug Christie, and let the Raptors
juggle and tinker and tempt Houston all they want. It is not a
Rockets team that is any closer to contending for a title than one
with Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not about basketball. It's about a society where
loyalty means nothing when corporate downsizing and positioning for
the future will put a few more bucks in a shareholder's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a time when you probably can trade the Dream, raise
ticket prices and know that the seats will be filled by those who
thrive on indoor fireworks, jiggling girls and blaring music.
</P>
<P>
   It is a more prosperous world in which we live. Just not a
better one.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The cyclical nature of baseball dictates that all teams will go
through stretches when wins are as rare and precious as hits have
been for the Astros over the past two weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the Yankees, who won an American League-record 114 games
and the World Series championship last year, lost eight of 10 games
during a particularly rough stretch this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's no getting around how poorly the Astros have
played recently, losing nine of their last 13 games and
surrendering first place in the National League Central to the
Cincinnati Reds over the weekend. But while their fans may be
panicking, the Astros have yet to reach that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat ironic that a week ago we had the best record in
the league and everyone was on the bandwagon,'' general manager
Gerry Hunsicker said. ``Did something happen that was so dramatic
that we went from the penthouse to the outhouse?''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are what happened. While they were winning seven in a
row _ including a four-game sweep here _ the Astros were losing six
of seven, turning a six-game Central lead into a virtual tie with
Cincinnati, which leads the division by a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid-fire turnaround has the entire city wondering: What's
wrong with the Astros?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not hitting,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said.
``That's what's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros hit .151 in the four-game series against the Reds,
and they are hitting .204 over the last 13 games, signifying a
team-wide offensive shutdown. Paul Bako is hitting .118 during that
stretch, Richard Hidalgo .167, Derek Bell .170, Tony Eusebio .182,
Tim Bogar .190, Bagwell .200 and Craig Biggio .245. Almost no one
is safe from this seemingly allergic reaction to anyone standing on
a pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep taking extra batting practice and keep
working at it,'' interim manager Matt Galante said. ``The cream
rises to the top. We're not talking about players who we question
whether they can play at this level. These guys are pretty good
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the Astros' much-ballyhooed offense
has gone south this season. They hit only .187 during an earlier
12-game stretch, but they somehow managed to win five of those
games while losing just 2{ games in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the Astros seem prone to such offensive lapses? Consider
the following:
</P>
<P>
   As hard as it may be to accept, 1998 is history. The Astros were
a great team last season when they won a franchise-record 102
games, but injuries have reduced them to merely good. It's
unrealistic to expect them to be the dominant, high-scoring club
most expected before injuries sidelined Moises Alou and Ken
Caminiti, who combined for 67 home runs and 206 RBIs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was an aberration when the Astros led the NL in
hitting earlier this season despite being at less than full
strength. And while it's probably safe to assume they are a much
better hitting club than their current 12th-place ranking would
indicate, it would be foolish to discount the impact of injuries to
two of their biggest guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some respects we're very fortunate to be where we are,''
Hunsicker said. ``I'm not sure people realize how special 1998 was.
Not only did we have a good team on paper, but they performed well,
and it's rare when everything comes together like it did for us
last season.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of hitting instructor Tom McCraw also could factor
into the sporadic offensive production. Since McCraw left the team
to undergo treatment for prostate cancer May 17, the Astros have
gone 19-19 and are hitting .235. They were 23-13 and had a .297
batting average before his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we miss Mac,'' Hunsicker said. ``It's hard to qualify
the impact that a coach or manager has on a club. He has a special
relationship with our players.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the theory that some of the players who have
been big producers in the past are pressing, perhaps to pick up the
slack of the two missing stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens sometimes is that when the big guys are
struggling, sometimes the big guys aren't getting good pitches to
hit,'' said Galante, under whom the Astros are 5-9 while manager
Larry Dierker recovers from brain surgery. ``And when the other
guys aren't hitting either, the big guys start swinging at bad
pitches because they think they've got to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it starts with the other guys, and then it gets to the
big guys because they try to do everything. We've talked about
this: Do what you can do to win a game. Don't try to hit a five-run
or six-run home run. When you start getting out of the things that
you can do, then you're not performing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of why the Astros aren't hitting or winning, they
haven't lost faith. With 87 games remaining, they are still
considered the team to beat in the NL Central _ despite the way
things might look now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland just lost four straight,'' Galante said. ``How did
you think that would happen? Chicago (Cubs) lost five straight. The
Mets lost eight straight, and they bounced back pretty well. We're
going to get this thing turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that this is happening right now. But if you
look back at all the teams that have gone through this, the one
thing we have to do is keep plugging away and keep hustling.
There's no question about the way we go about our business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still know we've got a good club. We've just been coming up
short.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Comets on Monday night came to Compaq Center in search of a
little, but important, piece of WNBA history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What they got was a glimpse at one of the teams of the future,
the expansion Orlando Miracle, which used the all-around play of
rookie Nykesha Sales to record a 68-66 victory and spoil the
Comets' chance to be the first WNBA team to start a season 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people were disappointed because we didn't
set the new record, being 8-0 or whatever,'' said forward Sheryl
Swoopes. ``And that would have been a great accomplishment, a great
honor. But I'm more disappointed that we didn't play very well, not
that we lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very well as a team throughout the entire game.
So that's more important to me and more disappointing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets will have to settle for a 7-1 record because Sales,
the rookie from Connecticut who sat out all last year while
rehabilitating the right ankle she hurt as a college senior, threw
in a game-high 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Orlando credit,'' said coach Van Chancellor. ``They came
in here tonight and really played well. Sales had 23 points, which
was outstanding for a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shannon Johnson, whom Chancellor has often called ``maybe
the best point guard in pro ball,'' got 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   And from start to finish, with few exceptions, the ultimate
difference was the intense, energetic play of the Miracle and the
lack of same for the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get ready to play,'' said Chancellor. ``And Orlando
did a great job. They just played well tonight, and we didn't play
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales said the Miracle made a statement of which others around
the WNBA are certain to take heed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps us and probably other teams just to see that they're
beatable,'' she said. ``I mean, they're going almost undefeated
every season and only losing a few games. But this shows that if
you have the heart, you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miracle, which won its fourth straight game to improve to
5-3, survived two possessions by the Comets in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Sonja Henning, enjoying her most successful outing
as a Comet, stole the ball from Johnson with 19 seconds remaining
and the Miracle leading 67-66.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes took a pass from Cynthia Cooper and, after
glancing at the clock and seeing only 15 seconds remaining, tried
to work through a triple team and get off a pass to Tina Thompson
on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, poked the ball away, and both players dived to
the floor near the sideline in an effort to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went out of bounds, but the officials ruled it had last
been touched by Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think we would get that call at home,'' Swoopes
said, half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2.1 seconds remained. Orlando, after a 20-second timeout,
inbounded to Taj McWilliams, who was fouled by Janeth Arcain.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams made one of two free throws for a 68-66 lead with
nine-tenths of a second left, thus leaving the door slightly ajar
for a potential Comets miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's inbounds pass went to Swoopes, but her 3-point
attempt from deep in the right corner hit the front of the rim and
bounced away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they had a really good team,'' said Swoopes. ``I knew
they were going to be completely different from the first time we
played 'em at their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that we thought we couldn't be beaten, but I just didn't
think we came ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been a different story when the teams met in Orlando on
June 10 to begin the season.
</P>
<P>
   Then, despite a sprained right ankle, Cooper teamed with Swoopes
and Thompson to lead the Comets to a convincing 77-63 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   During the morning shootaround Monday, Cooper resprained the
ankle. Though she showed no ill effects, leading the team with 21
points, the Comets' offense seemed out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one loss,'' said Swoopes. ``We've got 25 more or whatever
(games) to play. It's definitely going to be a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think we know that when you win games, you tend to
forget about a lot of the things that you need to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of forget what has gotten you to that point. And when
you lose, then you start looking back, pointing fingers and saying
it was because of this or that, instead of saying we lost as a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't play very well. That's the bottom line.''

BURNING FOR A FLAG AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   flags are getting torched these days but, thankfully, Congress
is trying to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   They have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   On average, it's been reported that fewer than 10 Americans per
year burn a flag in protest. There are more than 250 million people
in this country, and entire years may have passed without a single
U.S. citizen setting a match to Old Glory.
</P>
<P>
   It's a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all because of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, the justices said flag desecration was a
protected expression of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Something must be done about that and, distasteful as it is, the
government must do it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are right when they say we shouldn't expect Uncle
Sam to solve all our problems. They're right when they say it's
dangerous to ask Big Brother to correct social transgressions.
They're right when they say Congress should attempt to fix a
societal ill only after everything else has failed.
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely why we need a Constitutional amendment banning
flag desecration, as some members of Congress propose.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, flag burning in America may disappear completely. &QL; 
JUSTICES TOOK FUN OUT OF IT &QL; 
The amendment currently being considered reads: ``The Congress
shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives has passed it, and it's under
consideration in the Senate, where the experts are predicting it
will fail by a few votes.
</P>
<P>
   It must not.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court decision _ which proved that freedom in
America extends to those whose actions we consider repulsive _
actual flag burning incidents became even more rare.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known it would.
</P>
<P>
   The justices took all the fun out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a person can go out and spend $5 or $10 or $20 on the
Stars and Stripes, light it up and . . . nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No crowds. No police. No TV.
</P>
<P>
   You're not a protester, you're only a moron. You might as well
skip the middleman and torch the bills.
</P>
<P>
   That's got to change, and the only practical way to do so is to
make flag desecration illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The very day such an amendment is ratified by the necessary
two-thirds majority of states, we can be guaranteed flags will burn
across the land.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be crowds.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be police.
</P>
<P>
   And, most of all, there will be TV.
</P>
<P>
   That's what America is all about.
</P>
<P>
   That's why men like Arizona Sen. John McCain, who desperately
wants to be president, and Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, who desperately
wants to stop playing second banana to McCain, strongly support the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if the protesters get on TV, so will the politicians
who step forward to condemn them.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved winds up happy. The flag burners. The
politicians. The TV executives. &QL; 
DETAILS OF LAW UNCLEAR
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a few minor details to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no one knows exactly how many car thieves, con men,
burglars and armed robbers will go free while police are busy
arresting flag burners.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no one knows what the punishment for flag desecration will
be, since no one knows exactly what ``desecration'' means.
</P>
<P>
   Would it include running shorts designed to look like the flag?
Or paint jobs on automobiles? Or cakes?
</P>
<P>
   Kraft Foods recently sent food editors a recipe for ``flag
cake.'' It uses strawberries, blueberries and whipped topping.
</P>
<P>
   This atrocity can be baked and consumed legally, for now.
</P>
<P>
   But there may come a day, soon, when America's spoiled and
unpatriotic citizens will be forced to relearn a lesson they should
have known all along:
</P>
<P>
   You can't have your flag cake and eat it, too.

 &HT;    Complaining springs eternal in youth baseball season
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Do you hear that sound? That tremendous
whoooooosssh?
</P>
<P>
   That is the sound of a collective sigh coming from the mouths of
hundreds of baseball parents. Youth baseball season is over.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as if we did not love every last moment of watching our
children play. For a fact, it is one of my most enjoyable times of
the year. I wouldn't _ and didn't _ miss an inning of my son
playing.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something sweet about the final out of the final
game, too, once you have either celebrated victory or soothed
defeat. For most kids, soothing defeat takes about as long as
wolfing down a burger at the closest diner. There is something
sweet about that, too. Baseball for these kids is still just a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you wish you could say the same about the parents?
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that for some parents, youth baseball is not a
game at all, but an all-consuming quest. They intend on turning
little Johnny into the next Wille Mays, Ken Griffey Jr. or Mark
McGuire. This despite the fact that little Johnny cannot make a
basket catch or even catch with a basket. He cannot accurately
throw from the second baseman's fielding position to first base and
he couldn't hit past the pitcher's mound, even off a tee.
</P>
<P>
   To little Johnny, of course, this doesn't matter a bit. He's
getting some exercise, having fun playing the game and, most
important of all, he is a part of a team. The team may not always
be successful, but they win and they lose together.
</P>
<P>
   Far too many parents fail to understand that this is what makes
youth baseball _ or any youth sport _ important. It doesn't have
anything to do with how well your kid plays the game. Should I
repeat that?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say you shouldn't encourage _ that is, demand _
that your child do his absolute best and give his full effort. That
way he is prepared when you expect not one whit less effort when he
is sitting in a classroom or taking his first job. This is, of
course, assuming that all parents demand the same kind of effort in
the classroom as they do on the baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, that just isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I helped teach a Junior Achievement class at an East
Texas junior high school. I talked to the students about the
importance of doing well in class when one burly kid raised his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have to do well, just have to make sure that I
pass my subjects,'' the kid said. ``My daddy says I'm gonna get a
football scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Way to go, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   The most amusing time in youth baseball is the naming of the
All-Star teams. Parents who have prayed for an end to the season
suddenly become incensed that their child has not been chosen.
After all, he did get a hit and almost made one catch during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no great judge of baseball talent, but the two years I've
seen the All-Star selections, they made perfect sense to me. All
the best players I saw made the team. Some good players weren't
there because, of course, there are only so many slots. As with any
such process, there are a few close calls and judgment calls.
</P>
<P>
   In every city I know of, jilted parents have exactly the same
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   As for the complaint that kids of coaches get the best shake in
on the teams and All-Star selections, I'd say, ``Bravo!'' I figure
if a person puts in the sweat _ and there is a lot of it _ to coach
a team, he gets the right to play his child at any position he
wants and bat him anywhere in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, people are often compelled to coach because their
kids are especially talented, which might well account for a higher
representation on the All-Star teams.
</P>
<P>
   Want your child to play shortstop next season and bat fourth?
Fine, sign up to coach and you'll get no argument from me.
</P>
<P>
   This may strike some of you as unfair but _ surprise! _ life
isn't fair all that often. (Talk to any cancer patient about the
concept of ``fair.'') We aren't doing our kids any favors by making
them think they have some inherent right to fairness, because they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, have the right to play. Play. Remember? Repeat
after me: This is a game. This is only a game.

 &HT;    Wrestling? Politics? Same game _ different scorecard
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Jesse Ventura is the governor of Minnesota.
Hulk Hogan is running for president, and another former pro
wrestler, Bob Backlund, is campaigning for Congress in Connecticut.
And that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   WWF star Jerry Lawler is thinking about making a bid for mayor
of Memphis, and Harry Venis (Dirty Harry) is already the mayor of
Davie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   At first I was appalled with the notion of guys in tights
running the country, but the more I think about it, the less
outrageous it sounds. Here's the way I see it.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, it has always been impossible to tell the good guys
from the bad guys until it was too late, because they all look
alike. From their conservative pinstripes and television-ready red
ties to their pricey Italian shoes, each is politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   In professional wrestling, however, there is no such quibble _
the good guys wear white and the bad guys wear black. The only
problem voters might have with such readily identifiable symbols of
virtue and corruption, would be trying to take the entire process
seriously when we're asked to choose between a guy in a black mask
carrying a cat-o-nine-tails, and his opponent in gold sneakers and
a fur-lined cape.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it though. Can a choreographed wrestling match get
much sillier than some of the national conventions we've watched on
television? Surely, no one expects us voters to get serious about a
bunch of political types taking a week off from work and spending
the taxpayers' bucks to run around planting whoopee cushions under
the butt of another delegate who just happens to have a flamingo
tied to his hat.
</P>
<P>
   Why not level the playing field a bit and come clean with the
constituents? Why not swap the political arena for a coliseum of
another sort? A smaller one with ropes, a bell, and a referee? That
way everyone knows nobody's fooling anybody _ what we see is what
we get. How's that for a bureaucratic novelty?
</P>
<P>
   Come election time there'd be no question in the voters' minds
about who's telling the truth. Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Voters know that a candidate's position on the issues shifts
faster than a Texas Twostep. This week Libby moves a little left of
center because ``W'' is easing right and has been noticeably
praying with everyone. Even his momma, the former first lady,
thought the minister was speaking directly to her son during a
sermon about Moses' leading his people.
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller stage, we find our first lady blatantly switching
baseball teams as well as towns. She can't handle Bill, so she's
going for the Big Apple. How is New York going to be able to trust
her knowing they're getting her on the rebound? Worse, can the
voters live with the annoying suspicion that come 2004, when she
makes her bid for the top spot on the Democratic (or Republican,
should she revert to her youthful inclinations) presidential
ticket, her Yankees cap might be doffed for one belonging to
whichever club's hometown is slipping in the polls?
</P>
<P>
   Can the political types really expect us to buy into the notion
that our presidential wannabes are totally committed to anything
that doesn't guarantee them a quicker climb up the polls? Why don't
they admit it? Politics is showbiz _ all grunts and glitz. We'd all
feel a lot better if candidates fessed up to the fakery and made
honest folks of us.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling? Politics? Same game _ different scorecard, but at
least no one expects us to believe the WWF is going to erase the
national debt or solve the abortion issue. ``The Undertaker'' has
not promised voters a chicken in every pot, and ``Stone Cold''
hasn't guaranteed 1.5 cars to every citizen above the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how I'd feel about living in a state run by Jesse
the Body, or a country run by the Hulkster, but I know for sure
that I'd really appreciate it if politicians would stop talking out
of both sides of their mouths and speak a few ugly truths at us.
</P>
<P>
   First pin wins.

 &HT;    Bills on flag, commandments couldn't be more un-American
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If the political symbol were the swastika and the
religious document came from Mein Kampf, more Americans would see
the two wrongs the U.S. House of Representatives has committed.
</P>
<P>
   That the symbol in question is the U.S. flag and the document is
the Ten Commandments makes the House no less wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A government that orders its citizens how to behave around a
graphic political symbol _ an image printed on cloth, paper, name
your medium _ is not one based on symbolic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   A government that can decree religious commandments _ be they
translations of Muhammad, Mao or Moses _ can call itself just, and
moral, and God-empowered, but it cannot call itself free.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in the middle rationalize such mischief, along
with theoretical kin like organized school prayer, with ``What harm
would it do?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty. Say it. These proposals are fundamentally wrong. Most of
all, they are fundamentally un-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Wrong to punish people for vandalizing the symbol of
America?''
</P>
<P>
   America has laws against vandalism. Against theft. Against
arson. Against inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   What the House of Representatives has proposed is an amendment
to prohibit the defacing of a political idea. An idea is all the
flag is, something abstract sketched on something concrete. Someone
burn the flag? We make another. The idea remains. The idea never
left. The concrete thing (made of cloth in these beholders' eyes) a
constitutional amendment would protect is no more real than fog on
the mirror. We make one. We make millions. It means what our minds
say, just like the symbols on this paper, these Xs, Ys, and Os. Is
our government in the business of telling you how to perceive them?
</P>
<P>
   The most insidious thing about the anti-flag-desecration
amendment is that it is such an easy sell, striking back at
something so repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   But to the Supreme Court the public affront this amendment would
forbid is nearly sacred: It is political speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some speech is not protected. Child porn, for instance. Some
speech can be prohibited because it is obscene and has no socially
redeeming value. But here the issue is speaking symbolically about
our government and how it works. When that's the case, the Supreme
Court says government cannot tell critics, ``Knock off the
symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler could. Mussolini could. Khomeini could. Saddam Hussein
can. Slobodan Milosevic can.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives, by a disgraceful 305-124,
asserts, ``We want to join the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Government as God
</P>
<P>
   For the totalitarian club the posting of religious commandments
would help you keep your franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote to allow schools to post Judeo-Christian
commandments is quite possibly the most grievous assault against
religious liberty on these shores in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to try to sneak state-established religion into
the classroom with ``voluntary'' school prayer and a silent moment
meant for group prayer. Here the House has sanctioned the posting
of ``thou shalt have no other Gods before me'' and ``remember the
Sabbath day to keep it holy'' (which will confuse some Jewish
students who'll assume it means the state has declared Friday-night
football blasphemy).
</P>
<P>
   And what will have been accomplished? By government decree, the
Ten Commandments will be elevated to the stature of the ``Exit''
sign, the door jamb and the label you don't tear off the mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after we first planted the American flag on the
moon, the U.S. House of Representatives has launched two of the
world's most meaningful emblems on a mission to the Sea of
Triviality.

this change and not to abandon our people in the times to come.''

 &HT;    Retirement savings low across the board
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mail and e-mail from readers are a blessing. Your
questions keep us at the newspaper in touch with what you really
need, and you let us know when you need to know more about topics
we've covered.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the questions you've raised recently:
</P>
<P>
   In response to last week's report on retirement savings, two
readers asked for more information on how much money Americans have
saved to help pay for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The chart in last week's paper suggested that more than half of
the respondents in a survey had saved less than $100,000, and 9
percent had saved nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hollinger pointed out that a large percentage didn't answer
the question, and he asked for more details on savings among young,
middle-aged and older people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the average age is 30, then they are in great shape,'' even
if savings are low, Hollinger wrote. ``Age 40: not too bad. Age 50:
Not good but still time to get going. Age 60: They are in real
sorry shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Employee Benefit Research Institute responded with a chart
that removes the no-answer people and provides age groupings.
</P>
<P>
   Data from those smaller samples will not be as reliable. But the
numbers are still pretty discouraging. Nearly half of workers aged
54 and older have saved $50,000 or less. Only a third of
leading-edge baby boomers _ aged 46 to 53 _ have saved more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the institute observed in its original report, ``The amounts
accumulated by workers as a whole are generally unimpressive.''
</P>
<P>
   A reader wrote that her company has imposed new fees on her
401(k) retirement plan and has given employees the skimpiest
reports on how their investments are doing. She asks, ``Are there
any federal guidelines on what your 401(k) statements should
show?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer will not make her happy. ``The law does not require
an employer to provide an individual benefit statement,'' said
Deidre Koger of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are entitled to ask once every 12 months for a report on
their account. The employer must provide the statement, but your
account balance is the only detail that must, by law, be included.
</P>
<P>
   Koger said a majority of employers provide a more detailed
statement every three months, without being required to do so. Some
companies may minimize reporting to keep down administrative costs.
In many cases, it will not be clear whether fees were paid by the
retirement plan or from individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The same reader also asked for advice on which mutual funds to
pick for her family's retirement plan. I can't give that kind of
detailed investment advice. Better to hire a professional or to
read a good book, such as the ones listed with the Finding Help
feature on this page.
</P>
<P>
   The main considerations are how much risk you are willing to
take and how long you expect to let your investments grow. You also
should consider what pension and Social Security benefits you
expect, how much you want to spend in retirement and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader notes that a 12-year-old daughter made money
baby-sitting and asks if the daughter can use it to open a
traditional or Roth individual retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   I asked some experts, who answered yes, but with warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Rausch of Stein Roe mutual fund family _ which has a fund
designed for children _ noted that the account has to be a
custodial one, set up by a parent in the child's name. But she
warned that the child gets control of the money as soon as she
reaches the age of majority. ``If the child says, 'I want to cash
out and go to Tahiti,' you can't do anything about it,'' Rausch
said. ``You do have to think about whether you trust your child and
will be able to teach them that this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   An education IRA might be a better idea, if the point is to save
for college or any other pre-retirement goal, Rausch added.
</P>
<P>
   There are tax consequences, said Larry W. Nichols, a certified
public accountant in Atlanta. Baby-sitting fees are self-employment
income. If it comes to more than $400, the income is subject to
self-employment tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tried to say, 'I made $2,000 baby-sitting,' and if the
Internal Revenue Service checks that, they might say, 'Where's the
self-employment tax?' '' Nichols said.

 &HT;    Getting around the `R': Teens say it's easy to beat theaters'
system
 &HT;    By John Blake and Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An 8 1/2-by-11-inch sign posted at the door to Regal
Cinema's Covington Square 8 multiplex in Lithonia warns patrons of
the latest trend in moviegoing _ absolutely no one younger than 17
admitted to R-rated movies without a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Three teenagers, puffing cigarettes and hanging outside the
theater, are unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just going to make them want to see it even more,''
says one of the teens, Mike Stone, 17. ``There's enough violence in
the world. People know what's going on. If they don't see it in the
movies, they're going to see it in the news, and it's going to be
real life. There's really no point in stopping it.''
</P>
<P>
   But keeping younger teens out of R-rated movies is just what
many theaters have pledged to do in the wake of recent high school
shootings in Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which theaters enforce the policy, underscored in
a joint announcement June 9 by President Clinton and the National
Association of Theater Owners, appears to vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Some theaters have posted warning signs, and others routinely
send staffers into screening rooms to ferret out young teens who've
gotten past the box office by buying tickets to lower-rated films
and then sneaking into R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens, however, say that despite promises of extra policing
of admissions they've seen little change and rarely find it
difficult to see any movie they want.
</P>
<P>
   One film many kids want to see is the adult-themed, R-rated
``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut,'' which opens Wednesday in
metro Atlanta. It's a satire of the nation's R-rated movie
fixation, filled with profanities and violence. ``South Park's''
potty-mouthed kids _ Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Kenny _ sneak into an
obscenity-laced R movie, singing ``Off to the movies we go, 'cause
it's where we learn everything we know.'' The resulting brouhaha
leads to a war between the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   AMC Theaters promises a concerted effort to keep teens 16 and
younger from seeing the movie, and the chain's newest metro Atlanta
megaplex in Kennesaw, which opens Wednesday _ will not only check
IDs at the box office but station staff at screening room doors to
check ticket stubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For particular pictures such as `South Park,' we're going to
increase efforts to enforce the policy,'' says Rolando B.
Rodriguez, AMC's senior vice president, South Divisions operations.
Also on AMC's list: the Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman sex study ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' opening July 16, and the over-the-top high school sex
romp ``American Pie,'' coming July 9. At a Regal Cinema, Michelle
Stringer, 15, says she plans to see ``South Park'' and will likely
use her preferred method of getting into R-rated movies: simply buy
a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The ploy doesn't always work. ``I've been told I don't look
17,'' Stringer says. But she says her parents are willing to buy
her a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, there's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Underage kids are allowed tickets to R-rated movies when they
are purchased by a parent or adult guardian, but some theaters
maintain that the adult must accompany the teenager into the
screening room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adults get upset,'' says Deante Raston, assistant manager
at a theater in Covington, Ga. ``Even after you tell them the
content of the movie, even after you tell them it has a lot of
cursing, they'll say, 'Why do I have to come in and buy my child a
ticket? I don't want to watch this stinking movie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Raston says after warning one angry parent that his child
couldn't get into an R-rated movie because it contained too much
profanity and violence, the parent replied, ``Well, they hear it at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some kids under 17 say their parents don't care whether they see
restricted movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are like, 'We trust you,''' says Whitney Simmons,
13, while rece see it,'' says 14-year-old Matt Malissa. ``We could
buy tickets for 'Tarzan.' It's not like they guard the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Wijesimghe says, ``A lot of kids look older than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   But some theaters apparently have stepped up efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Raston says the Covington theater has at least one police
officer patrolling the corridors weekdays and two doing it on
weekends. The theater also sends ushers into screening rooms for
every show.
</P>
<P>
   Raston says it's not too difficult to spot under-age kids in a
darkened theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``By walking every aisle, you can see a head in each aisle. A
lot of kids are not smart enough to sit in the middle (of a row),''
he says. ``And usually if a kid sneaks in the movie, they sit in
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Daniel Furlow, 16, says he recently bought a ticket to
see the R-rated ``The Matrix'' at a different theater with some
other under-age friends and no one asked for his ID. And he scoffs
at the notion that violent movies inspire real-life acts of viole

 &HT;    CD-ROM aims to bring Jews back to the fold
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Religious law bars Jews from working,
driving, or even flipping a light switch on the Sabbath. So why has
an organization dedicated to bringing Jews back into the fold
released a CD-ROM to help guide them through Sabbath rituals when a
computer is required to view it?
</P>
<P>
   File the answer under D, as in desperate times call for
desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of the Americans under the age of 40 born to
Jewish parents do not consider themselves Jewish, which means most
Jews are ignoring the Sabbath _ and their Judaism _ altogether,
according to a 1990 survey by the Council of Jewish Federations.
</P>
<P>
   And that, says National Jewish Outreach Program spokeswoman
Melanie Notkin, is a reality that needs addressing. It is also the
impetus for ``Virtual Shabbat,'' a point-and-click primer on how to
prepare for and conduct a Jewish Sabbath service at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot condone someone using this (CD) on Shabbat,'' Notkin
said. ``But if someone was already going to do something on Shabbat
that was not allowed, a virtual Shabbat experience would be better
than none.''
</P>
<P>
   Literature accompanying the disc is even more blunt, warning
that the meltdown of Jewish life is so serious that ``Judaism in
America, as we have known it for the last 3,000 years, will likely
cease to exist in the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the outreach group, which was founded in New York
City in 1985, is to prevent that loss of identity by connecting
Jews to each other and to their traditions. The disc is aimed at
teaching Jews who are not affiliated with any Jewish organization
how to observe Shabbat. ``It's just another tool to reach people,''
Notkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer program begins with two Shabbat candles floating
into the screen on compact discs. After a welcome by the bearded
face of Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald, founder of the National Jewish
Outreach Program, viewers have a choice of entering four different
illustrated rooms: the kitchen, dining room, a synagogue or a
virtual classroom to learn Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, viewers can learn the basics of keeping kosher;
in the dining room they can learn several prayers to say before the
meal; and in the synagogue they can learn the rudiments of Judaism
and listen to any of three dozen different prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Shabbat CD should be used during the week and the
information put into practice beginning Friday night at sundown,
Notkin said. The disc is made by the same Manhattan-based group
that started ``Read Hebrew America'' to teach Jews to read Hebrew
and ``Shabbat Across America,'' which organizers said drew about
70,000 Jews who do not usually observe Shabbat into synagogues last
year. All the events target Jewish continuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My blessing to you,'' Buchwald says on the CD, ``is that you
remain as enthusiastic several years from now as you are during the
experience you are having today.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Shabbat can be ordered by calling (800) 44-TORAH.Douglas

 &HT;    A pitcher who gutted one out for his school
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ D.J. Jones tried to convince himself that the
pain in his gut did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   That was no easy task, considering he pitched the entire spring
with a hernia the size of a baseball. He ignored suggestions of
surgery in February, knowing the procedure would ruin his baseball
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my decision to play,'' the University of Texas junior
pitcher said last weekend. ``It was all up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it seems incredible that Jones pitched so
effectively in his condition. He played with a special brace that
supported the hernia. He still led Texas pitchers in wins (10),
innings pitched (122), complete games (six) and ERA (4.73).
</P>
<P>
   What Texas fans did not see was the pain Jones endured away from
the field. The hernia hurt whenever he ran or lifted anything
heavy. By the end of the season he felt sharp pains in his stomach
whenever he ate. He lost his appetite in May and was forced to lie
down after every meal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas coaches questioned the gritty left-hander about the hernia
almost daily. They mostly just received blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell them much, because I didn't want anybody to
worry about me,'' said Jones, one of the team's most soft-spoken
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.J. is the only person who knows how badly he felt,'' Dwain
Jones said of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Dwain Jones might be the only Texas fan who was relieved when
the Horns were eliminated from the NCAA tournament in a regional at
Houston. For the first time in nearly five months, D.J. would get
the medical care he needed. He had surgery June 4 _ the day after
his 21st birthday _ in a Dallas hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been ordered to stay away from strenuous activity for
two months. The surgery was a success, and he expects no problems
when he returns for his senior season. He hopes to start to throw
again in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking that the further Texas got (in the playoffs),
the chances were greater that his hernia would blow up,'' Dwain
Jones said. ``It was pretty nasty. I was worried that it might
rupture at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones felt the hernia for the first time in late January. While
jogging at Disch-Falk Field, he felt a twinge on the left side of
his lower abdomen. He did not have it examined until the pain got
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Coach Augie Garrido knew about the injury and was given
frequent medical reports. He relied on Jones to tell him the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Poker-faced Jones admits that he often told Garrido nothing was
wrong, even when the pain was unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Jones saw four doctors at various times in the spring, and one
insisted that he quit pitching immediately. There was no reason to
risk permanent injury. But as long as he performed well, Jones did
not consider quitting an option.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the determination of a bulldog during the regular
season, Jones threw 122 pitches against Missouri, 129 against
Stanford, 130 against Oklahoma, 130 against Southern California and
153 against Louisiana State. Rarely did he appear to be tired on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was nearly heroic in the Big 12 tournament in Oklahoma
City. In a 5-4 loss to Missouri in 11 innings, Jones fired an
amazing 175 pitches. After struggling early in the game, Jones was
nearly unhittable in the latter innings, and Missouri needed an
unearned run in the 11th to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better the further I went along (in that game),'' Jones
said. ``I've been in games when I threw fewer than 100 pitches and
felt worse than I did against Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one on the team worked harder than Jones. In addition
to starting 17 games, he pitched seven times in relief, earning
three saves. After every home game, he jogged alone on the outfield
warning track to improve his conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease the pain caused by the hernia, Jones took four
Advil tablets a day the entire season. He will continue to take
pain medication until he recovers fully from surgery. This summer
he has returned to his family's home in Forney, about 10 miles east
of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Did Jones ever consider taking time off when the hernia started
to break through?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I did,'' he said. ``I guess I got used to the pain.
I really never knew how bad it was.''

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Do you hear that sound? That
tremendous whoooooosssh? That is the sound of a collective sigh
coming from the mouths of hundreds of baseball parents. Youth
baseball season is over. (Latham, Marshall (Texas) News Messenger)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The 13 Iranian Jews imprisoned as alleged spies
are pawns in the dead-earnest power struggle between elected
moderate President Mohammed Khatami and radical Islamist clergy
hellbent on preserving the extremist theocracy of the late,
founding ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini. (Teepen, Cox Newspapers)
MOVED MONDAY.

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ While the president and seemingly everyone
else is down on the motion picture industry for its embrace of
violence and sex, I find myself on a different page. What troubles
me most about films these days is, simply, bad taste. (Kleinberg,
Cox News Service) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Jesse Ventura is the
governor of Minnesota. Hulk Hogan is running for president, and
another former pro wrestler, Bob Backlund, is campaigning for
Congress in Connecticut. And that's not all. At first I was
appalled with the notion of guys in tights running the country, but
the more I think about it, the less outrageous it sounds. (Schuett,
Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ If the political symbol were the
swastika and the religious document came from Mein Kampf, more
Americans would see the two wrongs the U.S. House of
Representatives has committed. That the symbol in question is the
U.S. flag and the document is the Ten Commandments makes the House
no less wrong. A government that orders its citizens how to behave
around a graphic political symbol is not one based on symbolic
freedoms. A government that can decree religious commandments can
call itself just, and moral, and God-empowered, but it cannot call
itself free. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   CoxNet WHEELS 0629 _ The thrill of putting the top down in
Porsche's new 911. Only one thing about the convertibles that
Porsche builds hasn't changed or been upgraded by technological
advances in 50 years of motorcar making: the simple fun of driving
a topless car. It doesn't matter whether it's a shiny six-figure
exotic from abroad or a rusting three-figure junker from the
classifieds, a convertible brings excitement to driving like
nothing else _ and the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet does it with
exceptional grace. (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   R-MOVIES-TEENS _ The biggest challenge to movie theaters' pledge
to keep young teens out of R-rated movies opens today. It's ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' an R-rated summer movie that many
young kids want desperately to see. And what is it about? Wouldn't
you know it _ Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman sneak into an R-rated,
which ultimately leads to war between the U.S. and Canada. Hot on
its heels will be ``American Pie,'' a raunchy R-rated film about
high school kids desperately seeking sex. We talk to young
moviegoers, parents and theater owners about the new policy,
whether its working, who's trying to beat it and what it all means.
(Blake/Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

In January, on her 75th birthday, Newman bought a Dell Dimension

   FORUMS _ The Usenet forum was for owners of Chia pets, those
ceramic animals from mail-order TV. And there in the list of
subjects was a query from someone desperate to keep her dog from
chasing cars. A chia dog that chases cars? That would be worth
sending a photographer, if those TV prowl vans don't beat us to it.
And there was another pottery-pet question asking whether a mother
cat would adopt a kitten from someone else's litter. And some

recent advances in ceramic technology). And someone complaining
that her landlord won't let her keep a ferret. (Stough, Austin

Emerson Research, a branch of Emerson Radio Corp., introduced a new

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Do you hear that sound? That

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The 13 Iranian Jews imprisoned as alleged spies
are pawns in the dead-earnest power struggle between elected

hellbent on preserving the extremist theocracy of the late,
founding ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini. (Teepen, Cox Newspapers)

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ While the president and seemingly everyone
else is down on the motion picture industry for its embrace of
violence and sex, I find myself on a different page. What troubles
me most about films these days is, simply, bad taste. (Kleinberg,
Cox News Service) MOVED MONDAY.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Jesse Ventura is the
governor of Minnesota. Hulk Hogan is running for president, and
another former pro wrestler, Bob Backlund, is campaigning for
Congress in Connecticut. And that's not all. At first I was
appalled with the notion of guys in tights running the country, but
the more I think about it, the less outrageous it sounds. (Schuett,
Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ If the political symbol were the
swastika and the religious document came from Mein Kampf, more
Americans would see the two wrongs the U.S. House of
Representatives has committed. That the symbol in question is the
U.S. flag and the document is the Ten Commandments makes the House
no less wrong. A government that orders its citizens how to behave
around a graphic political symbol is not one based on symbolic
freedoms. A government that can decree religious commandments can
call itself just, and moral, and God-empowered, but it cannot call
itself free. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   CoxNet WHEELS 0629 _ The thrill of putting the top down in
Porsche's new 911. Only one thing about the convertibles that
Porsche builds hasn't changed or been upgraded by technological
advances in 50 years of motorcar making: the simple fun of driving
a topless car. It doesn't matter whether it's a shiny six-figure
exotic from abroad or a rusting three-figure junker from the
classifieds, a convertible brings excitement to driving like
nothing else _ and the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet does it with
exceptional grace. (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   R-MOVIES-TEENS _ The biggest challenge to movie theaters' pledge
to keep young teens out of R-rated movies opens today. It's ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' an R-rated summer movie that many
young kids want desperately to see. And what is it about? Wouldn't
you know it _ Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman sneak into an R-rated,
which ultimately leads to war between the U.S. and Canada. Hot on
its heels will be ``American Pie,'' a raunchy R-rated film about
high school kids desperately seeking sex. We talk to young
moviegoers, parents and theater owners about the new policy,
whether its working, who's trying to beat it and what it all means.
(Blake/Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

 &HT;    Parole cases unmasked: How would you vote?
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the lock of secrecy on Texas' parole files,
law-abiding Texans normally can't see what parole board members
consider in deciding which criminals to free early from prison _
and which ones to keep in.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive glimpse behind those closed doors, parole
officials recently allowed the American-Statesman to review several
case files _ with names deleted so as not to violate state law. We
culled through the files and listed the information parole board
members said was pertinent to their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Read the facts. Cast your vote and then see how the real board
members decided each one. Your options are to parole, deny parole,
make convict serve all time remaining, or review the case again in
several months
</P>
<P>
   Case One
</P>
<P>
   Age: 18
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Arson
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 6 years
</P>
<P>
   Time served: 7 months
</P>
<P>
   Details: Convicted of torching a washateria a year ago, his
first offense. Insists he was only trying to put out a fire someone
else started. Tenth-grade dropout, but attending prison classes to
get GED. No past history of drug or alcohol abuse. Wants to become
a security guard if released. Previously worked as a grocery
stocker. No protests against parole, and his relatives support it.
Considered a low risk.
</P>
<P>
   Case One
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Review case again in 17 months. Reason: Has not
served enough time yet. Since he has no education, would be wise
for him to get schooling and some vocational training before he is
released.
</P>
<P>
   Case Two
</P>
<P>
   Age: 53
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murder
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 30 years
</P>
<P>
   Time served: 12 years
</P>
<P>
   Details: In 1979, fatally shot 54-year-old rival he said had cut
him with a broken beer bottle and threatened his mother. ``He was
going to be a continuing threat,'' the convict said. Wrapped the
body in plastic and dumped it in a river. Has previous arrests for
public intoxication, aggravated assault, making threats and a long
history of traffic violations. Freed on mandatory supervision in
the late 1980s. His release was revoked in 1997 after he was
arrested for drunken driving and assaulting a cop after a fight
with his wife. No protests against release. Good behavior in
prison. Plans to work for scaffolding firm. Rated a low risk
</P>
<P>
   Case Two
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Review case again in 20 months. Reason: Seriousness
of offense, history of assaultive behavior and past history of not
following rules when released indicate a disturbing pattern not
worth taking another chance on at present.
</P>
<P>
   Case Three
</P>
<P>
   Age: 21
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Robbery
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 7 years
</P>
<P>
   Time served: 21 months
</P>
<P>
   Details: Broke woman's wrist in purse snatching. Was a
17-year-old high-school football star when he committed the crime.
Originally given three years' probation, but was sent to prison for
failing to pay his probation fees and not checking in as required.
His handwritten plea: ``I am very sorry for the crime that I have
committed. . . . If I could change the past I would.'' Has paid
$791 in restitution to the victim. Past history of drug and alcohol
abuse. Good behavior in prison. Has job and plans to rejoin his
family. No protests to release. Rated as low risk.
</P>
<P>
   Case Three
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Parole in September. Reason: Release him when he has
served 2 1/2 years on his sentence. From one board member who
interviewed him in prison: ``He looks like he's made the turn . . .
He has turned himself around.''
</P>
<P>
   Case Four
</P>
<P>
   Age: 41
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Cocaine possession
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 30 years
</P>
<P>
   Time served: 5 1/2 years
</P>
<P>
   Details: Arrested in car containing nine kilos of cocaine worth
$30,000. Insisted he was ``holding it for a friend.'' Initially
charged with drug trafficking, pleaded guilty to lesser charge. The
convict, a former judge and business owner in Colombia, is ashamed
of what he did. Good behavior record in prison. Rated as low-risk
if released. No protests to release. Federal immigration agents
want to deport him because he is not a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Case Four
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Release in September. Reason: Was serious crime,
needs to do more time _ but can do that in a pre-release facility
instead of a prison. When he is eventually freed, will be deported
so little chance he can commit new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Case Five
</P>
<P>
   Age: 30
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Aggravated kidnapping
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 6 years
</P>
<P>
   Time served: 3 1/2 years
</P>
<P>
   Details: When he broke his arm at the nightclub where he worked,
his boss refused to pay the $2,000 bill and fired him. Angry and
facing pressure from bill collectors, he held two female co-workers
at gunpoint in an office to try to get his boss to pay up. No
previous criminal history. Got into fights when first imprisoned,
but recent behavior has been good. High school graduate with 60
hours of college. Wants to work in a restaurant if released. His
family supports parole. Prosecutors have protested any early
release. Rated as low risk if released.
</P>
<P>
   Case Five
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Release in August. Reason: Has done enough time on
his sentence. Appears to be good risk.
</P>
<P>
   Case Six
</P>
<P>
   Age: 36
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Home burglary
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 10 years
</P>
<P>
   Time Served: 7 years
</P>
<P>
   Details: Broke into a house while naked, woman awoke to find him
wearing her underwear and holding a knife at her throat. In one of
his accounts, he said he had to disrobe because he soiled his pants
while driving and was only looking for something to wear. In
another, he insisted ``someone gave me some kind of drug.'' Jailed
15 times for crimes ranging from drugs to assault, though most
charges were dismissed. Has been paroled twice and was rearrested
on new charges. Is serving two 15-year sentences for selling stolen
credit cards and theft. Has good behavior record in prison. Has
completed welding and GED courses. Rated as moderate risk if
released. Victim and prosecutors have protested his release.
</P>
<P>
   Case Six
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Review case again in a year. Reason: Because of
mandatory supervision release law, will be freed from prison anyway
in 2001. If his good behavior in prison continues, might consider
releasing him early with intensive supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Case Seven
</P>
<P>
   Age: 27
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crimes: Delivery of cocaine and sexual assault of a child
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 7 years
</P>
<P>
   Time Served: 6 years
</P>
<P>
   Details: While on probation on a 1991 cocaine charge, he twice
forced a 13-year-old runaway to have sex with him by telling her he
was a member of the Mexican Mafia prison gang and could hurt her
and her family if she refused. Said he doesn't know why he did it.
This is his first time in prison. Good behavior record. A
high-school graduate, is mildly retarded. Wants to become a
carpenter when he gets out. Will live with his mother. Victim has
not protested but a prosecutor has pleaded: ``Please keep this
defendant behind bars for as long as possible.'' Rated as a
moderate risk.
</P>
<P>
   Case Seven
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Serve all remaining time. Reason: There appears to
be little benefit in letting him out early, even though doing so
would ensure he could be intensively supervised for several months
_ something that will not occur if he serves his entire sentence.
But members felt the gravity of the charge and his apparent lack of
remorse argued against any early release. In any event, he will
leave prison in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Case Eight
</P>
<P>
   Age: 39
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Female
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Theft by check
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 2 years
</P>
<P>
   Time Served: 9 months
</P>
<P>
   Details: In 1989, she wrote $10,000 worth of hot checks for
assorted merchandise at several stores. Initially given probation
but violated the rules by not reporting as required and disappeared
in 1991. Was arrested in 1998 and sent to prison. Has a good
behavior record in prison. Even if the board nixes her release now,
she will be freed on mandatory supervision in May anyway. She has
no history of drug use and has family support. Rated a low risk for
release. No protest letters.
</P>
<P>
   Case Eight
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Release this month. Reason: She has repaid most of
the losses, and has a job lined up to pay back whatever remains.
Makes sense to let her out now with proper supervision until she
will be released in May anyway under the mandatory supervision law.
</P>
<P>
   Case Nine
</P>
<P>
   Age: 22
</P>
<P>
   Gender: Male
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Drunken driving, injury to a child and assault
</P>
<P>
   Sentence: 7 years
</P>
<P>
   Time Served: 3 years
</P>
<P>
   Details: Freed on mandatory-supervision release a year ago, he
was re-arrested on new charges of cocaine possession and aiding a
juvenile to possess alcohol after police spotted several teenagers
going in and out of his motel room with beer. His previous crimes
include the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl, a charge that was
plea-bargained to a lesser charge of injury to a child. Had a good
behavior record in prison, and no previous violations while out of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Case Nine
</P>
<P>
   Board vote: Revoke parole. Reason: Convict is a sex offender
who, by hanging around with teenagers with drugs and alcohol,
indicates he has not changed his ways.

 &HT;    Paper chase: Clemency system slow to go digital
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ It's just a laptop computer, parole board
member Rissie Owens says, ``and I haven't really even learned how
to use it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials hope it will soon take Texas' archaic
record-keeping system for parole and clemency cases into the modern
era.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been repeatedly criticized for its antiquated
and, at times, sloppy record keeping and is poised to go online
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million project that is part of a five-year, $30 million
overhaul of prison computer systems, officials say. Currently, the
prison system lives and sometimes dies on a gargantuan mix of more
than 250,000 paper files, folders that must be constantly sorted
and re-sorted at the board's Austin headquarters, with bar-code
stickers attached to track each one. They are then boxed up and
dispatched to the seven field offices where board members work.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday, state-owned vans rendezvous in places like the
McDonald's parking lot in Breham, and at roadside spots in Temple,
Beeville and Synder, where drivers exchange dozens of file boxes
that are either being sent out to board members or returned to
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the new millennium, officials say, no other state
agency remains as reliant on paper files as the Board of Pardons
and Paroles. Some 5,000 files are on the road each month.
</P>
<P>
   But Brian Collier, who oversees that traveling paperwork, said
things could soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, he says, officials hope to have the 18 parole
board members working from laptops and desktop computers _ so, as
Owens explains it, ``instead of going through these boxes and boxes
of files every week, I could look at an inmate's entire file on the
screen _ and I could do it here in the office, at a (prison) unit,
anywhere I had the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving money and expediting the flow of
information for parole officials, Rodriguez and Collier said it
could also curb another paperwork hitch in the current system: lost
files. And even, occasionally, burned files.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, officials said, one of the vans caught fire
near Fort Stockton and three boxes of files inside _ about 30 or so
files in all _ were destoyed. Collier said it took several weeks to
reconstruct those files, one page at a time.

 &HT;    Many parole documents not seen by public

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Not only are the meetings secret where Texas
paroles are decided, but so are the case files that guide those
decisions. In other states those files are open. If Texans could
see them, they'd find:
</P>
<P>
   _ A cover sheet on the convict, including age, crime and rating
on risk if released;
</P>
<P>
   _ Parole summary, including details of the convict's version of
the crime, his or her behavior record in prison, plans if paroled,
details on background such as schooling or vocational skills, IQ
and medical history. A prison employee prepares the summary;
</P>
<P>
   _ Work sheets on what kind of risk the convict will be if
paroled. A parole board worker puts together the work sheet;
</P>
<P>
   _ Paperwork on the convict's prison term, including copies of
the court sentence and other legal documents from public file at
courthouse. Can also include police reports of the crime;
</P>
<P>
   _ Letters from victims and prosecutors, for or against parole;
</P>
<P>
   _ Letters from the convict and his or her family and friends,
for or against parole;
</P>
<P>
   _ Paperwork from previous paroles and revocations, including
previous parole hearings and votes;
</P>
<P>
   _ Minute sheets showing parole members' votes and, if they
approve, the reasons for their vote and conditions of parole, such
as undergoing drug counseling or wearing an electronic monitoring
bracelet.

 &HT;    The secret world of the Texas parole board
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He was 21 when, in a flash of anger, he slammed
his 9-month-old niece to the floor because she was crying. A
cracked skull silenced her forever.
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary manslaughter, the jury called it, and gave the man
18 years in prison for his crime. He has done 10 and, because of
``good time'' laws that speed up the clock on sentences for good
behavior, he is scheduled to walk out of prison in just a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, three members of the state Board of Pardons
and Paroles sat inside a cluttered conference room in Northwest
Austin, deciding under what conditions the convicted baby-killer
will get his freedom. Same for a rapist with a preference for
14-year-old girls, a trigger-happy gangster who almost killed two
people, a longtime burglar who beat his girlfriend, a schizophrenic
arsonist and more than 100 other imprisoned criminals with
penchants for violence or sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: Protect the public
</P>
<P>
   But the public is nowhere to be found. The deliberations take
place behind closed doors in an increasingly controversial process
by which Texas decides which criminals should be freed early from
prison, under what rules those convicts must live, even whether
execution-bound convicts should receive clemency.
</P>
<P>
   It is also Texas' biggest state secret.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Friday, the parole board gave the press
unprecedented access to the clemency and parole process, as part of
a three-month examination into the inner workings of this mostly
hidden part of Texas' public justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The finding: troubling new questions about whether parole board
deliberations are too secretive and whether the public is being
unfairly left ignorant of criminals' early release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, parole board members insist that the secrecy is
a byproduct, not the driving force behind Texas' system. Because
members decide cases on their own, not together as a group as in
other states, they say there is no way to conduct the board's
business in public meetings _ and that was never the design.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we opened the current system, we would destroy it,'' argues
Victor Rodriguez, a former Brownsville cop who has been chairman of
the parole board four years. ``The volume of cases is too much for
a public hearing, public access to each one. There's a reason we do
this the way we do, and that is to protect the public safety and
public's interests in the best way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing chorus of critics disagrees. ``Our system needs to be
changed,'' said Jack Kyle, a retired prison administrator who
preceded Rodriguez as chairman. ``The public is going to have to
deal with these people coming out of prison, so why shouldn't they
be allowed to see the process work, to have a voice in it?''
</P>
<P>
   Texas will spend more than $300 million during the next two
years operating its parole system. Only $19 million will go for the
board's operation, roughly what security at the Texas Capitol will
cost.
</P>
<P>
   But its impact on the lives of everyday Texans is great: Last
year alone, it approved parole for 14,000 convicts and set
conditions of ``mandatory supervision'' for an additional 20,000
whose combination of time served and credit for good behavior
equaled their original prison sentence. Meanwhile, almost 9,000
parolees were sent back to prison for new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the 18 board members sent 13,000 parole violators
back to prison, denied parole for about 55,000 convicts, ruled on
129 requests for pardons, and denied all but one of the 11
last-minute pleas from convicted killers seeking to avoid
execution.
</P>
<P>
   In all, they cast 165,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   All from behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Making the call
</P>
<P>
   Inside a conference room ringed with stacks of brown file boxes
one Friday, three board members _ Gerald Garrett, Juanita Gonzalez
and Alvin Shaw _ decide the conditions of freedom for the worst of
Texas' worst, those convicts with a history of violence, sex crimes
or gang membership.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these files must be screened not once but twice by the
board, to ensure that the conditions of release are stringent
enough. SISP, this program is called _ parole-speak for Super
Intensive Supervised Parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sobering experience to make these decisions, knowing
it's just a matter of time until you get snake-bit by someone who
commits a new crime,'' says Shaw, a former Austin cop who has been
on the board for about two years. ``But public safety always is our
primary concern, even if the public probably doesn't really
understand what we do _ or why we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two board members review each case and approve. If they
disagree, a third member must break the tie.
</P>
<P>
   They can approve or deny paroles or ``set off'' the case for
review again in one to three years. For convicts slated for release
from prison on mandatory supervision, they set only the conditions
of that freedom _ everything from electronic monitoring bracelets
to drug counseling to staying away from schools and taverns and
victims.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, most of the cases are mandatory supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The board members clip along at about one case roughly every
seven minutes, one every four after a reporter stops asking
questions. Thick files take longer. Each must be opened, leafed
through, the pertinent documents perused. Members' votes are then
recorded on the left side of the folder in coded scribble. FI-4,
FI-2, FI-5 . 'Release to a half-way house, on a specified date,
after drug therapy.' E, M, R . 'Require vocational training,
registration as a sex offender, restitution.' And then, two
``ca-chuds'' by rubber stamps: ``Impose SISP. Continue action in
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   By lunchtime, more than 200 folders have been voted and boxed up
again, an assembly line of decisions that take place every day in
the seven regional parole board offices across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the pace of the morning's votes, there is still time for
occasional banter.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the repulse meter, this one is high,'' Garrett says of the
baby-killer, slowly leafing through a dog-eared 2-inch file on the
table before him. ``Just because she was crying. `Can you believe
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   He slides the file across the table to Shaw. ``Was out twice
before. Violated once when his wife caught him with another woman
and he punched her,'' Shaw says as he reads several pages. ``Bad
news. Bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he and Garrett decide that because the convict is to
be freed on mandatory supervision anyway in a few months, the best
plan is make him wear an electronic monitoring bracelet and remain
under almost constant surveillance by parole officers when he gets
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ca-chud.''
</P>
<P>
   In five hours, there is similar debate over other cases, each
convict with his or her own peculiar problems, each just a few
months from being released from prison whether the board approves
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Such as a 44-year-old man with a long history of mental illness,
a two-time loser who has been paroled twice before only to be sent
back for new crimes _ most recently for punching his 79-year-old
mother.
</P>
<P>
   And a 39-year-old man convicted of sodomizing a 15-year-old
cousin. He has refused to participate in sex-offender therapy even
though he has admitted molesting a sister, three nieces, eight
cousins and 10 neighborhood girls.
</P>
<P>
   And a 65-year-old arsonist who set fire to his suitcase outside
a parole office, just so he could return to prison.
</P>
<P>
   And a 24-year-old member of the Bloods street gang who racked up
45 disciplinary violations in prison for assaulting guards and
other convicts, destroying state property, even inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning, most of the 200 cases reviewed _ almost
everyone but some killers, rapists and the gang member _ are
approved. In almost every case, the board members worry about
whether the criminal will commit new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make the best decisions we can based on what we see in the
file,'' Gonzalez says. ``But we never know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw echoes those sentiments. ``These are the kinds of cases we
see every day, people someone else has attempted to raise _ and
failed. And now the public expects us to fix them somehow,'' he
says. ``But we're not miracle workers. We're just the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad the public can't see this. We're very
misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   In other states
</P>
<P>
   In other states, the public does see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything publicly,'' explained Ed Leyva, chairman of
Arizona's five-member Board of Executive Clemency. ``People are
cynical, and if we decided issues such as these behind closed
doors, they would wonder whether deals were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed Terry Jenks, director of the seven-member Oklahoma Board
of Pardons and Paroles: ``Releasing people from prison is certainly
something the public should have the opportunity to be involved
in.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, all parole cases must be discussed and voted on in a
public meeting. In Oklahoma, the paroles of all violent and major
felons must be approved in an open meeting while those for petty,
low-risk criminals can be approved administratively _ although the
records are open, so the public can track them. In both states, all
clemency cases for death row convicts are decided in a public
meeting where, as Leyva explains it, ``the inmate or his lawyer
gets a chance to have their say, prosecutors get to have their say,
relatives get to have their say, the public gets to have their
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Illinois, allow for confidential meetings
to protect witnesses or a victim's family. ``For the most part, we
let it all out in the public where it's all there for the public to
understand,'' said Ken Tupy, chief legal counsel for the 12-member
Illinois Prisoner Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, most parole records are publicly accessible, and
several even post lists of parole-eligible convicts on the Internet
so victims and citizens can protest _ or be alerted _ before a
convict is freed. In Texas, because of a 20-year-old secrecy law,
parole files and parole lists are off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   A irony in Texas: While parole decisions are made privately,
parole revocations by law are to done publicly _ even though the
public rarely attends because hearing schedules are not announced.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials argue that the other states' openness is
unworkable in Texas because of the volume of cases the board deals
with each year. By contrast, Oklahoma reviewed just 3,000 paroles
last year and Arizona just 1,600, while Texas reviewed more than
69,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Texas decided 11 clemency cases last year.
Arizona did five, Oklahoma four.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Texas parole board members argue that operating
in public would compromise their independence and throw a logjam in
front of the paperwork flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our volume, we can't have public meetings on every
case,'' Rodriguez said. ``I think we have a good, fair and just
system in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Misunderstood
</P>
<P>
   On another day, inside a cramped office at El Paso's district
parole office, ``good'' might not be the best description of Texas'
parole and clemency system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misunderstood'' might be a better one.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has flown in from San Antonio at dawn to help board
members Thomas Moss and Charles Shipman review and vote in more
than 200 parole and revocation cases. Now, after lunch, he has
settled in for a one-day-a-week ritual for most parole board
members: meeting with the public.
</P>
<P>
   This day, says Rodriguez, is fairly typical.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Guardado asks Rodriguez to make sure that the gang
members who killed his brother, Juan, in a local jail will never be
paroled. ``The system (stinks) because it let (one of the suspects)
go free'' without being charged, he says, lifting a framed portrait
of his brother onto the desk for Rodriguez to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe by the man upstairs that there will be justice, but
I can't see that now,'' Guardado says, choking back tears. ``Please
help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez cannot. The suspects, he learns, have not yet been
convicted. They are not in prison, but in the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't understand what the parole board does,
what my job is,'' Rodriguez tells Guardado. ``I have no purview
over this at this time. But I will try and factor in your concerns
at the proper time, certainly, if that is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He will repeat his explanation to two sisters who want to make
sure the man who killed their sister never moved back to El Paso,
an elderly couple who fear for their imprisoned son, and a woman
whose 15-year-old daughter was killed in 1993 by a hit-and-run
driver whom they tracked down on their own and made sure was sent
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man has left me without a future for my old age. That was
what I thought of my daughter as,'' Celestina Gutierrez says.
``Please help us.'' Several of the lawbreakers these victims have
come to complain about are not within Rodriguez' grasp. They are
not up for parole any time soon. ``This is very hard sometimes,
talking to these people, trying to help them,'' he says, putting
his face in his hands, after Gutierrez leaves. ``I have to try to
do what I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Rodriguez was explaining the system in El Paso, board
member Rissie Owens did the same thing inside three prisons around
Huntsville. She had arrived to talk to seven convicts whom she was
considering for parole, the few that she sees each week out of the
more than 100 cases she will decide.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, she asks the same questions over and over: Do you
have a parole plan? Do you have a place to live? Why should I let
you out?
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only ones I meet with are ones I have a question
about after I look through their file,'' says Owens, who has been
on the board four years. ``Mostly, they want to know how I'm going
to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   They get no answers. Owens tells them they can find that out
later by having a relative call her office.
</P>
<P>
   During the just-adjourned legislative session, victims advocates
strongly opposed bills to require the parole board to make parole
and clemency decisions in public. Even so, Dianne Clements,
president of the Houston-based Justice for All, the largest and
most influential of Texas' victim groups, says openness could be a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that the way the bills were written, that
they would create Commutation 101 _ that they would require the
parole board to commute death sentences,'' she said. ``If the
parole board adopted rules to open its process, open its records,
victims and relatives and the public could be the better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Top-secret files
</P>
<P>
   If the public in Texas has little understanding of the process,
neither do many of the convicts whose lives are governed by it, but
who by state law cannot even see their own files _ short of hiring
an attorney to subpoena them, something most cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``State law requires confidentiality of those files, and it
makes no exceptions,'' explains Laura McElroy, the parole board's
general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call it the most troubling part of the secretive
process.
</P>
<P>
   Reason: There is little way to detect mistakes in the files,
mistakes that can affect the outcome of a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it time and time again over the years,'' says Bill
Habern, a Huntsville-area lawyer who has specialized in parole
cases for two decades. Parole-hearing files and attorneys
interviewed by the Austin American-Statesman underscore his
warning.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a model convict was denied parole because his file
was mixed up with that of a misbehaving prisoner with the same name
who happened to be housed at the same prison. He was paroled after
the mistake was discovered by his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Another case file showed that a convict had shot his victim in
the back, and he was denied for parole by board members who later
said they considered him a cowardly criminal. In fact, autopsy
reports that were not in the file disclosed the fatal wound was
underneath the victim's arm _ bolstering his insistence that the
shooting was in self-defense. He, too, was later paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Even the final plea for mercy of Joseph Stanley Faulder, the
Canadian-born killer executed June 17, was hit by a paperwork
mistake. During an Austin federal court hearing last December, it
was revealed that an East Texas sheriff had written a protest
letter asserting that Faulder had killed someone while in prison _
which he never had.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of Texas convicts up for parole or early
release ever see a parole board member, although in recent months
convicts on death row have had the option. In other states, a large
percentage do _ giving board members, victims and the convicts a
chance to catch errors and speak their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those files can be filled with mistakes and lies and no one
will ever know,'' Habern said. ``The secrecy that surrounds this
system is very dangerous. We should open the system up to protect
everyone _ including the public.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is 1996. Donny Osmond is starring in Andrew Lloyd
Webber's musical, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in
Minneapolis. As he strides to the stage, Osmond begins to perspire
_ profusely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this sick feeling in my stomach,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   The stage manager announces it's 15 minutes to show time. Now
Osmond is shaking uncontrollably. By the time the makeup people put
on his wig, Osmond is crying like a lost toddler at an amusement
park. He's sweating so much, the glue from his wig won't even stick
to his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was having a nervous breakdown,'' he says quietly.
``I didn't know what was wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmond wasn't suffering a nervous breakdown. He wasn't having a
heart attack or dying.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to fathom, but the one-time teen sensation who
began his professional career at age 6 in 1963 on The Andy Williams
Show, was petrified of going on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The forever dimpled pop icon finally came to grips with the fact
that he suffered from social phobia, a rather common social anxiety
disorder that results from a fear of being ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in time, I said, `I don't care what the tabloids
say, I need some help,''' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old Osmond details his painfully emotional battles
with panic attacks in his autobiography, Life Is Just What You Make
It: My Story So Far (Hyperion, $22.95).
</P>
<P>
   In his rather candid book, which was co-written by Patricia
Romanowski (Dream Girl: My Life as a Supreme ; Truly Blessed with
Teddy Pendergrass), Osmond relates what it was like growing up in
front of America in a show business family and writes how difficult
it was to fight the perception he was a washed-up has-been in the
early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact was, my teen idol years had cost me my credibility as
a singer and as a musician,'' Osmond writes.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s should have been the best of times for Osmond. As the
lead singer of the Brady Bunch-clean Osmond Brothers, Donny was a
bona fide heartthrob before he hit puberty. With a string of
bubblegum hits like Puppy Love and Go Away Little Girl, Osmond was
the Leonardo DiCaprio of the '70s. He was cute, had great hair and
even greater teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But when the music stopped and stage lights dimmed, the kid with
the 500-watt smile was often just another, sad, lonely and scared
little boy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Osmond was 7, he wrote a letter to his mother from
Sweden, practically begging her to bring him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I didn't want any part of this,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was never acknowledged, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably made the right decision,'' says Osmond, noting
that this book strained his relationship with his parents. ``She
really couldn't do anything about it. The mechanism was strong, it
was making money. How could you pull it apart? It just didn't make
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not make sense to many that this 36-year show business
veteran would be afflicted with severe panic attacks. In fact, a
few years ago when Osmond was about to co-host Live with Regis and
Kathie Lee, he threw up the moment before he went on.
</P>
<P>
   You can trace the roots of Osmond's disorder to his almost
demonic need to be perfect and please everyone. Osmond is a classic
Type A personality. That means he works hard to achieve great
things and when he fails, he beats himself up over every mistake.
For Donny Osmond, failure is never an option.
</P>
<P>
   He had to be great in everything he did. Singing. Dancing. Ice
skating. You name it.
</P>
<P>
   Osmond admits his parents weren't that affectionate and were
often hard-driving. While they loved their nine kids, they spent
most of their time overseeing the Osmond family phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so busy as kids, we never really had time to express
our feelings and to be honest,'' he notes. ``It was, like, `Come
on, get the job done ... be a professional.' Saying that to a 7-,
8-, 9-year-old kid hurts. It can take a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   So Osmond suffered in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I covered up my feelings for the sake of my image,'' he says.
``Growing up I had extremes. I had people screaming after me and I
had people spitting at me. As a teenager, you're trying to find
yourself as it is. Dealing with those extremes can mess up a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Osmond managed to control his fears. While he
was always nervous before performances, once he heard the applause,
the nervousness would diminish.
</P>
<P>
   But as he got older, the panic attacks got worse. It got to the
point where it was hard to function in normal life. Attending
cocktail parties, for instance, struck sheer terror in Osmond.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a psychologist, Osmond, who now hosts the
syndicated talk show Donny &AMP; Marie with his sister, took control of
his fear. While Osmond points out he's not completely cured, he has
stopped viewing every mistake as Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I'm on television with Marie, I know I'll probably
make a mistake,'' he says. ``I've made some great faux pas in our
shows. But you know what? It's OK. It's fine because we all make
mistakes and you should be able to laugh about them because it
makes you real.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmond, who lives with his wife Debbie and their five sons in
Provo, Utah, is certainly able to laugh more freely. For instance,
when asked what kind of toothpaste the toothy star uses, he cracks,
``I ought to slap you right now. It's so funny, if you asked me
that question five, 10 years ago, it really would've upset me
because I would've been thinking, `C'mon, give me a break. I'm just
normal. My teeth aren't that big.' But I can understand where it
comes from now because that was my image, you know, the guy who
smiles all the time and he sings songs like sweet, innocent,
lollipops, lace, lipstick and all that kind of teeny-bopper
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And the answer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I use Colgate.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmond says he would never push his kids into Hollywood's
blinding lights. However, one of his sons is already in a punk rock
band called Sudden Urge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost joined the mosh pit,'' says Osmond, referring to when
he attended one of his son's concerts, ``but he said, `No.' He
looked at me and said, `Dad, don't you even think about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Osmond mostly thinks about now is getting better and
exorcising his demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is my therapist now,'' he says. ``Now everybody
knows the real me. It was really difficult to be open and honest,
but I'm glad I did it because I feel so much better about myself
since I'm not hiding anything.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Visit to the Mouse King
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I gave my granddaughter, Mira, a video of ``The Nutcracker''
ballet for her third birthday a couple of days ago. Mira is very
big on ballet. We watched it together.
</P>
<P>
   Mira got a little tense when the Mouse King turned up with his
Mouse army. I offered to fast-forward through the scary parts.
``Maybe it will turn out all right,'' she said, considering the
options.
</P>
<P>
   She asked a lot of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Papa, she's a lady pretending to be a girl pretending to be
a lady?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Ummm, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Papa, is he (Drosselmeyer) a good guy or a bad guy?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Ummm, all uncles are good guys.'' (Mine were, hers are.
Yes, I know he's a godfather, but try explaining that.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Papa, is he (Mouse King) a good guy or a bad guy?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Ummm, he's a pretend bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Papa, do you know everything?''
</P>
<P>
   This grandfather gig isn't as bad as it's made out to be.

LARGE-SIZE MODELS FIND THEMSELVES IN GREATER DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   Charity Shields, a young single
mother, was shopping in a Kansas City store when she was mistaken
for another person _ a model. At size 18, Shields was a bit taken
aback, but the idea so intrigued her that she went searching for a
modeling agency.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years later she is working regularly for such clients as
Wal-Mart, Lane Bryant Stores and the Jones Store in addition to
holding down a job as a workers' compensation claims adjuster and
caring for her 5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Shields is among a growing number of models caught up in the
explosive energy of a profession that used to stigmatize large
women.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Stonestreet, size 14 and a special education teacher in
Lawrence, decided to investigate modeling at the urging of her
brother, Los Angeles actor Eric Stonestreet. She has been so
successful in the Kansas City area that in September she will move
to Chicago to pursue a full-time career.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Smith answered a classified ad for a plus-size model
two years ago. Now Julie Wolf, owner of the Agency, a Kansas City
modeling representative, says, ``I wish I could clone her.'' And
Kim Hoffman, owner of Hoffman Models in Overland Park, says she is
actively scouting for plus-size talent, encouraging people at
weight-loss centers to watch for potential models.
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been so. Christine Alt, a celebrity plus-size
model and frequent spokeswoman, says when she started as a model in
1981, ``there was no such thing as a plus size.''
</P>
<P>
   When she gained weight and moved into large sizes in 1986, there
were only ``two or three agencies and a handful of models.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are hundreds out there, instead of just a hundred,''
says Alt who appears on the July//August cover of BBW (Big
Beautiful Woman) magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The plus-size model field probably has quadrupled in most major
cities in recent years, says Catherine Lippincott, director of
public relations for Lane Bryant, the Limited's retail chain that
specializes in large sizes. ``Now you can find just any look you
need,'' in any size, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Plus-size images are gaining prominence. Emme, the stylish blond
model, appears on the cable channel E's ``Fashion Emergency.'' The
high visibility of such celebrities as ABC Television's Star Jones,
Rosie O'Donnell, Cybill Shepherd and Kate Winslet is providing
positive ego reinforcement for many women.
</P>
<P>
   Mode magazine, a publication devoted to large women is in its
third year of publication and added Girl for teens earlier this
year. BBW magazine relaunched on the West Coast earlier this
summer. Anjellika recently was the first plus-size model voted to
an international models' association hall of fame, notes Gary
Dakin, a plus-size model for the Ford Agency in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The field of large-size modeling has grown ``beyond my own
dreams,'' says Susan Georget, the founder and director of
Willhelmina Models' Plus Size division, which is now getting
requests from major European fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, credit in part goes to the apparel industry. Designers
and manufacturers have suddenly awakened to a massive untapped
market of fashion-conscious consumers who until recently had
limited choices beyond pull-on pants and tunics. More and more name
designers including Emanuel Ungaro, Gianfranco Ferre, Givenchy and
Giorgio Armani have added plus-size collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a growth area for us,'' says Tina Hodak, the
St. Louis-based fashion director for Kansas City's Jones Store Co.
The store will debut Lauren by Ralph Lauren in large sizes this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Alt says the clothing industry boom is also a result of
consumers raising their voices. ``The reason it happened is because
of the women,'' she said. ``They wrote letters. They complained.
They let them know they were sick of stretch green polyester pants.
They were heard.''
</P>
<P>
   And manufacturers are responding in a big way. Lane Bryant has
launched a major promotional effort to address a young, hip
customer. The company contracted with Camryn Manheim of
television's ``The Practice'' to be a celebrity model and broadcast
a New York fashion show on the Web last week.
</P>
<P>
   Today's fashion essentials such Capri pants, drawstring pants
and skirts, cargo pockets and camisole sweater sets are now
flooding stores in all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, plus-size models did not always enjoy the same
glamorous image as other models. They didn't get paid as much,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Alt says that in her early days, some photographers simply
refused to shoot plus-size models. And smaller models made a point
to ignore them on jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has changed dramatically now and ``the industry is
one big happy family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the stigma has mostly disappeared. Rates have almost
closed ranks, says Ford's Dakin, and discrepancies in treatment
have dropped if not totally disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica La Voie, a young Kansas City area woman, is working
quite happily as a size 14 with New York's Wilhelmina Agency. But
she recalls her move there two years ago, when no budget was
provided to help her find housing, unlike with other models. She
found herself living in a rodent-infested hotel for a time.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ford agency, Dakin says all the models, regardless of
size, are ``handled with kid gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, requirements for plus-size models are comparable to
those of other models. They must be at least 5 feet 9 inches tall
and well-proportioned. (Most work out to stay toned.)
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, larger sizes such as 16 and 18 seem to be most
in demand. ``Julie encouraged me to gain weight,'' says Elizabeth
Smith of her agent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, size 14 may be the most prevalent, but Lane
Bryant's Lippincott says the company uses most sizes in their
shows, and 14 to 16 for shoots because those are the sample sizes.
Mode tends to use models size 12, 14 and 16, says Nancy LeWinter,
publication director.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond size, all models should have ``an inviting personality,''
as Kim Hoffman calls it, or ``a certain energy,'' says LeWinter.

BLUEPRINT FOR A FROZEN TORTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do an ice cream torte and a skyscraper have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers wouldn't dream of constructing a column of granite,
steel and glass without a plan to ensure its stability. Never mind
that there's a tower leaning 17 feet from the perpendicular over in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Kudos to the smart cookie who invented springform pans to hold
dense desserts built on fragile crumb crusts. With such a sturdy
base, even the noncook can construct a rather impressive torte
without fear of structural failure.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a blueprint for building your own frozen ice cream
torte: Take a cookie-crumb crust (the foundation), add scoops of
softened ice cream (the building blocks), drizzle with a gooey
dessert sauce (think mortar to cement the ``blocks'' together) and
garnish with a few sprinkles (the architectural details).
</P>
<P>
   The molded layers can be varied to suit your tastes. Don't like
coffee-flavored ice cream? Try pralines and cream ice cream
instead. Vary the type of crushed cookies in the crust, swirl
sauces with a flourish or go baroque with garnishes.
</P>
<P>
   Since discovering a recipe for Frozen Mocha Torte in Creme de
Colorado Cookbook by the Junior League of Denver, I have used it as
a springboard to other flavors and combinations. For instance, when
the mocha-flavored torte of the original recipe proved rather adult
for my 5-year-old son's birthday, I created a strawberry-vanilla
torte on an Oreo crust and sprinkled it with mini M&AMP;M's.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't already own a springform pan, they're fairly
inexpensive and sold at department stores and cookware stores. I
bought a set of 9-inch and 6-inch pans for $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get fancy you can also pick up an ice cream
spade, a flat-ish ice cream scoop, to help smooth things along. I
found one at the supermarket for a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a cookie-crumb crust, which takes about 15 minutes to
assemble and bake, there's no heat involved. If this all seems just
a little too easy, feel free to make a stovetop dessert sauce from
scratch, although a store-bought ice cream sauce (not syrup) will
do nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Use the following lists of mix-and-match ingredients to build
the frozen torte of your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Foundations
</P>
<P>
   Elinor Klivens, author of Bake and Freeze Chocolate Desserts
(Broadway), bakes these cookie crumb crusts at 325 degrees for 6
minutes in a 9-inch springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Cracker Crumb: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 3/4
teaspoon ground cinnamon, 5 tablespoons unsalted melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Cracker Crumb Crust With Nuts: 1 cup finely chopped nuts
(walnuts, pecans or toasted almonds), 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon
graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 5 tablespoons
unsalted melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Cracker or Chocolate Wafer Cookie Crumb Crust: 2 cups
chocolate wafer crumbs (9-ounce package), 6 tablespoons unsalted
melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Cracker or Chocolate Wafer Crumb Crust with Chocolate
Chips: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker or chocolate wafer cookie crumbs,
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 5 tablespoons unsalted melted
butter, 1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   Oreo cookie crumb crust: 2 1/4 cups Oreo cookie crumbs with
filling (about 3 1/3 cups Oreos), 2 tablespoons unsalted melted
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Adler, author of A Kansas City Christmas Cookbook (Two
Lane Press), bakes this one at 350 degrees for 12 minutes in an
8-inch springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   Macadamia nut crust: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup
melted butter, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: Baked crumb crusts may be stored in the freezer for up to
1 month.)
</P>
<P>
   Mortar
</P>
<P>
   Whether you prefer storebought or homemade dessert sauces, heat
room temperature or chilled sauces for 5 to 10 seconds in the
microwave to help it drizzle better. Just be sure it's completely
cooled so it won't melt the ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Amaretto Caramel Sauce: 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup water, 1 teaspoon
vanilla extract, 1 cup heavy cream or condensed skim milk, 1/4 cup
amaretto.
</P>
<P>
   Combine sugar, water and vanilla in a heavy saucepan, and stir
over low heat to dissolve sugar. Increase heat to medium-high and
boil, without stirring, until mixture turns golden brown (about 5
to 10 minutes). Remove from heat and carefully whisk in cream.
Return to low heat and stir until mixture thickens (about 5
minutes). Remove from heat and stir in amaretto. Allow to cool.
Makes 2 1/2 cups. _ A Kansas City Christmas Cookbook by Karen Adler
and Jane Doyle Guthrie
</P>
<P>
   Scotch Butterscotch Sauce: 1 cup packed light brown sugar, 1/3
cup heavy cream, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons dark
corn syrup, 2 tablespoons Scotch whisky, 1 teaspoon vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, slowly bring the brown sugar, cream,
butter and corn syrup to a boil over medium heat, stirring
constantly to dissolve sugar. Boil gently, stirring often, until
the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat and stir in the Scotch and vanilla until
blended. Makes about 1 cup. Allow to cool. _ Short &AMP; Sweet
(Houghton Mifflin) by Melanie Barnard
</P>
<P>
   Hot Chocolate Drizzle: 1 1/2 cups light corn syrup, 1/3 cup
unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 cup water, pinch of salt, 1
tablespoon butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the corn syrup, cocoa, water and salt in a 4-cup or
larger microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, uncovered, on high, for 3
minutes or until boiling. Remove from the microwave, add the butter
and vanilla, and stir until the butter melts and the mixture is
well blended. Allow to cool. _ Desperation Dinners! (Workman) by
Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross
</P>
<P>
   Pineapple-Apricot Sundae Sauce: 1 lemon, 1 jar (12 ounces)
apricot preserves, 1/3 cup light or dark brown sugar, firmly
packed, 1/3 cup unsweetened pineapple juice.
</P>
<P>
   Grate enough zest from the lemon to make 1 1/2 teaspoons.
Reserve the remaining lemon for another use. Combine the zest with
the remaining ingredients in a 4-cup or larger microwave-safe bowl.
Microwave 2 minutes, uncovered, on high. The preserves should be
melted and the mixture warm throughout. Remove from the microwave
and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Allow to cool. Keep
leftovers in the refrigerator. Makes about 2 cups. _ Desperation
Dinners! by Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross
</P>
<P>
   Hot Fudge Sauce: 6 ounces unsweetened chocolate, 4 tablespoons
butter, 2 cups sugar, 1 cup half-and-half, 14 ounces sweetened
condensed milk, 3 tablespoons brandy, bourbon, rum or favorite
liqueur (optional).
</P>
<P>
   In medium saucepan, melt chocolate and butter over low heat,
stirring constantly. Add sugar and half-and-half, and continue
cooking until thick. Gradually add condensed milk. Cook 20 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Stir in liqueur, if using. This keeps almost
indefinitely in the refrigerator. After it's cooled, you may need
to reheat for 30 seconds in the microwave or reheat on the stove
until pourable. Can freeze for up to 2 weeks before serving. Cover
with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Makes 2 1/2 to 3 cups. _ Creme

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can burning a little incense and lighting a few candles help
make chopping vegetables a meditative experience?
</P>
<P>
   If you've never thought about the karma of cooking, whether a
soup is yin or yang or about the feng shui, the ``life flow,'' of
your kitchen, you might dismiss all of this as so much New Age
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on the cusp of a new millennium, when so many of us are
dreaming of the Jetson-style kitchen of the future, there's a faint
yet audible mantra emanating from what I call spiritual cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The budding genre reveres the kitchen as a sort of holy
sanctuary. The act of cooking becomes an exercise in meditation and
astute eating is a recipe for salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the sampling bearing quasi-mystical titles that have
landed on my desk in recent weeks:
</P>
<P>
   - The Sacred Kitchen (New World Library, $16.95), by Robert and
Jon Robertson. Its authors relied on sacred texts from throughout
the world to uncover a higher consciousness in the act of cooking
and eating.
</P>
<P>
   - The Tao of Food (A Godsfield Book, $24.95), by Richard Craze
and Roni Jay. Using the ancient Chinese principles now more than
3,000 years old, this system of thinking and eating is based on
common sense and simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   - A Simple Celebration: A Vegetarian Cookbook for Body, Mind and
Spirit (Harmony Books, $23), by Ginny Bell Bragg and David Simon
with a foreword by Deepak Chopra. Based on Ayurvedic health
practices, taste charts are used to help balance body types.
</P>
<P>
   - Healing Secrets of the Seasons (Morrow, $27), by Judith Benn
Hurley. An amalgam of ancient philosophies, Hurley emphasizes
listening to nature's rhythms to eat more healthfully.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 trend forecasters tell us cooking is quickly becoming
more of a hobby and less of a necessity. No one need cook to
survive. But who knew it could be a way to self-improvement?
</P>
<P>
   The Sacred Kitchen, for instance, seeks to help cooks ``achieve
centeredness to free yourself from stress, to be mindful of the
moment to alleviate worry and to stay focused and peaceful while
you cook. It helps you `get into the act' of cooking and look
forward to dinnertime, not as another chore in your busy day, but
as a haven for relaxation and recharging.''
</P>
<P>
   On nights after work when I look into the jumbled depths of my
refrigerator with despair and try to fathom just what's for dinner,
I can only dream of that peaceful, easy feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the act of cooking and eating is a daily ritual that should
nurture the body. And there are times when it can even touch the
soul.
</P>
<P>
   The late food writer M.F.K. Fisher once wrote: ``Any time we eat
it's holy. We should have ritual and ceremony, not just gobbling
down some food to keep alive.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a fashion explosion in the moderate and
better plus-size market, spurred by women in their 20s and early
30s who are demanding the same styles as their regular-size peers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from firms such as Delta Burke, McNaughton Apparel,
Karen Kane and August Silk, which once played it safe with fashion
for the full-figured customer, are now coming out with such trendy
looks as capris, pants with cargo pockets and scoopnecks.
</P>
<P>
   The push began last year, but should be more dramatic for
fall/holiday.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is Lane Bryant, Limited's
750-store plus-size chain, which has been pushing bare looks for
several years. This spring, it has done well with capris, which hit
four inches below the knee, and pedal-pushers, five inches above
the ankle. The store has also done well with peasant blouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a gamble, and the (capri) looks did better than we
thought. It was a pleasant surprise,'' said Chris Hansen, vice
president of marketing and creative, adding that the cropped pants
sold out. ``It is a flattering look, something that she would not
have thought she could wear.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the chain will offer a wider version.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant is also continuing to show its pants with cargo
treatments, which were unveiled in stores two years ago. She added
that the pockets are positioned on the hip.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chain will offer vests in fleece, quilted nylon
and nylon stretch. There will also be jersey camisoles in nylon
stretch, merchandised with woven shirtings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a fabulous fashion cycle, and there is a pent-up
demand among our customers for newness,'' she said, adding that
Lane Bryant is experiencing double-digit sales increases this
season over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Major better and moderate sportswear resources are following
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, McNaughton Apparel, which over the past year
has made the color and print palette of its plus-size moderate
line, Maggie McNaughton, in sync with the fashion colors and prints
of its regular-size line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the plus-size customer wanted brights in the
tops. On the bottoms, they just wanted black or navy, and they
weren't willing to try wines or olives,'' said Lynn Fish, executive
vice president of design and merchandising at McNaughton Apparel.
``Now, they want softer colors such as pinks, soft yellows and
celadons. The fashion is being pushed by our younger customers, who
are in their 20s and 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaughton is interpreting all the silhouettes for the plus-size
woman. The fall lineup includes double-layer skirts and hooded
zip-front deconstructed knit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plus-size customer likes hoods. She tends to like more
casual looks,'' said Fish.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2000, the company is coming out with capris for the
first time _ for both the Norton McNaughton and the Maggie
McNaughton consumer. They will be in stretch twills and patterned
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   However, the firm will offer only clam-diggers, which offer more
leg exposure, for its Norton McNaughton customer.
</P>
<P>
   Fish added that for that same season, the company is also
interpreting the cropped drawstring sweater in plus sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Burke, who designs a plus-size line that bears her name,
said the demand for more fashion has made creating her collection a
lot more fun. She added that ``the stores are coming around'' to
demanding sexier styles.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's, she said, requested a line of teddies for fall.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's holiday lineup includes sweater sets in Lurex metallics,
which hit at the middle of the hip; capris, which are 24 inches _
an inch longer than the style's standard; trouser skirts and cargo
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that interpreting the cargo pants was a bit tricky.
Instead of putting the pocket on the side, which would have added
more bulk to the garment, she said she placed it on the front of
the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want color and novelty fashion, and they want it at the
same time as the rest of the store,'' said Fern Bratten, designer
of a two-year-old plus-size line that bears her name.
</P>
<P>
   The line, which is in 400 doors, is a division of Kellwood's
David Dart Design Group.
</P>
<P>
   She said there is a ``younger spirit'' in the misses' plus-size
market. She believes that helping the fashion movement are such
plus-size personalities as actress Camryn Manheim of ``The
Practice'' and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of Bratten's pants business is comprised of
pull-on elastic pants in garment-washed linen and Tencel, she is
offering one capri style, which hits midcalf, and cropped pants.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also continue to offer pants with cargo
pockets, which first hit the stores in May, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that stretch and capris are selling is proof that the
plus-size customer is taking more risks,'' said Bratten, who just
completed a 67-city tour in three months, visiting store accounts.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``They are making peace with their size, and not
waiting to lose those 50 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bratten is also shortening some of the jackets, to be
in sync with the trend to cropped looks.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Blair, vice president of sales at better-price sportswear
resource Karen Kane, admitted she wasn't prepared for the fashion
demands of the full-figured consumer when the company expanded into
large sizes this spring. Sure, the spring lineup, which offered a
combination of knit, Tencel and linen dressing, did well, but she
said the firm could have maximized the business even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit too conservative,'' Blair acknowledged. ``We
thought that the customer wanted to be more covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The plus-size line, which was unveiled in 75 doors and was under
Karen Kane Sport, went too deep in black and navy, ignored capris,
which were offered in both its misses' and petite lines, and didn't
have any pink. It also did not offer stretch, and could have used
more hooded looks, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, she admitted, was that the company had
thought the plus-size line would appeal to an older group, women
from 35 to 55. However, company officials soon found out that it
also drew women in their early 20s to early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be a crop of young women who are demanding
something new,'' Blair said. ``They want the colors, the special
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Karen Kane is showing trendier looks such as stretch
jackets and is expanding plus sizes to its Lifestyle label, which
is more fashion-oriented than its Sport line. The plus-size line
will be expanded to 100 doors.
</P>
<P>
   For fall/holiday, only about 40 percent of the plus-size
collection will be in black and navy, compared with 60 percent this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kane is also showing more embroidered tops, and item
T-shirts, Blair said, adding, ``The line was too group focused.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the collection will be in 100 doors. Wholesale volume
should be about $5 million in its first year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   August Silk, a better-price silk resource, which has long
offered plus sizes, is now out to ``maximize'' the business,
according to Jack Weinstock, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely plan to intensify the business,'' he said. ``We
had offered basics in the past. Now, we are offering more
fashion.'' &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a fashion explosion in the moderate and
better plus-size market, spurred by women in their 20s and early
30s who are demanding the same styles as their regular-size peers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from firms such as Delta Burke, McNaughton Apparel,
Karen Kane and August Silk, which once played it safe with fashion
for the full-figured customer, are now coming out with such trendy
looks as capris, pants with cargo pockets and scoopnecks.
</P>
<P>
   The push began last year, but should be more dramatic for
fall/holiday.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is Lane Bryant, Limited's
750-store plus-size chain, which has been pushing bare looks for
several years. This spring, it has done well with capris, which hit
four inches below the knee, and pedal-pushers, five inches above
the ankle. The store has also done well with peasant blouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a gamble, and the (capri) looks did better than we
thought. It was a pleasant surprise,'' said Chris Hansen, vice
president of marketing and creative, adding that the cropped pants
sold out. ``It is a flattering look, something that she would not
have thought she could wear.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the chain will offer a wider version.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant is also continuing to show its pants with cargo
treatments, which were unveiled in stores two years ago. She added
that the pockets are positioned on the hip.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chain will offer vests in fleece, quilted nylon
and nylon stretch. There will also be jersey camisoles in nylon
stretch, merchandised with woven shirtings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a fabulous fashion cycle, and there is a pent-up
demand among our customers for newness,'' she said, adding that
Lane Bryant is experiencing double-digit sales increases this
season over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Major better and moderate sportswear resources are following
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, McNaughton Apparel, which over the past year
has made the color and print palette of its plus-size moderate
line, Maggie McNaughton, in sync with the fashion colors and prints
of its regular-size line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the plus-size customer wanted brights in the
tops. On the bottoms, they just wanted black or navy, and they
weren't willing to try wines or olives,'' said Lynn Fish, executive
vice president of design and merchandising at McNaughton Apparel.
``Now, they want softer colors such as pinks, soft yellows and
celadons. The fashion is being pushed by our younger customers, who
are in their 20s and 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaughton is interpreting all the silhouettes for the plus-size
woman. The fall lineup includes double-layer skirts and hooded
zip-front deconstructed knit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plus-size customer likes hoods. She tends to like more
casual looks,'' said Fish.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2000, the company is coming out with capris for the
first time _ for both the Norton McNaughton and the Maggie
McNaughton consumer. They will be in stretch twills and patterned
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   However, the firm will offer only clam-diggers, which offer more
leg exposure, for its Norton McNaughton customer.
</P>
<P>
   Fish added that for that same season, the company is also
interpreting the cropped drawstring sweater in plus sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Burke, who designs a plus-size line that bears her name,
said the demand for more fashion has made creating her collection a
lot more fun. She added that ``the stores are coming around'' to
demanding sexier styles.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's, she said, requested a line of teddies for fall.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's holiday lineup includes sweater sets in Lurex metallics,
which hit at the middle of the hip; capris, which are 24 inches _
an inch longer than the style's standard; trouser skirts and cargo
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that interpreting the cargo pants was a bit tricky.
Instead of putting the pocket on the side, which would have added
more bulk to the garment, she said she placed it on the front of
the pants.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Backstreet Boys recently paid a visit to the
MTV studios here, they attracted so many teen-age fans, it created
gridlock in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   According to MTV approximately 9.5 million viewers tuned in to
watch the band's live appearance over the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, this super hot pop group will play 46
shows in 34 European cities this summer. Now who wants to dress The
Backstreet Boys?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger, BCBG and Versace are among those already
wardrobing the band. Not to mention Sears, the presenting sponsor
of the band's 50-city North American tour, September through
December 99, which plans to dress them in its private label, Canyon
River Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is there's a whole slew of hot, up-and-coming
bands that have Backstreet Boy potential and are just waiting for
the right brand, designer or retailer to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsorship is all about the hot new bands,'' said Barry
Blevins, fashion director at Rolling Stone. ``Designers today are
trying to link up with any musician they can, but it's the new and
up-and-coming artists who are hip and reach that youth market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationships are often difficult to manage and
maintain. Giorgio Armani had a six-year relationship with Ricky
Martin, but when Martin became an overnight sensation in the last
few months (Time magazine cover, ``Today'' show appearances),
Armani moved quickly to reinforce the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what it means to actually dress a band is given to a
variety of interpretations. Lots of people may claim to be
providing clothes, but the musicians are fickle so there's no
guarantee they'll ever wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these musicians won't wear a certain product
on stage, so actually trying to dress them is futile,'' said Dick
Baker, ceo of OP.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker is spending $4 million to link his brand to music.
The way he's doing it, however, is by sponsoring the actual music
event. This summer, OP is working with Spin magazine to advertise a
sweepstakes for consumers to win an all-expense-paid trip to any
summer concert of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot to choose from with artists like Britney
Spears, Lauryn Hill, N' Sync, Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls all
scheduled to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of
exploding teen acts, it will be a good year for the record
business.''
</P>
<P>
   White added that a good year for music also means a good year
for fashion and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designers are eager and the artists are in a position to
pick and choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's one designer who has positioned himself as the
leader of the trend, it's Tommy Hilfiger. He dubbed 1999 ``The year
of music'' and said musicians are one of the best sources of
fashion information in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``Tommy is the best at it. He invented fashion and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker added that Hilfiger also has the budget to make the
relationships happen. This summer Tommy Jeans is the presenting
sponsor of Britney Spears' 48-city North American tour (June 28 to
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5), providing all her outfits for appearances on- and
offstage and tying in retail contests where consumers can win free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sponsorship of the tour will also include Tommy
Jeans signage on all concert tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Girl, the fragrance, will be sponsoring the Lilith Fair,
the all-women concert that will tour nationwide from July 8 to Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Hilfiger, vice president public relations of
Tommy Jeans, 75 percent of this year's marketing budget for Tommy
Jeans is allocated to music.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive sponsorship, like the one Tommy Jeans has with
Spears, is a deal coveted by most brands, but also one that's tough
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, for example, has not only worked with brands like
PNB for the Billboard awards, but was most recently outfitted
exclusively by Levi's for her first international tour and is
frequently dressed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spin's White, the competition to dress Hill is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to simple arithmetic _ how many Lauryn Hills are
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that giants like Armani, Levi's and Hilfiger own the
category. BC Ethic, a $25 million streetwear company, is dressing
such hot groups as Barenaked Ladies and C Note. BC Ethic's
relationships don't involve signed contracts and the company makes
a point of not shipping unsolicited clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chasing music stars,'' said BC Ethic's Jim Huber.
``I'm communicating with them at an equal level. The only way I'd
be involved with a band is if they actually like the product. I
think it's kind of arrogant just to send out free trunks of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans giant Levi's takes a different approach and is involved
with over 200 music sponsorships this year. According to Joe
Townsend, manager of music sponsorships at Levi's, the company's
main focus this summer is music marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important ways for us to reach our
target consumer,'' he said. ``A relationship like the one we have
with Hill is repositioning us as a brand that consumers like. Over
the next 18 months, as we look for new and original musicians,
consumers will see Levi's as cool and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is linking up with three of this summer's hottest bands,
the Goo Goo Dolls, Sugar Ray and Fastball, sponsoring the Levi's
'99 Fuse tour. The 43-date tour will feature a medley of
up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

   ``Sponsorship is all about the hot new bands,'' said Barry
Blevins, fashion director at Rolling Stone. ``Designers today are
trying to link up with any musician they can, but it's the new and
up-and-coming artists who are hip and reach that youth market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationships are often difficult to manage and
maintain. Giorgio Armani had a six-year relationship with Ricky
Martin, but when Martin became an overnight sensation in the last
few months (Time magazine cover, ``Today'' show appearances),
Armani moved quickly to reinforce the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what it means to actually dress a band is given to a
variety of interpretations. Lots of people may claim to be
providing clothes, but the musicians are fickle so there's no
guarantee they'll ever wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these musicians won't wear a certain product
on stage, so actually trying to dress them is futile,'' said Dick
Baker, ceo of OP.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker is spending $4 million to link his brand to music.
The way he's doing it, however, is by sponsoring the actual music
event. This summer, OP is working with Spin magazine to advertise a
sweepstakes for consumers to win an all-expense-paid trip to any
summer concert of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot to choose from with artists like Britney
Spears, Lauryn Hill, N' Sync, Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls all
scheduled to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of
exploding teen acts, it will be a good year for the record
business.''
</P>
<P>
   White added that a good year for music also means a good year
for fashion and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designers are eager and the artists are in a position to
pick and choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's one designer who has positioned himself as the
leader of the trend, it's Tommy Hilfiger. He dubbed 1999 ``The year
of music'' and said musicians are one of the best sources of
fashion information in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``Tommy is the best at it. He invented fashion and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker added that Hilfiger also has the budget to make the
relationships happen. This summer Tommy Jeans is the presenting
sponsor of Britney Spears' 48-city North American tour (June 28 to
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5), providing all her outfits for appearances on- and
offstage and tying in retail contests where consumers can win free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sponsorship of the tour will also include Tommy
Jeans signage on all concert tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Girl, the fragrance, will be sponsoring the Lilith Fair,
the all-women concert that will tour nationwide from July 8 to Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Hilfiger, vice president public relations of
Tommy Jeans, 75 percent of this year's marketing budget for Tommy
Jeans is allocated to music.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive sponsorship, like the one Tommy Jeans has with
Spears, is a deal coveted by most brands, but also one that's tough
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, for example, has not only worked with brands like
PNB for the Billboard awards, but was most recently outfitted
exclusively by Levi's for her first international tour and is
frequently dressed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spin's White, the competition to dress Hill is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to simple arithmetic _ how many Lauryn Hills are
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that giants like Armani, Levi's and Hilfiger own the
category. BC Ethic, a $25 million streetwear company, is dressing
such hot groups as Barenaked Ladies and C Note. BC Ethic's
relationships don't involve signed contracts and the company makes
a point of not shipping unsolicited clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chasing music stars,'' said BC Ethic's Jim Huber.
``I'm communicating with them at an equal level. The only way I'd
be involved with a band is if they actually like the product. I
think it's kind of arrogant just to send out free trunks of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans giant Levi's takes a different approach and is involved
with over 200 music sponsorships this year. According to Joe
Townsend, manager of music sponsorships at Levi's, the company's
main focus this summer is music marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important ways for us to reach our
target consumer,'' he said. ``A relationship like the one we have
with Hill is repositioning us as a brand that consumers like. Over
the next 18 months, as we look for new and original musicians,
consumers will see Levi's as cool and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is linking up with three of this summer's hottest bands,
the Goo Goo Dolls, Sugar Ray and Fastball, sponsoring the Levi's
'99 Fuse tour. The 43-date tour will feature a medley of
up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a fashion explosion in the moderate and
better plus-size market, spurred by women in their 20s and early
30s who are demanding the same styles as their regular-size peers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from firms such as Delta Burke, McNaughton Apparel,
Karen Kane and August Silk, which once played it safe with fashion
for the full-figured customer, are now coming out with such trendy
looks as capris, pants with cargo pockets and scoopnecks.
</P>
<P>
   The push began last year, but should be more dramatic for
fall/holiday.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is Lane Bryant, Limited's
750-store plus-size chain, which has been pushing bare looks for
several years. This spring, it has done well with capris, which hit
four inches below the knee, and pedal-pushers, five inches above
the ankle. The store has also done well with peasant blouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a gamble, and the (capri) looks did better than we
thought. It was a pleasant surprise,'' said Chris Hansen, vice
president of marketing and creative, adding that the cropped pants
sold out. ``It is a flattering look, something that she would not
have thought she could wear.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the chain will offer a wider version.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant is also continuing to show its pants with cargo
treatments, which were unveiled in stores two years ago. She added
that the pockets are positioned on the hip.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chain will offer vests in fleece, quilted nylon
and nylon stretch. There will also be jersey camisoles in nylon
stretch, merchandised with woven shirtings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a fabulous fashion cycle, and there is a pent-up
demand among our customers for newness,'' she said, adding that
Lane Bryant is experiencing double-digit sales increases this
season over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Major better and moderate sportswear resources are following
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, McNaughton Apparel, which over the past year
has made the color and print palette of its plus-size moderate
line, Maggie McNaughton, in sync with the fashion colors and prints
of its regular-size line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the plus-size customer wanted brights in the
tops. On the bottoms, they just wanted black or navy, and they
weren't willing to try wines or olives,'' said Lynn Fish, executive
vice president of design and merchandising at McNaughton Apparel.
``Now, they want softer colors such as pinks, soft yellows and
celadons. The fashion is being pushed by our younger customers, who
are in their 20s and 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaughton is interpreting all the silhouettes for the plus-size
woman. The fall lineup includes double-layer skirts and hooded
zip-front deconstructed knit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plus-size customer likes hoods. She tends to like more
casual looks,'' said Fish.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2000, the company is coming out with capris for the
first time _ for both the Norton McNaughton and the Maggie
McNaughton consumer. They will be in stretch twills and patterned
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   However, the firm will offer only clam-diggers, which offer more
leg exposure, for its Norton McNaughton customer.
</P>
<P>
   Fish added that for that same season, the company is also
interpreting the cropped drawstring sweater in plus sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Burke, who designs a plus-size line that bears her name,
said the demand for more fashion has made creating her collection a
lot more fun. She added that ``the stores are coming around'' to
demanding sexier styles.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's, she said, requested a line of teddies for fall.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's holiday lineup includes sweater sets in Lurex metallics,
which hit at the middle of the hip; capris, which are 24 inches _
an inch longer than the style's standard; trouser skirts and cargo
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that interpreting the cargo pants was a bit tricky.
Instead of putting the pocket on the side, which would have added
more bulk to the garment, she said she placed it on the front of
the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want color and novelty fashion, and they want it at the
same time as the rest of the store,'' said Fern Bratten, designer
of a two-year-old plus-size line that bears her name.
</P>
<P>
   The line, which is in 400 doors, is a division of Kellwood's
David Dart Design Group.
</P>
<P>
   She said there is a ``younger spirit'' in the misses' plus-size
market. She believes that helping the fashion movement are such
plus-size personalities as actress Camryn Manheim of ``The
Practice'' and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of Bratten's pants business is comprised of
pull-on elastic pants in garment-washed linen and Tencel, she is
offering one capri style, which hits midcalf, and cropped pants.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also continue to offer pants with cargo
pockets, which first hit the stores in May, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that stretch and capris are selling is proof that the
plus-size customer is taking more risks,'' said Bratten, who just
completed a 67-city tour in three months, visiting store accounts.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``They are making peace with their size, and not
waiting to lose those 50 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bratten is also shortening some of the jackets, to be
in sync with the trend to cropped looks.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Blair, vice president of sales at better-price sportswear
resource Karen Kane, admitted she wasn't prepared for the fashion
demands of the full-figured consumer when the company expanded into
large sizes this spring. Sure, the spring lineup, which offered a
combination of knit, Tencel and linen dressing, did well, but she
said the firm could have maximized the business even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit too conservative,'' Blair acknowledged. ``We
thought that the customer wanted to be more covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The plus-size line, which was unveiled in 75 doors and was under
Karen Kane Sport, went too deep in black and navy, ignored capris,
which were offered in both its misses' and petite lines, and didn't
have any pink. It also did not offer stretch, and could have used
more hooded looks, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, she admitted, was that the company had
thought the plus-size line would appeal to an older group, women
from 35 to 55. However, company officials soon found out that it
also drew women in their early 20s to early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be a crop of young women who are demanding
something new,'' Blair said. ``They want the colors, the special
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Karen Kane is showing trendier looks such as stretch
jackets and is expanding plus sizes to its Lifestyle label, which
is more fashion-oriented than its Sport line. The plus-size line
will be expanded to 100 doors.
</P>
<P>
   For fall/holiday, only about 40 percent of the plus-size
collection will be in black and navy, compared with 60 percent this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kane is also showing more embroidered tops, and item
T-shirts, Blair said, adding, ``The line was too group focused.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the collection will be in 100 doors. Wholesale volume
should be about $5 million in its first year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   August Silk, a better-price silk resource, which has long
offered plus sizes, is now out to ``maximize'' the business,
according to Jack Weinstock, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely plan to intensify the business,'' he said. ``We
had offered basics in the past. Now, we are offering more
fashion.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ When the Backstreet Boys recently paid a visit to the
MTV studios here, they attracted so many teen-age fans, it created
gridlock in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   According to MTV approximately 9.5 million viewers tuned in to
watch the band's live appearance over the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, this super hot pop group will play 46
shows in 34 European cities this summer. Now who wants to dress The
Backstreet Boys?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger, BCBG and Versace are among those already
wardrobing the band. Not to mention Sears, the presenting sponsor
of the band's 50-city North American tour, September through
December 99, which plans to dress them in its private label, Canyon
River Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is there's a whole slew of hot, up-and-coming
bands that have Backstreet Boy potential and are just waiting for
the right brand, designer or retailer to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsorship is all about the hot new bands,'' said Barry
Blevins, fashion director at Rolling Stone. ``Designers today are
trying to link up with any musician they can, but it's the new and
up-and-coming artists who are hip and reach that youth market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationships are often difficult to manage and
maintain. Giorgio Armani had a six-year relationship with Ricky
Martin, but when Martin became an overnight sensation in the last
few months (Time magazine cover, ``Today'' show appearances),
Armani moved quickly to reinforce the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what it means to actually dress a band is given to a
variety of interpretations. Lots of people may claim to be
providing clothes, but the musicians are fickle so there's no
guarantee they'll ever wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these musicians won't wear a certain product
on stage, so actually trying to dress them is futile,'' said Dick
Baker, ceo of OP.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker is spending $4 million to link his brand to music.
The way he's doing it, however, is by sponsoring the actual music
event. This summer, OP is working with Spin magazine to advertise a
sweepstakes for consumers to win an all-expense-paid trip to any
summer concert of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot to choose from with artists like Britney
Spears, Lauryn Hill, N' Sync, Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls all
scheduled to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of
exploding teen acts, it will be a good year for the record
business.''
</P>
<P>
   White added that a good year for music also means a good year
for fashion and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designers are eager and the artists are in a position to
pick and choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's one designer who has positioned himself as the
leader of the trend, it's Tommy Hilfiger. He dubbed 1999 ``The year
of music'' and said musicians are one of the best sources of
fashion information in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``Tommy is the best at it. He invented fashion and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker added that Hilfiger also has the budget to make the
relationships happen. This summer Tommy Jeans is the presenting
sponsor of Britney Spears' 48-city North American tour (June 28 to
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5), providing all her outfits for appearances on- and
offstage and tying in retail contests where consumers can win free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sponsorship of the tour will also include Tommy
Jeans signage on all concert tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Girl, the fragrance, will be sponsoring the Lilith Fair,
the all-women concert that will tour nationwide from July 8 to Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Hilfiger, vice president public relations of
Tommy Jeans, 75 percent of this year's marketing budget for Tommy
Jeans is allocated to music.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive sponsorship, like the one Tommy Jeans has with
Spears, is a deal coveted by most brands, but also one that's tough
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, for example, has not only worked with brands like
PNB for the Billboard awards, but was most recently outfitted
exclusively by Levi's for her first international tour and is
frequently dressed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spin's White, the competition to dress Hill is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to simple arithmetic _ how many Lauryn Hills are
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that giants like Armani, Levi's and Hilfiger own the
category. BC Ethic, a $25 million streetwear company, is dressing
such hot groups as Barenaked Ladies and C Note. BC Ethic's
relationships don't involve signed contracts and the company makes
a point of not shipping unsolicited clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chasing music stars,'' said BC Ethic's Jim Huber.
``I'm communicating with them at an equal level. The only way I'd
be involved with a band is if they actually like the product. I
think it's kind of arrogant just to send out free trunks of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans giant Levi's takes a different approach and is involved
with over 200 music sponsorships this year. According to Joe
Townsend, manager of music sponsorships at Levi's, the company's
main focus this summer is music marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important ways for us to reach our
target consumer,'' he said. ``A relationship like the one we have
with Hill is repositioning us as a brand that consumers like. Over
the next 18 months, as we look for new and original musicians,
consumers will see Levi's as cool and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is linking up with three of this summer's hottest bands,
the Goo Goo Dolls, Sugar Ray and Fastball, sponsoring the Levi's
'99 Fuse tour. The 43-date tour will feature a medley of
up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a fashion explosion in the moderate and
better plus-size market, spurred by women in their 20s and early
30s who are demanding the same styles as their regular-size peers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from firms such as Delta Burke, McNaughton Apparel,
Karen Kane and August Silk, which once played it safe with fashion
for the full-figured customer, are now coming out with such trendy
looks as capris, pants with cargo pockets and scoopnecks.
</P>
<P>
   The push began last year, but should be more dramatic for
fall/holiday.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is Lane Bryant, Limited's
750-store plus-size chain, which has been pushing bare looks for
several years. This spring, it has done well with capris, which hit
four inches below the knee, and pedal-pushers, five inches above
the ankle. The store has also done well with peasant blouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a gamble, and the (capri) looks did better than we
thought. It was a pleasant surprise,'' said Chris Hansen, vice
president of marketing and creative, adding that the cropped pants
sold out. ``It is a flattering look, something that she would not
have thought she could wear.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the chain will offer a wider version.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant is also continuing to show its pants with cargo
treatments, which were unveiled in stores two years ago. She added
that the pockets are positioned on the hip.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chain will offer vests in fleece, quilted nylon
and nylon stretch. There will also be jersey camisoles in nylon
stretch, merchandised with woven shirtings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a fabulous fashion cycle, and there is a pent-up
demand among our customers for newness,'' she said, adding that
Lane Bryant is experiencing double-digit sales increases this
season over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Major better and moderate sportswear resources are following
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, McNaughton Apparel, which over the past year
has made the color and print palette of its plus-size moderate
line, Maggie McNaughton, in sync with the fashion colors and prints
of its regular-size line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the plus-size customer wanted brights in the
tops. On the bottoms, they just wanted black or navy, and they
weren't willing to try wines or olives,'' said Lynn Fish, executive
vice president of design and merchandising at McNaughton Apparel.
``Now, they want softer colors such as pinks, soft yellows and
celadons. The fashion is being pushed by our younger customers, who
are in their 20s and 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaughton is interpreting all the silhouettes for the plus-size
woman. The fall lineup includes double-layer skirts and hooded
zip-front deconstructed knit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plus-size customer likes hoods. She tends to like more
casual looks,'' said Fish.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2000, the company is coming out with capris for the
first time _ for both the Norton McNaughton and the Maggie
McNaughton consumer. They will be in stretch twills and patterned
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   However, the firm will offer only clam-diggers, which offer more
leg exposure, for its Norton McNaughton customer.
</P>
<P>
   Fish added that for that same season, the company is also
interpreting the cropped drawstring sweater in plus sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Burke, who designs a plus-size line that bears her name,
said the demand for more fashion has made creating her collection a
lot more fun. She added that ``the stores are coming around'' to
demanding sexier styles.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's, she said, requested a line of teddies for fall.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's holiday lineup includes sweater sets in Lurex metallics,
which hit at the middle of the hip; capris, which are 24 inches _
an inch longer than the style's standard; trouser skirts and cargo
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that interpreting the cargo pants was a bit tricky.
Instead of putting the pocket on the side, which would have added
more bulk to the garment, she said she placed it on the front of
the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want color and novelty fashion, and they want it at the
same time as the rest of the store,'' said Fern Bratten, designer
of a two-year-old plus-size line that bears her name.
</P>
<P>
   The line, which is in 400 doors, is a division of Kellwood's
David Dart Design Group.
</P>
<P>
   She said there is a ``younger spirit'' in the misses' plus-size
market. She believes that helping the fashion movement are such
plus-size personalities as actress Camryn Manheim of ``The
Practice'' and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of Bratten's pants business is comprised of
pull-on elastic pants in garment-washed linen and Tencel, she is
offering one capri style, which hits midcalf, and cropped pants.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also continue to offer pants with cargo
pockets, which first hit the stores in May, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that stretch and capris are selling is proof that the
plus-size customer is taking more risks,'' said Bratten, who just
completed a 67-city tour in three months, visiting store accounts.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``They are making peace with their size, and not
waiting to lose those 50 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bratten is also shortening some of the jackets, to be
in sync with the trend to cropped looks.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Blair, vice president of sales at better-price sportswear
resource Karen Kane, admitted she wasn't prepared for the fashion
demands of the full-figured consumer when the company expanded into
large sizes this spring. Sure, the spring lineup, which offered a
combination of knit, Tencel and linen dressing, did well, but she
said the firm could have maximized the business even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit too conservative,'' Blair acknowledged. ``We
thought that the customer wanted to be more covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The plus-size line, which was unveiled in 75 doors and was under
Karen Kane Sport, went too deep in black and navy, ignored capris,
which were offered in both its misses' and petite lines, and didn't
have any pink. It also did not offer stretch, and could have used
more hooded looks, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, she admitted, was that the company had
thought the plus-size line would appeal to an older group, women
from 35 to 55. However, company officials soon found out that it
also drew women in their early 20s to early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be a crop of young women who are demanding
something new,'' Blair said. ``They want the colors, the special
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Karen Kane is showing trendier looks such as stretch
jackets and is expanding plus sizes to its Lifestyle label, which
is more fashion-oriented than its Sport line. The plus-size line
will be expanded to 100 doors.
</P>
<P>
   For fall/holiday, only about 40 percent of the plus-size
collection will be in black and navy, compared with 60 percent this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kane is also showing more embroidered tops, and item
T-shirts, Blair said, adding, ``The line was too group focused.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the collection will be in 100 doors. Wholesale volume
should be about $5 million in its first year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   August Silk, a better-price silk resource, which has long
offered plus sizes, is now out to ``maximize'' the business,
according to Jack Weinstock, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely plan to intensify the business,'' he said. ``We
had offered basics in the past. Now, we are offering more
fashion.'' &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a fashion explosion in the moderate and
better plus-size market, spurred by women in their 20s and early
30s who are demanding the same styles as their regular-size peers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from firms such as Delta Burke, McNaughton Apparel,
Karen Kane and August Silk, which once played it safe with fashion
for the full-figured customer, are now coming out with such trendy
looks as capris, pants with cargo pockets and scoopnecks.
</P>
<P>
   The push began last year, but should be more dramatic for
fall/holiday.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is Lane Bryant, Limited's
750-store plus-size chain, which has been pushing bare looks for
several years. This spring, it has done well with capris, which hit
four inches below the knee, and pedal-pushers, five inches above
the ankle. The store has also done well with peasant blouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a gamble, and the (capri) looks did better than we
thought. It was a pleasant surprise,'' said Chris Hansen, vice
president of marketing and creative, adding that the cropped pants
sold out. ``It is a flattering look, something that she would not
have thought she could wear.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the chain will offer a wider version.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant is also continuing to show its pants with cargo
treatments, which were unveiled in stores two years ago. She added
that the pockets are positioned on the hip.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chain will offer vests in fleece, quilted nylon
and nylon stretch. There will also be jersey camisoles in nylon
stretch, merchandised with woven shirtings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a fabulous fashion cycle, and there is a pent-up
demand among our customers for newness,'' she said, adding that
Lane Bryant is experiencing double-digit sales increases this
season over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Major better and moderate sportswear resources are following
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, McNaughton Apparel, which over the past year
has made the color and print palette of its plus-size moderate
line, Maggie McNaughton, in sync with the fashion colors and prints
of its regular-size line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the plus-size customer wanted brights in the
tops. On the bottoms, they just wanted black or navy, and they
weren't willing to try wines or olives,'' said Lynn Fish, executive
vice president of design and merchandising at McNaughton Apparel.
``Now, they want softer colors such as pinks, soft yellows and
celadons. The fashion is being pushed by our younger customers, who
are in their 20s and 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaughton is interpreting all the silhouettes for the plus-size
woman. The fall lineup includes double-layer skirts and hooded
zip-front deconstructed knit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plus-size customer likes hoods. She tends to like more
casual looks,'' said Fish.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2000, the company is coming out with capris for the
first time _ for both the Norton McNaughton and the Maggie
McNaughton consumer. They will be in stretch twills and patterned
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   However, the firm will offer only clam-diggers, which offer more
leg exposure, for its Norton McNaughton customer.
</P>
<P>
   Fish added that for that same season, the company is also
interpreting the cropped drawstring sweater in plus sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Burke, who designs a plus-size line that bears her name,
said the demand for more fashion has made creating her collection a
lot more fun. She added that ``the stores are coming around'' to
demanding sexier styles.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's, she said, requested a line of teddies for fall.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's holiday lineup includes sweater sets in Lurex metallics,
which hit at the middle of the hip; capris, which are 24 inches _
an inch longer than the style's standard; trouser skirts and cargo
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that interpreting the cargo pants was a bit tricky.
Instead of putting the pocket on the side, which would have added
more bulk to the garment, she said she placed it on the front of
the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want color and novelty fashion, and they want it at the
same time as the rest of the store,'' said Fern Bratten, designer
of a two-year-old plus-size line that bears her name.
</P>
<P>
   The line, which is in 400 doors, is a division of Kellwood's
David Dart Design Group.
</P>
<P>
   She said there is a ``younger spirit'' in the misses' plus-size
market. She believes that helping the fashion movement are such
plus-size personalities as actress Camryn Manheim of ``The
Practice'' and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of Bratten's pants business is comprised of
pull-on elastic pants in garment-washed linen and Tencel, she is
offering one capri style, which hits midcalf, and cropped pants.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also continue to offer pants with cargo
pockets, which first hit the stores in May, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that stretch and capris are selling is proof that the
plus-size customer is taking more risks,'' said Bratten, who just
completed a 67-city tour in three months, visiting store accounts.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``They are making peace with their size, and not
waiting to lose those 50 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bratten is also shortening some of the jackets, to be
in sync with the trend to cropped looks.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Blair, vice president of sales at better-price sportswear
resource Karen Kane, admitted she wasn't prepared for the fashion
demands of the full-figured consumer when the company expanded into
large sizes this spring. Sure, the spring lineup, which offered a
combination of knit, Tencel and linen dressing, did well, but she
said the firm could have maximized the business even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit too conservative,'' Blair acknowledged. ``We
thought that the customer wanted to be more covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The plus-size line, which was unveiled in 75 doors and was under
Karen Kane Sport, went too deep in black and navy, ignored capris,
which were offered in both its misses' and petite lines, and didn't
have any pink. It also did not offer stretch, and could have used
more hooded looks, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, she admitted, was that the company had
thought the plus-size line would appeal to an older group, women
from 35 to 55. However, company officials soon found out that it
also drew women in their early 20s to early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be a crop of young women who are demanding
something new,'' Blair said. ``They want the colors, the special
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Karen Kane is showing trendier looks such as stretch
jackets and is expanding plus sizes to its Lifestyle label, which
is more fashion-oriented than its Sport line. The plus-size line
will be expanded to 100 doors.
</P>
<P>
   For fall/holiday, only about 40 percent of the plus-size
collection will be in black and navy, compared with 60 percent this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kane is also showing more embroidered tops, and item
T-shirts, Blair said, adding, ``The line was too group focused.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the collection will be in 100 doors. Wholesale volume
should be about $5 million in its first year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   August Silk, a better-price silk resource, which has long
offered plus sizes, is now out to ``maximize'' the business,
according to Jack Weinstock, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely plan to intensify the business,'' he said. ``We
had offered basics in the past. Now, we are offering more
fashion.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Backstreet Boys recently paid a visit to the
MTV studios here, they attracted so many teen-age fans, it created
gridlock in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   According to MTV approximately 9.5 million viewers tuned in to
watch the band's live appearance over the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, this super hot pop group will play 46
shows in 34 European cities this summer. Now who wants to dress The
Backstreet Boys?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger, BCBG and Versace are among those already
wardrobing the band. Not to mention Sears, the presenting sponsor
of the band's 50-city North American tour, September through
December 99, which plans to dress them in its private label, Canyon
River Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is there's a whole slew of hot, up-and-coming
bands that have Backstreet Boy potential and are just waiting for
the right brand, designer or retailer to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsorship is all about the hot new bands,'' said Barry
Blevins, fashion director at Rolling Stone. ``Designers today are
trying to link up with any musician they can, but it's the new and
up-and-coming artists who are hip and reach that youth market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationships are often difficult to manage and
maintain. Giorgio Armani had a six-year relationship with Ricky
Martin, but when Martin became an overnight sensation in the last
few months (Time magazine cover, ``Today'' show appearances),
Armani moved quickly to reinforce the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what it means to actually dress a band is given to a
variety of interpretations. Lots of people may claim to be
providing clothes, but the musicians are fickle so there's no
guarantee they'll ever wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these musicians won't wear a certain product
on stage, so actually trying to dress them is futile,'' said Dick
Baker, ceo of OP.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker is spending $4 million to link his brand to music.
The way he's doing it, however, is by sponsoring the actual music
event. This summer, OP is working with Spin magazine to advertise a
sweepstakes for consumers to win an all-expense-paid trip to any
summer concert of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot to choose from with artists like Britney
Spears, Lauryn Hill, N' Sync, Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls all
scheduled to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of
exploding teen acts, it will be a good year for the record
business.''
</P>
<P>
   White added that a good year for music also means a good year
for fashion and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designers are eager and the artists are in a position to
pick and choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's one designer who has positioned himself as the
leader of the trend, it's Tommy Hilfiger. He dubbed 1999 ``The year
of music'' and said musicians are one of the best sources of
fashion information in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``Tommy is the best at it. He invented fashion and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker added that Hilfiger also has the budget to make the
relationships happen. This summer Tommy Jeans is the presenting
sponsor of Britney Spears' 48-city North American tour (June 28 to
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5), providing all her outfits for appearances on- and
offstage and tying in retail contests where consumers can win free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sponsorship of the tour will also include Tommy
Jeans signage on all concert tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Girl, the fragrance, will be sponsoring the Lilith Fair,
the all-women concert that will tour nationwide from July 8 to Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Hilfiger, vice president public relations of
Tommy Jeans, 75 percent of this year's marketing budget for Tommy
Jeans is allocated to music.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive sponsorship, like the one Tommy Jeans has with
Spears, is a deal coveted by most brands, but also one that's tough
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, for example, has not only worked with brands like
PNB for the Billboard awards, but was most recently outfitted
exclusively by Levi's for her first international tour and is
frequently dressed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spin's White, the competition to dress Hill is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to simple arithmetic _ how many Lauryn Hills are
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that giants like Armani, Levi's and Hilfiger own the
category. BC Ethic, a $25 million streetwear company, is dressing
such hot groups as Barenaked Ladies and C Note. BC Ethic's
relationships don't involve signed contracts and the company makes
a point of not shipping unsolicited clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chasing music stars,'' said BC Ethic's Jim Huber.
``I'm communicating with them at an equal level. The only way I'd
be involved with a band is if they actually like the product. I
think it's kind of arrogant just to send out free trunks of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans giant Levi's takes a different approach and is involved
with over 200 music sponsorships this year. According to Joe
Townsend, manager of music sponsorships at Levi's, the company's
main focus this summer is music marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important ways for us to reach our
target consumer,'' he said. ``A relationship like the one we have
with Hill is repositioning us as a brand that consumers like. Over
the next 18 months, as we look for new and original musicians,
consumers will see Levi's as cool and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is linking up with three of this summer's hottest bands,
the Goo Goo Dolls, Sugar Ray and Fastball, sponsoring the Levi's
'99 Fuse tour. The 43-date tour will feature a medley of
up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The most striking feature of this year's defense budget debate
was that there was none.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the absence of the usual acrimony accompanying
the authorization of billions of federal dollars was congressional
exhaustion from the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Another and more important reason was that the military's
problems _ the ``three Rs'' of readiness, recruiting and retention
_ were well reported. President Clinton could not afford to be
caught cutting defense dollars while bombing Iraq and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's unease with traditional defense-cutting
arguments has spread across both aisles on Capitol Hill, where
almost any vote on three-R spending is treated as a litmus test for
patriotism. Thus in February, after only one day of debate, the
Senate voted 91-8 for a military pay raise that by itself could
amount to $55 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives, which could not even pass a
resolution supporting the air war in Kosovo, voted overwhelmingly
for a $13.1 billion emergency military spending bill only days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks should find Clinton's proposed $112 billion increase in
military spending over the next six years cause for celebration.
The armed forces have simultaneously been downsized and run ragged
by an unprecedented number of protracted overseas deployments. The
Pentagon has managed thus far by robbing funds intended for future
programs and equipment, but even that tactic has lost its useful
life. With combat readiness near a 20-year low, morale suffering
and acquisition sorely underfunded, the military could use the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Even hawks should be troubled, however. The defense budget
crisis that forced the president's hand did not happen by accident.
True, top generals and admirals downplayed their readiness woes
until they were too obvious to hide and then sprang them on
Congress when the government surplus became evident, giving the
crisis a sudden and random character.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the groundwork for the military's budget
crisis was laid long in advance and was fully predictable. And the
same system that created this defense ``train wreck'' will suck up
and waste even more substantial increases in military spending for
the foreseeable future unless Washington makes significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is locked in a budgetary death spiral simply
because the way it thinks about the world has not caught up with
the way it spends money. The process is the problem. The military
programs, strategies and weapon systems funded by the $270 billion
annual defense budget match neither the administration's national
security strategy nor the Pentagon's blueprint for future military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic reforms and reorganizations have tried to centralize
planning authority within the Pentagon, leaving behind an alphabet
soup of some 30 procedures intended to marry budgeting with
strategy. But these attempts have dented neither the basic
prerogatives of the services nor the incentives that influence
their decisions. The system has proven amazingly resistant to
changes or updates based on U.S. strategy or the international
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when then Secretary of Defense James R.
Schlesinger was asked why the military continued to fund itself
this way despite changes in national strategy, he reportedly
replied, ``Because it is too hard to do it any other way.'' His
successors would undoubtedly agree.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the services, the president, the secretary of
defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon's
elite Joint Staff, and the war-fighting commanders spread around
the world have almost no budgetary authority. Yet they must not
only devise U.S. military strategy but also control American forces
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Strong presidents and defense secretaries have sometimes managed
to bend the services' budgets to their strategy. But for the past
five years the services have mostly been left to their own devices,
spending their money and planning their forces as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, they have produced individual ``visions''
and spending plans to fit their distinct worldviews _ visions which
are not especially complementary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real problem for the Department of Defense is not
age-old interservice rivalries. Instead, it is the lack of
supervision and coordination of the services, which will bankrupt
an even bigger defense budget without addressing the countrywide
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Today the services are interested in neither the White House's
new wars (peacekeeping, terrorism, organized crime and the like)
nor the Joint Staff's futuristic technological blueprint (Joint
Vision 2010). Neither vision is compelling enough to induce the
services to change on their own nor specific enough to narrow
debate on what the services actually require.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Army, Navy and Air Force plan for the wars they
would like to fight. These future wars, unsurprisingly, look
remarkably like those of the past except that the same old type of
adversaries have slightly upgraded equipment _ as do we.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first days of the Clinton administration, top civilian
officials have warned that conflicts such as Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia
and Kosovo will be the order of the day. Nonetheless, with the
exception of the Marine Corps (which has historically specialized
in fighting ``small wars''), the services have hardly adjusted at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has sunk its money into upgrading the world's heaviest
tank and a new heavy artillery piece _ neither of which could be
shipped to Kosovo, for example, in time to make a difference. The
Air Force, meanwhile, has concentrated on stealthier, faster, more
precise and longer-range technologies rather than the mundane
close-support systems that might have stemmed the ravages of
Slobodan Milosevic's forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The services put little money behind the Pentagon's own
war-fighting blueprints. For example, the Navy has been told by
several high-level strategy documents and blue-ribbon commissions
that the aircraft carrier's age is soon over. Yet it recently
canceled production on an arsenal ship _ a stealthy barge bristling
with precision munitions _ and plans yet another carrier. The
Navy's single most expensive program is the upgrade of F-18 fighter
jets for carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force knows its future is in unmanned aircraft and
space, yet it clings maniacally to the superexpensive F-22 fighter
plane as its flagship program. And while the Army has criticized
itself for being too heavy, cumbersome and unwieldy, it has
canceled its light armored gun system, has suspended tests of more
agile formations and continues to spend the lion's share of its
budget on tanks and heavy artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   None of these systems are without merit, but they are invariably
created and advanced incompletely, without consideration for other
Pentagon programs, future war-fighting concepts or even the White
House's national security priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Because they cannot compel the services to think and act any
differently, the secretary of defense and the president are reduced
to rubber-stamping programs conceived 10 or 15 years ago and funded
well into the future _ where they will drive defense's chronic
underfunding to crisis proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1999 and 2003, the Congressional Budget Office and the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimate, service
requests will exceed the projected defense budget by $20 billion to
$25 billion per year. The Center for Strategic and International
Studies estimates that the shortfall could be three or four times
that figure. The Pentagon simply cannot afford what its services
say they must have to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the national security strategy produced by the
White House does not prioritize very much, but it does clearly
emphasize new security threats such as intrastate conflict,
terrorism, nuclear proliferation, organized crime and drug
trafficking. The Pentagon's plan for future war-fighting concepts
suggests radical changes to achieve a high-tech ``revolution in
military affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The services, on the other hand, are all figuring out how to
fight the next Desert Storm better (and far less jointly than they
proclaim).
</P>
<P>
   Officials should recognize that the services are not
analytically prepared to decide everything by themselves _ but they
will if given the chance. To reverse the budgeting-planning
equation will require confident, timely and disciplined leadership
from the president and the secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Current White House and Pentagon plans are too vague and
ambiguous to command the attention or respect of the services.
National security strategies driven by platitudes will not lasso
and corral the budget. Planning must be synchronized _ not parallel
_ if strategic needs are to drive the budget.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the traditional budget allocation among the services
from limiting or determining U.S. strategy, some budget authority
must be shifted to the Joint Staff or Joint Commands. Reducing each
service's procurement budget by 20 percent and letting competition
between programs determine allocation would restore some sanity to
the planning process.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring 20 percent of service procurement budgets for major
programs to joint authority would leave intact the training
prerogatives, developmental authority and organizational
wherewithal of the services. At the same time, it would give a
joint authority the necessary means to make some hard choices about
redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are no real incentives for the services to do
anything but mind their own interests. In times of finite resources
and wildly expensive programs, a more dispassionate system is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In order to buttress an American foreign policy that is growing
more imperial by the day, the Pentagon will need significantly
increased defense spending _ but the process must be fixed so that
national security needs, not budgetary inertia, lead the way.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   An unpleasant truth often overlooked is that although war is a
great evil, it does have a great virtue: It can resolve political
conflicts and lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen when all belligerents become exhausted or when
one wins decisively. Either way the key is that the fighting must
continue until a resolution is reached.
</P>
<P>
   War brings peace only after passing a culminating phase of
violence. Hopes of military success must fade for accommodation to
become more attractive than further combat.
</P>
<P>
   But since the establishment of the United Nations and the
enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council, wars
among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural
course. Instead, they have typically been interrupted early on,
before they could burn themselves out and establish the
preconditions for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands
engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of
combat, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational commands find it difficult to control the quality
and conduct of member states' troops, which can reduce the
performance of all forces involved to the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of troop degradation can rarely be detected by
external observers, although its consequences are abundantly
visible in the litter of dead, mutilated, raped and tortured
victims that attends such interventions. The true state of affairs
is illuminated by the rare exception, such as the vigorous Danish
tank battalion in Bosnia that replied to any attack on it by firing
back in full force, quickly stopping the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   What of NATO's intervention against Serbia for the sake of
Kosovo? The alliance relied on airpower alone to minimize the risk
of NATO casualties, bombing targets in Serbia, Montenegro and
Kosovo for weeks without losing a single pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the ground far beneath the high-flying planes,
small groups of Serb soldiers and police in armored vehicles were
terrorizing hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a panoply of aircraft designed for finding and
destroying such vehicles. All its major powers have anti-tank
helicopters, some equipped to operate without base support. But no
country offered to send them into Kosovo when the ethnic cleansing
began _ after all, they might have been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Apache helicopters based in Germany were finally
ordered to Albania, in spite of the vast expenditure devoted to
their instantaneous ``readiness'' over the years, they required
more than three weeks of ``predeployment preparations'' to make the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks into the war, the Apaches had yet to fly their first
mission, although two had already crashed during training. More
than mere bureaucratic foot-dragging was responsible for this
inordinate delay. The U.S. Army insisted that the Apaches could not
operate on their own, but would need the support of heavy rocket
barrages to suppress Serb anti-aircraft weapons. This created a
much larger logistical load than the Apaches alone, and an
additional, evidently welcome delay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO had aircraft deployed on Italian bases already
which could have done the job just as well: U.S. A-10 ``Warthogs''
built around their powerful 30mm antitank guns and British Royal
Air Force Harriers ideal for low-altitude bombing at close range.
Neither was employed, again because it could not be done in perfect
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the calculus of the NATO democracies, the immediate
possibility of saving thousands of Albanians from massacre and
hundreds of thousands from deportation was obviously not worth the
lives of a few pilots. That may reflect unavoidable political
reality, but it demonstrates how even a large-scale disinterested
intervention can fail to achieve its ostensibly humanitarian aim.
</P>
<P>
   The most disinterested of all interventions in war _ and the
most destructive _ are humanitarian relief activities. The largest
and most protracted is the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It
was built on the model of its predecessor, the U.N. Relief and
Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), which operated displaced-persons'
camps in Europe immediately after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Relief and Works Agency was established right after the
1948-49 Arab-Israeli war to feed, shelter, educate and provide
health services for Arab refugees who had fled Israeli zones in the
former territory of Palestine. Its camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan,
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip provided, on the whole, a higher
standard of living than most Arab villagers had previously enjoyed,
with a more varied diet, organized schooling, superior medical care
and no backbreaking labor in stony fields.
</P>
<P>
   They had, therefore, the effect of becoming desirable homes
rather than eagerly abandoned transit camps. With the encouragement
of several Arab countries, the agency turned escaping civilians
into lifelong refugees who gave birth to refugee children, who have
in turn had refugee children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   During its half-century of operation, this U.N. agency has thus
perpetuated a Palestinian refugee nation, preserving its
resentments in as fresh a condition as they were in 1948. By its
very existence, the UNRWA dissuades integration into local society
and inhibits emigration.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of Palestinians in the camps, moreover, has
facilitated the voluntary or forced enlistment of refugee youths by
armed organizations that fight both Israel and each other. The
agency has contributed to a half-century of Arab-Israeli violence
and still retards the advent of peace.
</P>
<P>
   If each European war had been attended by its own postwar UNRWA,
today's Europe would have remained a mosaic of warring tribes,
undigested and unreconciled in their separate feeding camps. It
might have assuaged consciences to help each one at each remove,
but it would have led to permanent instability and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The UNRWA has counterparts elsewhere, such as the Cambodian
camps along the Thai border, which incidentally provided safe
havens for the mass-murdering Khmer Rouge. But because the United
Nations is limited by stingy national contributions, these camps'
sabotage of peace is at least localized.
</P>
<P>
   That is not true of the proliferating, feverishly competitive
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that now aid war refugees.
Like any other institution, these NGOs are interested in
perpetuating themselves, which means that their first priority is
to attract charitable contributions by being seen to be active in
high-visibility situations.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dramatic natural disasters attract any significant
mass-media attention, and then only briefly; soon after an
earthquake or flood, the cameras depart. War refugees, by contrast,
can win sustained press coverage if kept concentrated in reasonably
accessible camps.
</P>
<P>
   Regular warfare among well-developed countries is rare and
offers few opportunities for such NGOs, so they focus their efforts
on aiding refugees in the poorest parts of the world. This ensures
that the food, shelter and health care offered _ although abysmal
by Western standards _ exceeds what is locally available to
non-refugees. The consequences are entirely predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Among many examples, the huge refugee camps along the Democratic
Republic of Congo's border with Rwanda stand out. They sustain a
Hutu nation that would otherwise have been dispersed, making the
consolidation of Rwanda impossible and providing a base for
radicals to launch more Tutsi-killing raids across the border.
Humanitarian intervention has worsened the chances of a stable,
long-term resolution of the tensions in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   To keep refugee nations intact and preserve their resentments
forever is bad enough, but inserting material aid into ongoing
conflicts is even worse. Many NGOs that operate in an odor of
sanctity routinely supply active combatants. Defenseless, they
cannot exclude armed warriors from their feeding stations, clinics
and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since refugees are presumptively on the losing side, the
warriors among them are usually in retreat. By intervening to help,
NGOs systematically impede the progress of their enemies toward a
decisive victory that could end the war. Sometimes NGOs, impartial
to a fault, even help both sides, thus preventing mutual exhaustion
and a resulting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And in some extreme cases, such as Somalia, NGOs even pay
protection money to local war bands, which use those funds to buy
arms. Those NGOs are therefore helping prolong the warfare whose
consequences they ostensibly seek to mitigate.

<P>
   An unpleasant truth often overlooked is that although war is a
great evil, it does have a great virtue: It can resolve political
conflicts and lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen when all belligerents become exhausted or when
one wins decisively. Either way the key is that the fighting must
continue until a resolution is reached.
</P>
<P>
   War brings peace only after passing a culminating phase of
violence. Hopes of military success must fade for accommodation to
become more attractive than further combat.
</P>
<P>
   But since the establishment of the United Nations and the
enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council, wars
among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural
course. Instead, they have typically been interrupted early on,
before they could burn themselves out and establish the
preconditions for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands

<P>
   In their book ``Preventive Defense,'' William Perry and Ashton
Carter, the former U.S. secretary and assistant secretary of
defense, argue that we should rethink the way we understand risks
to national security.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of their new hierarchy they put ``A-list'' threats
such as that which the Soviet Union once presented to our survival.
</P>
<P>
   The ``B list'' features imminent threats to U.S. interests _ but
not to our survival _ such as North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The ``C list'' includes important ``contingencies that
indirectly affect U.S. security but do not directly threaten U.S.
interests'' _ the Kosovos, Bosnias, Somalias, Rwandas and Haitis.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is the ``C-list'' issues that dominate our
foreign-policy agenda. Carter and Perry speculate that this is
because the ``A-list'' threats have diminished since the end of the
Cold War. But another reason is that ``C-list'' issues dominate
media attention in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Nonvital crises such as Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti and Kosovo
continue to force their way to the foreground because of their
ability to command massive media attention. Such crises raise moral
issues that the American people consistently list among their
foreign-policy concerns. Policy experts may deplore such
sympathies, but they are a democratic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic visual portrayals of immediate human conflict and
suffering are far easier to convey to the public than ``A-list''
abstractions such as the possibility of a ``Weimar Russia,'' the
rise of a hegemonic China, the importance of our alliance with
Japan or the potential collapse of the international system of
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if these larger, more abstract strategic issues were to turn
out badly, they would have a far greater impact on the lives of
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do about the humanitarian concerns and strong
moral preferences that Americans want to see expressed in their
foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   Americans have rarely accepted pure realpolitik as a guiding
principle. Moreover, human rights and the alleviation of
humanitarian disasters have long been important aspects of our
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign policy involves trying to accomplish varied
objectives in a complex and recalcitrant world. This entails
tradeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A human-rights policy is not itself a foreign policy; it is an
important part of a foreign policy. During the Cold War, this
balancing act often meant tolerating human-rights abuses by regimes
that were crucial to balancing Soviet power _ for example, in South
Korea before its transition to democracy. Similar problems persist
in the current period _ witness our policy toward Saudi Arabia or
our efforts to balance human rights in China with our long-term
strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures are more powerful than words, and so arguments about
tradeoffs tend to become emotional and difficult. Few Americans can
look at television pictures of starving people or miserable
refugees and not say that their country should do something about
them.
</P>
<P>
   And acting on humanitarian values is often appropriate; the
United States often does respond to such catastrophes. Sometimes
this is quite easily done, such as hurricane relief to Central
America or the early stages of famine relief in Somalia. But
ostensibly simple cases such as Somalia can turn out to be
extremely difficult to resolve and others, such as Kosovo, are
difficult from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with such hard cases is that the humanitarian
interest that instigates the action often turns out to be a mile
wide and an inch deep. The American public's impulse to help
starving Somalis (whose food supply was being interrupted by
various warlords) vanished in the face of televised pictures of
dead U.S. soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Such transience is sometimes attributed to the popular
reluctance to accept casualties. But that is too simple. Americans
went into the Persian Gulf War expecting and willing to accept some
10,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As this suggests, Americans are reluctant to accept casualties
in cases where their only foreign-policy goals are unreciprocated
humanitarian interests. Ironically, when opinion turns against such
cases, this may not only divert attention and limit willingness to
support ``A-list'' interests, but may also undermine support for
action in other, more serious humanitarian crises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the direct effects of the Somalia disaster was America's
failure (along with other countries) to support and reinforce the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, which could have limited a true
genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers. We could not simply turn off the
television or unplug our computers even if we wanted to. The ``C
list'' cannot simply be ignored. But there are certain rules of
prudence that may help integrate such issues into the larger
strategy for advancing the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are many degrees of humanitarian concern and many
degrees of intervention to reflect them, such as condemnation,
sanctions targeted on individuals, broad sanctions and various uses
of force. We should save violent options for the most egregious
cases.
</P>
<P>
   When we do use force, it is worth remembering some principles of
what is known as the ``just war'' doctrine: having a just cause in
the eyes of others; discrimination in means so as to not unduly
punish the innocent; proportionality of means to ends; and a high
probability of good consequences (rather than wishful thinking).
</P>
<P>
   We should generally avoid the use of force except in cases where
our humanitarian interests are reinforced by the existence of other
strong national interests. This was the case in the gulf war, where
the United States was concerned not only with the aggression
against Kuwait, but also with energy supplies and regional allies.
This was not the case in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Kosovo), our interests
combine both humanitarian values and the strategic concerns of
European allies and NATO. We should try to involve other regional
actors, preferably in the lead role when possible. In Europe, we
should welcome the idea of combined joint task forces that would be
separable but not separate from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   We should also be clearer about what are true cases of genocide.
The American people have a real humanitarian interest in not
letting another Holocaust occur. Yet we did just that in Rwanda in
1994. We therefore need to do more to organize prevention and
response to real cases of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Genocide Convention is written so loosely and
the word is so abused for political purposes that there is danger
of the term becoming trivialized. But a strict historical
interpretation of the crime, based on the precedents of the
Holocaust and Rwanda, can help to avoid such pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Americans should be very wary about intervention in
civil wars over self-determination. The principle is dangerously
ambiguous. Atrocities are often committed by activists on both
sides and the precedents indicate there can be disastrous
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   How could these rules of prudence have helped in the case of
Kosovo? At an earlier stage, they would have produced more caution.
In December 1992, President Bush issued a vague threat that Serbia
should not attack ethnic Albanians in its Kosovo province, while he
remained silent on Bosnia. A year later, the Clinton administration
reiterated the warning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was saved from having to back up these threats
by the Kosovar Albanians' pacifist leader, Ibrahim Rugova, who
espoused a Gandhian response to Serbian oppression. After 1996, the
rise of the militantly pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army
undermined Rugova's leadership. According to journalist Chris
Hedges, the radicals of the KLA, who combine ``hints of fascism on
one side and whiffs of communism on the other,'' were labeled a
terrorist organization by U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
   A KLA victory might well have involved atrocities and ethnic
cleansing of the Serb minority in Kosovo. The KLA's refusal to sign
the Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks in February
let the alliance off the moral hook and should have been used as an
opportunity to step back. Instead, the United States ``fixed the
problem'' by pretending to believe the KLA's promise to accept
autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States then threatened to bomb Serbia. Milosevic
called the American bluff and initiated his planned ethnic
cleansing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, new facts on the ground raised Kosovo from the
``C list'' to the ``B list'' of U.S. foreign-policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The scale and ferocity of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing could not
be ignored. European allies such as the United Kingdom, France and
even Germany joined the United States in calling for NATO action.
If the United States had then pulled the rug out from under its
pro-interventionist allies, it would have produced a crisis in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The ``C-list'' humanitarian impact had grown immensely and was
now reinforced by a strategic interest in the future of the
American alliance with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo illustrates how a ``C-list'' issue can migrate to the ``B
list'' of national interests that merit the use of force. Kosovo
itself is not a vital American interest, and it only touches
tangentially on an ``A-list'' issue (the credibility of the NATO
alliance). The ``A list'' also includes the future of Russia and of
international laws and institutions such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NATO, Russia and the United Nations all figure strongly
in how we resolve the Kosovo crisis. And the rules of prudence must
still be applied. If moral outrage or unilateralist temptations
blind Americans to other ``A-list'' priorities, the United States
may dangerously overreach itself and turn a just cause into a
counterproductive crusade.

<P>
   In their book ``Preventive Defense,'' William Perry and Ashton
Carter, the former U.S. secretary and assistant secretary of
defense, argue that we should rethink the way we understand risks
to national security.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of their new hierarchy they put ``A-list'' threats
such as that which the Soviet Union once presented to our survival.
</P>
<P>
   The ``B list'' features imminent threats to U.S. interests _ but
not to our survival _ such as North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The ``C list'' includes important ``contingencies that
indirectly affect U.S. security but do not directly threaten U.S.
interests'' _ the Kosovos, Bosnias, Somalias, Rwandas and Haitis.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is the ``C-list'' issues that dominate our
foreign-policy agenda. Carter and Perry speculate that this is
because the ``A-list'' threats have diminished since the end of the
Cold War. But another reason is that ``C-list'' issues dominate
media attention in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Nonvital crises such as Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti and Kosovo
continue to force their way to the foreground because of their
ability to command massive media attention. Such crises raise moral
issues that the American people consistently list among their
foreign-policy concerns. Policy experts may deplore such
sympathies, but they are a democratic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic visual portrayals of immediate human conflict and
suffering are far easier to convey to the public than ``A-list''
abstractions such as the possibility of a ``Weimar Russia,'' the
rise of a hegemonic China, the importance of our alliance with
Japan or the potential collapse of the international system of
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if these larger, more abstract strategic issues were to turn
out badly, they would have a far greater impact on the lives of
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do about the humanitarian concerns and strong
moral preferences that Americans want to see expressed in their
foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   Americans have rarely accepted pure realpolitik as a guiding
principle. Moreover, human rights and the alleviation of
humanitarian disasters have long been important aspects of our
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign policy involves trying to accomplish varied
objectives in a complex and recalcitrant world. This entails
tradeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A human-rights policy is not itself a foreign policy; it is an
important part of a foreign policy. During the Cold War, this
balancing act often meant tolerating human-rights abuses by regimes
that were crucial to balancing Soviet power _ for example, in South
Korea before its transition to democracy. Similar problems persist
in the current period _ witness our policy toward Saudi Arabia or
our efforts to balance human rights in China with our long-term
strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures are more powerful than words, and so arguments about
tradeoffs tend to become emotional and difficult. Few Americans can
look at television pictures of starving people or miserable
refugees and not say that their country should do something about
them.
</P>
<P>
   And acting on humanitarian values is often appropriate; the
United States often does respond to such catastrophes. Sometimes
this is quite easily done, such as hurricane relief to Central
America or the early stages of famine relief in Somalia. But
ostensibly simple cases such as Somalia can turn out to be
extremely difficult to resolve and others, such as Kosovo, are
difficult from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with such hard cases is that the humanitarian
interest that instigates the action often turns out to be a mile
wide and an inch deep. The American public's impulse to help
starving Somalis (whose food supply was being interrupted by
various warlords) vanished in the face of televised pictures of
dead U.S. soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Such transience is sometimes attributed to the popular
reluctance to accept casualties. But that is too simple. Americans
went into the Persian Gulf War expecting and willing to accept some
10,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As this suggests, Americans are reluctant to accept casualties
in cases where their only foreign-policy goals are unreciprocated
humanitarian interests. Ironically, when opinion turns against such
cases, this may not only divert attention and limit willingness to
support ``A-list'' interests, but may also undermine support for
action in other, more serious humanitarian crises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the direct effects of the Somalia disaster was America's
failure (along with other countries) to support and reinforce the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, which could have limited a true
genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers. We could not simply turn off the
television or unplug our computers even if we wanted to. The ``C
list'' cannot simply be ignored. But there are certain rules of
prudence that may help integrate such issues into the larger
strategy for advancing the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are many degrees of humanitarian concern and many
degrees of intervention to reflect them, such as condemnation,
sanctions targeted on individuals, broad sanctions and various uses
of force. We should save violent options for the most egregious
cases.
</P>
<P>
   When we do use force, it is worth remembering some principles of
what is known as the ``just war'' doctrine: having a just cause in
the eyes of others; discrimination in means so as to not unduly
punish the innocent; proportionality of means to ends; and a high
probability of good consequences (rather than wishful thinking).
</P>
<P>
   We should generally avoid the use of force except in cases where
our humanitarian interests are reinforced by the existence of other
strong national interests. This was the case in the gulf war, where
the United States was concerned not only with the aggression
against Kuwait, but also with energy supplies and regional allies.
This was not the case in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Kosovo), our interests
combine both humanitarian values and the strategic concerns of
European allies and NATO. We should try to involve other regional
actors, preferably in the lead role when possible. In Europe, we
should welcome the idea of combined joint task forces that would be
separable but not separate from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   We should also be clearer about what are true cases of genocide.
The American people have a real humanitarian interest in not
letting another Holocaust occur. Yet we did just that in Rwanda in
1994. We therefore need to do more to organize prevention and
response to real cases of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Genocide Convention is written so loosely and
the word is so abused for political purposes that there is danger
of the term becoming trivialized. But a strict historical
interpretation of the crime, based on the precedents of the
Holocaust and Rwanda, can help to avoid such pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Americans should be very wary about intervention in
civil wars over self-determination. The principle is dangerously
ambiguous. Atrocities are often committed by activists on both
sides and the precedents indicate there can be disastrous
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   How could these rules of prudence have helped in the case of
Kosovo? At an earlier stage, they would have produced more caution.
In December 1992, President Bush issued a vague threat that Serbia
should not attack ethnic Albanians in its Kosovo province, while he
remained silent on Bosnia. A year later, the Clinton administration
reiterated the warning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was saved from having to back up these threats
by the Kosovar Albanians' pacifist leader, Ibrahim Rugova, who
espoused a Gandhian response to Serbian oppression. After 1996, the
rise of the militantly pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army
undermined Rugova's leadership. According to journalist Chris
Hedges, the radicals of the KLA, who combine ``hints of fascism on
one side and whiffs of communism on the other,'' were labeled a
terrorist organization by U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
   A KLA victory might well have involved atrocities and ethnic
cleansing of the Serb minority in Kosovo. The KLA's refusal to sign
the Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks in February
let the alliance off the moral hook and should have been used as an
opportunity to step back. Instead, the United States ``fixed the

autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States then threatened to bomb Serbia. Milosevic
called the American bluff and initiated his planned ethnic
cleansing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, new facts on the ground raised Kosovo from the
``C list'' to the ``B list'' of U.S. foreign-policy concerns.

   The scale and ferocity of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing could not

even Germany joined the United States in calling for NATO action.
If the United States had then pulled the rug out from under its

NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The ``C-list'' humanitarian impact had grown immensely and was
now reinforced by a strategic interest in the future of the

<P>
   The war in Kosovo has reinforced the Balkans' image as a
cauldron of ethnic hatred. And yet we still need help understanding
the extent of the violence and cruelty involved in ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Although journalists such as Robert D. Kaplan, who wrote
``Balkan Ghosts,'' tend to regard Balkan violence as inherent in
Balkan cultures, it is postmodern orthodoxy in the academy to
insist that it is ``socially constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither perspective is very enlightening. State-imposed violence
is quite different from the violent actions of individuals, whether
acting on state orders or on their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ottoman Empire, kinship-based blood feuds of the type
common to medieval western Europe survived well into the 20th
century. They did so because the Turks did not efficiently provide
security and justice to their subjects after the 16th-century
Ottoman golden age, while the authorities they sanctioned among the
non-Muslims usually lacked the means to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Largely though not entirely suppressed after 1918, the ethic of
blood revenge, binding individual members of extended families,
sprang back to life when states disintegrated and civil wars
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this ethic has been successfully grafted onto
ethnic nationalism. The individual murders customary to blood feuds
are committed against the anonymous national enemy. This helps us
understand how such people as Slobodan Milosevic's security police
in Kosovo can murder and deport civilians of all ages. It also
helps explain violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   In the postcommunist Yugoslavian civil wars, rape's age-old
dishonoring effects have been heightened by perpetrators bent on
implanting their own ethnic offspring in the wombs of the national
enemy's women _ an ``essentialization'' of national identity if
there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances of civil war and ethnic cleansing, the
most ruthless rise to the fore. Some of the less ruthless manage to
escape the situation by, for example, emigrating to the U.S.
eastern seaboard, where hundreds of thousands of Serb and other
Balkan refugees unwilling to participate in the slaughter have
congregated. Those who cannot escape are forced to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar occurs in U.S. prisons, organized as they
usually are along ethnic lines that pit gangs of black, Latino, and
white racists against one another, leaving little or no room for
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   At the level of state-imposed violence, attacks upon the enemy's
human numbers _ such as the expulsion of the Kosovo Albanians and
the murder of many Kosovar Albanian men capable of bearing arms _
have a long history in the Balkans, stretching all the way back to
Thucydides' Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Evident here is the military and technological weakness of the
Balkan state, which, in Machiavellian manner, counsels destroying
the enemy's manpower in lieu of his industries or arms as the best
way of crippling his capacity to fight back. This can be grimly
effective. At the same time, ethnic cleansing may succeed, as
Milosevic seemed to hope, in establishing an irreversible fait
accompli in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the violence in both the 1992-95 wars in Croatia and
Bosnia and the 1999 war in Kosovo expresses not unmediated ancient
hatreds, but the insecurities accompanying the breakup of the
multinational communist confederation of Yugoslavia and the
unresolved conflicts over the establishment of new political
boundaries. In short, civil war sparked by conflicts over the
frontiers of the successor states has triggered the violence and
inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   Had those wars been fought more impersonally, in the high-tech
American way, the U.S. reaction to all the carnage would perhaps be
less horrified. The United States' fearsome bombing of German and
Japanese cities in World War II was far more destructive of
civilian life than anything that has occurred in postcommunist
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Analogies are frequently drawn between Serbian ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo and the Nazi genocide against the Jews. In some
particulars _ such as the victims' brutal uprooting from their
homes at gunpoint and their inhuman transportation by railroad _
the analogy, though inexact, is enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamentally, it is misleading. The Holocaust was a program
of biological extermination based on racist eugenic theories.
Balkan ethnic cleansing does not require mass extermination but
rather mass removal, which can be hastened along by displays of
murderous violence drawn from the repertory of revenge killings and
blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   This has, unfortunately, frequently occurred in the last century
_ for example, the destruction and expulsion of the Greeks by the
Turks in Asia Minor following the ill-fated Greek invasion of
Turkey in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lamentable Armenian genocide of 1915 was an extreme
form of ethnic cleansing, not an attempt to rid the earth of every
last Armenian. In 1914-15 czarist Russia forced the mass exodus of
its German-speaking subjects who lived along its borders with
Austria-Hungary. The largest such expulsion was that of the Germans
from eastern and Balkan Europe following the Nazi defeat of May
1945. Here some 12 million to 15 million people were uprooted and
driven from their homes amid rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   These points suggest that Milosevic falls short of Hitler.
Although his and his allies' complicity in war crimes justifies
their moral and legal condemnation, demonizing them serves no good
strategic purpose. The West is dealing with ruthless nationalists
who seek secure and (to them) honorable borders _ a goal understood
and shared by all Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
   A defeated Serbia seething with nationalist extremism would cast
shadows on neighboring states struggling toward democracy. The only
way to remove Milosevic from power is to achieve a peace within
which liberal, democratic civil-society movements can sink deeper
roots than they now have.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time for such an opposition to become a
majority in Serbia, as it will in Croatia and other postcommunist
Balkan regimes. But it is vital to the region that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington should take every care neither to impose
the peace of the graveyard on Serbia nor to turn its back on a
million or two Albanian Kosovar deportees. NATO _ which does not
mean the United States alone _ has now intervened deeply enough to
commit itself for the long term to peace in the Balkans. Anything
less fails to justify the West's resort to arms.

Turks in Asia Minor following the ill-fated Greek invasion of
Turkey in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lamentable Armenian genocide of 1915 was an extreme
form of ethnic cleansing, not an attempt to rid the earth of every
last Armenian. In 1914-15 czarist Russia forced the mass exodus of
its German-speaking subjects who lived along its borders with
Austria-Hungary. The largest such expulsion was that of the Germans
from eastern and Balkan Europe following the Nazi defeat of May
1945. Here some 12 million to 15 million people were uprooted and
driven from their homes amid rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   These points suggest that Milosevic falls short of Hitler.
Although his and his allies' complicity in war crimes justifies
their moral and legal condemnation, demonizing them serves no good
strategic purpose. The West is dealing with ruthless nationalists
who seek secure and (to them) honorable borders _ a goal understood
and shared by all Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
   A defeated Serbia seething with nationalist extremism would cast
shadows on neighboring states struggling toward democracy. The only
way to remove Milosevic from power is to achieve a peace within
which liberal, democratic civil-society movements can sink deeper
roots than they now have.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time for such an opposition to become a
majority in Serbia, as it will in Croatia and other postcommunist
Balkan regimes. But it is vital to the region that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington should take every care neither to impose
the peace of the graveyard on Serbia nor to turn its back on a
million or two Albanian Kosovar deportees. NATO _ which does not
mean the United States alone _ has now intervened deeply enough to
commit itself for the long term to peace in the Balkans. Anything
less fails to justify the West's resort to arms.

MOVIE PASSES MUSTER, `SOUTH PARK' CREATORS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ratings board of the Motion Picture
Association of America may be surprised by the final title of
``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut,'' opening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Board members demanded cuts when they first saw the animated
film about foul-mouthed third-graders, say creators Trey Parker and
Matt Stone, who co-wrote it and supplied many voices, with Parker
also directing.
</P>
<P>
   But their film is ``pretty much uncut,'' they said in an
interview here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the creators were upset with the MPAA's verdict. ``But
then we realized we could use it to our advantage,'' said Parker,
29.
</P>
<P>
   When told to cut a scene, he said, they made it ``five times
worse ... Then the MPAA came back and said, `OK, it's fine.' It was
totally arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their moral code is not the same as ours,'' said Stone, 27.
``In fact, it's not even consistent with themselves on a day-to-day
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Parker and Stone are consistent. Ever since ``South
Park'' evolved from a short ``Christmas card'' video circulated in
Hollywood into a Comedy Central cable hit (currently on hiatus)
followed by millions, they've become champions of humor that pushes
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Their new movie continues that process with an uncanny
timeliness.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, President Clinton has just complained about
kids seeing R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   In the Colorado town of South Park, bratty Cartman and other
third-graders do just that, sneaking into a comedy filled with
gutter language.
</P>
<P>
   When the kids repeat such words at school, alarmed parents
launch a moral crusade against the country of the film's origins,
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   War is declared, America turns totalitarian and kids are
implanted with chips giving electrical shocks when they say ``bad''
words.
</P>
<P>
   Like those kids, ``South Park's'' creators feel like ``whipping
boys'' _ of the MPAA.
</P>
<P>
   They said the ratings board first ``pushed our buttons'' by
giving ``Orgazmo'' _ their absurdist comedy about porno filmmakers
_ an NC-17, a commercial death sentence. ``Orgazmo'' was
non-violent and had little nudity, just constant talk about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a studio behind us, and there wasn't anything
we could do about it,'' said Parker, who calls ``South Park'' ``way
more hardcore than ''Orgazmo,`` which was almost chaste. But
''South Park`` had Paramount behind it, and they were able to push
it through.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore their contentions, Parker and Stone put war scenes
in ``South Park'' aping ``Saving Private Ryan,'' an R-rated film
that they felt should have been rated NC-17 for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, in our film people think language is bad, but
violence and bloodshed are OK,'' Parker said. ``And of course, the
MPAA didn't say anything about the violence, either. It was just,
`Don't say this word,' but blowing people to shreds was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators, who met while students at the University of
Colorado, also have been slammed by critics. ``Orgazmo'' was
roasted, as was their ribald sports film, ``BASEketball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reviews weren't saying they didn't like the movies so much
as they hated us,'' Parker said. ``They were so mean _ just
personally attacking us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a lot of good press, too,'' Stone said. ``But
we've also seen people who laughed all through `Orgazmo' or
`BASEketball' and then give them bad reviews. They don't understand
laughter as a guilty pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Their series has come under fire for its use of crude language.
The film is even more profane. Parker and Stone _ like comedians
Lenny Bruce and George Carlin before them _ say that epithets ``are
just words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's getting hurt by them,'' Parker said. ``In fact,
halfway through our movie, you're kind of numb to it all. The words
aren't for humor so much as to make a point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not language that's made `South Park' successful,'' Stone
said. ``It's bizarre situations and characters people love.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movie has the same crude style as the TV show, with
jumpy movements for characters who look like paper cutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the 80-minute film cost $20 million. Four TV episodes
with the same total length would cost about $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we took longer _ and Paramount had to pay all these
producers,'' Parker said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, technical demands were greater, especially for
elaborate Broadway-style production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to look like (the series), but we also did things
to say, `This is a movie,''' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``South Park's'' future, Stone and Parker say its ratings
are still strong, though they've dropped from the highs of the
show's peak publicity last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're where we should be,'' Parker said. ``It's still one of
the highest rated shows on cable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get half the ratings we get now and it would still be
profitable for Comedy Central,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   With all the furor over their cartoons, the creators are amused
that some who first branded the show as ``unimportant, trite and
stupid'' are blaming ``South Park'' for the ills of society and its
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess we do have an effect then,'' Parker said.
``Which is it?''

   Rodney Orr will never forget that breezy Saturday in September
nine years ago. While spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco, he decided to kick away from his paddleboard. Suddenly
he felt as if a boat had run over him. ``All I heard was a big
crunch, kind of like a garage door closing,'' Orr says. White teeth
pierced his eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose. Orr's entire head was in the grip of a
shark. But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended. Orr
survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims. Why? This is just
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, reports
Glen Martin, who covers the environment beat for the San Francisco
Chronicle. A fascinating sidebar titled ``Shark Avoidance'' is

   Rodney Orr will never forget that breezy Saturday in September
nine years ago. While spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco, he decided to kick away from his paddleboard. Suddenly
he felt as if a boat had run over him. ``All I heard was a big
crunch, kind of like a garage door closing,'' Orr says. White teeth
pierced his eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose. Orr's entire head was in the grip of a
shark. But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended. Orr
survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims. Why? This is just
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, reports
Glen Martin, who covers the environment beat for the San Francisco
Chronicle. A fascinating sidebar titled ``Shark Avoidance'' is
included.

   Crack may be the most addictive substance used by humankind. Its
effects are so potent and immediate that a single hit can hook you.
There's no approved medical treatment for cocaine addiction.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night. However, the U.S.
National Institute on Drug Abuse is now testing a time-honored
approach to controlling disease: vaccination.

   Rodney Orr will never forget that breezy Saturday in September
nine years ago. While spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco, he decided to kick away from his paddleboard. Suddenly
he felt as if a boat had run over him. ``All I heard was a big
crunch, kind of like a garage door closing,'' Orr says. White teeth
pierced his eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose. Orr's entire head was in the grip of a
shark. But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended. Orr
survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims. Why? This is just
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, reports
Glen Martin, who covers the environment beat for the San Francisco
Chronicle. A fascinating sidebar titled ``Shark Avoidance'' is

   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it

<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

proud to play with her teammates. Players on the women's national
team do ``a lot of great and wonderful things for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind each statement that seems too saccharine to be
sincere, there is earnestness. Milbrett believes everything she
says. She doesn't do anything half-hearted. In the shadow of Mia
Hamm, the diminutive forward has made a name for herself with
explosive dribbling, a deft touch around the goal, and unfailingly
honest effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anywhere on the soccer field is where you fit in,''
said Milbrett. ``I think it's a matter of what you're given and
your skill level. I'm a forward. I'm a sprinter. I'm short. I'm low
to the ground. I'm fast, quick. I'm a goal scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   The last pronouncement could be considered an understatement.
She scored the winner in the 1996 Olympic final against China and
ranks fifth on the US all-time scoring list. At the University of
Portland, the small forward finished her career the school's
all-time leading scorer with 103 goals. Until US teammate Danielle
Fotopoulos broke the record, Milbrett and Hamm stood atop the list
of NCAA Division 1 all-time goal scorers. Milbrett still holds
Oregon high school records for most goals in a season (54) and
career (131).
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the World Cup, she demonstrated the same prolific
touch, leading the US in scoring with 10 goals and 9 assists in 14
tuneup matches. Against Nigeria Thursday, Milbrett notched her
first two goals of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Her first point came midway through the first half when she
collected a ball off Cindy Parlow's shin and struck it with the
outside of her right foot. The shot curled away from the
outstretched Nigerian keeper. Later, playing on the restraining
line tucked behind the last Nigerian defender, Milbrett slid for a
ball served by Parlow. With her left foot, she nudged the ball past
the goalie to complete the Americans' 7-1 romp.
</P>
<P>
   In the same match, Milbrett showed she could also set up her
teammates. Her arching 20-yard pass in the 42d minute started a
chain reaction of head balls that led to Parlow's first World Cup
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated because I was so nervous (against Denmark)
and I was so mad at myself for being nervous,'' said Milbrett.
``You don't get a World Cup game very often so the thing you want
to do is give your best and do your best. I was really happy about
the way I came out against Nigeria because I was really focused. It
was just a matter of finally getting over the nerves and then
getting back to what I do best and that's creating chances and
scoring goals.''
</P>
<P>
   With 14 goals and 9 assists in 1998, she ranked second behind
Hamm in team scoring for the third consecutive year. But that
doesn't bother Milbrett. When Hamm is being double-teamed or fouled
hard by opponents, the US knows the 5-foot-2-inch Milbrett brings
equal speed and ability to burst past defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the sport of soccer was designed for players
with her ability,'' said US coach Tony DiCicco. ``It's the perfect
sport for Tiffeny. You don't have to be a giant to play it. You
just have to be quick and determined and tough. She's one of our
fastest players. She's one of the best take-on dribblers in the
world. And on her day, she can score goals that have you holding
your breath.''
</P>
<P>
   She made her first appearance with the US team in August 1991
against China, but it took a while for her to feel comfortable and
confident with her teammates. Milbrett's starting role gradually
has increased since 1995 and with that comes chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milli's a genuine person,'' said Kristine Lilly. ``My favorite
thing is after we score a goal, whoever scores, she's the first one
to give the most genuine hug I've ever seen and she's always
smiling. She adds spice with her play.''

PICTURES WORTH A THOUSAND LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In London, Prince William doesn't smile brightly
enough in the official photo of his uncle's wedding, so the
photographer takes William's grinning face from another shot and
morphs it onto the family portrait for Prince Edward and Sophie
Rhys-Jones' nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   In Madison, Conn., a high school senior outrages his parents by
shaving his head just before the yearbook pictures are shot, so his
folks get a photo company to digitally restore the kid's longer
hairstyle for the yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   This increasingly common practice gives me the creeps: using a
computer to alter a photographic record of reality.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's one thing for Hugh Hefner's minions to airbrush
to perfection every Playboy Playmate's bodacious ta-tas.
</P>
<P>
   But to put a smile where there was none?
</P>
<P>
   A crop of healthy brown hair where the reality was a 5 o'clock
shadow? Where will it stop? Will it stop?
</P>
<P>
   My favorite part of ``Wag the Dog'' was when the script called
for Hollywood computer wizards to transform a ditzy blonde model _
carrying a package of Tostitos _ into a terrified Albanian who was
fleeing bombs and clutching a white cat.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a cynical movie about cynical movie makers and
cynical politicians (redundant, I know). I hate to think that every
image in daily life will soon be suspect. Did it really happen that
way or did some unseen hand change history with a mouse and a
scanner?
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Prince William is a shy guy who isn't all that at
ease in front of a camera. To have him show up as the only Mr.
Sobersides in a smiley family wedding portrait seems to me a
faithful rendering of the way things are.
</P>
<P>
   In years to come, all the royals could have looked at Ed and
Sophie's wedding photo and sighed, ``Ah, just like William.''
</P>
<P>
   In next century's history books, scholars could have noted that
William displayed his customary solemnity.
</P>
<P>
   Now that peculiar, individual ``imperfection'' is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Daniel Young's senior picture. For reasons important
to his teen-age self, Young got himself a buzzcut. He was making a
statement. His kids and grandkids could have looked at the yearbook
photo and asked him what the cut was all about. Or they could have
split a gut laughing at him. But the point is, Young's real-life
deed would have been recorded in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his preppy haircut, tie and white shirt, he looks
perfectly homogenous and devoid of statements.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked about all this, Kim Komenich, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographer for the San Francisco Examiner, told me
that altering photographic images ``has been around as long as
photography has.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was portrait photographers retouching a prom queen's
face to remove her acne and lightening the skin tone of
African-Americans or National Geographic moving the Great Pyramids
a few feet to the left, reality has always been flexible in
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, before, you had to be really good at the
alchemy,'' Komenich said. ``Because it was so difficult to do _ and
there was no un-do button _ only accomplished photographers did the
altering. Now you can buy a scanner for $99, and anybody can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else that is generated by computers, I feel
certain that photo morphing will proceed unchecked. Put technology
into the hands of the masses and the masses will use it _
especially when it means you can place yourself on the bridge of
the Enterprise right next to Captain Picard.
</P>
<P>
   People like me, who grew up trusting photos, thinking of them as
snapshots of reality, soon will be looked upon as quaint or
laughably naive. Probably we already are.
</P>
<P>
   We come from an era in which one picture was worth a thousand
words. Now the exchange rate is not so good.

CAN CELTICS GET UP TO SPEED AT 55? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- History tells us that at least one late second-rounder
taken in Wednesday's NBA draft will make it. Barring any deal, that
is where the Celtics pick _ 55th overall _ and it will be their one
crack at the Class of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino may be disinclined to even think about making the
pick and who can blame him? He has 12 guaranteed contracts. He has
at least one free agent (Bruce Bowen) he might want to re-sign. If
the Celtics do choose, and there's no rule that says they have to,
Pitino may go with a familiar face (best Kentucky guy) or take a
project.
</P>
<P>
   Since the league expanded to 29 teams in 1995, making No. 55 a
second rounder, no player taken at that spot has done much. Do
these names ring a bell? _ Ryan Bowen, Mark Blount, Ronnie
Henderson, and Michael McDonald. Of the four, only McDonald has
even played in the league and that was a cameo in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   However, in four of the last five years, at least one player
taken in the 50s has gone on to play in the league, the best being
Shandon Anderson, whom Utah took with the 54th pick in 1996. Others
include Lawrence Funderburke (51 in '94), Don Reid (58 in '96), and
Chris Crawford (51 in '97). No one taken in the 50's last year did
anything, although J.R. Henderson (56) did stick with the Grizzlies
as a 12th man/cheerleader/nobody else available.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence to suggest that a second-round
choice is not a waste. You could put together a pretty competitive
team with former second rounders. Tiny Archibald and Maurice Cheeks
were second rounders, although Archibald went 19th overall. (Cheeks
went 36th.) The Celtics occasionally have come up big in the second
round with some of the better ones being Danny Ainge, K.C. Jones,
Kevin Stacom, Brad Lohaus, Jeff Judkins, and Dino Radja.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics don't expect much this time around; general manager
Chris Wallace said he hopes he's still awake when the time comes
for Boston to choose. But that's not to say Wallace isn't doing his
homework and isn't hoping that a player they have rated much higher
than 55 is there when their turn arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are picking at the upper end of the draft, you have
to concern yourself with what a guy can't do. How can he fail? The
ramifications are so huge. And every year, two or three guys in the
top 10 are going to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second round, it's the reverse. You're looking for
positives, something you can hang your hat on. Is he an NBA
rebounder? Can he make a shot? Is there some aspect of his game
that is it an NBA level?''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace mentioned Manute Bol as an example. Bol went in the
second round in 1985 to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at him as a potential lottery or high pick and you
see no body, no offense, no experience. You look at him in the
second round and, hey, he's 7-7 and can block shots,'' Wallace
said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest second-round draft had to be in 1986; it ended up
being better than the first. Among those taken include Dennis
Rodman, Mark Price, and Jeff Hornacek. Meanwhile, the first-round
casualties that year included Len Bias, Chris Washburn, William
Bedford, Kenny Walker, Roy Tarpley, Pearl Washington, and Walter
Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round pickers look for the proverbial drifter, due to
``suspicious background'' or other potentially naughty stuff like
blowing off interviews or appointments. Nick Van Exel, thought to
be a top 15 pick in 1993, slipped to 37 in part because he missed
some workouts. Cliff Robinson had a so-so senior year and fell from
the first round to 36. (Who will ever forget the sad sight of
Robinson, alone, in the green room waiting to hear his name?)
</P>
<P>
   Europe used to be a fertile source for second rounders; Radja
and Toni Kukoc went in the second. Lately, players such as Dejan
Bodiroga, Zeljko Rebraca, and Bruno Sundov went in the second. But
if there's a decent European out there, he's going in the first
round; witness Predrag Stojakovic (Sacramento) and Zydrunas
Ilgauskus (Cleveland) in 1996 and Dirk Nowitzki (Dallas), Radoslav
Nesterovic (Minnesota), Mirsad Turkcan (Houston), and Vladimir
Stepania (Seattle) last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are two European-weaned centers who may go in
the first round and definitely won't be around at 55: Aleksandar
Radojevic, a possible lottery pick, and French center Frederic
Weis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more emphasis on scouting in Europe,'' Wallace
said. ``Plus, there have been changes in Europe that have had a
negative impact on the sport, mainly, the conflict in Yugoslavia.
Now, guys coming over here don't have the resumes and experience
that guys like Kukoc and Radja had.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pitino bothers, he may go with someone such as Heshimu Evans,
although he never officially coached the 6-foot-6-inch Kentucky
forward. Evans transferred from Manhattan and was a redshirt in
1996-97, Pitino's last season. Another possibility is Kentucky's
Wayne Turner, a point guard who does everything but shoot. He may
be gone by 55.
</P>
<P>
   So don't cancel your plans to wait for the Celtics' pick.
Chances are you haven't heard of him and he won't be around for
long. But there's always that small glimmer of hope. Few heard of
Anderson a couple years ago, and now he's a millionaire, a regular,
and an attractive free agent.

GAME LODGE'S REPUTATION CLASHES WITH ITS REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1952, Princess Elizabeth of Great Britain went up to spend a
night at Treetops game lodge in Kenya, and when she returned in the
morning, she was a queen: Her father had died during the night.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that was almost half a century ago, and even though
the Treetops she stayed in burned down a few years later, the
cramped, bloated substitute that carries on the name still leans on
that legend. Maybe it's because that's the last brag-worthy event
its owners have had.
</P>
<P>
   In my party of five that visited in February, not a one of us
rated it more than 1 on a scale of 10.
</P>
<P>
   What separates Treetops from most game lodges are the creature
comforts; they all belong to the creatures: salt licks and a large
watering hole. There's no nature path, no swimming pool, no native
floor show after dinner; the animals are supposed to be the
entertainment. Huge lights flood the watering hole all night, and
there is a system to alert guests from their sleep if anything
interesting arrives outside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the accommodations are spare. A handful of bathrooms are
available for the dozens of rooms, most of which sleep two people.
The rooms have no locks, and are so small that I had to skip my
morning situps because there wasn't enough floor space.
</P>
<P>
   My room had a bonus: an infestation of locusts. When I saw the
dozen or so long, green pests upon entering, I went to ask, but was
assured that they are harmless. Perhaps, but the idea of spending
the night while they prowled the room was creepy. So using the
plastic bag that my drinking glass was wrapped in as a glove, I
grabbed them, one by one, and cast them outside. I had it down to
one or two by dinnertime.
</P>
<P>
   I joined my companions outside the dining hall, and we spent the
10-minute wait batting away the swarms of Nairobi flies that were
dive bombing us and everyone else. (Thankfully, the dining room was
cramped, but somehow insect free.) When I returned to my room a few
hours later, I found a dozen locusts more. Figuring I had missed
these before, I again donned my mitt, began catching, and again got
them down to a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Then I got into bed, to read before sleep. As I lay on my back,
I noticed I had missed a couple more up in the corner. Then I
realized the ceiling did not connect with the room's rough-hewn
corner post. Then I noticed the parade of locusts, slowly marching
single file into the room, our of some science-fiction horror.
Luckily, when I reached a staff member this time, they relocated me
to a room with a stable number of pests.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, you say? This is the wild, and even in an extreme
case, what's a few bugs? Sure, but the locusts outnumbered the
beasts we had come to see. Soon after arrival, someone exclaimed,
``Hey look, here comes an elephant!'' The day before, my companions
and I had been amid a herd of perhaps 50, close enough to touch
them (no, we didn't). Except one herd of water buffalo, the locusts
were the most notable event.
</P>
<P>
   William Otieno, Treetops' manager, blamed the insects on wet
conditions brought on by highly unusual, unseasonal rains. I asked
him about the lack of game, and puzzlingly, he said game turnout
has been great the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there was nothing more he could say. Even when one saves
for years, plans for months, and journeys for a day and a half to
get there, this was yet more proof that travel offers no
guarantees. Sometimes bad weather intervenes. Sometimes events
conspire to ruin a day.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you learn that some places are living off
reputations established _ and then eroded _ long ago.

MEXICO NEIGHBORS FIGHT AN INDUSTRY'S POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORREON, Mexico _ Dolores Guillen never expected to become a
political organizer, much less lead a crusade against the world's
largest silver mining plant, which sits just a few hundred yards
from her front door.
</P>
<P>
   But her small, white-brick house in this hot and dusty northern
Mexican city has become the nerve center for one of the country's
most dramatic battles against corporate environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
   One by one during the past year, dozens of children in Guillen's
neighborhood _ including her 6- and 13-year-old sons _ have been
found to have harmful levels of lead in their blood, mostly caused
by particles that drifted from the sprawling plant that belongs to
Met-Mex Penoles, say government and health authorities here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a bunch of mothers, not organizers or a political
party,'' Guillen said recently as she sifted through a stack of
papers with the names and tests of children who have been diagnosed
with lead poisoning. ``But we're fighting two big monsters _ a big
business and our government.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle between the poor residents and their industrial
neighbor has marked a shift in the way once-lax government
authorities respond to such hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, state and federal environmental prosecutors ordered
the company to cut its lead emissions by half and to take
responsibility for treating all affected children and relocating
more than 400 families. Officials say it is the first time a
company has been held liable for violations that predate Mexico's
environmental laws, which went into effect in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The smelting plant has operated here for nearly a century,
processing minerals taken from the surrounding desert, which was
once a prehistoric sea floor. With more than 2,000 workers, most of
them from Torreon, Met-Mex Penoles is one of the city's largest and
most influential employers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the plant sat in an isolated parcel away from the
city's main residential and business areas. But as this city 300
miles from the Texas border grew, new neighborhoods sprouted just
outside the company's walls, dangerously close to mounds of
minerals that were often left uncovered and exposed to winds that
regularly swirl down from nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime residents say government officials back then did not
warn them about the risks of living so close to the plant. Nor did
authorities or company officials act after a study published in
1978 showed that strands of hair from children living near the
plant had unusually high levels of lead.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was essentially ignored until late last year, when
Alonso Garcia Vargas, a toxicologist at the University of Juarez in
the neighboring state of Durango, published an updated and more
complete study.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 394 children tested at schools near the plant, 98 of them
had lead levels in their blood above 25 micrograms per deciliter.
Most US health experts say anything above 10 micrograms of lead per
deciliter of blood is unhealthy. Others argue that anything above
35 micrograms could result in damage to a child's nervous system.
And a level of 80 or higher could result in convulsions or even
death.
</P>
<P>
   Also last fall, a local pediatrician, Manuel Velasco, began
reporting cases of high lead blood levels he found in several of
his patients to state health authorities. One child had a reading
of 80 micrograms per deciliter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a silent epidemic here,'' Velasco said. ``Many of
these kids looked healthy, but they were mentally slow or had
chronic internal problems. It will take as many as 20 years for
some of these children to recover if the lead is in their bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, which began antilead campaigns in the
1970s, Mexico only recently has confronted the threats posed by
lead in the environment. It now sells unleaded gasoline and
encourages the sale of household paints without lead.
</P>
<P>
   Out of fear that government authorities might shut them down,
company officials have publicly accepted responsibility for the two
areas most affected by the plant's emissions, and they have agreed
to spend more than $34 million for the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lead is a product we produce, and we understand that it
creates problems,'' said Luis Rey Delgado Garcia, Met-Mex Penoles's
community relations director. ``But we must also remember that
Mexico didn't have regulations on lead until very recently.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its agreement, Met-Mex Penoles has sent platoons of
workers _ wearing face masks and protective white suits _ into
neighborhood streets and homes to sweep away and vacuum the lead
dust.
</P>
<P>
   It has set up a mobile clinic in one neighborhood to conduct
more tests and to dispense vitamins and medicines for children, and
the company is paying the bills for more than two dozen children
who have been hospitalized. It also will pay to relocate hundreds
of families and tear down their contaminated homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Titanic task,'' said Edmundo Mesta, a company
physician who is overseeing much of the outreach and treatment
projects. ``It took the United States 30 years to bring down its
lead levels, so we cannot just do this in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   But lead may not be the plant's only problem. A Dartmouth
University study released in April found that levels of two other
toxic contaminants, arsenic and cadmium, were also alarmingly high.
All three are also suspected carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many residents here aren't satisfied. Two dozen families
have banded together to file a lawsuit against the company, but
their case is already running into trouble in Mexico's arcane legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 1,000 environmental regulations, but the
laws are deficient,'' said Paolo Solano Tovar, a Mexico City
environmental lawyer. ``Active participants can't file a suit, and
if you do file a complaint, you're not allowed to seek other
remedies. These are technical flaws that need to be changed so that
people can stand up for their rights.''

   There are more than 4,000 gun shows held in the United States
each year, predominately in the south and west. Most of them do not
welcome photojournalists. But Florida's largest gun show, held at
the Palm Beach County's South Florida Fairgrounds earlier this
month, invited Globe associate editor Stan Grossfeld to take
photos, and talk with vendors and customers.
</P>

 &QL; 
Mary Cummings, licensed gun dealer &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Did you ever have to use a gun?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was a victim of an armed robbery in my business just west
of Palm Beach. I have a gun store and I was sitting in the store
with an off duty Palm Beach county sheriff's deputy. Two white
17-year-olds walked in the door. I was behind the counter and I had
the off-duty police officer sitting in front of me. They walked up
and put a gun to my head, one jumped the counter and they started
stealing guns.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that ran through my mind was very simple: they
were not wearing masks, they made no attempt to cover their
identity, they were actually calling each other by their right
names _ there was no doubt in my mind that they had full intentions
of killing me.
</P>
<P>
   One went to leave, and the other one's in the back of the store
holding the gun on myself and the police officer. I reached over to
hit the panic button; I have a wireless remote that goes to the
police department . . . I turned around and this guy's got the
trigger just about half way pulled on the police officer. He had
full intentions of shooting the cop in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   I carry my own gun, a .38 revolver, on my side. And he didn't
happen to see it, and I was able to get the draw on him and I shot
him. I fired one round and it hit him. The bullet _ one in a
million odds _ passed through both main arteries of his heart and
he lived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing was what happened afterwards; it took me a year
and a half of fighting, ranting, raving, and screaming bloody
murder to get this state to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   The one I shot was a straight A student. My own personal feeling
was that it was a gang initiation. They both came from two-parent
homes. Upper middle class. This was Ozzie and Harriet land. White
America.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to say he had a split personality. He thought he was
John Travolta from Pulp Fiction. They tried everything.
</P>
<P>
   They were sentenced to four years in the state pen and two years
probation. Of course, one of them only did a year and he's out. The
one that I shot is still in, 'til 2001. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Arent you worried about possible retribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every day of my life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What do you do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Got a larger caliber gun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: How did it feel to pull the trigger?
</P>
<P>
   A: If it was me or some punk kid, sorry, kid loses. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Where did they get the gun used in the robbery?
</P>
<P>
   A: From the father, left it laying around the house. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: How do you keep kids from playing with guns?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's the responsibility of parents. You don't go around
leaving Clorox and chemicals around the house, so why do it with
guns? Keep guns secure. Instead of a gun lock and hiding it and
saying don't touch it, try explaining that its not like you see on
TV where the bad guy gets shot and he's back next week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Is there a way to stop straw sales (in which someone buys a gun
for another person)? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A: There's no way for a dealer to know (if someone is buying a gun
for someone else.) (And) if a suspect tries, and you refuse it, and
you stop it, the ATF does not enforce it . . .
</P>
<P>
   Go back and ask the government how many times they've prosecuted
people who've lied on this form (about who the gun was for). And
the answer is zero. Instead of making new laws, they need to
enforce the ones they got. &QL; 
 &QL; 
-------------------------------------------------------------- &QC; 
 &QL; 
Bill Page, a promoter known as the P.T. Barnum of gun shows. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What effect did the shootings in Littleton, Colorado have on
your gun show?
</P>
<P>
   A: Littleton? That tragedy out there hasn't really had anything
to do with our shows here in Florida. The Y2K thing, more people
are concerned about that. I think this Y2K scare has got everyone
crazy now. We have people spending alot of money. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: There's a statistic that Clinton recently cited that at 46
percent of gun shows there's a convicted felon either buying or
selling guns. How do you feel about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Less than 2 percent of guns used in crimes comes from gun
shows; that leaves 98 percent that comes from someplace else. We
have ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau) come around
checking and they found nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is not the bad guys you think of. They are the backbone
of this country. They are the working middle and upper class of
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Look beyond the NRA. Crime is down in this country. The
president wants to take credit for it. We look at new statistics
that are coming out about concealed weapons permits; where states
have concealed weapons permits, crime is down. Because now we have
criminals who are afraid.
</P>
<P>
   We have another problem with children getting a hold of parents
guns when they go out. That's a major problem they want to put
locks on everything. Well 80 percent of the industry in handguns
(already) sends gunlocks on their guns when they're sent. So we're
already policing ourselves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Why do you allow people with concealed gun permits to purchase
guns immediately?
</P>
<P>
   A: A concealed weapons permit allows you to buy firearms right
then and there because you've been thoroughly checked out,
fingerprints are on file. It's only good people. &QL;

REAL QUIET BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine. A horse who wasn't good enough to win the Massachusetts
Handicap at Suffolk Downs won the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup
Sunday. Has Suffolk become the hub of the racing universe?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. But it is true that Real Quiet, who finished
third as the 4-5 favorite behind Behrens and Running Stag in the
$600,000 MassCap, redeemed himself with an impressive score in the
Gold Cup. Real Quiet, who won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness last
year, received two big breaks in the Gold Cup. First, Old Trieste,
a potential monster who would have been favored, was scratched,
suffering from an abscessed foot. Second, Real Quiet, who was boxed
in around the turn and into the stretch, got running room late
along the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys will tell you that small fields can produce the toughest
trips because riders have the luxury of clocking all their
opponents. There were only four starters in the Gold Cup, and, sure
enough, Real Quiet was trapped in last behind dueling front-runners
Budroyale and Malek, and stalking Puerto Madero. Past the 16th-pole
Malek came out just enough to let Real Quiet loose, and he tallied
by a half-length at 9-10 ($3.80) in 1:59 3/5 for the 1 1/4 miles.
Budroyale, Malek, and Puerto Madero followed, in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left myself with three options,'' said Bailey, who rode Real
Quiet. ``Go out, go in, go in between if the horses kind of split
on me. I think I prepared myself well, but you always have to have
some luck and a good horse.'' It was the second straight Gold Cup
victory for Bailey, who rode Skip Away last year, and fourth in the
last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if my horse even saw Real Quiet,'' said Ted West,
who trains Budroyale, the longshot at 7-1. ``I was hoping they
wouldn't let him through, but Bailey found a way through there
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, trainer of Real Quiet, had a terrific weekend,
winning several major races at tracks around the country. The
``Silver Fox,'' who lost some luster with a bad Triple Crown season
and Real Quiet's flop in the MassCap, does not stay down for long.
Real Quiet did not like the deep, sandy track at Suffolk. A deep
track was the least of his worries at Hollywood, and, it turns out,
the 1 1/8 miles in the MassCap may have been too short for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he runs a mile and one-quarter, that's his distance,''
said Baffert. ``Any shorter, and he's going to have his little
problems. That's why he's not a win machine (20-6-5-6).''
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Real Quiet into second place in the NTRA
Champions series with 22 points, behind Behrens, who has 28. Next
for Behrens is the Suburban at Belmont July 5. Real Quiet may go in
the Whitney at Saratoga Aug. 1, both series races. The decisive
meeting should come in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar
Aug. 29, the final race in the series and the event that decides
the bonus awards.

   Sweet 16 at Rock

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's $75,000 Rockingham Breeders' Cup has drawn 16
nominations, and the highweight, Mysterious Moll at 119 pounds, is
scheduled to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, for fillies and mares at a mile and one-16th on the
turf, may also attract Cozy Blues, the second weight at 117, and
the top two turf mares based in New England, Nana's Toy and Sandy
Gator, both weighted at 115.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old daughter of Bates Motel, Mysterious Moll is trained
by Del Caroll, and will be shipped in from New York to stay in the
barn of top local trainer John Botty. Sporting a lifetime record of
17-5-2-4, Mysterious Moll was most recently third to Cozy Blues in
the Just A Game Handicap at Belmont June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Cozy Blues, a 5-year-old daughter of Cure the Blues, is trained
by H. James Bond, who conditions Behrens. Bond is stabled at
Saratoga and likes to race at the New England tracks. Last year,
Bond took both the Rock Breeders' Cup and the Spicy Living with
Innovate. Cozy Blues has a lifetime record of 22-5-4-3, and
captured the Just A Game with a late charge from off the pace. The
field for the Rock Breeders' Cup will be drawn Friday.

   Wonderland sets dates
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wonderland Park released its stakes schedule Monday, and the
$100,000 Wonderland Derby is set for Aug. 14. Derby trials will be
held July 26, July 31, Aug. 5, and Aug. 9. This will be the 65th
annual running of the Derby, contested over the 2,045 feet of the
Revere Course, with $60,000 going to the connections of the
greyhound who wins the final. The Grady Memorial Sprint, the other
major contest on the Wonderland slate, has been moved from June to
Oct. 9. Prelims for the 22d annual Grady, raced at the
five-16ths-of-a-mile sprint distance, will be conducted Sept. 20,
25, 30, and Oct. 4. The Grady carried a $75,000 purse last year,
but the purse for this year has yet to be determined. ``There was
kennel sickness around the country from late winter through the
spring,'' said Wonderland assistant general manager Ron Wohlen.
``We felt if we ran it in June, it would be too early, and then it
would back into the Derby. The next best route was to put it in the
fall and run it on Columbus Day weekend. We've had it in the fall
in the past.'' . . . One of Baffert's other big weekend scores came
when General Challenge took the $125,000 Affirmed Handicap at
Hollwood Park Saturday. As coupled in an entry with the filly
Excellent Meeting, General Challenge was the 9-2 Kentucky Derby
favorite, but he was crushed during the running and finished 11th.
The fact that he won his return engagement is a sign that he's
recovered from his unpleasant Derby experience. General Challenge,
who was ridden by David Flores, doffed the blinkers he had been
wearing, and came on from the back of a five-horse field to tally
by 2 lengths, defeating two nice foes, Desert Hero and Crowning
Storm.

FIFA CUP PLANS MAY DILUTE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIFA president Sepp Blatter has been waging a campaign to make
soccer players' lives easier, or at least to reduce the number of
games they are required to play.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the first round of Europe's Intertoto Cup concluded _ a
month after the Champions League final _ Blatter has been touring
the United States and South America, which are hosting the big
international tournaments of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But beware of FIFA presidents bearing gifts. Nearly everything
FIFA is supporting appears to be adding to the demands placed on
players. Blatter proposed last week that Japan and Korea co-host
the Confederations Cup in 2001 as a trial run for the World Cup the
following year. Nearly everyone was hoping the recently concocted
event, scheduled June 24-Aug. 4 in Mexico, would be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter's plan is to play the World Cup every two years. This
sounds like it would mean more games, but Blatter insists there
would be less, since ``meaningless'' friendlies could be eliminated
and continental championships could take on a dual purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This way, the Copa America, which starts Wednesday in Paraguay,
can be used as a qualifier for the World Cup. The tradition of Copa
America, the oldest continental tournament in the world, would be
wiped out in the name of efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The international calendar makes sense from a modern business
standpoint, but it would devalue other competitions and blur the
identity of leagues and tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Even England's FA Cup, played annually since 1872, could be
expendable. Manchester United has qualified for the World Team
Championship, another newly created tournament for continental club
champions. For United to be involved in the event, scheduled Jan.
5-14 in Brazil, it would have to sacrifice participating in the FA
Cup, in which it is defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United directors at first declined the invitation to
the Team Championship, but now are being pressured to play because
of England's interest in bidding against Germany for the 2006 World
Cup. United took a dramatic 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich in the
Champions League final last month in Barcelona. And if United fails
to go to Brazil, the Germans will be the replacement, a huge
political and public relations coup.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what if the World Cup were held every two years? England
could wait until, say, 2008 or 2010 for its chance. Africa could be
appeased and the US cash cow could be milked more often.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost arenas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What price stadiums? The current hysteria for new stadiums has
led to some inflated pricing, mostly in the US.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus Crew's $28.5 million structure is exceptional in
the US. Several similar stadiums have been built recently in
England for similarly reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the Arena Atleticana was inaugurated last week in
Curitiba. The stadium has a 32,000-seat capacity and can be
increased to 50,000 should Brazil present a serious bid for the
World Cup finals. There are also luxury boxes, elevators,
restaurants, accommodations for musical presentations, even a moat,
and a transparent policarbonate covering. Total price is listed at
25 million reis, about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The national team drew a capacity crowd at the Arena for its 3-0
victory over Latvia Saturday, with goals by Alex, Ronaldo, and
Roberto Carlos. Mario Celso Petraglia, president of Atletico
Paranaense, said the Arena annually will draw 2 million spectators
for 70 events.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New league of their own?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The crowds for Women's World Cup indicate there is an audience
capable of sustaining a league at a level above the current W
League. Organizers have talked of starting one in 2001, using this
year's event and the 2000 Olympics as foundations.
</P>
<P>
   But they should not be overly ambitious. Starting from scratch,
and attempting to promote an on-going league is much different than
the one-time, big event World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a league already exists, though at the semi-pro level. The
W League provides a realistic structure, and could be modified to
incorporate greater investment.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer has some strong support in New England, and the
Boston Renegades show both the limitations and potential of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Renegades owners Tom Bagley and Reidar Tryggestad of
Massachusetts Professional Soccer were involved with the country's
first successful promotions of women's soccer in recent years,
starting with the US-Norway games in the New England Sports Museum
Challenge Cup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Renegades started three years ago, with roots in the local
club scene. Former coaches Rick Copland and Peter Counsell had been
involved with women's soccer since the 1970s and they brought
several players from their club, Opus County Younts, to the
Renegades. The team attracted nearly 2,000 fans per game in its
first season and is averaging 1,400 attendance after three home
games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a prime venue for a women's pro team,'' said
Farrukh Quraishi, chief operating officer of the Renegades. ``The
players are great role models, intelligent, gregarious, personable.
We have some strong teams in the W League and this is a strong
foundation to go to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been part of any discussions and I don't know if any
plans will be formalized until after the World Cup. But if the US
national team players can be distributed around the country, with
some international players to supplement them, it would become a
very strong league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Renegades reached the W League finals last year and are 7-3
this season, the last two wins under interim coach Peter Bradley,
who replaced Copland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick made significant contributions to the organization and
for that we are very grateful,'' Quraishi said. ``But philosophical
differences led to a parting of the ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Bradley has a very strong playing and coaching
background. He's a teacher with degrees in education and French.
And this buys us time to find a permanent coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 16 teams in Women's World Cup finals were
coached by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed that we want to have women in
positions of authority,'' Quraishi said. ``All things being equal,
we would prefer having a woman coach the team rather than a man.''

KENYA: MANY ANIMALS, NO CROWDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Yogi Berra's famous malaprops is, ``No one goes there
anymore, it's too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenya is like that these days, only different. No one goes there
anymore, so it's a lot less crowded.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons not to go, of course: political
violence, tourism crime, washed-out roads, fears of Rift Valley
Fever and other exotic diseases, and even the weather. Even some
tour operators in Kenya, whose livelihood depends on attracting
people to the central African nation, say they have difficulty
advising people to come.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of endless exotic destinations, it seems almost a
textbook example of how not to attract visitors.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, the animals, and they seem unaware of all
the calamity. And because fewer people are going, there is less
competition for the view. During a two-week trip to a half-dozen
game parks, we did encounter a couple of traffic jams in the bush,
but most often we had the animals to ourselves, and those times
remain the lasting impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we read about political violence daily in the newspapers:
It seemed a half-dozen people north of where we were were being
killed daily in clashes that many people blamed on President Daniel
arap Moi, who was reelected in a vote no one seems to think he won
squarely.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in the weeks leading to our trip, we had read about attacks
on tourists in the Masai Mara game reserve. And at Samburu, we
apparently narrowly missed an encounter with armed bandits
ourselves. The morning we tried to leave, we were flagged down by
townspeople warning us there had been an encounter just ahead, and
we were forced to return to the park exit station to enlist
soldiers as escorts. We sped out as part of an 11-vehicle convoy.
Two weeks after we left, a tourist in Nyeri was stabbed to death in
front of his wife when he fought with a bandit who demanded his
camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of these current events, many Kenyans I met had
peace on their minds. My guide volunteered early in conversation
that his countrymen are a peaceful people, proud that their nation
has never declared war. Two days later, I had a short discussion
with Moses Ndungu, who fronts for a Kikuyu traditional dance group
in Nyeri. Before he knew he was speaking with a journalist, he
asked plaintively, ``Please tell the people in America that we are
a peaceful people, because the media make it seem that we aren't.''
The eyes of other Kenyans beamed when I recounted his words, as
though the incidents are personally hurtful to them.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, the evidence of rampant corruption and neglect of the
roadways was everywhere, severely worsened by historic levels of
``dry season'' rain attributed to El Nino. On the main corridor to
Samburu, we spent 90 minutes trying to traverse perhaps a quarter
mile of road that had been ruined by cascading runoff from the
direction of Mount Kenya. We got through only because we had a
four-wheel drive Land Rover and a driver willing to pay bystanders
to push us through the very worst part.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, there were several spots where we needed to plan
a strategy for attacking the deep mud, while avoiding the vehicles
that had picked the wrong line. From Lake Naivasha south toward
Nairobi, the main road was more pothole than not; our guide said
the last time it had been worked on was when it was built, by
Italian prisoners of war in the '40s. And on the punishing road to
Masai Mara, there was no pavement, only evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   Easily said, Kenya is not idyllic. But still there are the
animals. At Amboseli game reserve at the southern border with
Tanzania, it's not uncommon to see large herds of elephants,
several families hanging out together, feasting on the high grasses
boosted by the torrents that have left the area waterlogged. The
guide said that in leaner times, families will work the ground
separately because they are in competition for food, but even at
400 pounds a day per adult, there is plenty to go around.
</P>
<P>
   We also encountered baboons, gazelles, warthogs, and plenty of
birds, all of them made more spectacular by the shrouded mass of
Kilimanjaro, Africa's tallest peak. Clouds almost always were part
of its grandeur, but at least we saw the peak occasionally; we were
told that for some three- or four-day visitors, the clouds never
part.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning, accompanying only my guide, he spotted two
lionesses and their cubs, following _ stalking? _ some gazelles,
themselves followed by a scavenger hyena. They were well into the
distance, and first the guide said apologetically it was forbidden
to leave the road. But bagging lions at Amboseli is apparently
rare, and a moment later we were headed cross-country, he with his
eyes on the prizes, me with my eyes out for the law. Back at the
lodge, the tale drew gasps of jealousy from other guests, and
having had the experience all to myself made it more precious
still.
</P>
<P>
   Samburu was the next stop, and not only was it sparsely
traveled, we found a terrific range of game. Before even reaching
the lodge, we'd seen ostriches, two lazy groups of giraffes, and a
couple of gerenuks, whose existence had somehow escaped me until
that moment. They are curious looking: Below the neck, in
proportion, they are like deer or gazelles, but above the neck, in
proportion they are like giraffes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is how they eat that is more delightful to discover: They
balance on their hind legs while they nibble a stratum of
vegetation apparently reserved just for them. The first time _ the
only time we saw them eating _ it was hard to process just what
kind of animal it was, and what it was doing: fully upright,
forelegs placed like a begging dog's. With just about every other
species, even neophytes like me at least could guess which animal
was in our sight.
</P>
<P>
   Samburu has an improbable landscape. In one spot, there is a
huge cubic outcropping, sheer on the sides and flat on top. Right
next to it is a fairly perfect cone rising to a point; it is hard
to imagine what natural force could have created both shapes so
near to each other. And next to them is a hill like a camel's back,
only a camel with six humps.
</P>
<P>
   Such is not the case at Masai Mara in southwestern Kenya, but
then again, one does not go to the Mara for topography. It is
located at the top end of the Serengeti, and considered the gem of
the nation's animal treasures. It is a truism that one saves this
reserve for last, to leave on a high plain.
</P>
<P>
   Although eventually we did see satisfying numbers of lions,
wildebeests, hippos, and other animals, but after our first game
drive there, our high expectations had not been met. It seemed an
armada of touring vehicles had left our lodge as one, so that as we
trolled the plains we could see as many as a dozen other vehicles
doing the same thing; for the two-hour-plus excursion, at no time
were we able to see more animals than people.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, near the end, we heard over the two-way radio that a
lion had been spotted perhaps a half-mile away, and once we turned
our attention in the direction, the location was made obvious by
the clump of vans. Still, we wanted to see it too, so we got into
the queue for a parking spot. I hopped up on the roof _ all the
vehicles have detachable roof covers to allow easier game viewing _
and saw the beast just on the other side of a glade. A rainbow was
in the background, and I snapped happily away. It wasn't until we
departed that I learned that somehow I had missed the lion that
everyone was viewing in the thicket, and had seen one that somehow
no one else had noticed.
</P>
<P>
   That it was unshared, even with those inside my vehicle, made
the moment special, just like the lionesses at Amboseli and the
uncrowded vistas of Samburu. Yes, there are plenty of reasons not
to go to Kenya, but if you've ever considered it, you might want to
go while no one's there.

BACK TO PROVENCE? WHY NOT?

<P>
   He's back.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mayle has returned to his haven for grand times, good
food, and unforgettable characters. ``Encore Provence: New
Adventures in the South of France'' (Knopf, $23) is his sequel to
``Tojours Provence,'' which was the sequel to the book that started
it all, ``A Year in Provence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With rose colored hindsight,'' he writes, ``the good times
become magical; the bad times fade and eventually disappear,
leaving only a seductive blur of sunlit days and the laughter of
friends. Was it really like that? Would it be like that again?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was, of course, only one way to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mayle, a former ad executive, goes back to Provence after a
four-year absence to find . . . a gardener who grows black
tomatoes, an oversexed butcher with a secret, a perfume creator
with a highly educated nose, and plenty of other other Gallic
types, described with a mix of wit and respect. You'd expect food
to play a big part in this book, as it did in the others, and you'd
be right. From a memorable meal in a former gas station to a taste
of the best bouillabaisse to trips to the colorful weekly markets,
Mayle and the reader are in gastronomic heaven.
</P>
<P>
   So was it all he had hoped for, or had Provence changed 11 years
after his first book about the region? Let Mayle answer: ``Provence
is still beautiful. Vast areas of it are still wild and empty.
Peace and silence . . . are still available. The old men still play
their endless game of boules. The markets are as colorful and
abundant as ever. There is room to breathe, and the air is clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Most readers of ``Encore Provence,'' I suspect, will share his
delight.

   Mention movement by black people and many think of this
century's great migration from South to North or the last century's
forced migration from Africa to slaveholding states. But
African-Americans have traveled for other reasons, too _ adventure,
insight, and just pleasure _ and written about their experiences.
James Baldwin, for instance, went to Paris, and Langston Hughes
visited Mexico. ``A Stranger in the Village: Two Centuries of
African-American Travel Writing'' (Beacon Press, $25) is two
centuries worth of memoirs, book and diary excerpts, letters, and
lectures that show the breadth of such travel. A 19th-century
sailor tells about his trips to ``the ends of the world.'' A woman
``doctress'' describes the Panamanian frontier. Claude McKay shares
his observations on the newly formed Soviet Union. And, from
Nicaragua, Ntozake Shange ruminates on how Motown overcomes the
barriers of language and custom.
</P>
<P>
   In all there are nearly 50 pieces. Editors are Farah Jasmine
Griffith and Cheryl Fish, both English professors.

   I've never considered Vermont a scary state. But ``Green
Mountains, Dark Tales'' by Joseph A. Citro (University Press of New
England, $19.95) shows that the state can serve up chills as well
as cheer. Citro turns up a stone-flinging poltergeist in Pownall, a
gallery of ghosts at Southern Vermont College, and cites the
historic Equinox in Vermont as the state's most haunted hotel.
There are more than 30 tales of the living and the dead from this
specialist on the occult in New England.

<P>
   With their shiny silver covers and plethora of color photos, the
Knopf City Guides are decidely distinctive. The books offer
suggestions about where to go and what to do in nine major cities.
The Rome guide, for instance, tells 53 things you need to know,
giving information about 64 hotels, 92 restaurants, 38 nights out,
99 sights, 17 excursions, and 79 shops. Ten maps help you get to
those places. Other books in the series, to date, are Berlin,
Lisbon, London, Madrid, Milan, New York, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro.
The guides are $14.95 each.

   Summer is a wonderful time for roaming New England. Accordingly,
the Countryman Press has published a second edition of ``Walks and
Rambles on Cape Cod and the Islands: A Nature Lover's Guide to 35
Trails'' ($14) by Ned Friary and Glenda Bendure, and a third
edition of ``Walks and Rambles in Rhode Island: 40 Trails for
Birders and Nature Lovers ($15.95) by Ken Weber. Both books have
the requisite maps, descriptions, and photos. Happy rambling.

   And speaking of getting around, it never hurts to have a good,
up-to-date map to help you find where you're going in metropolitan
Boston. The spiral-bound ``Official Arrow Pocket Atlas: Metro
Boston'' (Langenscheidt Publishing, $9.95) offers large-scale,
color-shaded maps, with a list of places of interest and shopping
centers (they're not necessarily the same thing) for Boston and
nearly 30 nearby communities. There's also a Route 128 map.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're looking for full-size maps covering the entire
state, the Maine-based DeLorme mapping company has added the
``Massachusetts Atlas and Gazeteer'' ($16.95) to a series that now
covers all 50 states. In addition to routes, you'll find
information on historic sites, scenic drives, and camping, hunting,
and fishing sites.

ANTIQUE CAROUSELS ABOUND IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time in pre-PlayStation America, there were
thousands of wooden carousels. And there wasn't anything virtual
about their reality, which consisted of brightly painted animals,
gleaming brass poles, and lazy Sunday afternoons at the amusement
park.
</P>
<P>
   Today, fewer than 200 antique woodies remain in the nation, many
in various states of disrepair. But since the 1960s, carousels have
come to be viewed by many as true slices of Americana worthy of
preservation and restoration. A census published last year by the
National Carousel Association found there are seven old wooden
merry-go-rounds in Massachusetts that are open to the public. As
summer began this week, we climbed aboard three of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Paragon Carousel, 205 Nantasket Ave., Hull. 781-925-0472.
Open 10 a.m.-10 p.m. daily through Labor Day. $1.50 per ride.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cloudy weekday morning at Nantasket Beach, &UR;  &LR; just outside
of Boston, and only a few folks _ mostly mothers with small
children in tow, or is it the other way around? _ have shown up to
climb aboard the Paragon Carousel. James Hardwin, the
merry-go-round's restorer and sole full-time employee, is
undaunted. ``It's like `Field of Dreams,' '' he says. ``You open
the door and they do come.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old operator Matt Riccio clangs the carousel's
brass bell four times and sets the four-row behemoth in motion with
a slow pull on the vintage Western Electric trolley switch. The 66
hand-carved wooden horses and two Roman chariots begin their
three-minute sprint beneath 951 glittering white lights. ``I've
changed 'em all,'' Hardwin muses, looking up.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1928 by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC), the
carousel spent most of its life only half a block away, at Paragon
Park, which closed in 1985. It is owned by The Friends of the
Paragon Carousel, whose 700 members are trying to preserve what
president Susan Fleck calls ``both an art treasure and an emotional
treasure.'' The task hasn't been easy. Fleck, a Hull native who
rode the carousel as a child, says the group recently restructured
its debt in order to ease its monetary pain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being a work in progress _ 27 of the 66 horses have been
restored so far, and the 1920s Wurlitzer band organ is disconnected
_ the Paragon Carousel attracts about 100,000 riders per year,
according to Fleck. On this particular morning, one of them, a
small boy, is reluctant to leave and is tearfully clinging to his
brightly painted horse despite his mother's best efforts to pry him
loose. Watching, Hardwin smiles. ``Another satisfied customer,'' he
announces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Fall River Carousel, 1 Central St. (Battleship Cove), Fall
River. 508-324-4300. Open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. daily, through Labor Day;
noon to 4 p.m. weekends only, Sept. 11 through Oct. 31. $1 per
ride.
</P>
<P>
   School groups bound up the rubber-clad staircase of Fall River's
ersatz Victorian carousel pavilion, but not everyone who comes here
is fresh from touring the USS Massachusetts next door. Last summer,
an elderly visitor stood on the sidelines, weeping. ``It was her
50th wedding anniversary,'' recalls co-manager Charlene Conway.
``She was remembering how her husband had proposed to her on one of
our chariots.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been when this spectacular 48-horse carousel,
built by PTC in 1920, was the heartbeat of Lincoln Amusement Park
in North Dartmouth. Purchased at auction for $693,000 when the park
closed for good in 1986, the merry-go-round was meticulously
restored in Ohio before settling into the Fall River waterfront.
Like the Paragon Carousel, however, it has suffered financially.
Estimates that it would draw as many as 300,000 annual riders
proved optimistic. Today it is owned by the Fall River Development
Corp. and leased by Conway and her husband, Bob. Charlene Conway
says the carousel drew about 80,000 customers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, old amusement park rides don't get much more pristine
than this one. With even its massive center pole and heavy gears
part of its total restoration (although it does feature a new
electronic control system), the carousel gleams brightly in colors
that duplicate the originals. An antique band organ provides the
soundtrack, and the school kids climb atop palominos and dapples
that look like they just arrived from the factory. ``I rode on this
30 years ago,'' Charlene Conway says, ``and it never looked this
good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Holyoke Merry-Go-Round, 221 Appleton St. (Heritage State
Park), Holyoke. 413-538-9838. Open 10:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m., Tuesdays
through Sundays, July 4 weekend through Labor Day. $1 per ride.
</P>
<P>
   All's quiet inside the yellow clapboard pavilion that houses the
Holyoke Merry-Go-Round. The colorful 14-ton unit operates only on
weekends until July 4, so weekday visitors must temporarily press
their faces to the windows. This downtime allows 23-year-old
operator Jason Charpentier an opportunity to explain the details of
the merry-go-round _ folks in Holyoke always call it a
merry-go-round, not a carousel _ to a visitor. He even has speed
figures: ``It travels 8.4 miles per hour on the outside, 4.7 on the
inside,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another carousel from PTC, this one was built in 1927. It
ran at Holyoke's Mountain Park until the trolley park, which opened
in 1895, closed 12 years ago. After the kind of fund-raising effort
that warms a community's heart _ kids selling cookies here, postal
employees running a bottle drive there _ the merry-go-round was
purchased for $850,000 by a local group known as the Friends of the
Holyoke Merry-Go-Round.
</P>
<P>
   It now draws 50,000 to 60,000 riders a year to 8.5-acre Heritage
Park in downtown Holyoke, which features another attraction you
don't encounter every day: the Volleyball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with the Paragon Carousel, the merry-go-round is
still being refurbished, in large part by local volunteers. It's no
small job bringing 56 scenic panels, 98 beveled mirrors, and one
very loud Artizan band organ back to life. And, of course, there
are the 48 prancing horses, many of which have yet to be restored
for the Playstation set. Says Charpentier: ``Kids come in here, and
they can't believe they're made of wood.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Other antique wooden carousels in Massachusetts are at Riverside
Park in Agawam (413-786-9300), Whalom Park in Lunenburg
(978-342-3707), Heritage Plantation in Sandwich (508-888-3300), and
the town of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard (508-693-9481 or
508-627-4440).

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you haven't made plans for July 4, there's no better place
than Boston for one of the biggest and best celebrations anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the July 4 festivities along the Charles River on
the Esplanade, where the Boston Pops will perform free before at
least 250,000, is the 18th annual Boston Harborfest. Harborfest
runs June 29 to July 5 and features more than 200 events including
a Chowderfest, children's day, walking tours, concerts,
Revolutionary Era historical reenactments, visits from US and
foreign naval ships and more. Thirty-five percent of the events are
free and the rest cost between $1 and $10. A new tradition will be
a Sunset Parade adjacent to the USS Constitution where a fife and
drum band and the US Navy Band will perform during the lowering of
the flag.

<P>
   And, of course, there's nothing like joining the Pops on the
Esplanade for the July 4 concert, which this year features not only
Keith Lockhart conducting but the ``1812 Overture'' with the Boston
Symphony's Seiji Ozawa conducting. It's a grand salute to the
nation's birthday, complete with canons firing, church bells
ringing, and a massive fireworks display.

Montana's Upper Missouri River. Participants travel on modern,
34-foot-long voyageur canoes, which replicate those used by early
fur traders. Thirteen four-day and three six-day safaris will be
featured. Prices begin at $850. For information, call River
Odysseys West at 800-451-6034.

COAST, COUNTRY AND CHARM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an area of some 150 square miles, embracing 33 communities
in southeastern Connecticut and coastal Rhode Island. And its
attractions include everything from 18th-century villages to
21st-century slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Mystic Coast &AMP; Country, one of the most diverse and
delightful areas in the nation. As Donna M. Simpson, Mystic Coast &AMP;
Country executive director, put it in a telephone interview:
``There's so much to take in.'' So there is, and a lot of it has
undergone major improvements. Among attractions:
</P>
<P>
   --Mystic Seaport. The 19th century returns in this Mystic,
Conn., maritime museum, filled with ships and shops and sailors
singing chanteys. The Charles W. Morgan is a favorite ship to
visit. And a special project now underway is the construction of
the 129-foot schooner Amistad, using 19th-century techniques. An
exhibit nearby includes objects used in the Steven Spielberg film
``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   --Mystic Aquarium. Having undergone a $52 million expansion,
this impressive aquarium features 24 exhibits showcasing 6,000
specimens. More programs for youngsters have been added, and this
year there will be two major new exhibits. The Institute for
Exploration, headed by Robert Ballard, will zero in on deep-sea
exploration, including the ocean floor, which Simpson calls ``the
only uncharted territory we know of.'' The other will be an
outdoor, one-acre Alaskan Coast exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   --Foxwoods Resort Casino. This gambling and entertainment haven
in Ledyard, Conn., has doubled the size of its already huge casino
and added an 800-room tower, along with several upscale touches.
There are more than 5,500 slot machines and 370 table games. About
a mile away, the tribe that brought you the casino also brings you
the Mashantucket Pequot Museum &AMP; Research Center, a new, high-tech,
$193 million museum that takes visitors on a 20,000-year journey
through time, featuring sights, sounds, and smells that bring the
tribe's history to life.
</P>
<P>
   --Historic Ship Nautilus/Submarine Force Museum. Only in Groton,
Conn., can you tour the world's first nuclear submarine. Museum
exhibits, meanwhile, include a sub control room, operating
periscopes, and historical displays. A $4 million expansion is
scheduled to be completed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   There's much more: the Gillette Castle, the Essex Steam Train
and Riverboat Ride, the Mohegan Sun casino, the Mystic Factory
Outlets, the Stonington Vineyards, the pleasant beaches of Rhode
Island, good restaurants, fine theater, crafts, galleries, lots of
lodgings, and a raft of other attractions, most of them suitable
for all the family.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Simpson says, there are quaint communities with
white-frame churches, village greens, tumbling stone walls,
gardens, downtown shops, and historic homes, all of which give the
area its charm and character. Mystic Coast &AMP; Country, says Simpson,
``gives us a feeling of what we were and are in history.'' May the
new and the old always stay in proper balance.

 &QL; 
And speaking of Mystic: We learn from the Mystic Aquarium that if
all the earth's oceans were to dry up, the leftover salt would
weigh 100 sextillion pounds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: You're standing next to Fred, who annoys you. So you
want to travel as far away from him as is possible. How many miles
away will you be when you reach your destination? (Answer at end of
column.)
</P>
<P>
   In a name: One of Britain's Channel Islands, Jersey, calls
itself ``The Cream of Holidays.'' (To see how rich that cream is,
call 800-617-3333 for a free set of Channel Islands guidebooks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: It's illegal to take a lion to the movies in
Baltimore. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fascinating fact: The Hawaiian alphabet has a mere 12 letters: the
vowels a, e, i, o, u and the consonants h, k, l, m, n, p, and w.
(We thank Sal Chancholo of Medford.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Don't get sore: Dairl Johnson was a Navy fighter pilot who injured
his back in a training accident in an F-4 Phantom fighter jet. Now
he's CEO of Relax the Back, a company that, among other items,
sells travel products such as a self-inflating lower back support,
an inflatable U-shaped travel neck rest for sleeping on planes, a
compact massage unit, a travel-size support pillow, back support
belts, and an S-shaped ``back nobbler'' for reaching sore spots.
For a catalog, call 800-290-BACK. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Leave nothing: A Taiwan company makes dinnerware out of wheat, so
you can eat your plate. (With thanks to faithful contributor Mike
Schuster of Foxborough.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ducky doings: One day, we hope soon, a new museum will rise in the
heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, devoted solely to Walt
Disney's famous fowl, Donald Fauntleroy Duck. Curator will be
Melissa Bernhart of Reading, Pa., who says the impact of Donald on
American culture cannot be underestimated. She herself has more
than 5,000 duck items to display, ranging from splendid statues to
collectible coffee cans. While you're waiting for the museum to
open, though, why not join her fan club, which publishes a
newsletter about the life and times of that mighty duck. For more
information, write to Donald Duck Fan Club, PO Box 13972, Reading,
PA 19612, call 610-396-9872, or e-mail
outerstationproj(at)juno.com. (Here's the legal stuff: The club is
in no way associated with the Walt Disney Co., which owns the
priceless copyright on Donald Duck.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? You will be 7,926 miles (the earth's diameter)
away.

BRAVE NEW WORLD OF DESIGNER BABIES 
 
GENETIC ENGINEERING TO OPEN PANDORA'S BOX OF ETHICAL QUESTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photos, graphics available on NYT database) 
 
(For weekend release, July 3-4) 
 
By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The full-page advertisements, in the national pages of
newspapers across the country, portrayed the most 21st-century
product _ custom-made children.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside a picture of an adorable, perfect-looking baby was a
shopping list of traits readers could choose for the child they
plan to have and a telephone number to order them:
1-888-4-BEST-DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you could choose exactly what your child was like?''
read the ad. ``Male or female? Gay or straight? Athletic or
intellectual? You decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements caused such interest that when the number did
not go through, so many people called the American Society for
Reproductive Medicine that it issued a press release disavowing
involvement. The ads turned out to be for the 1997 film
``Gattaca,'' a futuristic thriller about a society in which people
are designed in laboratories prior to conception.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next millennium, designer babies won't be just the
stuff of sci-fi movies.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of human cloning may get all the attention, but
genetic engineering is the reproductive technology that scientists
and bioethicists say will most fundamentally change society in the
next 10 to 50 years, and for generations beyond. Parents will be
able to engineer their offspring to, initially, prevent disease;
later, choose certain traits; and ultimately, even enhance looks or
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the ultimate shopping experience, like ordering a
sunroof or leather seats from the car dealer. And in the fevered
imagination of at least one eminent biologist, the options won't be
limited to human traits: He describes a future in which parents
engineer their children to possess, say, the olfactory powers of
dogs or the night vision of owls.
</P>
<P>
   But even the tamest alterations promise to open a Pandora's box
of ethical questions: Will they inadvertently inflict curses on
future generations? Will they violate principles of informed
consent? Will they further stratify society between those who can
afford the new technology and those who cannot? Will they create
pressure to tailor reproductive decisions to the prevailing norms
of what is considered ``desirable?'' Will they breed less
compassion for society's new less fortunate _ nondesigned children?
In short, will they rob us of our humanity?
</P>
<P>
   Gene screening and therapy raise the real possibility that we
will be able to re-engineer the genetic blueprints of our own
species, seize control of our own evolution. It's the ultimate form
of preventive medicine _ and the ultimate form of ``Brave New
World'' eugenics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we've talked about having children,'' says Glenn
McGee, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist and the author of
``The Perfect Baby: A Pragmatic Approach to Genetics.'' ``Soon,
we'll talk about making children.''
</P>
<P>
   If designer babies conjure up the images of eugenics, it is
because that was once science's hope for a better future. Before
Adolf Hitler gave it a bad name, eugenics was championed as the
cure-all for economic inequities and social ills by leaders ranging
from Charles Darwin and Theodore Roosevelt to George Bernard Shaw
and Winston Churchill. The burden will be on their successors to
show it won't go horribly wrong again and fulfill Huxley's
disturbing vision.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists differ on how imminent the brave new world is. Some
say the first proposal may emerge in the next several years. Most
say it is still a decade or more away. Still others say the more
exotic genetic engineering won't happen for 50 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BRAVE NEW WORLD EXISTS TODAY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in one sense, the brave new world is here already.
Prospective parents take out ads looking for sperm or eggs based on
the donor's athletic skills, intellectual prowess, socio-economic
status or physical appearance; and at some clinics, sperm is
separated so parents may pick the sex of their offspring. (They
more often pick boys.)
</P>
<P>
   But that is just unaltered embryo selection. Genetic engineering
involves the insertion of new genes into human cells, as scientists
first did in 1990 when they successfully injected a healthy gene
into the cells of an organ of a 4-year-old girl with a genetic
disease. The procedure was allowed only after doctors assured
regulators the genetic change would not be passed on to any
children the girl might have.
</P>
<P>
   Designer babies promise something even more momentous: altering
a fertilized egg so that the genes in all of a person's cells,
including eggs or sperm, include one that scientists, not parents,
bequeathed. It will be inheritably transmitted to future
generations, a legacy demanding a Solomonic collective wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``As opposed to every other decision made in medicine, this will
involve more than the patient, the family and the doctor,'' says
French Anderson, director of the University of Southern
California's gene therapy laboratory. ``The gene pool is not owned
by any one person. It is the joint property of society. And when
you manipulate the gene pool, you need the agreement of society.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, everyone from the U.S. Department of Energy to the
American Association for the Advancement of Science has staged
soul-searching sessions. So much grant money has been put into
examining the ramifications of designer babies that one academic
calls the coming era of genetic engineering a ``full-employment act
for bioethicists.''
</P>
<P>
   They still have a bit of time to arrive at a consensus. Aside
from gender, the only traits that now can be identified at the
earliest stage of development are about a dozen or so of the most
serious genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists claim that in time they expect to find genes for
virtually every trait imaginable _ thrill-seeking, musical ability,
anxiety, spirituality, happiness, leadership, shyness, you name it
_ and cultural observers promise that if the technology is
available to instill or extract such traits, you can bet some
parents will avail themselves of it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GENE RESEARCH ON A MAMMOTH SCALE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of gene knowledge is coming as a result of the
Human Genome Project, the $3 billion federal effort to locate,
identify and sequence the roughly 100,000 genes on the 46 human
chromosomes. Often compared to the Manhattan Project or the mission
to put a man on the moon, it is expected to be finished in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the periodic table categorized the elements so chemists
could predict how they would react, so will the fully mapped human
genome provide the medical community with dramatic insights into
how the body works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about the science-fiction scenarios, but the
real breakthrough will be the greater understanding we will have of
why disease occurs,'' says Art Beaudet, chairman of the department
of molecular and human genetics at Houston's Baylor College of
Medicine, a leading participant in the Human Genome Project. ``We
will be able to create better drugs because we'll know how a
disease works.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaudet envisions a future in which, say, hemophiliacs are
treated with gene therapy once a year or less, unlike today's
sufferers, who typically must receive multiple injections each
week. He says better knowledge of diseases like asthma or
Alzheimer's will lead to better drugs, in much the same way
understanding the 26 steps of cholesterol metabolism led to
effective cholesterol-lowering drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the treatment that most excites some people _ and most
concerns bioethicists _ will come when doctors use the new gene
knowledge before birth, at in vitro fertilization clinics. Doctors
will fertilize a few of a woman's eggs with her husband's sperm, as
IVF clinics now do. But then they will inject an artificial human
chromosome, carrying made-to-order genes, into the fertilized egg
before placing the embryo in the woman's uterus.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors might inject a gene that would kill
prostate cancer on command. To control such a gene, scientists
could hook it to another gene that responds to an insect hormone,
ecdysone, that normally has no effect on human cells. If a man
found he had prostate cancer, he'd simply take an ecdysone pill,
which would activate the gene to kill the cancerous prostate cells
but leave every other cell of his body untouched.
</P>
<P>
   And since the gene copied itself into every cell of his body,
including his sperm, not only would the man not die of the cancer,
his sons would beat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to numerous scientists, gene therapy will begin with
the treatment of childhood diseases, such as sickle cell anemia or
cystic fibrosis, that have a severe impact on quality of life. As
society's trepidation eases, they say, treatment will expand to
problems whose impact hits hardest in adulthood, such as obesity,
diabetes, heart disease and various kinds of cancer. And, finally,
it will be extended to inoculate against infectious agents and
addictions and to improve various health characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be cruel not to use this technology to eliminate such
problems,'' says James Watson, whose Nobel Prize-winning
co-discovery of the structure of DNA made the idea of gene therapy
possible. ``Waiting for conventional methods to succeed would be
like waiting for thesun to burn out.''

HOUSTON: sun to burn out.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proof that such gene therapy could work, at least in animals,
dates to the early 1980s, when scientist added curative genes to
mouse embryos that had been doomed to develop an inherited nervous
system disorder. But scientists stress that more animal research
needs to be done before human genetic engineering starts in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Among the concerns is that we could remove something important
in the very act of removing something objectionable. Every gene
pool has recessive traits with important evolutionary functions,
many of which haven't yet been discovered. The genetic glitch that
causes sickle cell disease, for example, protects against malaria.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A DELICATE GENETIC BALANCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps we would disrupt the delicate balance that evolution
has brought us to, in which each genetic trait has an effect on
every other. In the 5 million years since hominids separated from
great apes, our DNA has evolved less than 2 percent, and the
difference is still just 1 to 3 percent. Scientists say that
difference isn't in the genes themselves, but in how they're turned
on and off, which isn't yet well understood.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, gene therapy could lead to an increase in genetic
diseases _ since the most popular genetic traits in an open market
may not necessarily be the healthiest. If everyone wants to be
blond with blue eyes and if that is associated with an increased
susceptibility to skin cancer, note biologists, there is going to
be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   That last scenario, of course, involves genetic engineering for
the more controversial purpose of enhancement. Most bioethicists
approve of genetic engineering for therapeutic reasons, but draw
the line at enhancement, saying the latter would change the very
things that make someone an individual. But others argue the line
is blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``That distinction won't stand the test of time,'' says Gregory
Stock, director of UCLA's Medicine, Technology and Society program.
``Retarding the aging process would be therapy and enhancement
because it would mean defeating diseases and because it would
extend our life span. Growth hormones are therapy for short
children, enhancement for medium-size children. Heck, even cosmetic
surgery is a kind of therapy for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people argue that because future generations by definition
cannot consent to the genetic engineering chosen by their
forebears, there is an ethical barrier to the technology. Employing
that logic, one European body opposes gene therapy in the context
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, an
organization of members of parliaments from 40 countries, has
included language in a human rights manifesto claiming ``every
human being has a right to a genetic heritage that hasn't been
artificially tampered with.'' It is not clear whether the assembly
would consider a genetic cure of a deadly disease to be tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering also has drawn objections from religious
thinkers, who argue that treating people like a collection of
mechanical parts is dehumanizing, and that making the reproductive
process asexual too eerily mirrors the emotionless future depicted
in ``Brave New World,'' Aldoux Huxley's dystopian vision of an
emotionless future.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is highly unlikely that everyone would receive
enhancements. Since they would almost certainly be available
primarily to the well-to-do, even designer babies' most rabid
defenders acknowledge that they would invariably lead to a kind of
``biological reinforcement'' of class distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GENETIC HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside with the least likelihood of a remedy being found
is the fact that society will be divided between genetic haves and
genetic have-nots,'' says Arthur Caplan, director of the University
of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics. ``And it will test people's
capacity for compassion: Will they still have it when perfection
seems attainable?''
</P>
<P>
   Before therapy is available, comprehensive genetic information
will test our decision-making. In an era when 90 percent of fetuses
with Down syndrome are aborted, what will couples do if, say, a
homosexual gene is found? Consider the tale bioethicists tell of
the couple advised recently that their fetus had a rare extra
chromosome that would not cause a debilitating disease like Down,
but that potentially was linked to tall stature, severe acne and
aggressive, even criminally aggressive, behavior. The couple
responded by aborting the child.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider a hypothetical case in which a couple have
fertilized a number of eggs in vitro, intending to implant the most
genetically superior one. The doctor calls with test results:
Embryos 1 and 6 reveal a strong manic-depressive tendency; 2 and 3
are likely to have attention-deficit disorder; 4 and 5 are marked
for average intelligence, early-onset eyesight loss and the
likelihood of aggressive colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Then add an economic variable. The couple's HMO subsequently
tells them they should know that if they choose to implant 1 and 6,
the costs of the child's manic depression will not be reimbursed.
It is, after all, a pre-existing condition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the potential problems, most everyone thinks
designer babies are inevitable. In one survey, more than 40 percent
of Americans said they think it would be OK to use gene therapy to
make their children either more attractive or more intelligent than
they were otherwise destined to be _ and observers say those
numbers will go up as the technology becomes commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when the world first learned about IVF two decades
ago, it was horrifying to most people _ ``test-tube babies,'' they
called them _ and most surveyed said they wouldn't use it even if
they were infertile. But today, more than 40,000 children owe their
existence to in vitro fertilization and nearly anyone who is
infertile demands it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we don't need to invoke the Hitler analogy to
understand how troubling this technology will be,'' says Jeremy
Rifkin, a frequent science critic and author of ``The Biotech
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evil cabal here, no government forcing us into
brave new worlds. Instead it's just the banality of a
market-oriented, commercial eugenics in which parents simply want
to give their children what seems best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In countries with national health services, such as Canada or
Britain, it might be easier to dictate what sort of enhancements
will be permitted and what will be forbidden. But in the United
States, there will always be people with enough money to pay for
what they want _ and even countries like Canada or Britain will
know that forbidding a particular kind of enhancement might put
them at a competitive disadvantage with countries that permit it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FERTILITY CLINICS AT THE FOREFRONT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more exotic human genetic engineering is likely to occur
first at fertility clinics, which are among the country's most
advanced and least regulated biotech research centers. They are
also the most logical candidates to continue the time-honored
medical trend of a treatment beginning as a therapy and ending up
in the more lucrative field of cosmetic enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery, for example, was developed to correct the
facial deformities of war injuries, but was soon used to straighten
asymmetrical noses and tighten older, sagging skin. Breast implants
were developed to reconstruct women who lost theirs to mastectomy,
but were soon fitted into healthy women who wanted to upgrade their
B cups to D cups.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Stock dismisses Rifkin's contention that society can turn
its back on genetic engineering as it did with, say, nuclear
energy. Stock argues that because the new technology will be done
easily and cheaply at thousands of labs around the world, be sought
by an affluent minority that just wants what's best for its
children and poses no danger to innocent bystanders, it will be
impossible to stop, no matter how convincing a case ethicists make
for or against it.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, a culture in which people have gradually
become accustomed to ``playing God,'' to maintaining their balance
on the slippery slope that divides the acceptable from the
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But will people ever be ready for the world envisioned by
Princeton biologist Lee Silver, in which humans are engineered with
not just the olfactory powers of dogs and night vision of owls but
the electricity-generating capabilities of eels, light-emitting
organs of fireflies and fish, magnetic-detection systems of birds
and echo-locating powers of bats?
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what techniques are ultimately used, genetic
engineering of human embryos is sure to become feasible, safe and
efficient by the middle of the 21st century,'' writes Silver, the
author of ``Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New
World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, we will come face to face with the ultimate
frontier in medicine and philosophy _ the power to change the
nature of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll mean all of science fiction is true.''

   CAPE TOWN _ It was my travel security blanket, a Liberty peacock
print shawl that I took everywhere, even wrapping myself in it to
sleep on planes. I lost it somewhere during a peripatetic evening
that started with drinks in the library at the Cape Grace Hotel,
then a drive to a nearby restaurant. During dinner, I noticed the
shawl was gone, and wrote it off as a sad loss. When I got back to
my room in the hotel, there it was, neatly folded at the foot of
the bed, thanks to some observant Cape Grace staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what you hear about South Africa focuses on the alarming
crime rate, which recently forced Anne Paton, widow of Alan Paton,
who wrote ``Cry The Beloved Country,'' to announce that she was
moving to England because she couldn't handle being mugged and
hijacked any more. The crime is certainly there, although in two
lengthy visits to the country I've neither seen nor experienced
any. But there is also kindness, hospitality, and a desire to join
the community of nations after being cut off by apartheid for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   The strong desire to attract foreign tourists translates into
some superb places to stay, the Cape Grace being a case in point.
Opened in 1996, it is giving Cape Town's most renowned hotel, the
100-year- old Mount Nelson, a run for its money. The food at the
Cape Grace is sublime, the rooms luxuriously appointed in British
Colonial style. Lots of hotels have ``libraries'' that are actually
bars, but the Cape Grace's, in addition to being a civilized
setting for drinks, really is a library, extremely well-stocked
with books, many about South Africa. My favorite detail about this
hotel that gets the details right: Should you be mid-book when you
check out, you may take the tome with you, returning it in the
self-addressed mailer the hotel provides.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Grace is on the Victoria &AMP; Alfred Waterfront, a great
shopping area boasting a huge South African craft market and a
world-class wine emporium, the Vaughan Johnson Wine Shop, which
specializes, naturally, in South Africa's stellar vintages. (They
ship.)
</P>
<P>
   The waterfront is also the point of embarkation for the short
boat ride to Robben Island, site of one of the world's most
notorious prisons, whose most famous occupant was Nelson Mandela.
The spartan buildings where prisoners once performed hard labor are
now a museum, as sobering in its way as Israel's Yad Vashem
memorial to the Holocaust or Senegal's Goree Island, the point from
which slaves were shipped to the New World. It was startling to
learn that my eloquent guide on Robben Island had been a prisoner
there from age 18-30, and, having missed out on formal higher
education, was a total autodidact. It was also startling to learn
that he was unpaid for his work as a guide: So strongly does he
feel about getting his message of forgiveness across that he works
for free. Sadly, his volunteer status may also be a result of South
Africa's high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's tourism slogan _ ``A World in One Country'' _
could be adapted to ``A World in One City'' and applied to Cape
Town. I spent an entire week at the Cape Grace, and felt I'd barely
begun to explore Cape Town and its environs. I visited the
historic, white-washed manor houses and vineyards a short drive
from the city, including Spier, Vergelegen, and Groot Constantia,
where the Dutch-influenced architecture suggests Amsterdam South. I
made the half-hour drive to the Grande Roche, which many consider
the finest hotel and the finest restaurant in all South Africa, a
circa 1700 wine estate with exquisite decor, its own tiny chapel
for weddings, and fabulous French food you can eat indoors or on a
terrace with lovely views.
</P>
<P>
   I made the obligatory pilgrimages to Table Mountain; to
Kirstenbosch, one of the world's greatest gardens; and out to the
wine routes, where you could spend forever visiting wineries that
vary from family-owned boutiques to high-tech, grand-scale
operations.
</P>
<P>
   These are the obvious stops. But there are unexpected gems: the
Jean Craig Pottery, for instance, near Stellenbosch, where ceramics
based on Xhosa, Zulu and Ndebele motifs can be had for about $3 per
pot. So chic have the bold geometric designs of the Ndebele become
of late that British Airways has commissioned twin Ndebele sisters,
Emmly and Martha Masanabo, to design patterns to emblazon on the
tails of BA jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   The South African art scene is as volatile as the rest of the
society, and ranges from the haunting wattle bark figurative
sculpture of a recluse named Jacques Dohnt to the stinging
political animation of William Kentridge, the most high-profile
South African artist on the international scene. Significantly, the
National Gallery in Cape Town puts contemporary South African art
front and center _ and relegates its 18th- and 19th-century
European canvases to galleries in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Driving East from Cape Town, I saw few flowers on the ``Garden
Route,'' which, in November, looked more like the bleakly beautiful
Yorkshire moors. But once I stopped in Plettenberg Bay, in the
heart of the Route, I found a new Eden. The gorgeous Plettenberg
Hotel, where I stayed, is filled with, and surrounded by, flowers.
Across the street, in someone's front yard, is an all-white ``moon
garden,'' starring Queen Anne's lace and white roses, with an array
of small white annuals in supporting roles. Just up the hill is a
reminder of South Africa's uneasy present _ St. Peter's Anglican
Church, an exquisite little stone chapel set in a garden abloom
with hibiscus, daisies, and agapanthus, the beds and borders in a
framework of stone arches and trellises. The wrought iron gates to
the church are locked, though, and a sad sign announces why. ``From
the year 1881, when this church was opened, until July of this year
(1998), the church has been kept open every day. However, following
a number of recent acts of theft and vandalism we have reluctantly
decided to keep the church closed.''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite Garden Route activity was also my riskiest moment in
South Africa _ and it had nothing to do with crime. Hiking with my
20-year-old son in the Robberg Nature and Marine Reserve, we opted
for the nine-kilometer (5 1/2-mile) trail, the longest of the three
suggested, without reading the fine print about ``high cliffs and
difficult rocky terrain dangerous to inexperienced hikers'' along
with ``freak waves and strong currents.'' Good thing Jon was
willing to slow down and drag his mother over those looming wet
rocks.

 CAPE TOWN: ... wet rocks.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't skip Durban. There are more obvious South African
destinations for tourists. You have to do Cape Town, one of the
world's most beautiful cities. You have to do Johannesburg, not
beautiful at all but valuable for experiences including Soweto, a
sprawling world unto itself. You have to do a game reserve, for a
wildlife experience unequaled anywhere else in Africa. (South
Africa offers more off-road and night game drives than you'll find
in East Africa, and you ride in open Land Rovers, as opposed to the
pop-top vehicles of other African safari experiences.)
</P>
<P>
   Durban is the most tropical city in South Africa, and its
beaches on the Indian Ocean make it a fun-in-the-sun place. But
it's much more. Its Indian population of 500,000 _ Indians first
came as indentured servants in the 19th century _ adds cultural
richness. Durban has many Indian restaurants _ I had a superb lunch
at the opulent Jaipur Palace, on a hill overlooking the city _ and
at the Victoria Street Market you can buy Indian brass, pottery,
and custom-mixed spices with names like ``delayed reaction,'' as
well as African crafts. You can even ride in a rickshaw: There are
about 20 licensed ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Botanic Gardens boast a splendid array of rare cycads; while
visiting the gardens, you pay an official ``car guard'' one or two
rand _ the current exchange is 16(CT) to a rand _ to protect your
car. Tourism Durban started the idea, to cut unemployment as well
as crime.
</P>
<P>
   Durban is also a cultural hub. I spent a happy afternoon
exploring the BAT Centre, a lively, four-year-old harborside
complex that supports local artists, writers, and musicians. Here
you'll find concerts, galleries, studios, and the Zansi Restaurant,
serving African food. The BAT Shop and the Bayside Gallery, both
part of the center, offer an excellent selection of indigenous arts
and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   If Durban's baroque City Hall looks slightly out of place in
Africa, it's because the design is recycled: It's precisely the
same plan used for the City Hall in Belfast. Durban's 1892 Old
Station Building is another architectural oddity: Its roof can
support 16 feet of snow. The London architects mistakenly sent
Toronto's station plan to Durban, and vice versa. Toronto's roof,
unable to support any snow at all, collapsed during its first
winter.

   Johannesburg is a problem for tourists. You could almost skip
it, were it not so essential for taking the country's pulse. The
mere sight of the Carlton Hotel downtown is scary. A high-rise,
once the city's most elegant hostelrey, it is now closed because of
crime in the vicinity, its stairwells and elevators cemented so
squatters can't get to the upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Like the city's posh art galleries and boutiques, its finest new
hotel, The Westcliff, is in the suburbs. A cascading series of
villas built into a hillside, like a Mediterranean village, The
Westcliff is secure and secluded and boasts a commanding view of
elephants in the Zoological Gardens below. The lavish rooms have
been decorated by South Africa's most famous interior designer,
Graham Viney.
</P>
<P>
   As for what to do in Johannesburg, don't miss the Market Theatre
complex downtown: It includes a theater, adventurous contemporary
art gallery, bars, and a fabulous, funky restaurant, Gramadoelas,
specializing in tribal African and Malaysian cuisine. Here you can
feast on crocodile and mopani worms.
</P>
<P>
   Soweto is definitely worth visiting, and there are now many
organized tours that are perfectly safe ways to see this sprawling
city of all economic levels, with its houses where celebrities
including Nelson and Winnie Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu either
once lived or still do. Containers donated by trucking firms have
been converted into art galleries here; in one, I saw photographs
of the 1976 Soweto Uprising by Peter Magubane, who spent 586 days
in solitary confinement for his efforts.

   I'd taken South Africa's fabled Blue Train a few years ago, on
the 24-hour route from Johannesburg to Cape Town. It now leaves
from Pretoria because passengers were being accosted on the
platforms of the Johannesburg station.
</P>
<P>
   The train has recently been given a major facelift, and it's now
like traveling inside a jewelry box. Drawers and armoires in the
small but exquisite cabins are lined with padded gold silk;
tabletops are inlaid with leather; walls are panelled with wood
veneers in book-matched grains, and bordered with marquetry in a
pattern of dots _ blue, of course. The bathrooms _ each cabin now
has one, as opposed to the former shared accommodations _ are
miracles of space engineering, all fitted in sumptuous Italian
marble and gold. The murals in the dining car are the same scenes
you're looking at out the windows. There's one pit stop on the
trip, at Kimberley, to inspect the 3,600-foot hole that yielded 14
1/2 million carats of diamonds before the prospecting stopped.
Frankly, this mega-ditch is not one of the country's greatest
attractions, but if you're in the neighborhood anyway. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Train lunch is five courses; dinner, six. The food is
superb, complemented by the finest South African wines, all
included in the admittedly exorbitant price, which encourages you
to drink your money's worth. After doing so, you fall into a deep
sleep, awakening the next morning to a view of vineyards sheltered
by rugged mountains. In this country where flowers bloom in such
profusion, it's typical for each row of vines to be punctuated by a
rose bush at the end.

 UNDATED: ... good people.  Jim French, a member of Friends of the NRA, a fundraising branch of
the NRA. 
 
Q: Why is it that in Canada there are only a fraction of the deaths
caused by guns in the United States?
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: The primary reason is (because of) one segment of the
American society, which tends to be concentrated around the African
American community. If you take their statistics out . . . our
crime statistics are the same as Canada or even lower.
</P>
<P>
   We have segment causing an enormous amount of crime and getting
that under control would solve our so called crime problem &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: How do you do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're creating a climate of immorality. Frankly it's a lack
of respect for the laws which have created a breakdown in the
structure of society of the whole. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Why do you need to be armed?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have a history of 160 years without a foreign invasion and
its easy to forget that it is possible to have tryranical
governments and foreign invasions. In this day and age, we sit now
as a superpower (and) the odds of being physically invaded are
pretty low. That doesn't stop an internal government from someday
arising that could be very dangerous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Isn't the Second Amendment outdated? After all the British are
not coming.
</P>
<P>
   A: Locke and the others were set against tyranical government. I
mean, the Russians in '89 didn't throw the Americans out of Russia;
they threw their own government out. If we ever need to change
government in this country _ and we've been very fortunate that we
haven't had to take any extreme measures _ you want the means at
hand. You either trust the people or you trust a select group. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: But aren't guns killing innocent children?
</P>
<P>
   A: The crime control statistics (define) kids as up to 21 . . .
Gangster rappers and turf war drive-bys, they call them kids being
shot. Well these are vicious criminals &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What are the police for?
</P>
<P>
   A: The police are an arm of government. They are not to defend
you from government, they are government. Ask about the police in
Germany in the 1930s; they became the problem they were not the
solution. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Is the government a problem now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at the moment, but I love history and there's no society
ever that been completely devoid of government over-stepping their
powers. The citizens better have guns if the police have guns. This
lesson's proven time and time again. &QL; 
 &QL;

   Stephen Tressler, a firearms collector and father of 3-year-old
Gage. Tressler owns 173 firearms, from handguns to assault rifles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Aren't you worried about Gage with so many firearms in the
house?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, because he knows already at three he's not suppossed to
touch them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Do you have safety locks on them?
</P>
<P>
   A: No we don't have safety locks; never did when I was growing
up either. We never had any accidental shooting and my whole family
was involved in guns. We all had guns when I was growing up, and we
never had a desire to go to a high school and shoot everybody or
anything else. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Why did Littleton happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not because of guns. It's the way parents bring up their
children. They don't teach them right from wrong. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Do you think TV and video games are glamorizing violence?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really, cause look at the era I grew up in. Im 38.
Starsky and Hutch. Hawai Five Oh. Mannix. People got shot on those
shows all day long. We never had a problem. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What's the solution to the problem of guns and violence? A:
People need to take an interest in their children. Both parents
work too much. When I grew up my mom stayed home. They don't take
them to baseball games. They just give money and pawn them off on
someone else. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: When were you introduced to guns?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been hunting since I was a kid. I used to ride my bike
with a shotgun on my back and go dove and quail hunting. The
sheriff used to . . . go huntin with us. I was 12 years old. They
never said a thing. It was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a quality gun it will never decrease in value. It's
just like having a savings account. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

 &QL; 
Charlie Parrot, maker of the ``invisible holster,'' which is worn
under one's pants. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What's in your pants?
</P>
<P>
   A: A 1911 A1 (handgun) . . . That is a military semi-automatic
.45-caliber handgun, and if you've ever seen any war movie you've
probably seen it on the screen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Where exactly is the gun concealed?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a lower abdomen holster, and it goes around your hips,
right in your crotch. Its actually the best jock strap a male will
ever wear because it protects his privare part. If you kick me in
the groin right now you'd have one hell of a sore foot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What do you think of gun control?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just another way to take away some of our rights and
freedoms. It' guarenteed to do one thing: increase crime. Homicides
are going to go up. Murders are going to go up. Just look at every
gun control law that's ever been enacted.
</P>
<P>
   When you disarm law abiding citizens you give criminals an easy
work environment. They get braver, more confrontational. It's being
proven in Australia, where the homicide rate by handguns in
Queensland is up over 300 percent . . . background checks serve
only to deter law abiding citizens; they do nothing to deter
crime. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What do you think of waiting periods?
</P>
<P>
   A: The average length of time a revolver was used in a crime
after it was acquired was 7.2 years. Waiting periods don't do
anything except promote an increase in homicides and rapes, because
the victims can no longer get protection. The only thing that's
going to protect you from an armed criminal is a firearm, period. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: But don't innocent people wind up getting killed?
</P>
<P>
   A: By criminals, not by law abiding gun owners. There's no
innocent people get killed by ordinary citizens. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What about accidental shootings? Kids playing with guns?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely not. The number of accidental shootings by kids
grabbing guns is down to 200 to 300 per year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Isn't one kid too many?
</P>
<P>
   A: One kid is too many, but whose life do you put more value on?
The over 2.5 million lives protected by firearms every year, less
300 to 400 kids. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Can I ask you a personal question? Aren't you woried you're
going to shoot your . . . off?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, because nothing including your own finger can even get
near the trigger when its in the holster. It's the safest way in
the world to carry a gun. Guaranteed. Even if the gun were to go
off the bullet would land between your feet. &QL; 
 &QL;

   Sandy Silverman, a collector of war relics and antique weapons. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Congress wants to make it illegal for you to sell guns. They say
you're a loophole and they want to close the loophole. What do you
think about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: What they want to do is make it illegal to sell a gun from
person to person, as opposed to going through a federally licensed
dealer. If (a customer) doesn't have a concealed gun permit, I have
to run it through a dealer. It won't bother me one way or the
other; it just costs the customer an extra $18. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: You are not doing that now?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, because usually the stuff I have, I sell to other
dealers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Do you think guns in the house gives you security?
</P>
<P>
   A: I feel a gun in the house is necessary. My wife is a liberal
and doesn't like guns. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: Don't guns ultimately wind up being used in alot of domestic
disputes?
</P>
<P>
   A: If it's not a gun, it's a baseball bat or a knife or a frying
pans. Frying pans can kill, not as quick as a bullet, but just as
dead as a bullet. My wife knows if we have a fight I'm not going to
kill her.
</P>
<P>
   My whole life I only had to pull a gun once. I was trying to
pass on the road and (people in the car ahead) wouldn't let me
pass. I finally got around them, a stupid thing with young
teenagers. After I got to where I was going, they came out like
this (menacingly).
</P>
<P>
   They said `what's the idea of what you were doing?' I said `Did
you know that its illegal not to let somebody pass you when they
flash the lights?' They said, `Who made a stupid law like that.' I
said, `Why dont you ask the government?' . . . He started coming
for me. I pulled out a derringer and (he said) `Oh, he's got a
gun,' and they started running away. Fine. That pleased me no end.
I saved myself. They ran away and then after that I shook. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: What would've happened if they kept coming?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. It gets scary as hell. I hope I never have to
pull a gun on another person. I hope I never ever have to shoot a
person. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -------------------------------------------------- &QC; 
 &QL; 
Chris Bronahan, gun show customer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: How do you keep guns out of the hands of kids?
</P>
<P>
   A: A friend of mine had two kids, age five and six, and he
bought a rabbit so they could get used to it for two or three
weeks. Then he took a .22 out and shot the rabbit in front of the
children, and they were devasted _ absolutely devastated. The girl
was in tears and the boy was in tears. And he said, `Now this is
what's going to happen if you play with a gun and you shoot
somebody. They are dead.' To them it had such an effect, they never
wanted to touch a gun again.

AT 89, SHE'S OUT FOR A 3,000-MILE PROTEST TREK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANGER, Texas _ Nearing the end of her 1,240th-odd mile on her
walk across America, just after sidestepping a road-kill pancake,
Doris Haddock begins quoting Robert Frost. It seems prudent to
start worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock is 89 and so is the temperature, and she is perspiring
freely as she makes her way along this moderately ugly stretch of
Texas highway with the goal of reforming federal campaign finance
laws. For a moment, her unusual purpose combines with her sudden
poetry recital to suggest a kindly old woman who has been too long
in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But listen closely between the roar of trucks passing 4 feet to
the left, and her words, and maybe even her mission, begin to make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   The poem she is mumbling closes with Frost's message from a man
contemplating life's end: ``The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
but I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep, and
miles to go before I sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   As she nears the end of her sixth month on the road, Doris
Haddock of Berlin, N.H., ``Granny D'' to her growing legion of
fans, has about 1,800 miles to go before she can rest. Only then
will she have completed her trek from California to Washington to
protest the failure by Congress to reduce the money-driven
influence of special interests and big business.
</P>
<P>
   It strikes some people as a curious cause to inspire a widowed
octogenarian with 11 great-grandchildren to rise well before dawn
to begin daily 10-mile excursions. But walk a few miles alongside
her _ she loves the company _ and there is no mistaking her clearly
articulated passion for prompting changes that she says will
restore faith and involvement in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is drowning in a flood of money, and I've found
people _ when you ask them _ are pretty angry about that. They hate
the idea that big money has purchased their democracy out from
under them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the people who have given their lives for
democracy, and we're letting democracy go into the sewer, it's
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, she says, starts with passage of federal campaign
finance overhauls sponsored in the House by Representatives
Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, and Martin T. Meehan,
a Lowell Democrat, and in the Senate by Republican John McCain of
Arizona, and Democrat Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The House version, which passed last year and then died during a
Senate filibuster, would ban ``soft money'' contributions to
political parties, restrict late-breaking issue-advocacy ads that
target candidates, and tighten existing fund-raising rules.
Opponents say the changes would violate First Amendment freedoms by
unconstitutionally limiting political speech.
</P>
<P>
   Winning passage is a tall order for a woman barely 5 feet high
who walks with a pronounced forward-leaning stoop, as if she is
eager to reach the next mile marker or is about to fall on her
appealingly lined face.
</P>
<P>
   As she trudges on, weaving at times but never wavering, she
wears a wide-brimmed straw hat, a reflective vest, a T-shirt, khaki
pants, and jogging shoes with high-tech inner soles. It is her
second pair of shoes and her fourth hat since she began her walk
Jan. 1 in Pasadena, Calif. She hopes to arrive in Washington, D.C.,
on Jan. 24, 2000, her 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   On her shoulders is a backpack with a rubber bladder filled with
water, which she sips from a long blue straw. It is a safeguard
against dehydration, a bout of which landed her in the hospital for
four days in February.
</P>
<P>
   She carries a large yellow flag that reads: ``Granny D for
Campaign Finance Reform.'' When the wind is up the flag acts like a
sail, threatening to propel Haddock into traffic or down an
embankment, depending on which way it blows. The flag attracts
honks from drivers, some of whom presumably have learned about her
from the local newspapers and radio and television stations that
have chronicled her travels.
</P>
<P>
   Under her clothes she wears a corset with metal ribs. She has
arthritis in her back and hands, hearing aids in both ears,
dentures in her mouth, and the remnants of emphysema in her lungs
from 50 years of smoking, a habit she kicked in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, I'm perfect,'' she says cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   She is accompanied at all times by either her son Jim, who lives
next door to her in New Hampshire, or by one or two volunteers who
rotate on and off the road for short periods. They either walk
alongside her or drive behind her in a balky van plastered with
signs advertising Haddock's goal.
</P>
<P>
   On this day she is joined by two volunteers whose organizations
also are devoted to campaign finance reform: Jeanne Doogs, head of
the Reform Party in Texas, and Jeffrey Peters, founder of a New
Hampshire-based group called We The People that is dedicated to ``a
rebirth of democracy all across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 100 people have accompanied her for various periods,
including a young man who insisted on burying all road kill he
happened past. Common Cause has sent several escorts, and she has
attracted activists from several organizations, including the
Reform Party, that she neither endorses nor shuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many disparate groups working on this, and if
they could get together they would be such a force. I have
absolutely no intention of belonging to them, but their primary
intent is campaign finance reform, and I'm happy as hell to have
them with me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, she also has been accompanied by a formerly
flea-infested, black-and-white mutt she adopted in Baird, Texas. It
has been dubbed DJ, for ``Doris Junior,'' and its sweet-natured
antics are a source of comfort and glee.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock was inspired to undertake her mission by a friend in New
Hampshire with whom she met regularly for exercise and political
discussions. In 1996, when Haddock complained about what she saw as
a link between low voter turnout and the influence of special
interests, her friend asked, ``Why don't you do something about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After thinking about it awhile, Haddock began training. For nine
months last year she practiced with 10-mile walks, during which she
lost 20 pounds and became convinced she could go coast to coast.
Her family doubted her, though, and as recently as last Christmas _
a week before she began her trek _ several of her eight
grandchildren were making bets on how long she would last. None
thought she would get nearly this far.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haddock has always been politically active, little in
her past hinted at her current endeavor. She is a retired executive
secretary and lifelong activist who remembers casting her first
vote for Norman Thomas of the Socialist Party during one of his six
bids for the presidency. She has since become a Democrat. In the
1960s she helped lead a successful effort to stop nuclear blasting
in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   As a young girl, she dreamed of becoming an actress and says she
completed three years at Emerson College toward that end, but left
school after eloping with her husband. He died in 1993 after 62
years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet moment, she says ``Granny D'' _ the cuddly old lady
walking for reform _ is actually a link to her old dreams of
acting. It is a role she is playing, a persona she has adopted that
belies her steely nature, because she thinks Granny D draws people
to the cause in a way Doris Haddock would not.
</P>
<P>
   When it is pointed out to her that an 89-year-old woman walking
cross-country is news no matter what she calls herself, Haddock
tilts her head upward and smiles, but says nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As she travels _ accepting donated meals, guest rooms in homes,
and hotel rooms paid for by supporters _ Haddock collects
signatures on a petition that reads: ``We the people of the United
States of America beseech our elected leaders to enact, with all
speed, campaign finance reform, eliminating `soft money' from
political campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she does not know how many names she has collected, but
proudly announces that she received 21,000 hits on her Web site
(www.grannyd.com) after she was mentioned on ``Good Morning
America.'' Though she has received a great deal of support, not
everyone likes her. One recent day after her walk, she approached
two women of her generation in a restaurant and asked them whether
they had signed her petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't and I wouldn't want to,'' one said brusquely.
Haddock did not answer, but she acknowledged later that the
brushoff bothered her for several hours afterward.
</P>
<P>
   She gets a far better reception from local politicians who are
acutely aware _ as is Haddock _ that presenting her with a key to
the city (she has six at last count) or a written proclamation (too
many to count) is good for a photo on Page 1 of the local paper and
maybe a few seconds on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock is also welcomed warmly at schools, where children seem
happiest when chanting her slogan: ``Go Granny Go!''
</P>
<P>
   As she walks, she sometimes admires the scenery, but her eyes
are usually trained on the ground. She dodges all sorts of debris,
from pieces of exploded tires to beer cans to various bits of dead
things. At one point, Haddock grabs a guest walker by the belt and
pulls him toward her. ``You definitely don't want to step on
that,'' she says, pointing at the unattached leg of a hoofed
animal, possibly a deer.
</P>
<P>
   She seems to ignore the ubiquitous billboards, advertising
everything from the Castle Arms Gun Shop to the Love's Rest Stop
about 50 miles down Interstate 20. But she comments on exit signs,
at one point marveling at Exit 361, leading to the towns of Strawn
and DeLeon. Thinking it a single town, she sings out, ``Strawn
DeLeon, what a lovely name for a town. I wonder how it got such a
name.'' When she is told they are two separate towns, she shrugs
and moves on.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock is certain that campaign finance laws will be
overhauled, though she doubts it will happen soon. ``It'll be
another 10 years before anything is accomplished,'' she says. And
no, she does not expect to live to see it happen: ``I'll be smiling
from the other side.''

CON MAN LEAVES TRAIL OF ASSAULTS ACROSS THE NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The calls began 17 years ago and haven't changed much since.
</P>
<P>
   They start with a muffled, barely intelligible voice that preys
on a woman's deepest fears about her family. They have ended in
dozens, perhaps hundreds, of rapes and sexual assaults across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The victims are chosen randomly from the telephone book by
Richard Alan Minsky, a 56-year-old con artist and fugitive who is
wanted in Boston, Los Angeles, San Diego and elsewhere for rape,
sexual assault and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   While Minsky has scammed about $28,000 from victims in the past
six months, police say he hunts for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Minsky's crimes have landed him in prison in Massachusetts and
on a Georgia chain-gang for eight years, but today he's on the
loose and authorities are looking for him everywhere, knowing that
he favors his home state, as well as Florida and California.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Minsky, a balding chain-smoker who likes to be called
``Abe Lincoln,'' is a master manipulator, preying on the bonds a
woman has with a lover, husband, or child. He is on the Top 10 list
of fugitives issued by the Los Angeles Police Department and set to
be the subject of an upcoming episode of ``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a salesman with a perfected pitch,'' said William
Hartford, a Boston police detective who, along with his partner,
Paul Mahoney, arrested Minsky at the Copley Plaza Hotel in 1996 _
the only officers to catch him in the act of randomly calling
women, trying to lure them to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he's selling a product,'' Hartford said.
``He's successful at selling it, so he probably figures `Why change
the pitch?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Hartford arrested him, Minsky was waiting for a victim from
Boston while using a bag of dimes to call more possible victims in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Minsky was convicted of indecent assault and battery and spent
two years in a Massachusetts penitentiary. He was released in June
1998, but failed to register as a sex offender and skipped
probation. Now Minsky faces a minimum of five years in prison for
parole violations.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Minsky fishes the phone book for victims, often
striking high-rent areas like Boston, Cambridge, San Diego and
Beverly Hills. He dials madly until he finds someone who will
believe him.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the early hours, and with the poise and push of a
clever telemarketer, Minsky tricks his victims into believing he is
an attorney trying to help a boyfriend or husband who has just fled
the scene of a vehicular homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The calls begin with a hushed, almost indecipherable, voice, and
when a victim blurts out a loved one's name in an attempt to find
out who is calling, Minsky pounces. He expertly changes voices, and
using the name he has just obtained, says he is a lawyer trying to
help that person.
</P>
<P>
   Minsky quickly convinces the women that sex, money or both can
be exchanged to pay off a malleable, lone witness.
</P>
<P>
   He cites state laws he is familiar with and mentions a mandatory
prison sentence. Minsky varies the con, sometimes pretending to be
a kidnapper holding a child at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Minsky directs the victim to meet the made-up witness or
kidnapper at a hotel or airport, where Minsky himself will be
waiting, to make the so-called payoff.
</P>
<P>
   If Minsky likes the looks of the women he sees, he lures them to
a hotel room, police say. If not, he just walks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm educated, I'm the vice president of a national sales
company. I'm no dummy, he caught me off guard,'' a 32-year-old
victim from the Miami area told the Globe recently. She is Minsky's
last known victim, one of the few who have provided police with a
template of Minsky's well-crafted scam.
</P>
<P>
   The first words she heard _ from Minsky, in a muffled voice
purporting to be her husband _ at 7:50 a.m. that Feb. 10 morning
were ``Honey, I'm in trouble.'' After she responded with her
husband's name, the voice changed to one evocative of a well-spoken
professional man _ supposedly, a lawyer offering her a chance to
pay off a witness to her husband's hit-and-run car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was helping my husband,'' the woman said. ``The
man on the phone wanted to know what I was willing to do to help my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   She agreed to meet the witness at the Miami airport with $5,000
in cash. Police say Minsky orders the victims to meet him fast,
before they can think clearly or call for help. In this case,
Minsky, while posing as the helpful attorney, insisted that the
woman practice her plea, saying out loud several times why her
husband couldn't afford to go to prison. She mentioned a new job
and their infant baby.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she was told to go to the arrival desk at United Airlines
and ask for ``Abe Lincoln.'' When she got there, Minsky was
waiting. Posing as the witness, he ordered her to drive to an
isolated area nearby where they could talk.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a cheap black suit, scuffed leather loafers, and
thick eyeglasses, Minsky prattled for three hours and smoked a
dozen cigarettes, the woman recalled. He never made eye contact and
refused to talk about the made-up accident, instead chatting on
about having dogs and a girlfriend, all the while managing to touch
the victim's legs and chest. Sometimes he hugged and kissed her
head, reminding her that he ``needed to be convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   After the woman made it clear she would not have sex, Minsky
took the cash without counting it and asked to be dropped back at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The victim rushed home, tracked her husband by phone, realized
her mistake, and called the police. The case went unsolved until
recently, when police learned Minsky had committed similar crimes
in Los Angeles and had a past in Boston. She later identified his
photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was lucky. This guy was working on raping her, that's why
he wanted her to leave the airport,'' said Aventura, Fla., police
Detective Carlos Fernandez, who is handling the case.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said he obtained a photograph of Minsky from Boston
police, the agency with the most information about him, and the
victim immediately picked him out of a photo array. Florida will be
issuing an arrest warrant this week for Minsky.
</P>
<P>
   Minsky's scam is so polished, Fernandez said, ``He scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brookline, Mass., Minsky has split his time between
Massachusetts and California for much of his adult life. Police say
he enjoys gambling and betting on horses; he particularly favors
several tracks in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   He has little education, according to police, and his primary
work experience was as a part-time salesman for a brother-in-law
who owns a used car lot in a north-of-Boston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who once ran a produce business in Boston, has
retired to Florida and lives near Fort Lauderdale. When Minsky was
arrested in Boston in 1996, he listed an address near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest reported rape scams were in Southern California in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never forgotten this guy,'' said Los Angeles Police
Detective John Metcalf, who first came across Minsky as a detective
trainee in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf linked Minsky to six attacks, but before Los Angeles
police could prosecute, Minsky was arrested in Georgia in 1983. He
was convicted of sodomy, sexual assault and extortion in Georgia
and Florida, and served an eight-year concurrent prison sentence in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   And since being released from Massachusetts last June, Minsky
has allegedly struck more than a half-dozen times in Los Angeles
and San Diego, said Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf said that Minsky relies on the belief most victims will
not call the police, afraid to tell authorities they willingly took
part in a scam, embarrassed about being raped or afraid their
husbands and family will not understand they were duped by a
smooth-talker who looks more like a snake charmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my belief this guy has struck hundreds, maybe thousands,
of times. We only know about some of them,'' Metcalf said. ``This
guy is preying on the loyalty between between a mother and a
daughter, or a wife and husband. He knows the female is going to be
protective, he knows they're going to do whatever it takes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia _ At a 1987 rally, Slobodan Milosevic
bellowed from a balcony to the residents of this Serb industrial
town, ``No one should dare to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, the Yugoslav leader donned the mantle of
protector of Kosovo's beleaguered minority Serbs and ignited the
ethnic hatred that would propel him into power and explode into one
war after another.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in streets ravaged by Milosevic's hateful vision, a
funeral procession for a Serb _ beaten savagely with a hammer and
then shot to death by ethnic Albanians seeking revenge _ wound its
way beneath the same balcony where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic made his promises to us, and now he has left us to
die,'' said Miodrag Stamenkovic, 66, as he stood by the simple
wooden casket that held his son Jovica, 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those words were all for his own political career, and it is
the people who are suffering and dying. We lost our beautiful
son,'' said Stamenkovic, brushing away tears. The son's body was
found Thursday in a pool of blood at the Pristina University cafe
where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   As the cycle of violence turns against the Serbs,
disillusionment with Milosevic's nationalist dreams seems to be
cresting. Each day Serbs in Kosovo, the southern province of what
is left of Yugoslavia, are turning against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are wearing black because of him. Milosevic is now our
worst enemy,'' said Savka Martinovic, 70, shrouded in a black veil
as she made her way in the funeral procession Friday in a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs' anger is reinforced by fear as the death toll mounts.
Serbian Orthodox Church officials allege that about 50 Serbs have
been killed in the two weeks since NATO ground troops moved into
Kosovo after a 78-day bombing campaign intended to halt the Serbs'
forced expulsion of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is now accelerating deployment of peacekeeping forces to
reach a planned strength of 55,000 as soon as possible. The
alliance's leaders seem to believe that they must act quickly or
face the prospect of losing the peace after winning the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the streets of Kosovo Polje were lined with
frightened Serbs standing solemnly for Jovica Stamenkovic's funeral
procession. As they mourned a neighbor, they must also have feared
for their own lives, well aware that returning Kosovar Albanian
refugees were unleashing their anger on Serb neighbors throughout
the province, looting and burning homes and killing suspected
collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   Already, an estimated 75,000 of Kosovo's 125,000 Serbs have
fled. They had long been a minority of 10 percent of the province's
population, and their dwindling numbers dim any remaining hope of
maintaining a multiethnic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But some, embittered and fearful, are staying, at least for now.
Mili Dimic, 35, with an AK-47 loaded with a 30-bullet clip lying on
a bed in his one-room home, looked out his window on the streets
last week. He had just lost his job at an electrical plant that was
once again operated by ethnic Albanian workers, who had been fired
under Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Dimic said he will never leave, and he will kill anyone who
threatens him or his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic won't protect us, and NATO can't. We'll take care of
ourselves,'' said Dimic, adding that he had tossed in a trash heap
the framed photo of Milosevic that until two weeks ago hung on his
wall.
</P>
<P>
   All week long, the streets of Kosovo Polje crackled with
sporadic gunfire, and Serbian homes were set ablaze as ethnic
Albanians looted Serb homes and stores. NATO troops were a sparse
presence, with only an occasional tank rumbling down the street.
</P>
<P>
   It made no difference to the victims, but the scope of the
reflexive rage that ethnic Albanians unleashed on some of their
Serb neighbors was limited compared with the intense and systematic
campaign of violent expulsion that had been waged by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians rationalize their current violence,
justifying it by saying that Serb civilians killed and raped their
loved ones and looted and burned their homes. They contend that
many Serb and Serbian gypsy civilians worked in concert with
murderous paramilitary units and police to carry out the ``ethnic
cleansing'' that forced 1 million refugees from their homes and
slaughtered an estimated 10,000 ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Stamenkovic was apparently an innocent victim, caught in the
wrong place at the wrong time. He served coffee at a Pristina
University cafe. The unknown assailants, who witnesses say were
ethnic Albanians, were believed to be targeting two prominent Serb
professors at the Serb-dominated university, which was once the
pride of ethnic Albanians before they were ousted from academic
positions under Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The two professors were found bound and gagged and shot in the
head alongside the body of Stamenkovic. The message, it seemed, was
that ethnic Albanians will use force if necessary to take back
their jobs in everything, including academia.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a darkened home, a Kosovo Polje priest conducted the
funeral rites, the casket lit by a glow of mourners' candles. But
the priest was ordered by the church hierarchy not to attend the
burial in a nearby cemetery. The risk to his life was too great.
One priest was already missing, church officials said, after he was
seen being detained by the soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation Army.

 KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia: ... Libertion Army.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The priests have reason to fear. Because Serb nationalism is
laden with religious symbolism, the KLA and the predominantly
Muslim Kosovar Albanians often see the Serbian Orthodox Church as
an ally of the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   That impression _ and the church hierarchy insists it is a false
one _ was solidified in 1989 when 1 million Serbs gathered at the
14th-century monastery in Gracanica to commemorate the 600th
anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic presided on that day 10 years ago, standing
side-by-side with the Serbian Orthodox patriarch. Although his 1987
rally at Kosovo Polje had thrust him onto the national stage, it
was the 1989 rally that consolidated his power. Fired with Serb
nationalism, the crowd marched from the monastery to Gazimistan, a
sprawling farmland in the Lob River valley, and listened to the
words that unveiled Milosevic's ominous vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six centuries later we are again in battles and quarrels,''
Milosevic said. ``They are not armed battles, though such things
should not be excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was well aware that in the historic Battle of Kosovo
in 1389, when Serbs were defeated by the Turks and subjected to
some 500 years of Ottoman rule, has deep spiritual significance for
the Serbian Orthodox Church as well. It is seen as a noble defeat,
one that purified the souls of Serb soldiers as they fought for the
Serbian holy land. The date on which Serbs commemorate the battle,
June 28, is the day that a Serb nationalist chose in 1914 to
assassinate Austrian Archduke Ferdinand, triggering World War I.
</P>
<P>
   But as the traditional date of the battle approached last week,
there was little to commemorate.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1389 Pub one evening, Serb workmen were downing shots of
plum brandy. They hurled ugly insults at ethnic Albanians as
``thieves and whores,'' and the language grew louder and more
vulgar as more drinks were poured.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall was a huge mural depicting Serbian Czar Lazar _ who
chose to fight to his death rather than be conquered by the Turks.
The painting depicts the czar's last supper, mirroring the image of
Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our history. This is who we are,'' said Petrovic
Stanica, part owner of the bar and the only one drinking a Coke.
``Milosevic wants to think he's Lazar. For a few years he had
support; now he is seen for what he is: a pawn of the world's
Mafia.'' Referring to President Clinton and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, he continued, ``Your Clinton and your Blair are Mafia
kings.'' The 1389 Pub is just up the road from the historic
battlefield it celebrates, and there too is a monastery, where
Bishop Artemije Radosavljevic, bishop of the Serbian Orthodox
Diocese of Prizren, last week remembered Milosevic's 1989 speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech frightened people, Serbs as well as Albanians. It
was the specter of a kind of nationalism that everyone knew meant
violence,'' he said in an interview. ``He used that day and its
symbolism for his own political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``there is no contact between Milosevic and the
Serbian Orthodox Church. When have you ever seen Milosevic in
church on a Sunday?''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Serbian Orthodox patriarch no longer stands beside
Milosevic. In a statement released just after NATO troops moved
into Kosovo, the church called for his resignation, making it the
most powerful institution to challenge Milosevic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that the disillusionment of Serbs in Kosovo
is spreading into Serbia proper. A recent poll showed that his
popularity had plummeted amid the ravages of NATO bombing. And the
Yugoslav Army has grown restive, blocking roads south of Belgrade
and demanding unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is widespread criticism that the church was too
late in challenging Milosevic, Artemije called that view unfair. He
said that the church had spoken out against Milosevic since 1992,
but had been ignored by the state-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishop doesn't expect Milosevic, who stands charged as a
war criminal by an international tribunal in The Hague, to step
down any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the priests were arranging a funeral for four Serb
farmers, all in their 60s, who were found slaughtered, presumably
by ethnic Albanians, in the woods near their village. The men had
been castrated and their hearts cut out of their chests, Artemije
said, an account confirmed by family members and several priests.
</P>
<P>
   After the funeral, the procession of mourners from the four
victims' extended families, and most of the other residents of
their farming village, were too frightened to go home. Some 150 of
them camped inside the monastery's school.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Voja Zvedkovic, 75, who huddled in fear with his
wife, Zorka, 65, in a classroom with children's drawings on the
walls and a model of a human heart encased in glass.
</P>
<P>
   Zvedkovic said KLA soldiers had kicked in his door in the middle
of the night, beat him badly, and forced him and his wife out of
their home. Tears streamed down over the black-and-blue half moons
under his eyes _ the result of the beating. His wife had a
reddish-blue bruise, the shape of a boot, from her left eye to her
neck. She said she had been kicked by a KLA soldier while she lay
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what has happened to us. Look what they did,'' said Voja.
``We have nowhere to go. We have no money.''
</P>
<P>
   But when they were asked about Milosevic and his campaign of
ethnic cleansing, the elderly villagers seemed too frightened to
criticize him. Even with evidence all around them of the horrors
that ethnic Albanian neighbors had suffered, they denied there had
been any atrocities. They insisted the killing and ransacking was
done by NATO, not Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment remains common among Serbs who have only the
government-controlled media to rely on for their news.
</P>
<P>
   But when Stanko Shoranovic, 45, a manager of a petroleum
processing plant who holds advanced degrees in engineering, came to
the schoolhouse to pick up his elderly father, the contrast was
stark. Shoranovic can afford satellite television, and he had seen
the horror. But as he talked, the elderly villagers listened to him
silently and shook their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Shoranovic said, he actively supported
Milosevic, believing that his leadership would redress the
discrimination that he said Serbs suffered under Albanian political
leadership in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. But now, he said, he has
seen ``Milosevic's dirty war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Milosevic can live with himself,'' he said,
``not after what he has done.''

OPTIMISM ON IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- In Northern Ireland, the Perils of Pauline
character of the peace process is always dramatic, usually serious,
and occasionally dangerous _ as in right now.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also diverting from underlying trends that produce
most of the optimism that still surrounds the contentious
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   To an optimist conditioned by scores of events in the past five
years to look realistically past obstacles _ it is the politicians
in the six counties of the North that are the lagging indicators,
not the people.
</P>
<P>
   It is the people who have demonstrated and then voted for both
nonviolence and a settlement of outstanding political questions.
And it is the people whose religious leaders (most of them) and
economic activities (all of them) are creating a new environment
that will not tolerate a return to the madness of The Troubles that
began in such deadly earnest 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why the latest deadline _ Wednesday _ for political
progress _ imposed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahearn _ is less an ultimatum than a
marker. It is above all an expression by two of the governments
driving this process _ the third, thanks to President Clinton, is
the United States _ of an unwillingness to tolerate querulous
politics by the parties to last year's still-astonishing Good
Friday agreement, and to insist on implementation.
</P>
<P>
   That intolerance was expressed during a visit here last week by
Ireland's deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, the leader of the
junior party in Ahearn's coalition, the Progressive Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always envisaged there would be problems,'' she said in
between official appointments with Clintonites, ``but we cannot
contemplate failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Harney's portfolio in the Ahearn cabinet covers economic
affairs, which makes her an overseer of one of the genuine miracles
in the world today _ an economy that itself has evolved into a
powerful magnet for the North as well as a positive role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone can see what peace can produce, especially
when compared to the effects of 30 years of enormous damage to the
society in the North,'' she said. ``Since the ceasefire in 1994,
even the cross-border trade has been way, way up. The reaction in
the business community to continued progress would be extremely
positive, and many of their leaders are strongly encouraging the
politicians to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the problem is not literally Unionist leader David
Trimble's insistence that Sinn Fein lean on its pals in the Irish
Republican Army to turn in some of their weapons and explosives in
advance of the deadline of next spring that was agreed to last
year; Trimble has insisted on some response to his liking as a
condition for agreeing to let the executive department of the new
government in the North be formed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the core of the problem Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams's
refusal to date to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   As Trimble has said, the core of the problem is diminished
confidence in the peace agreement within his divided community; and
as Adams has said somewhat less directly, the core of the problem
is an unwillingness to push disarmament ahead of schedule in the
absence of confidence that a new political day is in fact dawning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's obviously needed is simultaneous movement on every
side,'' said Harney. ``All sides know what the words mean, but it's
not always the words themselves that matter. It's sometimes
important to go a bit beyond the words to honor the real spirit of
an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Irish official involved in the process said that while
disarming _ they call it by the choice euphemism, decommissioning _
is not a precondition for the establishment of the power-sharing
executive, it is a commitment nonetheless for next May; and, in
that context, it is not unreasonable to push for things that will
establish confidence that the commitment will be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, you could see the parties begin to move. Sinn Fein
was talking about formally declaring ``the war is over'' and not
just halted by a ceasefire. Trimble was talking about oral
commitments to disarm, not necessarily any actual turning in of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And, in addition to quietly encouraging Sinn Fein to take a step
toward the Unionists, the authorities in the North were banning a
major Protestant march this weekend from entering the Catholic part
of Drumcree, for years a flashpoint for violence.
</P>
<P>
   What all those moves share is a realization that the public
wants more progress, less intransigence, and no violence.
</P>
<P>
   We optimists believe the pols understand the message.

<P>
   Take a look out the window of any airport terminal _ or a window
of an aircraft taxiing toward takeoff _ and you might see a plane
painted to look like a whale that contains a scene of Boston's
famous Swan Boats, or others painted to celebrate Nevada, Arizona,
or plain, old Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly competitive world of the airline industry,
carriers are looking for an edge. United Airlines earlier this year
finished painting all of its 460 planes in new colors; Delta is in
the midst of changing its look. And US Airways not only is changing
its colors for the third time in 10 years, it changed its name from
USAir to US Airways. Continental recently redid the outside of its
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines must seem modern and cutting edge, so colors or print
type that were fashionable a decade ago can seem terribly passe,
industry specialists say. As a result an airline's colors _ what
the industry calls livery _ get changed frequently, and airline
executives hope that a message has been sent to business travelers,
vacationers _ even their employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort may not alter the bottom line, said Darryl
Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anybody, anywhere say that one airline made
more than another because of its livery,'' he said. ``You don't
want your airplanes to look like dogs, but you never see the
outside of an airplane when you are flying in one. The airline
business boils down to schedule and price.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are reluctant to divulge how much they spend on
changing livery. They say virtually all of the cost _ anywhere from
several hundred thousand dollars to a few million _ is in
commissioning the new design. Planes are painted during their
normal maintenance schedule _ no airline would take a plane out of
service simply to paint it. As a result, a complete changeover can
take several years.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not smart branding, said Audrey Duskey,
professor of marketing at Duquesne University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from the consumer's point of view, it is confusing,''
she said. ``Look at traditional images like Coca-Cola or Nike. They
don't change. As consumers, we like tradition and it surprises me
the airlines do this as much as they do. It is probably not a good
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   While United, Delta, Continental, and US Airways are all going
with solid colors and clean lines, and each is trying to portray
international professionalism to the business traveler, other
carriers are taking a more eye-catching route.
</P>
<P>
   Consider British Airways. Two years ago, the airline scrapped
the Union Jack and royal crown painted on the tail of its planes
for more colorful, bold global images to reflect the airline's
worldwide route system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was part of rebranding,'' said BA spokesman John Lampl.
``We are still British, the name will never change, but we fly to
167 destinations in over 80 countries. We wanted to reflect the
fact that we were appreciative of where we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   But BA's change caused a patriotic uproar in Merry Old England.
So halfway through the redesign, the airline decided to paint a
modified Union Jack on planes that had not yet received the wild
schemes designed by artists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Upstart Virgin Atlantic Airways this month unveiled a new livery
for its aircraft. The British flag is prominently featured on the
winglets and fuselages of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   Was it chance the rival airline, long a thorn in BA's side, saw
an opportunity to stick it to the big airline once again?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are coincidences in life, but this was not a
coincidence,'' said Virgin spokeswoman Elvi Taveras.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin has a history of using its fleet to convey all sorts of
messages. Many of its planes still have the message ``No Way BA
AA,'' a reference to the proposed alliance between British Airways
and American Airlines that failed to get off the ground. Virgin put
the political statement on its planes as it launched service to
Washington in an effort to get the Department of Transportation to
rule against the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Much more often, however, designs are tied to marketing rather
than politics. In 1989, after acquiring Piedmont and Pacific
Southwest Airlines, USAir changed its livery from a polished
aluminum fuselage with a red and orange stripe to a painted
fuselage with red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, the airline changed its livery and name again
because ``there was new management, and the airline was expanding
internationally, and we were upgrading our facilities,'' said Rita
Cuddihy, vice president of customer products and service planning
for US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that had to be changed, said Cuddihy, was the
name. USAir sounded smaller than US Airlines or US Airways. The
former was the generic name for the domestic commercial aviation
industry, so the latter was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping US was a no-brainer, as was keeping red, white, and blue
_ although the blue became deeper and the underbelly of each plane
was painted gray, to ``get further into the business side to
reflect the pinstripe-suit formal side of life,'' said Cuddihy.
</P>
<P>
   The change involved some 1,600 separate items, from airplanes to
baggage trucks, from airport interior signage to corporate
stationery. And unifying everything, says Cuddihy, is the stylized
flag design painted on the tail of every plane, be it US Airways,
the US Airways Shuttle, or Metrojet.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers aren't as consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines's normal livery is gold, red, and orange,
with the colors extending the length of the fuselage and stripes
running up the tail. But seven of the airline's 292 Boeing 737s
have special paint jobs _ most of which cost more than the regular
livery.
</P>
<P>
   Three are painted to look like Shamu the killer whale, in a
marketing tie-in with Sea World. Others are painted as tributes to
Texas, Nevada, and Arizona. The plane the airline calls California
One has a giant bear (like the one on the state flag) painted on
the fuselage. And Triple Crown One is dedicated to Southwest
employees for the airline finishing with the best on-time arrival,
the best baggage handling, and the fewest customer complaints
registered with the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The plane has the name of all 25,000 Southwest employees who
worked for the airline in 1996 on the luggage bins inside the
aircraft, said spokeswoman Kristie Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to fly on the planes, especially Shamu,'' said
Kerr. In fact, people often request reservations on the specialty
planes _ something reservation agents have no control over.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, America West has some planes painted to represent
states the airline serves. It also has theme planes for the Phoenix
Suns basketball team and the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Cape Air/Nantucket Airlines, with its
blue-and-white livery with either a seagull or Nantucket painted on
the tail of the Cessna 402s the airline uses.
</P>
<P>
   But among the fleet of 47 airplanes are three that president Dan
Wolf hopes do more than catch the eye. He hopes to instill an
appreciation for art.
</P>
<P>
   One plane, celebrating the airline's first route _ between
Boston and Provincetown _ is painted like a whale with scenes from
Boston and Provincetown. Designed and painted by Cape Cod artists,
the special planes cost much more than a normal paint job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that if you can get art out of galleries
and museums, it is an enriching thing,'' said Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Another plane is designed to represent Nantucket's high school
sports teams. With new service to North Carolina's Outer Banks,
Cape Air plans to select an artist from that area to design and
paint the airplane. Future Cape Air planes may have scenes from
Martha's Vineyard and New Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bond, co-chairman of New York advertising firm Kirshenbaum
Bond &AMP; Partners, thinks Cape Air is on the right track _ even if
the goal is less lofty than Wolf's desire to promote art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that gives you the experience of a place before
you get there,'' said Bond. ``It says your vacation starts when you
step on the plane, not when you step off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might fret that airplanes with wild designs and special
themes are just a step away from flying billboards. But airlines
that sold ads on planes have not done so well.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based Western Pacific Airlines, a discount airline that
started operations in 1995, made a splash by turning its Boeing
737s into flying advertisements. One contract, for example, was
with Fox TV, and the plane was painted with cartoon characters from
``The Simpsons.'' But while Bart, Homer, and Marge are still
crowding the airwaves, their plane is not. The airline went
bankrupt in 1998.

   SEOUL _ The fans are munching dried squid, guzzling potato
vodka, banging noisemakers and screaming like maniacs: ``Woo-ju!
Woo-ju! Woo-ju!'' Up at bat is ``Woo-ju,'' Korea's home-run hero,
otherwise known as . . . Tyrone Woods.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't sound like a Korean name, that's because it
isn't. Woods is a former Boston Red Sox minor league player who
kissed the Pawtucket, R.I., Triple A farm team goodbye in 1997 when
it became clear he wasn't going to make it to Fenway Park. He came
to South Korea for the first season that foreigners were allowed to
play in the Korean major league _ and said hello to fame, fortune,
and a whole new life.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a man who spent a decade struggling in the minor
leagues at home surprised his new audience, his new managers and
himself by becoming the Mark McGwire of Korea _ breaking the home
run record, leading the league in runs batted in, and winning the
Most Valuable Player award. His picture graces the cover of local
sports sections almost daily, more often than the image of
Korean-born Red Sox pitcher Jin Ho Cho. (In Korea he is known as
Cho Jin Ho.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, whatever you do, it seems like it's not
enough . . . I was only a Triple A player and I was never given a
chance to go any farther,'' the 29-year-old first baseman reflected
after driving in the winning run in a game last week. ``This is
their major league, and to come and fit in right away is great.
It's everyone's dream to play in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is an outsider who has become not just an insider, but a
national hero. That is no mean feat in Korea, a society that is
notoriously homogeneous, insular, and suspicious of foreigners.
Like Tom Selleck's character in the movie ``Mr. Baseball'' _ a
ballplayer who goes to Japan and must adapt to new customs _ Woods
has somehow bridged a cultural divide in a country where that gap
is pretty wide.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even the quintessential American sport of baseball has a
uniquely Korean flavor. Vendors don't hawk hot dogs or peanuts;
fans snack on squid jerky (dried, salted slabs of flattened squid),
hard-boiled eggs, sushi, and mint-green dumplings. The only beer
for sale is a low-alcohol variety that, Woods jokes, would take a
whole case to make an American tipsy. No matter; Korean fans prefer
``soju,'' a potent potato-based alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   But even that doesn't explain a ballpark atmosphere that is like
Yankee Stadium's famously rowdy bleachers _ only louder.
</P>
<P>
   The noise is thundering as fans beat together ``bangers,''
sausage-shaped plastic balloons decorated with team logos, going
wild over every base hit. A man in white satin pants, white leather
lace-up knee boots and a whistle leaps up and down on a platform to
fire up the fans. Two men in the official pep brigade bang maroon
drums that look like they came from a high school marching band.
But the biggest attraction for the mostly male, twenty-something
crowd may be the cheerleaders in white short-shorts and sneakers
who dance disco moves nonstop _ in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyrone is home run king!'' shouted Kim Eun Kuk, 30, a computer
engineer, pausing from banging his noisemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Woods appreciates the fans and the cheerleaders (``They're rowdy
the whole game''), but hasn't yet acquired a taste for dried squid
(``It's nasty'') or soju (``It's poison''). And he still thinks the
American custom of having the grounds crew manually rake the
infield in the seventh inning beats the mechanized Korean version _
a golf cart dragging a single rake behind it _ a sort of dirt
Zamboni. But those are superficial differences from playing ball
back home.
</P>
<P>
   Far more important are the social customs of conforming to group
behavior, observing formalities, respecting hierarchy, and keeping
out of trouble. A free spirit like former pro basketball star
Dennis Rodman wouldn't make it here. But Woods, a native of
Brooksville, Fla., and his wife, Cheryl, have managed so
successfully to behave in a ``Korean way'' that they have earned
the respect of their adopted compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   Ha Il Sung, the baseball commentator for Korean Broadcasting
Service, attributes Woods's popularity to his ``Asian style,'' no
less than his ballplaying skills: He never became a snob when he
got good; he is friends with other players; ``and his wife is like
a Korean wife _ she comes to every game to help motivate him; and
she is good with the other wives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Koreans always have distance with foreigners,'' Ha said, ``but
Woods has really given us a good role model and example of a
foreigner.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim In Sik, the manager of Woods's team, the Doosan Bears, says
skill isn't the only key to success for foreigners playing in
Korea. Some former major league players, such as onetime Los
Angeles Dodger Mike Bush, have fizzled here. ``It's more . . . work
ethic and whether you can adjust to Korean lifestyle,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance issue, of course, cuts both ways. Kim admits his
Korean players were at first ``scared'' when they heard two
foreigners were joining Doosan last season. And Woods ``was not
only a foreigner, but a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know what to expect,'' Kim explained. ``Everyone
here has watched TV, but they hadn't met an African-American person
. . . They've seen gangster images, and he's nothing like that.
He's very good-looking, clean cut. They got along with him very
well and brought him into their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Koreans are sometimes accused of racism, not specifically
against blacks but against any non-Koreans. But Woods says he felt
more unspoken bias within the Red Sox organization than he ever has
here. He laughs at his nickname in some Korean papers _ ``the big
black bear'' _ explaining that it's because of his hulking build
and his team's mascot, and that it is intended affectionately in a
country that hasn't yet learned the meaning of ``politically
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods hit 42 homers last year to break the Korean record _ far
short of McGwire's US record of 70. For one thing, the Korean
season is shorter than in the United States _ 126 games versus 162.
It is also true that pitching here is slower, hitting is weaker,
and fielding can be downright raggedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we come out and play Triple A. Other times, we're
just bad,'' Woods admitted with a laugh. As of Monday night, Woods
was batting .310, with 20 homers and 65 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean league was founded in 1982 and has eight teams
sponsored by big corporations such as Doosan, the liquor
conglomerate that owns the Bears. The league has less money to
throw around than the US major leagues, but far more to spend than
the minors. Woods's salary last year jumped meteorically from the
$6,500 a month for six months he made in Pawtucket to over $130,000
a year. This season, his salary more than doubled, but Woods won't
reveal the precise figure in deference to management's wish to
avoid rivalry among players.
</P>
<P>
   After his spectacular season last year, his agent also told him
the Red Sox inquired about his returning to the minors. Woods said
he wasn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have said Woods didn't have the stuff for the majors; he
says they spent two years ``telling me what I wanted to hear _ that
I had a great chance of making it. But it was basically lies,'' he
said with a laugh. ``They told me if someone goes down injured,
you'll be the first up. But people went down hurt all the time . .
. and I was waiting for a call that never came.''
</P>
<P>
   Demoralized by his experience with the Sox, Woods considered
becoming a firefighter. His move to Korea was a last-ditch try at
baseball, but it turned his life around. He has stayed partly for
the money, partly because he loves the country and his team, and
partly because he has become the star he never was at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of makes me feel like Mo Vaughn or Ken Griffey,'' he
said, an electric smile lighting his face. ``The best thing is
feeling appreciated. No matter what you do, the fans and the front
office here are still behind you.''

GAMBLING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It came as little surprise when the doctor gave me the bad news.
For years I'd gone for the cheap laugh, the low blow, the wisecrack
_ always with little effect. Everybody told me that all those sick
jokes would catch up with me one day. So I half expected it when
the good doctor said: ``You have a diseased funny bone.'' He added
somberly: ``It looks fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew I'd been a bit gauche at times but I just had to ask:
``Is it really . . . that bad?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm,'' he nodded. ``But I can offer you a glimmer of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything, doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new procedure,'' he said. ``It's enormously risky.
But for a man as disturbingly sick as you, it's your only chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it. What is it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A transplant?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We replace your funny bone with a healthy one. After months of
profound therapy, there's a chance you could surprise us with an
acceptable witticism or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And without the operation?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get started, doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something else,'' he said. ``The costs will be
astronomical. First you need to find a compatible donor. This will
require travel _ airfares, hotels, rental cars. Then there's the
procedure itself. Altogether we're looking at hundreds of thousands
of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course my health insurance _''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor shook his head gravely. ``Transplants of the funny
bone. The insurance companies still consider them experimental.
They won't pay a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I felt adrift. I was one of far too many patients who
find themselves engulfed in dark _ and uncomic _ desperation as
they try to scrounge money for a vital medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   There's Susan Diaz who, the Wall Street Journal tells us, needs
a new intestine and is forced to hold yard sales and arts and
crafts auctions, and to place milk cartons in her local restaurants
seeking contributions from diners. She is still thousands of
dollars away from saving her own life.
</P>
<P>
   There are Robert and Amanda Sehee, who sell candy bars to fund a
bone-marrow transplant for their 22-month-old daughter. And JoEllen
Whitfield, who holds a raffle with donated gifts to pay for her
search for a bone-marrow donor.
</P>
<P>
   The health insurance system has failed them all. So too has the
government _ populated by oafs who, blinded by their
self-importance, have lost sight of the important issues. If there
is one thing a government in good faith ought to do it is to ensure
the health of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   You won't catch me hawking candy bars or selling old
candlesticks on my front lawn. By the time I raised enough for my
new funny bone, the laughing would have long stopped. I have no
choice, really, but to take on the biggest gamble of my life. I've
sold everything I own, cashed in all of my certificates, bonds, and
baseball cards, and I'm converting the small lump of bills into
chips for the roulette table.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's come to this.
</P>
<P>
   I'm placing the whole stack on 11 black. Whoosh. Round goes the
wheel, just like the fortunes of life, counter-clockwise, and
there's the tiny ivory ball spinning the opposite direction. If it
falls for me, I'm paid 35 to 1, and I live happily ever after with
a new and improved funny bone.
</P>
<P>
   Round and round. It's come to this _ one last shot.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel slows, the ball falls: It's 23 red.
</P>
<P>
   I lose. I die _ and it won't be funny.

FREEDOM URGED FOR KOSOVO'S `MOTHER FLORA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Flora Brovina peacefully, but openly,
protested Serbian atrocities against ethnic Albanian women and
children in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, friends and family say, she became too fearless.
</P>
<P>
   In April _ a month after NATO began airstrikes on Yugoslavia _
Serbian police arrested the woman whom Kosovar orphans
affectionately call ``Mother Flora.'' Brovina reportedly was
beaten, possibly tortured, and is partially paralyzed in a
Yugoslavian prison hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear was never a part of her life,'' said Uranik Begu,
Brovina's son, who last saw his mother almost a year ago. ``That is
why she decided to stay and that is why she is paying with her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Dallas resident and other family members are
waging an international campaign to win Brovina's freedom. A
humanitarian who gave shelter to war orphans and wrote poetry books
that speak passionately about motherhood, suffering and love,
Brovina has become a symbol of ethnic Albanian resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Her case has drawn international attention from human rights
groups, including Amnesty International and the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department is working with the Red Cross and the
United Nations to investigate claims of as many as 3,000 prisoners,
including Brovina, who were taken out of Kosovo before NATO
peacekeepers arrived, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   International support has been great, but more action is needed
to save Brovina's life, said Begu, who moved to Texas to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in a very bad state of health,'' he said. ``In the
United States, I would like a lot more women to raise their voices
because I'm sure she would do the same for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Begu said his mother is important to the peace process because
she could help women heal their psychological wounds without
seeking revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina, 49, was in her apartment April 22 when eight men, some
masked, broke in, handcuffed her, forced her into a car and drove
away, according to Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners freed after the war reported seeing Brovina in the
yard of the prison, said Vjosa Dobruna, a former co-worker of
Brovina's, in a telephone interview from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was beaten and in very bad shape,'' said Dobruna, who
worked with Brovina for 10 years and has been her friend for 19.
``She was walking and other women were helping her walk around.''
</P>
<P>
   Brovina has been charged with ``joining in enemy duties,''
committing ``criminal acts endangering the territorial integrity''
of Yugoslavia and terrorism, the Los Angeles Times has reported.
She is also accused of making sweaters and masks, setting up a war
clinic and serving as the health minister for the Kosovo Liberation
Army, a separatist guerrilla group, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, she could be sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina founded and has served as president of the Albanian
Women's League, a group that advocates emancipation for Albanian
women, since the early 1990s, Begu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would organize studies on culture and arts. But when the
war started, the objectives changed,'' Begu said. ``She organized
first-aid (classes), teaching women to heal wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Brovina was featured as one of Marie-Claire
magazine's Women of the World.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Brovina organized a demonstration in which more
than 7,000 women, each carrying a loaf of bread, marched from
Pristina to Drenica to protest the killings that forced women to
flee their villages and hide in the mountains. The women marched
only 10 kilometers before they were stopped by police, Begu said.
</P>
<P>
   The message to the women was ``that they were not alone, that
they need bread,'' Begu said.
</P>
<P>
   Dobruna said she and Brovina were among several ethnic Albanian
doctors fired from the Central Daily Clinic for Children in
Pristina and replaced by Serbs 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But because Albanian women were denied health care, she and
Brovina continued to work for free, venturing into the mountains
and bringing women back to the clinics.
</P>

   ``They didn't have places to stay. They were there over a year,
even in minus-28-degree temperatures,'' she said. ``Women were
literally dying in the streets.''

<P>
   Through it all, Dobruna said, her friend refused to buckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd say, `I'm doing what I'm doing to help people, so I
don't feel like I have to hide,' '' Dobruna said. ``We lived under
the violence all our lives. We very strangely, but very stupidly,
lost the fear.''

NEW NATIONAL MUSEUM GALLERY REPRISES PACIFIC WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ Two Marines take a break on Guadalcanal;
a B-25 bomber sits ready on the deck of the USS Hornet. A Navy
Wildcat is scavenged for parts. Representations of war in the
Pacific are on display in a new venue.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after millions of TV viewers watched former President
George Bush celebrate his 75th birthday with a safe parachute
landing near Texas A&AMP;M University, hundreds of visitors gathered
around a grainy World War II film clip at the National Museum of
the Pacific War and watched a 20-year-old Bush being rescued from
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   His plane, a torpedo bomber, had been hit by enemy fire while on
a mission to knock out a Japanese communications center on a
Pacific island near Iwo Jima. Bush completed his mission before
parachuting to safety. He was picked up by the submarine USS
Finback. An officer on the sub filmed the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The date was Sept. 2, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very identifiable as a very young George Bush in that
film,'' said Helen McDonald, curator of exhibits and programs at
the Admiral Nimitz Historical Center, which houses the new $3
million National Museum of the Pacific War. The 23,000 square-foot
gallery in which the exhibits are displayed is called the George
Bush Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a piece of the rubber raft he was picked up in,''
she said. ``It was signed by him, and by other pilots who were
picked up by the Finback.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was on hand for the gallery's dedication last week. Among
the visitors was a man who served on the Finback at the time of
Bush's rescue. The two didn't get a chance to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was hustled off to other obligations, but he left a video
message for the thousands of visitors who are expected to see the
battle exhibits from World War II's Pacific theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``This museum is a gift to American citizens,'' Bush says in his
recorded welcoming speech, ``and a window reflecting the
foundations of our modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush explains that he served under Adm. Chester Nimitz, the
Fredericksburg native for whom the complex is named. ``My family
was like millions of Americans, working tirelessly for the war
effort while waiting for the boys to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a thousand artifacts are on display in the Bush Gallery.
They range from the most simple _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur's corncob
pipe _ to an elaborate presentation of a miniature Japanese
submarine lurking off the shore of Pearl Harbor. The display takes
an entire room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That midget submarine, in that particular setting, is very
poignant and telling,'' McDonald said. ``It really sets the stage
for the rest of the exhibit. Pearl Harbor was so far away from
Japan, we really were an unsuspecting nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exhibits are more personal. The museum considers the
acquisition of the goggles and flight helmet of Saburo Sakai
extremely important. Sakai, Japan's leading war ace with more than
60 downed planes to his credit, began building his reputation when
his squadron attacked Clark Field in the Philippines on the same
day that Pearl Harbor was attacked. During the U.S. landing on
Guadalcanal in 1942, Sakai was hit. Blinded in one eye, he flew his
Zero 560 miles back to home base while lapsing in and out of
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the Medal of Honor posthumously awarded to Lt.
Cmdr. Howard Gilmore, who was on his submarine's conning tower when
the ship was hit. Badly wounded, he ordered ``Take her down,''
while he remained on deck. He was lost at sea, but the sub was
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reception to the new gallery has been excellent,''
McDonald said. ``From the veterans, from their families, just the
general public, everyone really seems to be enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary purpose, she said, is to reach a younger audience
and give them a better understanding of the contributions that were
made by the generation of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``That generation had a tremendous impact on us,'' she said,
``and they are fast leaving us. I talked to someone the other day
who said people of that generation are dying at a rate of about
1,500 a day. Soon, they'll be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this museum to keep their memories alive.''
</P>

RED SOX CASTOFF FINDS FAME, STROKE IN SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ The fans are munching dried squid, guzzling potato
vodka, banging noisemakers and screaming like maniacs: ``Woo-ju!
Woo-ju! Woo-ju!'' Up at bat is ``Woo-ju,'' Korea's home-run hero,
otherwise known as . . . Tyrone Woods.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't sound like a Korean name, that's because it
isn't. Woods is a former Boston Red Sox minor league player who
kissed the Pawtucket, R.I., Triple A farm team goodbye in 1997 when
it became clear he wasn't going to make it to Fenway Park. He came
to South Korea for the first season that foreigners were allowed to
play in the Korean major league _ and said hello to fame, fortune,
and a whole new life.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a man who spent a decade struggling in the minor
leagues at home surprised his new audience, his new managers and
himself by becoming the Mark McGwire of Korea _ breaking the home
run record, leading the league in runs batted in, and winning the
Most Valuable Player award. His picture graces the cover of local
sports sections almost daily, more often than the image of
Korean-born Red Sox pitcher Jin Ho Cho. (In Korea he is known as
Cho Jin Ho.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, whatever you do, it seems like it's not
enough . . . I was only a Triple A player and I was never given a
chance to go any farther,'' the 29-year-old first baseman reflected
after driving in the winning run in a game last week. ``This is
their major league, and to come and fit in right away is great.
It's everyone's dream to play in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is an outsider who has become not just an insider, but a
national hero. That is no mean feat in Korea, a society that is
notoriously homogeneous, insular, and suspicious of foreigners.
Like Tom Selleck's character in the movie ``Mr. Baseball'' _ a
ballplayer who goes to Japan and must adapt to new customs _ Woods
has somehow bridged a cultural divide in a country where that gap
is pretty wide.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even the quintessential American sport of baseball has a
uniquely Korean flavor. Vendors don't hawk hot dogs or peanuts;
fans snack on squid jerky (dried, salted slabs of flattened squid),
hard-boiled eggs, sushi, and mint-green dumplings. The only beer
for sale is a low-alcohol variety that, Woods jokes, would take a
whole case to make an American tipsy. No matter; Korean fans prefer
``soju,'' a potent potato-based alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   But even that doesn't explain a ballpark atmosphere that is like
Yankee Stadium's famously rowdy bleachers _ only louder.
</P>
<P>
   The noise is thundering as fans beat together ``bangers,''
sausage-shaped plastic balloons decorated with team logos, going
wild over every base hit. A man in white satin pants, white leather
lace-up knee boots and a whistle leaps up and down on a platform to
fire up the fans. Two men in the official pep brigade bang maroon
drums that look like they came from a high school marching band.
But the biggest attraction for the mostly male, twenty-something
crowd may be the cheerleaders in white short-shorts and sneakers
who dance disco moves nonstop _ in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyrone is home run king!'' shouted Kim Eun Kuk, 30, a computer
engineer, pausing from banging his noisemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Woods appreciates the fans and the cheerleaders (``They're rowdy
the whole game''), but hasn't yet acquired a taste for dried squid
(``It's nasty'') or soju (``It's poison''). And he still thinks the
American custom of having the grounds crew manually rake the
infield in the seventh inning beats the mechanized Korean version _
a golf cart dragging a single rake behind it _ a sort of dirt
Zamboni. But those are superficial differences from playing ball
back home.
</P>
<P>
   Far more important are the social customs of conforming to group
behavior, observing formalities, respecting hierarchy, and keeping
out of trouble. A free spirit like former pro basketball star
Dennis Rodman wouldn't make it here. But Woods, a native of
Brooksville, Fla., and his wife, Cheryl, have managed so
successfully to behave in a ``Korean way'' that they have earned
the respect of their adopted compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   Ha Il Sung, the baseball commentator for Korean Broadcasting
Service, attributes Woods's popularity to his ``Asian style,'' no
less than his ballplaying skills: He never became a snob when he
got good; he is friends with other players; ``and his wife is like
a Korean wife _ she comes to every game to help motivate him; and
she is good with the other wives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Koreans always have distance with foreigners,'' Ha said, ``but
Woods has really given us a good role model and example of a
foreigner.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim In Sik, the manager of Woods's team, the Doosan Bears, says
skill isn't the only key to success for foreigners playing in
Korea. Some former major league players, such as onetime Los
Angeles Dodger Mike Bush, have fizzled here. ``It's more . . . work
ethic and whether you can adjust to Korean lifestyle,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance issue, of course, cuts both ways. Kim admits his
Korean players were at first ``scared'' when they heard two
foreigners were joining Doosan last season. And Woods ``was not
only a foreigner, but a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know what to expect,'' Kim explained. ``Everyone
here has watched TV, but they hadn't met an African-American person
. . . They've seen gangster images, and he's nothing like that.
He's very good-looking, clean cut. They got along with him very
well and brought him into their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Koreans are sometimes accused of racism, not specifically
against blacks but against any non-Koreans. But Woods says he felt
more unspoken bias within the Red Sox organization than he ever has
here. He laughs at his nickname in some Korean papers _ ``the big
black bear'' _ explaining that it's because of his hulking build
and his team's mascot, and that it is intended affectionately in a
country that hasn't yet learned the meaning of ``politically
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods hit 42 homers last year to break the Korean record _ far
short of McGwire's US record of 70. For one thing, the Korean
season is shorter than in the United States _ 126 games versus 162.
It is also true that pitching here is slower, hitting is weaker,
and fielding can be downright raggedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we come out and play Triple A. Other times, we're
just bad,'' Woods admitted with a laugh. As of Monday night, Woods
was batting .310, with 20 homers and 65 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean league was founded in 1982 and has eight teams
sponsored by big corporations such as Doosan, the liquor
conglomerate that owns the Bears. The league has less money to
throw around than the US major leagues, but far more to spend than
the minors. Woods's salary last year jumped meteorically from the
$6,500 a month for six months he made in Pawtucket to over $130,000
a year. This season, his salary more than doubled, but Woods won't
reveal the precise figure in deference to management's wish to
avoid rivalry among players.
</P>
<P>
   After his spectacular season last year, his agent also told him
the Red Sox inquired about his returning to the minors. Woods said
he wasn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have said Woods didn't have the stuff for the majors; he
says they spent two years ``telling me what I wanted to hear _ that
I had a great chance of making it. But it was basically lies,'' he
said with a laugh. ``They told me if someone goes down injured,
you'll be the first up. But people went down hurt all the time . .
. and I was waiting for a call that never came.''
</P>
<P>
   Demoralized by his experience with the Sox, Woods considered
becoming a firefighter. His move to Korea was a last-ditch try at
baseball, but it turned his life around. He has stayed partly for
the money, partly because he loves the country and his team, and
partly because he has become the star he never was at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of makes me feel like Mo Vaughn or Ken Griffey,'' he
said, an electric smile lighting his face. ``The best thing is
feeling appreciated. No matter what you do, the fans and the front
office here are still behind you.''

OPTIMISM ON IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- In Northern Ireland, the Perils of Pauline
character of the peace process is always dramatic, usually serious,
and occasionally dangerous _ as in right now.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also diverting from underlying trends that produce
most of the optimism that still surrounds the contentious
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   To an optimist conditioned by scores of events in the past five
years to look realistically past obstacles _ it is the politicians
in the six counties of the North that are the lagging indicators,
not the people.
</P>
<P>
   It is the people who have demonstrated and then voted for both
nonviolence and a settlement of outstanding political questions.
And it is the people whose religious leaders (most of them) and
economic activities (all of them) are creating a new environment
that will not tolerate a return to the madness of The Troubles that
began in such deadly earnest 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why the latest deadline _ Wednesday _ for political
progress _ imposed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahearn _ is less an ultimatum than a
marker. It is above all an expression by two of the governments
driving this process _ the third, thanks to President Clinton, is
the United States _ of an unwillingness to tolerate querulous
politics by the parties to last year's still-astonishing Good
Friday agreement, and to insist on implementation.
</P>
<P>
   That intolerance was expressed during a visit here last week by
Ireland's deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, the leader of the
junior party in Ahearn's coalition, the Progressive Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always envisaged there would be problems,'' she said in
between official appointments with Clintonites, ``but we cannot
contemplate failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Harney's portfolio in the Ahearn cabinet covers economic
affairs, which makes her an overseer of one of the genuine miracles
in the world today _ an economy that itself has evolved into a
powerful magnet for the North as well as a positive role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone can see what peace can produce, especially
when compared to the effects of 30 years of enormous damage to the
society in the North,'' she said. ``Since the ceasefire in 1994,
even the cross-border trade has been way, way up. The reaction in
the business community to continued progress would be extremely
positive, and many of their leaders are strongly encouraging the
politicians to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the problem is not literally Unionist leader David
Trimble's insistence that Sinn Fein lean on its pals in the Irish
Republican Army to turn in some of their weapons and explosives in
advance of the deadline of next spring that was agreed to last
year; Trimble has insisted on some response to his liking as a
condition for agreeing to let the executive department of the new
government in the North be formed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the core of the problem Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams's
refusal to date to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   As Trimble has said, the core of the problem is diminished
confidence in the peace agreement within his divided community; and
as Adams has said somewhat less directly, the core of the problem
is an unwillingness to push disarmament ahead of schedule in the
absence of confidence that a new political day is in fact dawning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's obviously needed is simultaneous movement on every
side,'' said Harney. ``All sides know what the words mean, but it's
not always the words themselves that matter. It's sometimes
important to go a bit beyond the words to honor the real spirit of
an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Irish official involved in the process said that while
disarming _ they call it by the choice euphemism, decommissioning _
is not a precondition for the establishment of the power-sharing
executive, it is a commitment nonetheless for next May; and, in
that context, it is not unreasonable to push for things that will
establish confidence that the commitment will be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, you could see the parties begin to move. Sinn Fein
was talking about formally declaring ``the war is over'' and not
just halted by a ceasefire. Trimble was talking about oral
commitments to disarm, not necessarily any actual turning in of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And, in addition to quietly encouraging Sinn Fein to take a step
toward the Unionists, the authorities in the North were banning a
major Protestant march this weekend from entering the Catholic part
of Drumcree, for years a flashpoint for violence.
</P>
<P>
   What all those moves share is a realization that the public
wants more progress, less intransigence, and no violence.
</P>
<P>
   We optimists believe the pols understand the message.

pay the entire cost of preventive health care measures such as
mammograms, prostate cancer screening and bone-mass measurements.
Clinton's chief economic adviser says the president opted for the

   INS-RAILKILLER_ As the FBI continues to hunt for suspected
serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the INS is being showered
with questions about how Border Patrol agents let him slip through
their fingers. The answer, according to INS sources, is that no one
was looking for him, and their computerized identification system,
dubbed IDENT, didn't include a red flag to alert agents when
Resendez- Ramirez's fingerprints were scanned after his June 2
apprehension. The IDENT system, according to agents, is set up to
tell them how many times an immigrant has been detained, not to
give them the criminal history of everyone they catch _ it is not
linked to national crime networks like NCIC. Still, a California
agent says the suspected killer's prior deportations should have
caused agents to probe deeper into his past. (Harmon, Austin

poll in August, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is pinning his
presidential hopes on strong showings in New Hampshire and South

the two states, and he returns to New Hampshire today to open a
fresh assault on the nation's campaign finance laws. Defying the
conventional wisdom that campaign finance reform is an issue that
won't sell with Republican voters, McCain will blame Republicans

lard up the budget with pork barrel spending. (Foskett, Atlanta

DOCTORS SEE BRIGHT FUTURE FOR PLASTIC SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the new century, the broadening terrain of
plastic surgery will offer patients not only younger faces and
trimmer torsos, but also fingers grown from cattle cells and organ
parts built on biodegradable scaffolds.
</P>
<P>
   That was the tantalizing possibility put forth Monday by doctors
meeting this week in San Francisco. Some 2,000 plastic surgeons
from around the globe are attending the 12th Congress of the
International Confederation for Plastic, Reconstructive and
Aesthetic Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous increase in medical knowledge,''
said Dr. Ronald Iverson, former president of the American Society
of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, which is hosting the forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians need to know how to assimilate this information,''
Iverson said. ``Every year, we think we've reached a new level of
technology. This meeting gives you wonderful exposure to what is
happening around the world, to an exchange of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Known to some as ``aesthetic correction,'' plastic surgery is a
flourishing industry, with baby boomers by the hundreds of
thousands clamoring annually for face lifts, fat transfers, tummy
tucks and other vanity procedures designed to rejuvenate sags and
bags or whittle unwanted weight. But the field, which of late has
been criticized for a spate of puzzling deaths tied to liposuction,
also encompasses reconstructive work, revising faces deformed by
cleft palates, salvaging severely burned limbs, and rebuilding
breasts lost to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And in coming years it could do much more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Noritaka Isogai, a hand and micro-surgeon from Japan,
unveiled slides showing a partial finger of sorts grown on the back
of a mouse. The specially engineered joint, built using three types
of cells from cattle, could be the precursor to widespread
production of human finger bones and joints, Isogai said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of children who have a congenital deformity and
are missing a finger,'' he said in an interview. ``At this point,
there is no way to reconstruct the finger except through a toe
transplant. There is no other solution. Since we can form a joint
(through tissue culturing), we can form a whole finger. This is my
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Isogai transplanted bovine tissue onto polymer matrices that
were shaped like human finger bones. Then cartilage and tendon
cells from the shoulder of a calf were placed on that ``scaffold.''
</P>
<P>
   The structure was stitched together, then implanted under the
skin of a mouse. In 20 weeks, the tissue grew into the shape and
size of a human digit.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the relatively young field of tissue engineering
could someday be a tool for creating skin, bone, muscle, cartilage,
tendons and nerves, other surgeons said.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue engineering involves transplanting cells onto synthetic
forms where new tissue is generated. Some techniques are now being
tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an evolving concept and field of medicine,'' said Dr.
Michael Yaremchuk, a plastic surgeon with the Massachusetts General
Hospital who is also affiliated with the Plastic Surgery Research
Laboratory under the auspices of Harvard Medical School. ``There is
a limited amount of tissue. ... As plastic surgeons, we have to rob
Peter to pay Paul. Say the patient has a defect in his arm, the
idea is to take a little bit of tissue and grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Yaremchuk said, liver cells could be grown to ``do
the job of the liver. ... Most is still experimental, you have to
take small steps, but the potential is enormous.''

CANCER NO LONGER TAKES CENTER STAGE IN YOUNG MAN'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

 By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's the room of a college kid come home for a
few days in between school and a summer job.
</P>
<P>
   A black Star Wars T-shirt sits on top of a pile of clothes to be
packed. Boxes clutter the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mementos span the years geography wallpaper, action-figure toys
and a photograph of the class that will graduate from Brandeis
University in Waltham, Mass., next year. In the upper right corner
of the picture is Philip Mucci, his brown hair back in a ponytail
looking like the 20-year-old, biology major, ``X-Files'' fan,
I'm-not-sure-what-to-do-after-graduation college student that he
is.
</P>
<P>
   The picture doesn't say cancer survivor. Neither does the
handshake with which Mucci greets a visitor at the front door of
his family's home in Castleton, south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after beating a brain tumor, cancer no longer claims
center stage in Philip Mucci's life.
</P>
<P>
   Mucci is part of the first big wave of childhood cancer
survivors to reach adulthood. He faces a future full of unknowns
from how childhood cancer survivors will age to how radiation
affects the body years after it is used.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors don't know nearly as much about them as they do about
kids in their first years after cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide study of long-term childhood cancer survivors is
under way and may yield some answers. The researchers questioned
13,254 former patients who were treated between 1970 and 1986. They
collected detailed treatment histories, including the total amounts
of drugs the children had been given and what health issues the
survivors have faced since they finished treatment. It is clear
that for many survivors, cancer and the harsh therapies it took to
beat it exact a toll later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Green, a childhood cancer specialist at the Roswell Park
Cancer Institute in Buffalo, has spent 20 years studying cancer
survivors and the effects of various cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Many cancer therapies leave patients sterile, Green said, but
for both men and women who have remained fertile the resulting
pregnancies have largely been normal. Some women who've had
radiation to the pelvis have premature babies. And others who were
treated with certain chemotherapy drugs hit menopause 10 to 15
years early as their diminished egg supplies run out.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood cancer survivors who have been in remission for 15 or
more years are four to five times more likely to develop fatal
health problems than the rest of the population, Green said. The
higher mortality rates are mainly due to recurrences of the
original cancer, treatment-induced cancers and treatment-induced
heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The role of genetics in childhood cancer is a big unanswered
question, said Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that is still unknown is whether the offspring are
at greater risk of developing childhood cancer,'' Green said.
``It'll probably be another two to three years before we have data
on cancer in offspring.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Mucci spends more time thinking about his new job at
a summer camp in Maryland than worrying about his odds.
</P>
<P>
   Mucci spent years staring cancer down. After he got healthy, he
returned to Albany Medical Center to work as an intern, spending a
lot of time with radiologists. He read his medical files something
he wouldn't recommend to everybody. It was hard to come face to
face with his own numbers, the high levels of radiation, the
changing odds of survival. But Mucci read on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard reading all the technical terms that they were
using and reading that I might have died,'' he said. ``But if you
understand something, it is really hard to be afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mucci went to college and majored in biology, thinking he would
go into cancer research. That has changed in the last year or so as
the urge to stare down the monster has given way to the desire to
get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime during college, cancer loosened its grip on Mucci. He
started wearing his shoulder-length hair in a ponytail because he
likes the style even though you can now see the wide horizontal
scar, low on the back of his head, where hair no longer grows. He
recently had surgery to try and correct the damage radiation did to
his hearing.
</P>
<P>
   He has decided to hold off on fertility testing, leaving the
future to sort itself out.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about whether he thinks about the cancer coming back and
Mucci looks you in the eye and with a little smile quotes dialogue
from ``The Empire Strikes Back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Yoda says,'' Mucci explains. ``Always in motion is
the future.''

   ON THE SET OF TODAY: ``Today,'' the first of the morning news
shows when it debuted in 1952, is amazingly dominant in the late

   MIAMI TOUR: Paul George started doing tours for friends in the
late 1970s. By 1983, he was doing it for University of Miami
students. He went ``public'' in 1985, aligned with the historical
association in 1988 and eventually spread out from downtown, doing
tours of places such as Miami Beach's Art Deco district and Coral
Gables. He's done tours of Fort Lauderdale since 1989. And he did
one tour along A1A from Deerfield Beach to Henry Flagler's
Whitehall mansion and museum on Palm Beach. He calls his tours ``a
painless and fascinating way'' to learn history. (Includes 3-column
color photo of Paul George directing a walking tour, 1-column color

Barbara Norfleet. If you don't care for insects, her book ``The
Illusion of Orderly Progress'' will drive you buggy. (Includes
4-column color photo from book and 6-pica color photo of book

<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: OUT FOR GOOD: Now, all these years later, when it

scintillating surprise of the first one, this sequel is definitely
worth your time. (Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)

   BALLOON THERAPY: The question was never if Lora Black would have
a hysterectomy, but when. Medication hadn't curbed the excessive
menstrual bleeding that had made her anemic and disrupted her life.
Her three older sisters had undergone hysterectomies. Now it was
her turn. But when could she take four to six weeks off to recover?
She chose summer but in the months before her operation, Black's
doctor told her about a new alternative to surgery that uses a
heated balloon to burn off the uterine lining _ the source of her
copious bleeding. It sounded good, but the word Black kept having
trouble with was ``new.'' (Includes 3-column color photo of patient
being instructed by doctor.)

   WITH: BUG STUDY: Cellular biologists at the University of
Georgia are hoping to find a cure for Chagas' disease and other

BURGLAR'S TAKE INCLUDES VIAL OF TUBERCULOSIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A vial of tuberculosis bacteria was stolen from
a medical researcher attending a tuberculosis conference here,
prompting the authorities to seek help in finding the missing
container while at the same time saying the public should not be
alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a general health hazard to the people of San
Francisco, but it can be a hazard to the person who has it now or
someone who might open it up,'' said Richard Lee of the San
Francisco Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The container was in a black Eddie Bauer-brand duffel bag stolen
from the hotel room of a researcher from the University of
California at Berkeley. The canister was in an inside pocket of the
bag, which also contained clothing and jewelry, leading the police
to conclude that the burglar was not out to get the bacteria, said
Capt. Ed Springer.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher had planned to exchange the vial with a fellow
researcher from the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The metal canister, marked with a ``biohazard'' label, is about
8 inches long and 3 to 4 inches wide, said Deputy Chief Rich Holder
of the San Francisco police. Inside that, enclosed in plastic
bubble wrap, is a 6-inch-long glass test tube containing gelatinous
material with a whitish substance _ the tuberculosis bacteria _
growing on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   One would have to breathe in the bacteria to become infected,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone opened it, and if they got very close to it, they
could possibly contract tuberculosis,'' he said. Or someone could
come in contact with the bacteria if the vial broke.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone infected with the bacteria might show symptoms in a month
to a year, Lee said. TB attacks mainly the lungs, intestines, skin
and brain. Symptoms include a constant cough, difficulty breathing
and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The police believe that whoever took the bag entered the room
from a side door for there were no signs of forced entry. Asked
whether a hotel staff person could have been involved, Holder
replied, ``That's something we'll look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer said police officers and security personnel at the
Cathedral Hill Hotel searched the building Monday, including all
garbage containers, trying to find the vial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task here today is to make sure we find it before somebody
opens it up,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   TB in the 1990s has returned as a significant health hazard
worldwide, in part because people with AIDS are particularly
susceptible to the disease. Also, strains of tuberculosis that are
resistant to front-line antibiotics are emerging around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, TB was listed by the World Health Organization as the
world's most deadly transmittable disease.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, however, deaths from the disease worldwide dropped. TB
kills fewer than 1,000 people a year in the United States.

NEW COMPANY OFFERS FINANCIAL ADVICE, SHOPPING FOR TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ginger Thomson, who left the financial world
several years ago to raise her three children, has created a Web
site for teens to help them manage money, shop and learn about
investing.
</P>
<P>
   It's called doughNET.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site, doughNET.com, is both parent and teen friendly. The
site lets parents open on-line debit accounts for their children in
amounts such as $50 or $100.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers can shop on line for their favorite products,
including Urban Decay, a hip and edgy line of cosmetics; Alloy
Online, which sells clothes and accessories; and Shop.eonline.com,
which sells movie and television merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to create a free, safe environment for teens and
their families to learn about finance in the real world,'' said
Thomson, 42, doughNET's president and a former banker at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when 10 percent of college students are saddled with
credit card debts of more than $7,000, Thomson hopes a little
education will go a long way.
</P>
<P>
   DoughNET and two similar on-line companies _ RocketCash
(www.rocketcash.com) and I Can Buy (www.icanbuy.com) hope to tap
the vast market of computer-literate youths.
</P>
<P>
   On the doughNET site, teens can learn about personal finance
through tips on how to play the stock market and links to on-line
brokerage companies and mutual funds. Later this year, doughNET
will offer on-line banking services.
</P>
<P>
   Recent articles and services appearing on the doughNET site
include a helpful primer on college loans, a story on career
planning and a calculator that estimates the car price a teen-ager
can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Teens also can donate to their favorite nonprofit causes,
including the Rainforest Alliance, the Humane Society and Youth
Service America.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the nation's 31 million teen-agers regularly
use the Internet, according to Teenage Research Unlimited in
Northbrook, Ill. But will they shop on line until they drop? It may
take a while. Last year, only 1 percent of the $140 billion spent
by teen-agers was spent on line, according to Teen Research.
</P>
<P>
   DoughNET hopes to get its brand name out to youths with a
guerrilla marketing campaign launched recently.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, who earned at master's degree in business
administration from Harvard University, founded doughNET last year
with her 48-year-old husband, Jon Hamren, who earned an MBA at
Stanford. Hamren is a veteran venture capitalist who has worked at
Gateway Partners, Cypress Funds and Sequoia Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Their idea was a hard sell to financiers at first, so the couple
spent $50,000 of their own cash last year to start the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought it was a great idea, but they wondered
whether we could really get it done,'' Hamren said. ``With all the
Internet commerce out there, could we get anybody's attention?''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, they persuaded Labrador Ventures in Redwood
City to pitch in $2 million in seed money in two rounds. Then, just
this month, two venture capital heavyweights _ Mayfield Fund in
Menlo Park and Maveron LLC in Seattle _ invested $7.3 million.
Mayfield has funded more than 300 high-tech companies, while
Maveron is owned by Starbucks Coffee Chairman Howard Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Now, financiers are bullish on doughNET, which hopes to sign on
150,000 users and dozens of new merchants within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   DoughNET predicts that each teen-ager will spend up to $700 a
year on on-line goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that doughNET has a significant opportunity to build
a brand that is relevant to teens and their families,'' said
Zachary Herlick, a partner at Maveron. ``It empowers teens to take
control of their financial lives.''

THE LIVES OF LILLIAN HELMAN 
Produced by: Julian Schlossberg 
Directed by: Phillip Schopper 
On: PBS 
Date: Wednesday, 9 p.m. 
 
DASHIELL HAMMETT. DETECTIVE. WRITER. 
Produced by: Margaret Smilow 
Directed by: Joshua Waletzky 
On: PBS 
Date: Wednesday, 10 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, and what comes to
mind? The tumultuous relationship. Cigarettes dangling from their
mouths, iconically. Booze and more booze. Radical post-war
politics, the infamous Red-hunt and Hellman's timeless 1952 remark
to the House Committee on Un-American Activities: ``I cannot and
will not cut my conscience to fit this year's fashions.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, their lives overshadow their art, and perhaps for good
reason. The work of both prolific playwright Hellman and crime
novelist Hammett is decidedly dated _ although Hammett's stringent
prose in ``The Maltese Falcon'' and elsewhere resonates even now in
the best tough new crime fiction.
</P>
<P>
   So one would have hoped that, while capitalizing on a good
story, the makers of both ``Dashiell Hammett. Detective. Writer.''
and ``The Lives of Lillian Hellman'' would have made serious cases
for the quality of the writers' work. (The hour-long documentaries
air as part of the PBS ``American Masters'' series.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the somewhat more polished Hammett documentary at least
tries to evoke his prose, lets us hear a bit of it, and commends
its qualities in often rather clever phrases of its own. Thus, for
instance, smoky-voiced narrator Kathleen Turner refers to Hammett's
style as ``blue-collar language with white-collar trim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hellman film, however, doesn't even take a stab at serious
literary biography, nor, except for its last few touching minutes,
does it show much flair as celebrity biography. For the most part,
it's a headlong recitation of titles of her plays and movies with
rapid-fire comments about their critical reception and box-office
grosses, and of lean biographical data. After ``The Children's
Hour'' opens to raves in 1934 and is followed by her profitable
bowlderized movie version, we learn that Hellman ``was rich and
famous while the rest of the country was starving.'' She then pens
another play, which fails, travels to Spain during the Spanish
civil war where she does broadcasts under fire, opens another play,
a hit this time, buys a farm in upstate New York, and suffers an
alcoholic depression.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes across as quite this telegraphic and disjointed,
and even the interesting talking heads involved _ friends Norman
Mailer and Jules Feiffer, intimate Peter Feibleman _ are often
edited in such a way as to make the least of their potentially
lively and valuable anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps worst of all (not counting Eli Wallach's
irritatingly mannered narration) is the lack of thoughtful
attention in ``The Lives of Lillian Hellman'' to her complex but
central relationship with Hammett. We hear about it, of course, but
the information is, like so much of this documentary, hurried and
colorless. There is, at least, a legible account of Hellman's
bitter legal action against Mary McCarthy, who publicly called her
a liar, and provocative clips from interviews with Hellman herself.
In one, she describes her later years with Hammett when both were
battered by booze, Hammett nearing death, but Hellman with several
cat's lives left in her resilient little frame. ``It's a very hard
relationship to explain because once the so-called physicality is
gone, usually people break up. We had almost the opposite
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   One is left, finally, with a sense that her notorious toughness
was matched by a capacity for fierce devotion and a never
diminished hunger for life.
</P>
<P>
   But to better appreciate their tattered and oddly devoted love,
see the Hammett hour, which weaves their lives and work into far
more interesting patterns. Hammett's success, if relatively brief,
was stunning, and some of his creations, notably the novel ``The
Thin Man,'' drew imaginatively on his experience with Hellman. When
his own writing failed for good, Hammett functioned as kind of a
muse for Hellman. And ``Dashiell Hammet'' nicely develops his
improbably selfless role as the playwright's mentor. He gave her
the idea and background research for her reputation-securing play,
``The Children's Hour,'' and served as a mercilessly honest and
helpful editor.
</P>
<P>
   With the valuable input of at least three Hammett biographers,
who are given time to shape their interesting ideas about him, the
film makes a case for Hammett's deceptive cultural importance. Of
particular interest is Joan Mellen's claim that Hollywood's durable
ideal of masculinity _ tall, sexy, silent, smart, and heroic but
childlike men _ was modeled on Hammett himself and his fictional
creations.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman and Hammett are such provocative, intriguing characters
that almost anything reasonably accurate and literate about them is
worth a look _ as these documentaries are, especially the Hammett.
Curiously, however, a recent A&AMP;E television movie called ``Dash and
Lilly,'' based on their 30-year relationship but not a strictly
factual account of their lives, is superior to both of these
nonfiction films. It seems more true to the emotional turbulence of
their affair, and skillfully evokes Hammett's role in Hellman's
creative life. Hellman, whom virtually everyone agreed resorted to
creative deceptions if not outright lies in her own popular
memoirs, might have appreciated the irony.

TODAY'S TEEN MAGAZINES MAY BE SENDING MIXED MESSAGES TO GIRLS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanied by BC-TEEN-MAGS-RACK, BC-TEEN-MAGS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On its July cover, YM asks its girl readers to rate their
``Sweetie-Snagging Style.'' Teen magazine enthuses over ``Stars'
Hair Secrets.'' And Twist promises its audience ``The Truth About
Boobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The three B's: boys, beauty and body. Is that all girls think
about these days? Uh, I don't THINK so. And yet the covers of their
favorite magazines are plastered with Day-Glo headlines trumpeting
all three almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for girls have become increasingly vocal about what
they assert are damaging messages perpetuated by magazines for
pre-teen and teen-age girls _ that rail thin is the only acceptable
body type and that a girl's worth is based on how she looks and how
well she attracts boys.
</P>
<P>
   These educators, parents and psychologists have appeared on
television, undertaken research, even started their own magazines
for girls.
</P>
<P>
   But as their concerns have grown, so has the market for teen
publications that stress the three B's. This week's debut of
CosmoGIRL! _ a spinoff of the racy women's magazine _ is unlikely
to appease the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message that is given (in girls' magazines) is so far
afield from the reality of what today's girls look like and what
the variety of their interests happen to be,'' said Whitney
Ransome, co-executive director for the National Coalition of Girls
Schools. ``This is such a narrow view of teen girls, and that's
what bothers us.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls' magazines closely parallel women's magazines in content
and advertising. They focus primarily on fashion and beauty. They
talk a lot about men and boys. The models in the ads and the
layouts are almost universally skinny.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the magazines do tackle topics like sexuality and health
in a straightforward, honest manner, but often the written messages
about body image and physical appearance contradict the magazine's
visual content, says Teresa Thompson, a professor of communications
at the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   This past winter, Thompson's class on women and communication
analyzed the content of 90 issues of various teen magazines. The
students, Thompson reports, found ``token'' remarks encouraging
girls to accept their body shapes, ``a nod to empowerment''
outweighed by the emphasis on getting a guy, and ``an occasional
comment'' about eating disorders juxtaposed with ads full of
waiflike models.
</P>
<P>
   This last criticism is especially significant: A recent Brigham
Young University study concluded that media images of women
perpetuate eating disorders in girls, though the images aren't the
sole cause of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``To these young women who are at risk, some of these beauty and
fashion magazines can be as dangerous as giving a beer to an
alcoholic,'' researcher Steven Thomsen noted.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines are far from the only medium girls look at, but a 1997
study by Children Now found that 24 percent of 10- to 17-year-olds
read fashion magazines ``very often.'' The report examined the four
top teen magazines in the fall of 1996 and discovered that 35
percent of the articles focused on dating; only 12 percent looked
at school or careers. Thirty seven percent of the articles dealt
with appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a fashion and beauty magazine, and in a fashion and
beauty magazine you show clothes and makeup,'' said Roberta Caploe,
executive editor of Seventeen magazine. Fourteen million girls read
the publication each month partly because they aspire to be
fashionable, and ``I don't think there's anything wrong with
that,'' Caploe said. ``The magazine is only reflecting what's going
on in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen debuted in 1944 and has survived by changing. It used
to have a monthly feature devoted to wedding planning, and its
articles coached girls on the ladylike way to exit a car.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, last month's issue included an essay by Jamie Byrd,
who wrote about her father James Byrd's racially motivated murder
in Jasper, and the Sex and Body column answered the question, ``Can
you get AIDS from oral sex?''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the magazine began using plus-size models (size
10 and up) in its regular fashion spreads. (Other girls magazines
such as Girl and Jump do the same.)
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the competition really puts a lot of emphasis on
getting a guy,'' Caploe said, ``but we feel other things are
equally important in a young woman's life: friends, school, having
a sense of the world at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen and its competitors regularly tackle serious issues:
international refugee crises, AIDS and date rape, for instance. The
magazines also encourage girls to read, notes Robert Butterworth,
the child psychologist behind Teen magazine's Ask a Guy column.
</P>
<P>
   Some magazine content, he says, may even help teens from various
backgrounds better understand one another. Plus, ``they're getting
stuff (about sex and relationships) their parents might not be
talking to them about.'' Butterworth further emphasizes that his
columns never suggest that girls take a back seat to boys.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most recent issue of Teen is a virtual hunk fest,
filled with photos of boy bands and features like ``What's His Love
Style?'' ``Who's That Babe?'' and ``Dumped? How to Deal.'' The June
Seventeen cover announces ``Guywatch: Meet them, schmooze them,
snag them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think girls need accurate information,'' said Nancy Gruver,
publisher of New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams.
``But if that one piece of valuable information is couched in 180
pages of sexual innuendo about `What do boys find sexy?' that's
where I have the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when her twin daughters were 11 years old, Gruver
created New Moon, an ad-free magazine run by girls. An editorial
board of 17 8- to 14-year-olds chooses cover art, picks stories and
decides which letters to the editor to publish.
</P>
<P>
   The bimonthly based in Duluth is far from flashy, but its goal
is to promote empowerment through intellectual and creative
pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My passion is to help girls tell the world who they are,''
Gruver said, ``instead of letting (the culture) tell girls the way
they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ransome believes it would be unfair to girls _ who have
legitimate interests in their appearance during adolescence _ and
unrealistic for parents to pry teen magazines out of their
daughters' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she says, talk with girls about the publications
they're reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to become savvy media analysts and know how to
look at these stories as well as the pictures and be able to
critique them on a reality meter,'' said Ransome, who encourages
girls to ``take issue'' with how they are portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write letters to the editor, start your own campaign,'' she
added. It will take more than a handful of complaints from parents
and educators, Ransome said, to persuade publishers to change their
recipe for success.

   CosmoGIRL!
</P>
<P>
   No cleavage on the cover! Cosmopolitan has curbed its infamously
titillating tone for this new spinoff. Heavier on the topic of boys
than Seventeen, with lots more star-gazing, too (celebrity
romances, style, makeup, a fold-out calendar with their birthdays).
A brief article explains why having a boyfriend isn't that
important; another tells the story of a model who recovered from
anorexia nervosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message, through advice, inspiration and scoop is that our
reader can be all that she desires to be,'' says Atoosa Rubenstein,
the mag's 27-year-old editor, in the press kit. ``This is what
distinguishes CosmoGIRL! from other teen-age titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Doesn't look all that different to us. But then again,
we're not 14.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Girl
</P>
<P>
   A girl-centered style magazine that features full-figured models
in almost all fashion spreads. A story about hair removal ends with
a bold ``Reality Check!'' reminding girls that body hair is
``completely natural and normal.'' Debuted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Girls' Life
</P>
<P>
   A down-to-earth mag for younger girls with very little celebrity
fawning and an entire page devoted to books. The June/July issue's
Last Laugh feature is a hysterical roundup of ``Deep Thoughts from
Supermodels.'' Debuted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Honey
</P>
<P>
   A stylish and sophisticated magazine aimed at college-age
African-American women. Heavy on fashion and relationships, with
several substantive articles, including one on female genital
mutilation. Debuted in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Jump
</P>
<P>
   This month's issue features a refreshing four-page swimsuit
spread with all ``plus size'' (meaning size 10 and up) girls.
Heavier on boys, makeup and celebs than Girls' Life and Girl.
Debuted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   LatinGirl
</P>
<P>
   With departments like Mi Barrio, in which girls write about
their lives, this new mag has some meat on it. There's moderate
concentration on boys, more on fashion and beauty, a books page and
heavy focus on Hispanic pop culture. Debuted in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MXG (MoxieGirl)
</P>
<P>
   A sly combo of catalog and magazine in which every item pictured
can be ordered through a toll-free number run at the bottom of each
page. Light on the ``boyz'' stuff, with a story in the latest issue
about plus-size model Mia Tyler. Debuted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   New Moon
</P>
<P>
   Edited by a staff of 8- to 14-year-olds. Accepts no advertising,
and most graphics are illustrations. The May/June issue has stories
about the Japanese art of shodo and an interview with
African-American filmmaker Julie Dash. Debuted in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen
</P>
<P>
   The grande dame of teen magazines has added plus-size models to
some fashion spreads, offers fiction and often stories that tackle
weighty issues. Heavy on fashion, with a moderate amount of
boy-centered material and straight talk about sex. Debuted in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Teen
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Girl, Teen's hair-removal headline tells girls ``you
can't be carefree unless your skin is smoothly hair-free.'' Loads
about boys in the July issue, along with a story on teen-age
abductions (and how to stay safe). Debuted in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Teen People
</P>
<P>
   Ever heard of something called People magazine? Swap Whitney
Houston for Britney Spears, and you've got Teen People. Debuted in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Twist
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight pages of celebrity gossip, hunky boys, romance
advice, pop culture and fashion. A graphic asking ``Is he
summer-fling material?'' tells girls to ``dis'' a guy if ``he
drives his parents' minivan.'' Debuted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   YM (Young &AMP; Modern)
</P>
<P>
   This month's quiz asks ``Do you have a sexy personality?'' and
the Babe Watch section checks out ``Surfer Studs.'' That's balanced
with results from the love and marriage poll and a feature on a
girl born with a facial deformity. Debuted in 1940 as Calling All
Girls, changed to YM in 1966 (which stood for Young Miss until
1989).

SACRE BLEU! AMERICANS DISCOVER DISCO `MUSIQUE'
</HEADLINE>

By MALCOLM MAYHEW

<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with a breath of fresh Air.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a French duo called Air released one of 1998's most
critically acclaimed CDs, ``Moon Safari,'' a techno-meets-lounge
effort that, critics wrote, was a refreshing change of pace from
typical pop music.
</P>
<P>
   Music listeners seemed to think so, too: The disc wound up
selling more than a half-million copies _ and that was on this side
of the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing what happened when Nirvana was unearthed in Seattle, the
discovery of Air has drawn a degree of attention to France's
dance-music scene, which has been bubbling since the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   But now, thanks to Air's success, and a recent Billboard
charting of French duo Les Nubians, French dance acts are garnering
attention from wider audiences. Is France the next Seattle? In its
own unique way, it already is _ and has been for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where some of the most exciting electronic music is
being made right now,'' says Booth Beckett, a manager at Dallas'
Core Records, an independent record shop that specializes in dance
music. ``America is known for dance music, but the French stuff has
been on a different level. Some of it is just phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett says that although Air and Les Nubians _ a rhythm and
blues-flavored duo whose debut, ``Princesses Nubiennes,'' recently
cracked Billboard's 200 chart _ have grabbed the attention, the
real stars of France's dance-music scene are a circle of artists
who merge '70s funk with '90s grooves for a formula they like to
call ``French disco.''
</P>
<P>
   The forefathers of this sound: Daft Punk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daft Punk is one of the main reasons (French acts) are getting
all this exposure,'' Beckett says, commenting on a recent Spin
magazine article on French groups and MTV offshoot M2's playing of
French bands' videos. ``They were one of the first (groups) to dig
up old funk riffs. They laid the groundwork for a lot of what's
going on over there today.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft Punk is a two-man operation made up of Guy-Manuel de
Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. They are as popular as they are
low-key: They shy away from interviews but perform to sell-out
crowds in their homeland. Their bestselling CD, ``Homework,'' has
sold more than a million copies but was made on a modest budget _
and in their homes. During photo shoots, they wear disguises.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because they don't want to sell out,'' Beckett says.
``They don't want to be known. That's the cool thing about them _
they're getting more and more popular with mainstream music fans,
but people in the underground still like them, because they've kept
their integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that have followed Daft Punk's lead include
Stardust (actually a Daft Punk offshoot), Cassius, DJ Cam, Kid
Loco, La Funk Mob and Motorbass. French record labels _ many of
which, such as Source and Roulette, are owned or partially owned by
artists _ sell their records by the ton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few labels on this side of the globe to distribute
records by French disco acts is Astralwerks, also home to techno
heroes the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad, Astralwerks' Dan Cohen says, that more U.S. labels
aren't releasing efforts by these groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bands in France that are selling tons of records
that never get released in America,'' says Cohen, the label's
national director of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's understandable,'' he says. ``French music hasn't had
the best reputation. There wasn't much that people were going nuts
about until (these artists) came along. But now a lot of big U.S.
producers are into it, and that's helped get their music translated
in America. It also legitimizes them before they even take a step
on these shores.''
</P>
<P>
   Astralwerks has played a major role in exposing French disco
artists to U.S. audiences. Astralwerks compilations, such as
``Source Material'' and ``Respect Is Burning,'' featured tracks by
French artists that eventually made it to U.S. dance clubs and
dance-music airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the label's most significant releases has been a recent
one: ``1999,'' the latest CD by Cassius, a supergroup made up of
members of other French groups (and no, ``1999'' is not a Prince
cover). ``They're pretty much `It' right now,'' Cohen says.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Cassius is so popular is that fans of this
genre of music recognize the names of the other acts that Cassius
members are involved in: La Funk Mob and Motorbass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works a lot like hip-hop does over here,'' Cohen says.
``The names of the band members are recognizable, so it's gonna
sell well.''
</P>
<P>
   Like America's hip-hop scene, the people involved in it support
one another, performing on and/or producing each other's records.
That's one difference between France's dance music scene and
America's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, as far as dance music goes, everyone competes,''
says Beckett. ``In France, they work with each other. This is the
first time France has been recognized for putting out quality
music, so everyone's supporting each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to new French music than French disco, says
Celia Faussart, half of the sister duo Les Nubians (the other
sister: Helene). Celia says that although she supports French
disco, she'd hate for it to get singled out and overshadow France's
music scene as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind America, France is the second-biggest country for
hip-hop,'' she said in a recent phone interview. ``There's a
hip-hop scene, rock and world music scene. It's not just dance
music. We have a great pop scene here.''

   _
</P>
<P>
   1. DAFT PUNK, ``Homework'': Three years old, this wonderfully
mesmerizing disc _ full of hypnotic dance grooves and funky samples
_ still sounds as fresh as it did in 1996, when French disco was
just taking off. This record helped lay the groundwork for what
French dance music is today.
</P>
<P>
   2. CASSIUS, ``1999'': This is what French dance music is today.
Cassius is sort of like French disco's Garbage: It's made up of two
producers, Hubert Blanc-Francard and Philippe Zdar, who, like the
rhythm section of Garbage, decided to start their own band.
``1999'' is a wildly varied culmination of the different genres
Zdar and Francard have toyed with, from hip-hop to funk to house.
</P>
<P>
   3. AIR, ``Moon Safari'': Although not exactly dance music,
``Moon Safari'' is groove-driven, with an ambient, loungey
undertone. Good chill-out music.
</P>
<P>
   4. VARIOUS ARTISTS, ``Respect Is Burning Vol. 2'': If you want a
broad taste of French disco, go here. The second volume of
Astralwerks' now hard-to-find ``Respect Is Burning'' compilation
features tracks by Stardust, Deejay Punk-Roc, Francesco Grant and
several others.
</P>
<P>
   5. VARIOUS ARTISTS, ``Source Material'': French label Source has
been chronicling French disco for several years now; this
collection of tracks from artists like Phoenix, Sebastien Tellier
and Ernest Saint Laurent, among others, is a good place to start.

   Clueless about how to act French while dancing to French disco?
You're lucky you have us to help. Here's a quick primer:
</P>
<P>
   1. Well, speak French. Your local community college surely
offers summer courses in French, such as French grammar, elementary
French, and reading in French. Make the call.
</P>
<P>
   2. Wear a beret. In the wintertime, they're available at most
department stores. In the summertime, your best bet's gonna be
someplace like an Army-Navy store that specializes in military
clothes, including military berets. They go for $6-$14.
</P>
<P>
   3. At the bar, order a Pernod or Ricard, French
anisette-flavored liqueur drinks. Most bars have 'em.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sneer. Smoke clove cigarettes. Act superior. Pretend you
don't understand anyone speaking English. Yeah, we know that's a
stereotype, but then again, we've recently been to Paris.

A STANDARD OF THE AMERICAN SHORE GETS CITIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
  This is the sixth of eight columns by Thomas Keller, the chef and
owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif. His collaborator

<P>
   Every summer, Mom took us to visit my aunt and uncle, who owned
a tavern in Gambrills, Md. There, we ate soft-shell crab
sandwiches: blue crabs just after they had molted, fried and served
on two slices of bread with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. I
still love the multi-flavored, textural experience of a soft-shell
crab sandwich _ the crispy shell, the meaty interior and the
flavorful mustard, tomalley and roe.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to serve a version of the sandwich in the restaurant,
and the trick was how to reinterpret this great rustic classic as
something appropriate for people expecting to eat highly refined,
French-inspired food.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be easy. Instead of white bread, I use a round
of toasted brioche, rich and delicious. Tomato confit _ wedges of
slowly roasted tomato transformed into intense bursts of flavor _
takes the place of the sliced raw tomato. Arugula is the lettuce,
though any sharp Asian green or cress will provide a peppery
counterpoint to the sweet crab.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce is still a tartar sauce, but one that is made with
hard yolks, cornichons and shallots, and refined by a tiny dice of
colorful vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   I trim the crab to make its shape a little more elegant and
proportionate to the brioche round. And I always check the quality
of the crab; the shell should be no more resistant than silk
(though if the shell is hard it can be removed and discarded).
</P>
<P>
   And that's all there is to it _ the soft-shell crab sandwich
with tartar sauce, lettuce and tomato, as haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   CHESAPEAKE BAY SOFT-SHELL CRAB SANDWICH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes

   1 tablespoon minced shallot
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers
</P>
<P>
   6 soft-shell crabs, cleaned and trimmed of legs except for claws
</P>
<P>
   All-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Clarified butter for sauteing crabs (optional)
</P>
<P>
   6 brioche rounds, 2\ inches in diameter and \ inch thick,

</P>
<P>
   6 pieces tomato confit, at room temperature (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup baby arugula, or thinly shredded arugula leaves.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare sauce: Fill a medium saucepan half full of water;
bring to a boil. Prepare an ice bath by filling a large mixing bowl
with water and ice. In a small strainer, combine carrots, turnips
and leeks. Submerge strainer in the boiling water about 10 seconds,
then plunge into the ice bath a few seconds. Drain vegetables on
paper towels. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In the container of a blender, combine egg yolks, broth,
cornichon liquid and mustard. With machine running, slowly drizzle
in { cup canola oil to emulsify. Transfer to a small bowl, and add
blanched vegetables, cornichons, shallot, parsley and salt and
pepper to taste. Refrigerate up to 2 days; bring to room
temperature before serving.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare capers: Pat dry with paper towels. In a very small
saucepan over medium-low heat, heat about 2 inches canola oil to

salt and pepper to taste. Dredge crab bodies and claws in flour,
shaking off excess.
</P>
<P>
   5. In a large skillet over medium heat, add clarified butter or
canola oil to a depth of [ inch. Place crab bodies shell side down
in the skillet, and adjust heat so crabs sizzle but the butter or
oil does not pop. Saute crab bodies until they are golden brown and
crusty, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn bodies, and add claws. Turn the claws
after about 1 minute. Cook about 2 more minutes. Remove crabs, and
drain on paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, place a spoonful of sauce in the center of each of
six serving plates. Center a brioche round on the sauce, and top it
with a crab body. Place a piece of tomato confit on top of each
body, folded if necessary, and finish with a stack of baby arugula.
Sprinkle each dish with fried capers. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   TOMATO CONFIT
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2\ hours
</P>

   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 whole ripe tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Fresh thyme sprigs.
</P>
<P>
   1. Fill a medium saucepan half full of lightly salted water, and
bring to a boil. Prepare an ice bath by filling a large mixing bowl
with ice and water. Cut and discard cores from tomatoes, and cut a
shallow ``X'' through the skin on the bottom of each. Drop tomatoes
into boiling water for a few seconds, then transfer to ice bath.
Peel tomatoes and cut into quarters through the stem, or if large
cut into 6 pieces. Remove remaining pulp or seeds to leave a smooth
tomato petal.
</P>
<P>

IN FRANCE, A RUMBLE IS HEARD: `VIVE GALLO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ For an American winemaker, France is the belly of the
beast, a virtually impenetrable market. From Bordeaux to Burgundy,
from Champagne to Beaujolais, American wines are about as popular
as some new strain of vine-eating bug.
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't learn that by talking with Michael Novy, a
breezy, 32-year-old Chicagoan charged with nothing less than
establishing the wines of Ernest and Julio Gallo in France. While
his reception often has been about as warm as that accorded the
Americans who stormed the Normandy beaches 55 years ago, Novy is
confident that he, and the giant California winery he represents,
will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo has had considerable success in the rest of Europe. After
little more than a year in Germany, its 1998 sales there were a
million cases. Gallo wines also have a modest presence in Belgium,
the Netherlands and Scandinavia. And its sales in Great Britain
last year came to some two million cases.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular Gallo labels overseas are Turning Leaf and the
Ernest &AMP; Julio Gallo Wine Cellars. In European markets, Gallo
advertising emphasizes the Gallo family heritage, tapping into the
Old World respect for family ties and for elders.
</P>
<P>
   In France, striving for a youthful image, the company focuses
its advertising on Gina and Matt Gallo, Julio Gallo's
grandchildren, the third generation in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Novy and his team set up shop in France just a year ago in
Boulogne-Billancourt, just outside Paris, after studying the market
for quite some time. ``We were really surprised,'' he said. ``We'd
been lead to believe that the French were unalterably opposed to
non-French wine. What we discovered was that about 10 percent of
all French wine drinkers would like to try something else.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was targeting the 25-to-40-year-old consumer with
disposable income, a yen for travel and a taste for American movies
in English. Turned away by some of the major French wine
distributors, Gallo got a more encouraging response from
supermarket chains like Auchan, Casino and Carrefour.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, poor vintages and wines from marginal
regions were dismissed by Frenchmen as ``supermarket wines.'' Now,
some of the most prestigious winemakers, including famous Bordeaux
chateaus and small Burgundy estates, are not unhappy seeing their
labels on supermarket shelves. Which has not always made things
easier for Novy and Gallo. Some supermarkets have ordered him to
remove his wines after only a few days on display because they
weren't selling.
</P>
<P>
   Novy said Gallo's immediate goals were modest. Fewer than 2,000
cases were sold in France last year, and he hopes to sell about
5,000 cases in 1999. Not much for a company that produces some 75
million cases of wine and spirits a year. But Novy is undeterred.
``It will take us 5 to 10 years'' to see a return on investment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo may be the best-known American winemaker trying to open up
the French market, but there are others. American wine exports last
year totaled about $530 million, most of it to Canada. Exports to
France totaled only about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   If France is a particularly tough market to crack, the reason
has more to do with economics than chauvinism. Even though the
French drink more wine than anyone else _ more than 16 gallons a
person a year, compared with just under 2 gallons a person in the
United States, according to Impact, a trade publication _ wine
consumption in France has fallen steadily since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Recent figures show that more than half of all French adults
drink no wine at all. Each year millions of gallons of surplus
French wine are converted to alcohol and burned.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Bordeaux wines that sell for astronomical prices and
make headlines account for only 2 percent of Bordeaux's production;
the amount of expensive Burgundy, compared with France's total
output, is even smaller.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful, resourceful competitor like Gallo is understandably
viewed with alarm. Not by Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, perhaps, but
by dozens of major producers of average table wines.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the French image of American wine could change
rapidly. Since a now-historic blind tasting in Paris in 1976, when
French experts preferred some relatively unknown California wines
to some of the most famous Bordeaux, French winemakers have had
considerable respect for American wines.
</P>
<P>
   Young French winemakers regularly apprentice at California
wineries, and it's no secret that many prominent Bordeaux wine
producers now make their wines in the less tannic, earlier-maturing
California style. Many other winemakers, particularly in the south
of France, have adopted the American practice of identifying wines
by their grapes, rather than by the place from which they come.
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on Gallo's initial moves into the French market,
the newspaper Le Monde noted that Gallo, the largest winery in the
world, has a long-standing relationship with Wal-Mart, the largest
retailer in the world, and that the two were working together in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart recently acquired Asda Group PLC, Britain's
third-largest supermarket chain, which can only strengthen Gallo's
position there. Wal-Mart has as yet no position in France, but the
moves in Germany and Britain leave little doubt that Gallo intends
to be a major participant in the wine business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here for the long term,'' Novy said, and it's evident
that Gallo has the means to be patient. The company had an
estimated $1.2 billion in sales in 1998, which, Le Monde noted, is
a little more than was sold by the entire Bordeaux wine exporting
business. &QL;

FOR NOW, BUSH SKIRTS SOME GOP OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush
appears to be keeping its distance from former California Gov. Pete
Wilson and some of his key strategists as the Texan tries to spread
his message of inclusiveness in California.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the state's most successful Republican in recent years,
was dubbed a compassionate conservative years before Bush. He won
four straight elections in a state dominated by Democrats and he
knows how to squeeze cash out of the tightest wallets. Most of the
state's most astute GOP political strategists are intimately
connected to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   But the former governor and his inner circle carry unwieldy
baggage. Wilson was a major supporter of Proposition 187, the
anti-illegal immigrant ballot initiative blamed for scaring away
Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and hurting the 1998
gubernatorial campaign of former California Attorney General Dan
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it would do Bush any good to be publicly seen
hanging around with Wilson,'' said Mark Petracca, chairman of the
political science department at the University of California at
Irvine. ``Bush's hope to win the presidency _ and this is already
showing in the opinion polls _ rests on his ability to attract a
key minority group of voters to eat into the base support of the
Democratic Party. One key group is certainly Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Goodman, Bush's California adviser who worked in Wilson's
communications office for three years, rejects the notion that the
former governor or his people are being excluded from the campaign,
saying the people who want to help offer ``an embarrassment of
riches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about going back to the Nixon days, the Reagan
days, the Deukmejian days, to the Wilson days and the Lungren
campaign, all of whom we hope to be part of a massive campaign,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to smooth the Republican Party's hard edges by
defining himself as a compassionate conservative without distancing
himself too far from the GOP's powerful right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has had no visible role in Bush's campaign, although
campaign sources say Wilson may eventually be named an honorary
co-chairman. Wilson hasn't even decided whether he'll endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this juncture, there are a number of presidential
candidates who have either met personally or spoken with (Wilson)
on the phone seeking his support and advice on the state,'' said
Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh. ``The governor has not decided to
endorse any specific candidate, but there are a couple who have
impressed him greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson handed over the governor's office to Democrat Gray Davis
in January after serving two terms. Wilson's tough position on
illegal immigration is blamed for alienating Hispanic voters in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bush has spent five years as governor courting
Hispanics. He traveled to Mexico frequently, and won nearly half
the Hispanic vote in his re-election last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a message that speaks to the values that the
Hispanic community can understand,'' Bush said after arriving
Monday night in San Diego. ``I've done a good job in Texas in
reaching out to the Hispanic community. I intend to do the same
thing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers believe that it would harm Bush to shun
the former California governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why Governor Bush wouldn't be reaching out more
aggressively to Wilson and to the people around him, but it would
be a very smart thing to,'' said Dan Schnur, a former Wilson
spokesman who recently took a job with another Republican
presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Goodman, other former Wilson officials have joined the
front-running Bush campaign. Bush has brought aboard Eloise
Anderson, Wilson's social services director, and Ann Veneman,
Wilson's secretary for food and agriculture, to his statewide
leadership team. Another California co-chair is Gerald Parsky, a
Wilson appointee to the University of California regents.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson spoke to Bush to discuss California politics after Wilson
decided not to enter the presidential race earlier this year. Some
of Wilson's chief advisers have been informally contacted by the
Bush campaign. And Wilson's closest confidant, former chief of
staff Bob White, is helping raise money for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But some top members of the Wilson team haven't yet moved to the
Bush camp. They include Schnur and Wilson's husband-and-wife
communications team, Kim and Sean Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign so far has avoided Lungren's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said the campaign had received more requests than they
could handle from people wanting to work for them, and ``one of the
things this campaign is not doing right now is paying for expensive
consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jim Brulte, a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga and a
Bush supporter, said: ``If you know anything about George W. Bush,
and his style and his campaigning, he is inclusive by nature.''

PRESERVING THE BEST OF EACH SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's face it: Great-Grandma would not recognize home canning
today. For most of us, it's not driven by the need to fill the
pantry before the onset of winter (or a fear of Y2K problems), nor
is it much of a money-saver.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving and pickling have largely become recreational
activities: to put up a few jars of homemade strawberry jam or
peach preserves when these fruits are at their peak, to be able to
serve our own bread-and-butter pickles to friends and family and to
know exactly what ingredients go into what we eat. This approach to
canning inspired Anne Gardon, who lives on a farm in Quebec, to
write ``Preserving for All Seasons'' (Firefly Books, $24.95,
paper). She also took the book's stunning photographs.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction, she explains that she used to spend all
summer canning and preserving, but now she is more relaxed,
preparing jams, pickles, sauces, chutneys, herb mixes and the like
with seasonal produce throughout the year. ``I eat my preserves
within a few weeks or a few months, instead of keeping them for
later,'' she writes, which makes preserving less of a chore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her recipes are for smaller quantities than in many home
canning guides, so you can make preserves without having your
kitchen look like a subsidiary of Smucker's. And though Ms. Gardon
packs her jams, pickles and sauces in sterilized jars, she usually
refrigerates or freezes them, making processing them in a boiling
water bath or pressure-canner unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The book touches on the safety factor, but not in the kind of
detail you find in the heavy-duty home-canning books, or the
manuals published by the Agriculture Department or the canning-jar
companies. To be on the safe side, a less-experienced canner should
plan to refrigerate the pickles, preserves and chutneys.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ms. Gardon's recipes contain enough acid (vinegar) or
sugar to make spoilage unlikely. The results can be refrigerated
and used in a relatively short time, within about three months,
further minimizing any risk. Ms. Gardon recommends freezing some
jams and condiments, like a chutney, but doesn't say for how long;
I think six months would be the limit.
</P>
<P>
   But I was surprised that the recipes for seasoned oils, which
are low-acid and not processed, did not specify refrigerating them.
(At minimum, they can spoil if they are not. At room temperature,
oil flavored with some seasonings, like fresh garlic, can provide a
breeding ground for toxins.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Preserving for All Seasons'' offers some good tips, like
selecting citrus fruits with thick skins for the most tender
candied peels, and not discarding the seeds from fresh hot chilies,
as most recipes require, but saving, drying and grinding them for
later use as a seasoning.

   Danzante Sangiovese 1997, Le Marche, Italy. About $10.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time we all got a break, and here it is: a really
delicious Italian wine, widely distributed and at a great price.
This is yet another fruitful result of the combined talents of the
Robert Mondavi Winery in California and the Frescobaldi family in
Tuscany. This one, from the point of view of the average wine
buyer, really makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   The sangiovese grape is usually associated with Tuscany and
Chianti wine, of which it is the chief component. But good
sangiovese can be found all over north and central Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Marches, the coast region east of Tuscany and Umbria,
produces excellent wines from the grape, and this is one of them.
It's a rich wine with lots of fruit, and it's ready to drink now.
Danzante, by the way, is Italian for dancing. &QL;

BEETS FOR SKEPTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commercial canners probably don't want you to know this, but
beets can be eaten raw, and they're delicious. They're not as
approachable as an apple, but my suspicion is that even beet-haters
will like them raw in this salad. Uncooked beets are less sweet and
earthy than they are when boiled or roasted.
</P>
<P>
   To eat a beet raw, you have to peel it and shred it. The first
step is easiest with a regular vegetable peeler. I do the second
with the metal blade of a food processor, pulsing the machine on
and off until the beets are finely cut. You could use the shredding
blade, but it isn't any easier or better. Or you could use a manual
grater, but only if you're interested in an upper-body workout.
</P>
<P>
   Beets are messy, so this is a job best done near the sink, where
utensils can be washed quickly. Wear an apron or previously stained
clothing. After the peeling and grating, this wonderful salad can
be thrown together in about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their sweetness, raw beets really should be tossed
with a very sharp dressing, one that you might otherwise consider
too strong. More vinegar than oil is unusual for a vinaigrette, but
each time I made this salad I changed the ratio. I began with 2
parts oil to 1 part vinegar and ended up with 2 parts vinegar to 1
part oil. I also use more mustard and shallots than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Dill is a traditional partner for beets, and it won't do any
harm here. But stronger herbs are better, like a few leaves of
tarragon or rosemary, or a good handful of chopped parsley.
</P>
<P>
   If you just can't resist cooking beets, once they're shredded,
they can be quickly sauteed in butter or oil. They become
completely tender in less than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   RAW BEET SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound beets
</P>
<P>
   1 large shallot
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or other good strong vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley, dill, chervil, rosemary or tarragon.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel the beets and the shallot. Combine them in the bowl of a
food processor fitted with the metal blade, and pulse carefully
until the beets are shredded; do not puree. (Or grate the beets by
hand and mince the shallots; combine.) Scrape into a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toss with the salt, pepper, mustard, oil and vinegar. Taste,
and adjust seasoning. Toss in the herbs, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

`WILD, WILD WEST': GADGETS, BOND GIRLS AND MEN IN CHAPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest inevitability to hit the movie screen has its
blockbuster credentials firmly in place: Will Smith, July 4th
weekend, ``Men in Black'' director, swell gadgets, huge Erector set
toy spider, chart-bound hip-hop title song behind the closing
credits. Not to mention cheesecake (Salma Hayek in a corset),
comical cross-dressing (Kevin Kline in a corset) and enough
schoolboy double-entendres to bring out the 11-year-old in the most
circumspect sage.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the collective effect of this Pavlovian bonanza is
bound to be a hot-weather, opening-weekend stampede in the
direction of ``Wild Wild West.'' But this is another big, lavish
movie with no there there. Ruled by increasingly ghoulish special
effects, it leaves reality so far behind that its storytelling
would be arbitrary even by comic-book standards, and its characters
share no common ground or emotional connection. It cares far more
about herding audiences into theaters than about what they hear or
see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' is hard to categorize, a quality not to be
confused with originality. It begins on a James Bond note despite
its post-Civil War time period, then segues into contraption-heavy
science fiction and ultimately a ``Godzilla''-style battle with a
mechanical monster. Into this same blender are thrown a maimed
Confederate villain with Nazi stylistic flourishes, elaborately
antiquated railroad scenes and enough crafty, kiddie-minded
pratfalls to make one wonder whether the film really had to begin
with a whorehouse sequence. All in all, acid indigestion for the
soul.
</P>
<P>
   In the quaint old days of ``Hudson Hawk'' and ``Howard the
Duck,'' the film that senselessly grafted together such a
smorgasbord of styles was a fluke. Now, amid a wave of uncommonly
slapdash summer movies, the stylistic grab bag looks like the
status quo, and the movie that actually makes sense is the freak
occurrence. As ``Wild Wild West'' begins, it's clear that there's
no danger this latest film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld will fall
into the latter category.
</P>
<P>
   With his acerbic ``Addams Family'' comedies, the Elmore Leonard
edge in ``Get Shorty'' and the deadpan alien humor of ``Men in
Black,'' Sonnenfeld could anchor his own merrily perverse pop style
to something sturdier than the material he has here. This time, in
a film loosely based on a television show of no great staying
power, he's more apt to drift. Without the winning presence of
Smith, whose knowing, newly hunky presence here is the film's
greatest asset, ``Wild Wild West'' would look even flimsier. But
the star's wit and swagger do a lot to deflect attention from the
film's sputtering. And they make it all the more regrettable that
``Wild Wild West'' doesn't make better use of its vast budget and
acting talent.
</P>
<P>
   Handsomely outfitted as a dandy, Smith plays James West, a
government agent in the days of the Ulysses S. Grant
administration. And Kevin Kline, in addition to impersonating
President Grant, plays West's odd-couple colleague, a master
inventor named Artemus Gordon. When West turns up on the roof of
Gordon's private train car, for instance, there is a gizmo to
catapult him into an armchair so that Gordon can say: ``How nice of
you to drop in!'' In a screenplay that has four credited authors
but no particular story, there are a lot more hoary Bondian puns
and winks where that came from.
</P>
<P>
   In a typically good-looking (the film was shot by Michael
Ballhaus) but dopey opening section, West and Gordon meet in a
brothel where both are trying to trap a minor villain, Gen.
``Bloodbath'' McGrath (Ted Levine), whose grotesque ear trumpet
sets the tone for much of what will follow. Then, after a visit to
the White House, where sheep are seen grazing on the lawn, the film
offers a little history lesson as it heads with President Grant to
Promontory Point, Utah, for the joining of the trans-continental
railroad. Since within the film there is also a science project
straining to get out, the story's various railway escapades work in
a few physics demonstrations, as when West and Gordon find
themselves with powerful magnets attached to their necks. The
magnets plus a cornfield chase make for a nice, jokey action
sequence that has nothing much to do with the rest of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But it does show off the handiwork of Dr. Arliss Loveless,
played by Kenneth Branagh in a steam-powered wheelchair and a
goatee any heavy-metal band would envy. There's no point to
wondering where Dr. Loveless lost the lower half of his body, why
he made plans for outsmarting the President and how his minions
managed to coax Ms. Hayak's Rita Escobar into a bedroom cage
surrounded by bondage equipment; these are just the sorts of things
that ``Wild Wild West'' takes for granted. Besides, Branagh's madly
villainous Confederate ranting (``way-all'' for ``well'') and
spider fetish are stupefying enough to dispel questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Kline as a charmingly suave comic foil, Ms. Hayek to
raise the film's temperature, and other good but weirdly utilized
players on hand (Bai Ling, who had a serious leading role in ``Red
Corner,'' is reduced to smirky Dragon Lady moves as an Asian
character called East), ``Wild Wild West'' trades especially
heavily on Smith's considerable appeal. Many barbed references to
slavery have been worked into the dialogue, and he delivers them
with winning acerbity. His abilities as a tough but jokey action
hero and ladies' man at least mean at least there's something worth
remembering when the film is over.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Wild Wild West'' is rated PG. It includes sexual
situations, sexual references, jokey but deadly violence and many
snickery double-entendres.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld; written by S.S. Wilson, Brent
Maddock, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, based on a story by Jim
Thomas and John Thomas; director of photography, Michael Ballhaus;
edited by Jim Miller; music by Elmer Bernstein; production

 &HT;    POLITICAL POLLING FACES PITFALLS IN CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``OK Internet Brigade, let's get out there and
stand strong for Pat!'' That's the rallying cry on Pat Buchanan's
Web site, which urges his supporters to ``hit the on-line polls and
register your vote for PJB.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't view it as skewing the numbers, just getting out the
vote,'' said Bob Adams, a spokesman for the Republican presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But could such partisan efforts skewer bold plans to make the
Internet a major source of political polls for the 2000 elections?
</P>
<P>
   Already, one leading market research firm has announced plans to
measure next year's political races on the Internet, including
battles for the White House, Congress and governorships. Such
plans, however, are deeply troubling to other survey professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political polling on the Internet has absolutely no
validity,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the widely respected Pew
Research Center. ``It's a giant leap backwards because it allows
the squeaky wheels to have a greater say. Responsible people
shouldn't be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pew recently compared its polling data with the results of
survey responses to the same questions posed on America Online.
More than half the people in the online survey disapproved of the
job President Clinton was doing. But two-thirds of those surveyed
by Pew on the phone approved.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping polls accurate as the industry moves into the Internet
age is even more of a challenge than the one posed by the last
technological leap, from door-to-door polling to telephones, which
occurred a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone polls, numbers are dialed at random. The results
are then weighted to accurately represent the national voting
population or a regional grouping. By contrast, Web pollsters must
deal with a self-selected group of volunteer respondents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it's clear that cyberspace dwellers are different
from the nation as a whole. One indicator is that, according to a
Georgia Tech survey released last month, the average annual income
of Web users is $57,300 _ more than $20,000 higher than the median
income of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism has not deterred Gordon Black, the chief
executive officer and founder of Harris Interactive. That's the new
name the venerable Harris market research firm adopted Tuesday,
when it announced a major reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, as a graduate student at Stanford, Black
recalls being barred by his teachers from using telephone surveys
because they were deemed unreliable. Now, he suggests, the same
prejudices plague the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply stated,'' Black said, ``the Internet is faster, cheaper
and more versatile than traditional mail, door-to-door and
telephony research methods. In fact, half of Harris Interactive's
watershed research during the past year are studies that could not
have been accomplished without the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, using an Internet database of just 1 million, the
Harris Poll Online accurately predicted 21 of 22 U.S. elections for
governor and senator in 16 states. By contrast, on average,
telephone polling units missed five of the 22 contests.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 2000, Harris plans to expand its database of
Internet users from the current 3.5 million people to as many as 10
million. With the expanded database, Harris says it will be able to
accurately discern trends among ever smaller segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly an empirical thing,'' said Jon Siegel, who
directs Harris' political efforts. ``It either works or it doesn't
work. We're going to be as honest about our methods and our results
as a newborn baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' Siegel added, ``it's a technology that's ready to
roll. If the Wright Brothers had waited, somebody else would have
flown first. Is what we've got a 747? No it's not. But I can assure
you that it will fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the American Association for Public Opinion
Research are not persuaded that Internet political polling is ready
for prime time. The group, meeting last week in Orlando, weighed
whether it should adopt a new survey rating system that would
require interviewers to tell the public and the media what
standards are being used to elicit results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overstate the concern that people who practice
polling have about this,'' said Nancy Belden, a Washington-based
pollster who organized the Orlando discussion. ``It is more urgent
because of the proliferation of Internet polling.''

FOR THE BARBECUE, A KALEIDOSCOPE OF SAUCES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN RAICHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not everyone sees red as the color of barbecue sauce.
Just as barbecue is defined as pork in some states and beef in
others, the liquid used for basting and flavoring can vary from
region to region. And ketchup is not at all as common as one may
think.
</P>
<P>
   The vinegar-based sauces of North Carolina are well known. But
in South Carolina and parts of Georgia, barbecue sauce is often
yellow-brown, based on mustard, not ketchup. In northern Alabama,
you can find white barbecue sauce, made from mayonnaise. And in my
hometown, Miami, we're partial to an amber blend of fried garlic
and citrus juice that goes by the name of mojo.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's vinegar sauce may well be the original American
barbecue sauce, according to Bob Garner's ``North Carolina
Barbecue'' (John F. Blair, 1996). The book says that Virginians and
North Carolinians in the 18th and 19th centuries sauced their
barbecue with a tangy mixture of vinegar, red pepper, salt and
oyster juice. He speculates that the vinegar may have been chosen
for its ability to mask the gamy taste that meat must have had in
the age before refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
   The mustard sauce found farther south _ sweet and tangy _ can be
varied infinitely. The basic ingredients are mustard (preferably
that cheap lurid yellow ball park variety, but sometimes two or
three classier kinds), vinegar and some sort of sweetener, like
honey, molasses, brown sugar or cane syrup or a combination. Local
cooks change the vinegar, sweetener and mustard to put their own
imprint on the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McDavid, the owner of Jack's Firehouse in Philadelphia and
the consulting chef and a partner in Red's Backwoods BBQ, a
restaurant chain primarily in the South, created a mustard sauce
that gets its kick from jalapeno peppers and its silken sweetness
from corn syrup.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme is the piquant white barbecue sauce served
with chicken in northern Alabama. ``My grandfather came up with the
recipe in 1925,'' said Don McLemore, the third-generation owner of
Big Bob Gibson's restaurants in Decatur, Ala. No self-respecting
pit master would disclose the exact formula for his sauce, but
McLemore says that the main ingredients are vinegar, mayonnaise and
black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds weird, and it is in fact weird. But sometimes weird is
best when it comes to barbecue. One taste of Big Bob's chicken,
smoked to a mahogany color and then tossed with the creamy but
peppery white sauce, made me a believer. My own contribution to the
recipe was a spoonful of prepared horseradish for more bite.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mojo (pronounced MO-ho), it owes its aromatic profile
to that triumvirate of Cuban seasonings: garlic, cumin and oregano.
The garlic is fried to the color of amber to intensify its flavor
without making it bitter. The traditional souring agent for mojo is
the juice of the naranja agria, the sour orange, which is available
in many Hispanic markets. You can approximate it by combining fresh
lime and grapefruit juices.
</P>
<P>
   It's classically Latin, but you'll be surprised by the
electrifying effect mojo has on grilled food of all ethnic
persuasions.

 &HT;    POLITICAL POLLING FACES PITFALLS IN CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``OK Internet Brigade, let's get out there and
stand strong for Pat!'' That's the rallying cry on Pat Buchanan's
Web site, which urges his supporters to ``hit the on-line polls and
register your vote for PJB.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't view it as skewing the numbers, just getting out the
vote,'' said Bob Adams, a spokesman for the Republican presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But could such partisan efforts skewer bold plans to make the
Internet a major source of political polls for the 2000 elections?
</P>
<P>
   Already, one leading market research firm has announced plans to
measure next year's political races on the Internet, including
battles for the White House, Congress and governorships. Such
plans, however, are deeply troubling to other survey professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political polling on the Internet has absolutely no
validity,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the widely respected Pew
Research Center. ``It's a giant leap backwards because it allows
the squeaky wheels to have a greater say. Responsible people
shouldn't be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pew recently compared its polling data with the results of
survey responses to the same questions posed on America Online.
More than half the people in the online survey disapproved of the
job President Clinton was doing. But two-thirds of those surveyed
by Pew on the phone approved.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping polls accurate as the industry moves into the Internet
age is even more of a challenge than the one posed by the last
technological leap, from door-to-door polling to telephones, which
occurred a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone polls, numbers are dialed at random. The results
are then weighted to accurately represent the national voting
population or a regional grouping. By contrast, Web pollsters must
deal with a self-selected group of volunteer respondents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it's clear that cyberspace dwellers are different
from the nation as a whole. One indicator is that, according to a
Georgia Tech survey released last month, the average annual income
of Web users is $57,300 _ more than $20,000 higher than the median
income of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism has not deterred Gordon Black, the chief
executive officer and founder of Harris Interactive. That's the new
name the venerable Harris market research firm adopted Tuesday,
when it announced a major reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, as a graduate student at Stanford, Black
recalls being barred by his teachers from using telephone surveys
because they were deemed unreliable. Now, he suggests, the same
prejudices plague the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply stated,'' Black said, ``the Internet is faster, cheaper
and more versatile than traditional mail, door-to-door and
telephony research methods. In fact, half of Harris Interactive's
watershed research during the past year are studies that could not
have been accomplished without the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, using an Internet database of just 1 million, the
Harris Poll Online accurately predicted 21 of 22 U.S. elections for
governor and senator in 16 states. By contrast, on average,
telephone polling units missed five of the 22 contests.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 2000, Harris plans to expand its database of
Internet users from the current 3.5 million people to as many as 10
million. With the expanded database, Harris says it will be able to
accurately discern trends among ever smaller segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly an empirical thing,'' said Jon Siegel, who
directs Harris' political efforts. ``It either works or it doesn't
work. We're going to be as honest about our methods and our results
as a newborn baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' Siegel added, ``it's a technology that's ready to
roll. If the Wright Brothers had waited, somebody else would have
flown first. Is what we've got a 747? No it's not. But I can assure
you that it will fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the American Association for Public Opinion
Research are not persuaded that Internet political polling is ready
for prime time. The group, meeting last week in Orlando, weighed
whether it should adopt a new survey rating system that would
require interviewers to tell the public and the media what
standards are being used to elicit results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overstate the concern that people who practice
polling have about this,'' said Nancy Belden, a Washington-based
pollster who organized the Orlando discussion. ``It is more urgent
because of the proliferation of Internet polling.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Decal is a sign of the times
 &HT;    By Todd C. Duncan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other day, as I was waiting for the traffic light to turn
green at one of downtown Atlanta's busiest intersections, I noticed
an emblem of how far our society has moved away from civility.
</P>
<P>
   Posted on the rear window of a stealthy-looking black Chevy
pickup was the white outline of the cartoon character Calvin _ of
``Calvin and Hobbes'' fame _ urinating on a Ford logo.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen these decals before, but in this climate of school
shootings, sex scandals, dragging deaths and police torture cases,
the tiny cartoon suddenly represents something more.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for adult devotees of one brand of automobile to
circulate Xerox copies and e-mails with this expression of
automotive superiority, but to publicly display such crudeness is
simply repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   As I drove alongside the truck, I spied the occupants. The
driver was a man, probably in his late 30s. His passengers were a
woman about the same age and a young boy playing with one of those
toy robots that transform into another machine or animal. All had
smiles on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   I'll assume they are hard-working, well-meaning folks. I'll even
bet they describe themselves as ``average Americans.'' That's what
is so troubling about the sporting of the decal.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that ``average Americans'' don't find urinating
anywhere _ except before a commode _ distasteful is clear
indication that we have lost the way to civilization.
</P>
<P>
   If we were to talk to the adults in that truck, I believe they
would agree that American values have taken a turn for the worse _
accelerated by ineffective schools, the disintegration of the
family, the irrelevance of spirituality, and the violence portrayed
on television, in movies, music and video games.
</P>
<P>
   They are correct on those points, but more importantly, they've
missed the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   We teach our children with our actions and who and what we
surround ourselves with.
</P>
<P>
   The message they are sending with their decal works hand in hand
with the over-pumped silver screen idol blowing away dozens of
``bad guys'' to move us away from basic decency. Each desensitizes
us.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being distasteful, the decal displays a level of
blind intolerance. Intolerance for what is different or for a
different way of thinking or living.
</P>
<P>
   It really isn't a far stretch in these times for someone to
replace that car brand logo with the logo of the type of music they
despise, the sports team they dislike or the political party they
vote against. I noticed a bumper sticker the other day with the
same Calvin figure standing over seven yellow-stained letters,
C-L-I-N-T-O-N.
</P>
<P>
   A politician now, but how about a religion tomorrow? A race? The
exchange is not that difficult to foresee.
</P>
<P>
   This by no way means that people who enjoy this decal are going
to raise the next Timothy McVeighs or neo-Nazis. However, it does
point out that we are not thinking about the meaning of the banners
we're flying.
</P>
<P>
   The message the decal sends to others, especially children: ``If
you don't like something, you have the OK to urinate on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that a family value? Is that message better than off-color
rap or speed metal lyrics? How did this decal get to be funny or
cute and acceptable for public display?
</P>
<P>
   This society accepts many forms of destructive behavior. Just
watch the ``Jerry Springer Show'' for two minutes. It's hard to
tell who is more obscene; the male guest who's having an affair
with his fiancee's lesbian grandmother or the audience members who
cheer the guests' stream of profane tirades and physical assaults.
</P>
<P>
   For the even more absurd, look at all of the children in this
country walking around wearing T-shirts with their favorite
engorged, living cartoon characters _ pro wrestlers. There is a pro
wrestling character whose persona is that of a street pimp. He
calls the scantily clad women that follow him his ``hoes.'' How
does a character like that make it to a television screen viewed by
children? What is the wrestling or TV executive thinking about when
they give their permission to create such nonsense? What sponsor
believes it's OK to advertise around a segment featuring a pimp and
his whores? How can any parent let their children watch such
displays.
</P>
<P>
   While seeking civility, we should not forget that freedom of
thought and speech is the key to our democracy's survival. One does
have the right _ with some limitations _ to crude expression.
However, individuals, families and communities also have the right
not to accept it. Acting civilized should not be inconsistent with
being a good American. A good person. ``Keeping it real'' does not
mean ``keeping it vile.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems we've lost our basic starting points. Say ``please''
and ``thank you.'' ``Don't curse in public.'' ``Be respectful to
our elders.'' ``Treat others the way you want to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Common decency used to be common.

`SOUTH PARK`: MAKING A POINT WITH SMUT AND LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any self-respecting third-grade boy what is the funniest
thing in the whole wide world, and he might tell you (in different
words, of course) that it is the nether region of the human body.
In its spontaneous and sometimes noisy release of noxious fumes,
which turn out to be (gasp! chortle!) flammable, the posterior
operates according to its own natural laws. These laws are
diametrically opposed to the orderly rules laid down by grade
school principals and soccer moms who are constantly nagging you to
stand in line, wash behind your ears and smell nice for granny. But
as any third grader will tell you, chaos can erupt from below at
any moment to throw a pall over the nicest little tea party.
</P>
<P>
   The rock-bottom reality of third-grade humor versus adult
sanctimony is the source of many of the laughs in ``South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' the very funny, extremely obscene movie
spinoff from the popular animated Comedy Central series. With
eerily perfect timing, ``South Park'' addresses the current
national debate about the Motion Picture Association of America's
movie ratings and President Clinton's call for exhibitors to
enforce them vigorously. In an early scene a group of chirpy
round-faced tykes in the Rocky Mountain town of South Park pay a
homeless man to take them to a movie starring a Canadian duo who
spew nothing but high-velocity profanity with an anal slant.
</P>
<P>
   Proudly flaunting their new, scatological vocabulary, the boys
shock the community with sophisticated language that they don't
fully comprehend but enjoy slinging around. Emergency meetings are
held, and Sheila Broflovski, the bossy mother of Kyle, one of the
corrupted third graders, leads a hysterically vindictive anti-smut
campaign that grows into a national movement. Sheila blames Canada
for all the ills of the world. Diplomatic insults fly, and (in a
grand gesture borrowed from the 1995 movie ``Canadian Bacon'') the
United States declares war on Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's sharpest satirical twist, Cartman, one of the
boys, is subjected to a behavior-modification experiment
(reminiscent of ``A Clockwork Orange'') and implanted with a V-chip
that delivers a severe electric shock every time a naughty word
escapes his mouth. In an amusingly subversive twist, the mechanism
eventually becomes a potent weapon of war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boys' pal Kenny (who in the series is regularly
killed off only to be resurrected) dies in an accident that begins
with a flaming ignition of his own body gas and winds up in that
ultimate nether world, the one ruled by Satan. The Devil seems to
be having romantic problems. Having succumbed to the charms of
Saddam Hussein (portrayed as a smiling photograph attached to a
tiny cut-out figure), who has died and gone to hell, he has become
the Iraqi dictator's pining love slave. The Devil is shown poring
over ``Saddam Is From Mars, Satan's From Venus'' for tips on how to
improve their communication. But their troubled idyll is
interrupted by the war above ground, which Satan realizes is his
opportunity to put in an appearance and take over the planet.
Armageddon is suddenly at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between the movie and the television
series is that along with everything else, the film is a
Disney-style (or anti-Disney, if you will) musical with 15 songs.
These poke fun at everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein (the
icky, cheery opener, ``Mountain Town,'' and the ``Do Re Mi''-like
``It's Easy, Mmmkay'' about learning to replace obscenities with
nice words) to ``Les Miserables'' (``La Resistance'') to Mariah
Carey-style inspirational ballads (``Up There''). Most of the songs
were written by Trey Parker (who created the ``South Park'' series
with Matt Stone) and the film composer Marc Shaiman. Several are
staged as splashy chorus-line production numbers. While none are
classics, they underline the movie's cheeky attitude toward
grown-up authority.
</P>
<P>
   Not to become ponderous (after all, it's only a movie), but the
``South Park'' phenomenon cannily zeroes in on some essential
contradictions of American popular culture. In its cheerfully
smutty way it wants to clear the air of pompous, hypocritical
rhetoric about protecting children from basic if unpleasant
realities. Beneath the hilarity, the movie is a scathing social
parable in which desperate, paranoid grown-ups who long for an
impossibly sanitized environment go collectively crazy to the point
that they're willing to bring on World War III. And what are they
so afraid of? Just some dumb off- color humor about bodily
functions.
</P>
<P>
   One key to ``South Park's'' humor is its lack of political
smugness. In spoofing such stereotypes as a bossy Jewish mother
(Mrs. Broflovski), a campy gay man (Big Gay Al) and a black man who
is a repository of sexual knowledge (the grade school chef, spoken
by Isaac Hayes), the satire extends to everybody.
</P>
<P>
   As jolly as it is, the humor in ``South Park'' isn't as acute as
in the television series' best moments. Nothing in the film matches
the force of an episode in which the third graders are taken on a
hunting trip by adults who instantly revert to atavistic macho
insanity, getting drunk and shooting at everything that moves. And
in an effort to bring in as many characters as possible from
different ``South Park'' episodes, the movie also goes on tangents.
Some of its jokes (like a song devoted to the skater Brian Boitano)
will mystify those unfamiliar with the series.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, ``South Park'' has a very simple,
self-justifying moral. As much as the movie touches on the
socialization process and a conservative society's fears and
prejudices about the human body and sex, it is really about mass
entertainment, censorship and freedom of speech. Its argument is
distilled in a single short speech pointing out that movies allow
almost unlimited violence while remaining petrified of anything
reeking of smut. The mere existence of ``South Park,'' which
received an R rating after a struggle to avoid NC-17, suggests that
it is winning its argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``South Park'' (whose R rating requires viewers under 17
to be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian) has reams of
profanity, not all of it intelligible because much of it is spoken
so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Trey Parker; written by Parker, Matt Stone and Pam
Brady; director of animation, Eric Stough; edited by John Venzon;
music and lyrics by Parker, with score and additional music by Marc
Shaiman; produced by Parker and Stone; released by Paramount
Pictures. Running time: 88 minutes. This film is rated R. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WITH THE VOICES OF: Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman
(Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan), Isaac Hayes (Chef), Jesse Howell,
Anthony Cross-Thomas and Francesca Clifford (Ike), George Clooney
(Dr. Gouache), Brent Spiner (Conan O'Brien), Minnie Driver (Brooke
Shields), Dave Foley (the Baldwin Brothers), Eric Idle (Dr.
Vosknocker) and Mike Judge (Kenny's Goodbye).

AN AUTHOR HAS A BALL WITH `LUCY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ I know I'm not alone in saying that I'm a big
fan of ``I Love Lucy,'' arguably television's greatest situation
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Even repeated viewings of Lucy Ricardo's shenanigans do little
to dim the humor. I've read a few books about the show, most of
them serious looks at the hard work and creativity that went into
TV history.
</P>
<P>
   At last, there's a book that tells the story with a sense of
humor, ``Laughs, Luck ... and Lucy,'' by Jess Oppenheimer, the
show's creator and head writer. Oppenheimer died in 1988 before he
completed his memoirs, which provided a life-changing opportunity
for his son, Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Oppenheimer gave up his legal career when he signed
the contract for the ``Lucy'' book and started rummaging through
his father's files to piece together notes and letters into a book.
</P>
<P>
   The book has just been published in paperback by Syracuse
University Press.
</P>
<P>
   While working on the book, Oppenheimer collected hundreds of his
father's scripts for Jack Benny, ``Lucy,'' ``Baby Snooks,''
starring Fanny Brice, and the ``My Favorite Husband'' radio series
that led to ``I Love Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned a few things about his father in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I learned, which was not a real surprise, is that
his sense of humor really helped him cope with all the hurdles that
were thrown at him.'' Jess Oppenheimer had double vision as a
child, which caused all sorts of social problems. But his
awkwardness led him to develop his natural wit and humor as he
figured that making people laugh could also make him popular.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gregg Oppenheimer said he inherited his father's sense of
humor, he never turned to television comedy (aside from a brief
stint working on a Debbie Reynolds series in the 1960s). ``I had a
blast and thought that this is what I want to do, but Dad said I
had to go to college and find something to do where I can earn some
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Oppenheimer had a clear purpose with the book _ to make
people laugh. ``I've read a lot of `Lucy' books and most were
serious,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It seemed strange
that all the stuff about the person who has given more laughter to
the world than practically anyone in history is so depressing. I
thought it would be nice to let people read about her and laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   So the book mixes the serious with the funny, as it relates the
evolution of turning radio's ``My Favorite Husband'' into ``I Love
Lucy.'' Actually, you can hear it, too, because the book includes a
compact disc with clips from both shows.
</P>
<P>
   One track features a restaurant scene from ``Husband'' that is
virtually identical to a scene later heard on ``I Love Lucy.'' Even
the waiter (played by Frank Nelson) is the same.
</P>
<P>
   On another track, you can hear Ball's ``Husband'' character
acting like a racetrack tout to sell a used dress, while a similar
style has Lucy Ricardo selling excess meat in a butcher shop.
</P>
<P>
   To further the multimedia theme, Oppenheimer also has created a
lively Web site (www.lucylibrary.com) that features stories, sound
and video clips, biographies and a book excerpt.
</P>
<P>
   The show was an instant success when it premiered in 1951, but
it almost ended before it became the classic it now is. Lucille
Ball became pregnant, and no other series had ever dealt with such
a happy problem. Remember, this was in the era when married people
on TV slept in separate beds, and the word ``pregnant'' was not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But those episodes are now embedded in our minds, and no other
series since has dealt with the farcical realities related to
pregnancy without touching on something that Oppenheimer and his
writing staff had already done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most accessible shows ever done,'' Gregg
Oppenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Love Lucy'' runs nightly on Nick at Nite, and you can expect
big things in 2001, the 50th anniversary of the show's birth.
Oppenheimer is putting together a collection of
never-before-published ``Lucy'' scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be that sophisticated to watch, yet they
didn't write down to the audience,'' said Oppenheimer. ``They took
simple concepts and executed them very elegantly. The visuals are
hilarious, but the writing builds them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer said his favorite episode was the Emmy-nominated
``L.A. at Last'' when the Ricardos and Mertzes arrive in Los
Angeles and Lucy, Ethel and Fred visit the Brown Derby restaurant
and run into William Holden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brown Derby scene is just a beautiful acting scene. She
makes it look so simple and I know she spent days practicing. She
didn't do any of this stuff naturally. Dad would say that if you
came to rehearsals, you'd think get rid of the redhead, she's
terrible. But after several days of wrestling with the script, she
owned it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why we still love Lucy.
</P>

   LONGVIEW, Texas _ It's called ``Babyland'' but there are no
aisles of cute baby clothes or nursery furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a row of plaques mark tiny graves decorated with
flowers and favorite toys at the Chapelwood Memorial Gardens in
Bowie County, Northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaques reads, ``Our beloved little man, Anthony D.
Zimmerman, July 24, 1998-Feb. 17, 1999, Now I lay me down to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Zimmerman can't forget the day his 6-month-old son died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to bed about 9 or 10 p.m. He went right to sleep,
laying in my arms. He woke up at 4 a.m., and I gave him his
pacifier and I sang him back to sleep,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's 2-year-old sister, Katelyn, woke up at 6 a.m., and
Zimmerman gave her a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I woke up with my son in my arms. He was clinging
to me and looking at me,'' but he wasn't breathing, said Zimmerman,
22.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman called 911. The Bowie County sheriff's office and an
ambulance from St. Michael Hospital in Texarkana responded. When
Anthony arrived at the hospital, ``they said he was gone,''
Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Local law enforcement officers and a Child Protective Services
investigator examined the circumstances of Anthony's death, and his
body was autopsied.
</P>
<P>
   CPS is a division of the Texas Department of Protective and
Regulatory Services.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Anthony's death still is unknown, but investigators
found no evidence of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman and his wife, Tina, 18, are just one of the more than
2,000 couples who suffer the loss of a child younger than
1-year-old each year in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   CPS staff and local committees are examining the circumstances
surrounding child deaths across the state to see if they can be
prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony had been hospitalized for RSV _ respiratory syncytial
virus _ and had been out of the hospital for just four days when he
died, Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Longview pediatrician Dr. Karen Roberts said RSV is the most
common respiratory virus in children and often causes them to be
hospitalized. It usually occurs from December through February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can make the kids have the appearance of (sudden infant
death syndrome, or SIDS). In very small infants, it can just make
them quit breathing,'' Roberts said. Children with RSV are treated
as if they had asthma, and no RSV vaccine is available.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is a member of the Texas Child Fatality Review Team that
covers the 23 counties that make up CPS' Region 4. Other members
include a CPS worker, police chief, district attorney, retired law
enforcement officer and former CPS worker. The committee meets
about four times a year to review the circumstances of all child
deaths in Region 4, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee asks, ``Can we pick out something that anyone did,
that could have been improved upon and might have saved that baby's
life,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a child drowns, the committee examines the
police report and autopsy records to see if the drowning could have
been prevented, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found that the frequency of child death by drowning
decreases by about 60 percent when you put a fence up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also has talked about ways ``to get the word out
to people saying don't shake your baby,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times we sit around and say, 'if only,' and this
allows me to help change that 'if only,' `` Roberts said. ``It's a
chance to make the world a little bit better, a little safer for
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman and his wife, who now live in a mobile home park in
the Bowie County town of Hooks, were willing to talk about
Anthony's death because they want to prevent others.
</P>
<P>
   When Anthony died, all four Zimmermans were sleeping in an adult
bed in a camper, Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony usually slept in his own bed, but occasionally he did
sleep with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept him on my arm, 'cause I could feel him when he turned.
I'm a light sleeper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Zimmerman cautioned parents about sleeping with their
babies in a large adult bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a hard sleeper, I'd put him in a baby bed, that's
what I'd do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Wright is the CPS specialist who investigated Anthony's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mandated that we investigate any deaths of children 6
years old and under who didn't die in a motor vehicle accident or
who didn't have an ongoing illness,'' said Wright, who also looks
into reports of child abuse by school employees throughout Region
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm looking for is, could the death have been prevented
and was the child abused,'' he said. If there are other children in
the home, they receive physical exams to make sure they are not
being abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``If abuse or neglect is ruled out and there's no risk to the
surviving children, we close the case out. ... I generally have a
pretty good idea if abuse or neglect occurred within the first
couple of days of the investigation,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked for CPS for six years but investigated his first
child death in January. Since then, Wright has investigated five
deaths, all of children 1-year-old or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't describe what this is like. The first dead baby I
saw looked like my son. You become very protective (of your
children), and you watch out for everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these deaths have involved ``high-risk kids and young
parents,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Anthony's death, one child died of SIDS, one suffocated,
one strangled on a Venetian blind cord, and one overdosed on
medication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that's just common sense. When you have young
children, you put your medication up because children will put
things in their mouth,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Other common-sense precautions: don't leave your children in
locked vehicles in the summer, don't shake your baby, no matter
what, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright reports his findings to the area fatality review team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about what could have been done to prevent (the
death). That helps me learn what to look for when investigating
these cases. It also makes sure I haven't missed anything,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   CPS may refer parents who have lost a child to support services,
such as counseling or parenting classes, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard investigations are the ones I've had recently, the
SIDS death. We don't want to leave it that we don't know what
happened, why your child died,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janece Keetch, statewide coordinator for child fatality review
teams, said the teams have been able to educate communities about
how to reduce child deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many infants die because they are not in safe beds or cribs.
We really encourage that parents not sleep with their children or
that they do that safely, so that a child is not accidentally
suffocated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other infants drown because they are left unattended in a
bathtub, Keetch said.
</P>
<P>
   Many drownings take place when a group of adults supervise a
group of children around water because one child is overlooked, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to have one-to-one assigned supervision. It
takes a very short time, like two minutes, for a child to drown,''
Keetch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need specific data to target prevention efforts. Did the
child drown in a pool or in a mop bucket?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make a lot of assumptions about child deaths, but
unless we have the hard data, our assumptions many times are going
to be wrong,'' Keetch said.
</P>
<P>
   CPS community initiatives specialist Linda Cunningham said the
majority of child deaths are caused by accidents or suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents unknowingly put their children in dangerous
situations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said parents need to ``make sure they spend as much
time with their kids as they can, because you can't ever tell what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing a little baby just born and knowing our little son, 6
months old, is gone. ... just tears me up,'' said Zimmerman, who
works at a cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took off work a couple of days ago. I went over to his grave
and just sat there. It's hard, very hard,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They applauded Philip Glass as if he were a rap star
and greeted the first notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with a
gasp of delighted recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie Hall audience the other day was composed of
hundreds of students in grades four through six from schools around
the city. Most had participated in Carnegie Hall's Linkup music
education program, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Linkup was developed in the 1980s when arts programs were being
slashed in New York City public schools and elsewhere around the
country. But how much the students actually learned was measured
largely through anecdotes until now.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall tried to improve on this with help from Columbia
University's Teachers College and Educational Testing Services.
Program administrators asked 6,000 students participating in the
program to develop musical compositions at the beginning of the
course and again at the end. The students used commercially
available glockenspiels and homemade thumb pianos, guitars made of
cardboard, a set of three can drums, can shakers and trumpets made
from garden hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Using a complicated scoring formula, testers evaluated the
differences between the two compositions. The improvement was far
from earthshaking, but evaluators concluded that it was
``significant'' given the modest length of the program, which ran
for seven 45-minute sessions. The final compositions showed small
improvements in how students produced sounds and alternated
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   And in written responses to questions about composing, the
students gave more detailed explanations of how they used the
instruments to create action, character and mood.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study were released this month. ``I was very
pleased with the modest gains,''said Carol Myford, a senior
research scientist at Educational Testing Services in Princeton,
N.J. ``This is a short-term program.''
</P>
<P>
   Linkup emphasizes basic music concepts and music's relationships
to other academic subjects through classes, planning sessions for
teachers and artists, and concerts in schools and neighborhoods.
This year, the 14-year-old program involved 22,000 students and 733
teachers at 176 schools in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For the study, conducted in the 1996-97 school year, students
working in groups of six were given a set of instruments and asked
to write a piece of music that would illustrate a short story they
were asked to read. Then they were asked, after some instruction in
how to use the instruments, to choose sounds that ``show''
characters, action and mood.
</P>
<P>
   The students had 15 minutes to create and practice a piece that
was a minute or two long. Each group played its piece, which was
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was repeated at the end of the program, and the
compositions were taped again. The students' efforts were evaluated
for use of timbre, texture, portrayal of the text and overall
effectiveness. The students also responded to written questions on
work sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that sixth graders made the greatest gains while
fourth graders made the smallest. The report hypothesized that
older students had had more exposure to the concepts of text,
timbre and texture. Another hypothesis was that the curriculum was
more appropriate for older students.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, students showed the most improvement in their use of
texture and the smallest gain in their exploration of timbre.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at the
Harvard University Graduate School of Education, whose theories of
multiple intelligences have gained wide popularity, said that the
study sounded like a positive step but that follow-up was needed.
It is important to determine whether the students continue to
improve, after such a short program, and at what rate, Gardner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That you can do something in a short time is worth noting,''
he added. ``It's a good message to kids that this is something you
can get better at.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than 2 million adults are incarcerated in
the United States _ one out of every 150 residents. With rare
exceptions, they have one thing in common: They all get out. Most
of them come out no better off than when they went in.
</P>
<P>
   Most have no practical plans for making it in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Most, with little education and few skills, resort to the
underground economy, commit new crimes and are soon rearrested.
</P>
<P>
   What if someone came up with an idea that could end this cycle?
You would think that governments and sociologists would be
clamoring to fund, study and replicate such an amazing idea.
</P>
<P>
   That someone does exist. Her programs have stopped criminal
behavior in hundreds of former criminals. As sheriff of San
Francisco, I can attest to their success.
</P>
<P>
   Cathrine Sneed is the idea person behind the Garden Project and
the Tree Corps, two programs designed to train and employ
ex-offenders. She is also the program manager, the fund-raiser, the
inspirational speaker and the person who makes these programs work.
</P>

   A recidivism study printed in American Jails magazine reported
that while 55 percent of offenders released from the county jail
were rearrested within one year, only 27 percent of the 390 Garden
Project participants were rearrested within four years of their
release.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is the secret of Sneed's success? She teaches work
skills, requires former outlaws to move back into the framework of
a lawful society (get a driver's license and bank account, take
adult education classes) and urges them toward the self-respect and
self-sufficiency that employment brings.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than good intentions to break back into the
mainstream of society.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the genius of Cathrine Sneed enters the picture.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that having a legitimate income is the key to a
lawful life. But who is going to give a break to an untested
ex-con?
</P>
<P>
   In the Garden Project and the Tree Corps, Sneed takes offenders
fresh out of jail, puts them to work, mentors them until they learn
how to work, and then helps them find a job elsewhere in the job
market. In Sneed's programs, they learn the joys of gainful labor
and the advantages of not having to run from the cops.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it is our community that benefits from this
transformation. As these hundreds of Garden Project and Tree Corps
graduates reject the criminal life, thousands of crimes never
happen, government resources are no longer used to incarcerate and
feed them, and new taxpaying employees are created.
</P>
<P>
   Produce from the Garden Project's organic vegetable garden is
sold at farmers' markets and to local businesses. Some produce is
donated to local soup kitchens, the very place that people getting
out of jail often count on for their meals.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Project participants learn not only how to work but also
the real meaning of work: the feeling of success when a job is
finished; the sense of pride one gets when someone compliments the
product; the satisfaction of being able to tell your family what
you did today; the comfort of having a source of income for the
essentials of living.
</P>
<P>
   The Tree Corps is an advanced work program for ex-offenders,
funded through a street beautification bond program that mandates
the city of San Francisco to maintain and increase trees along
public streets.
</P>
<P>
   This is a full-time, hard-labor job _ digging out dead tree
stumps, tamping soil and hefting trees into newly dug holes. In the
eight years that the Tree Corps has been in existence, its members
have planted and cared for more than 7,500 new trees in San
Francisco, often in the poorer neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Tree Corps participants move on to other full-time
employment, bringing with them a record of hard work and pride in
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Garden Project nor the Tree Corps can operate
without support. Innovation and community support have been the
keys to success so far.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Sheriff's Department pays Sneed's salary and
rents an eight-acre plot of land to her non-profit group for $1 a
year. Several business owners on the Garden Project's advisory
board have purchased produce and hired graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, every year it is a struggle for Sneed to find funds.
</P>
<P>
   As a non-profit organization, the Garden Project is always
looking for foundation support, contributions from businesses or
citizens and new employment avenues for graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know someone has a key to stopping crime, maybe you
know someone else who wants to be part of this remarkable project.

 GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, GREEK DICTATOR FROM '67 to '73, DEAD AT 80  
(gm) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Papadopoulos, who headed a military dictatorship that
dominated Greece in the late 1960s and early 1970s and which was
widely reported to have tortured and imprisoned opponents of its
rule, died Sunday in a hospital in Athens. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, Agence France-Presse reported. He
had been in the hospital since August 1996 for treatment of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 Papadopoulos, then an army colonel, led a bloodless
military coup, which overthrew a shaky parliamentary government.
</P>
<P>
   He was ousted from power late in 1973 by a new group of
officers, whose own junta fell from power in 1974. In that year he
was arrested. With constitutional government restored, he was put
on trial.
</P>
<P>
   He and 19 other figures in the coup were charged with treason
and insurrection. At the time of the trial in 1975, he issued a
signed statement to the press asserting that he had led the coup to
save Greece from communism and civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of both treason and insurrection. He was
sentenced to death, but his sentence was reduced to life
imprisonment. He was held in Korydallos Prison in Athens until he
was transferred to the hospital three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Despina. An earlier marriage ended
in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a village schoolteacher, Papadopoulos was born in the
northern Peloponnesus. He graduated from his country's War Academy
and was commissioned an artillery sublieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the six-month Greek-Italian war that began late in
1940, fought in the Greek resistance movement while Greece was
occupied by German forces later in World War II and saw action
against communist guerrillas in Greece after the war.
</P>
<P>
   He was promoted to colonel in 1960. From 1959 to 1964 he was a
staff officer in the Central Service of Information, the Greek
equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   His coup was carried out early on April 21, 1967. As a British
historian of Greece, C.M. Woodhouse, recounted in his 1985 book,
''The Rise and Fall of the Greek Colonels'': ''Zero hour for the
military action was 0200. No one outside the conspiracy seems to
have had an inkling of the threat. The king had gone to bed late in
his country house. The American ambassador, Phillips Talbot, was
asleep at home. Senior officers of the CIA appear to have suspected
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Greek general who commanded the troops in Athens, but
was not in on the plot, was out walking in the capital in the early
hours and ''was amazed to see tanks moving through the streets,
without any orders known to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year Papadopoulos retired from the army with the rank
of brigadier as part of an effort to make the government seem more
civilian. But it was dogged by criticism over human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after the coup, on Jan. 27, 1968, an American
lawyer, James Becket, and a British lawyer, Anthony Marreco, acting
as representatives of Amnesty International, wrote a report after a
month of investigation in Athens saying the Greek police had
engaged in widespread torture of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The contention was denied by a spokesman for the post-coup
government, but charges of torture continued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 Sen. Claiborne Pell, R-R.I., wrote, ''The Council of
Europe has confirmed the allegations that I have been making on the
Senate floor to the effect that the Greek regime has countenanced
the use of torture as a matter of administrative practice to
extract information from prisoners and to discourage men and women
from engaging in any activity unsympathetic to the junta.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its repressive measures, and although a number of
intellectuals and leftists left the country while it held power,
Papadopoulos held on to power through several efforts to remove
him. In December 1967, King Constantine II mounted an unsuccessful
coup attempt, after which Papadopoulos took the title of premier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he was almost assassinated. Navy officers tried but
failed to overthrow him in 1973. In that year he set up a republic
and took the title of president. He tried to give the new
arrangement legitimacy. But his downfall ensued.

&HT;        SPECTER CALLS FOR INDEPENDENCE IN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Tiffany Lynch  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 29 -- Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter and other
members of the Senate said they are concerned that a new policy
will make the office of Independent Counsel less independent.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Justice measure puts the independent counsel
under the guidance of the Attorney General -- an office that could
be the subject of an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the chain of command created an ``irreconcilable
conflict-of-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter and three other senators spoke out against the DOJ
proposal Tuesday and introduced an alternative. The legislation,
called the Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999, would limit the
power of the independent counsel and hold the investigator to the
same regulations as other federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The current independent counsel system, created in the aftermath
of Watergate, allows the Attorney General to call on an individual
to investigate and prosecute crimes by up to 200 officials,
including the President. It will expire on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current process, the independent counsel is
independent of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
But under new Department of Justice regulations, the Attorney
General has the power to remove special counsels and veto their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the rule of law is indispensable and you can't
have a rule of law if the individual is investigating himself or
the person in charge of him has an irreconcilable
conflict-of-interst,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he would also like to see Congress use its power to
change the DOJ rule. He said he will work on trying to revise the
DOJ plan, in addition to pushing his own legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's measure would reign in the power of the independent
counsel. It would limit the possible subjects of investigations to
the President, Vice President, the Cabinet and the President's
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would hold investigations to a two year period,
unless a special court approves additional time for the inquiry. An
independent counsel wouldn't be able to expand the investigation
from the original purpose. It would also prevent investigators with
a conflict of interest from launching a case.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the need for tighter control over the independent
counsel was because of the liberty and expansion past prosecutors
such as Kenneth Starr have taken with investigations.

`AMERICAN MASTERS': HELLMAN AND HAMMETT, STURM UND DRANG 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the biographies of Lillian Hellman and Dashiell
Hammett, carried in tandem on Wednesday night's American Masters
series, are linked by romance and politics, fame and hard knocks,
they are studies in contrast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lives of Lillian Hellman'' is a very public document,
while ``Dashiell Hammett. Detective. Writer'' is as private and as
elusive as the Continental Op, Hammett's famous fictional
detective. The Hammett biography is mainly about the writer's work,
with helpings of the movie version of his novel ``The Maltese
Falcon''; the Hellman biography is less about her writing than
about her contentious personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detective is an anonymous character,'' a Hammett scholar
says. ``He has, as it were, no individuality. His individuality is
simply what he does.'' Hammett was similarly shy on personal
details. The program's narrator says that he ``almost seems to have
willfully covered the traces of his own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellman was 11 years younger than Hammett. When they met in
Hollywood, he was at the peak of his fame as a best-selling writer
of mysteries, notably ``The Thin Man''; she had not yet begun to
write. Soon, in a strange sort of transference, he bequeathed his
talent to her, beginning with the idea for her first play, ``The
Children's Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   A critic, Joan Mellen, says that the history of literature
``would be hard pressed to find another example of a man who so
selflessly helped a woman to achieve the most out of her, I would
say, somewhat limited gifts. She was smart, she was clever, but she
wasn't a natural, and he was a natural. And he gave her everything
that he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Their life together, beginning in the 1930s on Hardscrabble
Farm, combined left-wing politics and random affairs, heavy
drinking and chain smoking. As his career faded, hers took off.
``These Three,'' her 1936 movie adaptation of ``The Children's
Hour,'' was a hit. The narrator reports, ``Lillian was now rich and
famous while the rest of the country was starving.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics and playwriting merged. She went to Spain on behalf of
the Loyalist cause and wrote ``The Little Foxes,'' a memoir of
growing up, and then ``Watch on the Rhine,'' an anti-Fascist play.
She won the gratitude of the Russians with ``The North Star,'' a
pro-Soviet movie that one critic likened to a bowl of borscht.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s she joined the presidential campaign for Henry
Wallace's third party and helped organize the Communist-influenced
Waldorf Peace Conference. Around this time, during the
Communist-hunting era, Hammett was sentenced to six months in jail
and Hellman, refusing to ``cut my conscience to fit this year's
fashions,'' would not answer questions from the House Committee on
Un-American Activities. She was blacklisted by the movies, but her
1960 play, ``Toys in the Attic,'' was a hit; a few months later, in
1961, Hammett died.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman took up with another writer, who was many years her
junior, and set out on a series of best-selling biographies that
blended fact and fiction. When the novelist Mary McCarthy called
her a liar, Hellman sued. As Norman Mailer commented, ``Lillian was
not someone who was anchored to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Afflicted by glaucoma, emphysema and strokes, Hellman battled
death as she had battled in the causes to which she gave her life.
A friend, the writer Richard Poirier, reports that as she lay dying
she said, ``I was fun, wasn't I?'' Many disagreed, but another
friend said at her funeral, ``She was awful and she was worth it.''

   Numerous locations across the Northeast and Middle Atlantic
States received abundant rainfall Tuesday as an arriving cold front
sparked thundershowers by lifting warm, humid air. The southern
portion of this front will become stationary Wednesday from the
Carolinas to southern Oklahoma. Many places near the front will
have showers and thunderstorms again, with larger clusters of
storms along the Carolina Coast, in the lower Mississippi Valley
and the southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A region of low pressure in extreme northern Minnesota will
bring showers and clouds to portions of the western Great Lakes.
Behind this system, cool and dry and air will filter to the south
across the northern Plains. Meanwhile, sunny skies are likely over
much of interior New England as high pressure moves into the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and low clouds are likely near the coast in the Pacific
Northwest as a jet stream disturbance at 18,000 feet moves onshore.
The jet stream over the Northwest is unusually fast-moving for this
time of year, allowing numerous disturbances to continually
approach the coastline. This will keep cool, damp weather anchored
in this region.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers are likely in Florida, especially in the
northern parts of the peninsula, as a weak disturbance promotes
thunderstorms. Much of the Southwest and Central Valley of
California will remain very hot and dry, with temperatures reaching
triple digits in lower elevations. Some locations from southwest
Texas to southern Arizona, however, will have isolated
thunderstorms during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Heat Wave &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An official heat wave was declared on Monday along the Northeast
Seaboard as temperatures from New York City to Boston climbed to 90
degrees or more for the third consecutive day. Reaching 90 degrees
for three consecutive days or more was proposed as a universal
criterion for a heat wave in 1900. But such a rigid criterion does
not take into account normal conditions in certain regions. For
example, the average daily high in Dallas reaches 90 on June 6 and
stays at 90 or above until September 12. Applying this definition
of a heat wave at Dallas ignores the city's `normal' summer heat.

COURIER TOUGHS OUT BRITISH ONSLAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ They've tried firing their two deadliest weapons at
him, baking him, dehydrating him, sticking needles in him,
squeezing him on line calls _ in his opinion, anyway _ and
drenching him. And still the English can't get rid of Jim Courier.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugliest American in these parts has been on a reign of
terror spanning two months, and while the natives applaud his
resiliency, they'd really rather bid him good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they're close, but they've been there before and they know
how comfortable he is on the precipice.
</P>
<P>
   Courier's two-fisted performance remained on hold Tuesday, as
did all the action at Wimbledon, inundated by rain and forced to
suspend play without a ball being struck. The postponement was
announced at approximately 6:30 p.m., some eight hours after the
grounds opened to approximately 30,000 fans who brought their
brollies but never got their jollies. For only the 30th time in the
113-year history of The Championships, there was not one stroke of
competition, and while the patrons received refunds,
concessionaires hit the jackpot on strawberries and cream,
champagne and Pimms, and souvenir seat cushions.
</P>
<P>
   And Courier lived on. The Grudge Match against Tim Henman _ who
was hoping to avenge the 3-2 first-round Davis Cup loss the United
States, principally Courier, inflicted on the Brits at Birmingham
in April _ remained where it had the night before when play
initially was suspended. Henman leads in sets, 2-1, and has a 4-3,
30-15 advantage in the fourth. Potentially, he's within two games
of victory, and he hoped to complete the job Tuesday. But the
closest he and Courier came to combat was standing around for three
minutes at Centre Court before rain shooed them back into the
players' locker room and the tarpaulins and tents were brought back
out. They'll try again Wednesday, but Henman and his countrymen
know better than to sleep easy on the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Courier became the scourge of the Empire when he outlasted first
top-ranked Brit Henman, 7-6, 2-6, 7-6, 6-7, 7-5, and then, in the
deciding match, No. 2 Rusedski, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 1-6, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   That signaled two things: Those attending the US-Australia
quarterfinal July 16-18 at Longwood should make late dinner
reservations when Courier plays; and his career is back on an
upswing.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 1 in the world the last time he advanced past the
second round at Wimbledon, 1992, Courier seemed to be washed up
this year at 28, as illustrated by his No. 62 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cup apparently was his elixir, and he has continued his
Rasputin impersonation here. A straight-set first-round breeze past
another unfortunate Brit, Barry Cowan, was an anomaly. Then
Courier, who came here with a vicious head cold, reverted to his
favorite style: long, grueling, and chock full of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Spaniard Carlos Moya was supposed to take care of him for the
hosts, but Courier outsweated him, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6), 5-7, 6-3,
on Centre Court. He surely was dead against Dutchman Sjeng Schalken
in the third round Friday, dropping the first two sets in stifling
heat. But he flat out refused to surrender, scrambled back to tie
the match, then won the protracted fifth-set duel, 13-11.
</P>
<P>
   After spending 4 hours 27 minutes dodging bullets, Courier
required intravenous treatment and was transported to a hospital.
But no sooner was the needle out of his arm than he was out of the
emergency room, and he returned to Wimbledon Saturday for a belated
press conference full of vim and vitriol. Having suffered severe
cramps before he received treatment the day before, he berated All
England Club officials for the absence of IVs on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only tournament _ only country _ that we play in
where this is the case, from what our trainers tell us,'' said
Courier. ``I'd heard this before from other players. They'd run
into the same brick wall of conservatism. I'm sure there are
different medical aspects here in this country, but you know,
top-level athletes should be above all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of his affection for hostile crowds _ the more
boisterous, the better. ``I've always been told or always heard
that I shouldn't do this or I couldn't do that,'' he said, ``and so
I'm used to those kind of naysayers, so to speak, so maybe that's
why I respond to that.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the past few weeks have rejuvenated him, restored
his juices more than any IV could. ``I think it's a new experience
for me,'' said Courier. ``I feel much older, much wiser. That's
probably a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman hopes to turn Courier's British domination into one, and
Wednesday, like Monday, he'll be backed by a capacity house of
13,813 who will scream his name at every pause, flaunt the Union
Jack, and savor every Courier misadventure.
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't work, they always can unleash pestilence and
famine. They've tried just about everything else against Courier.

NOTHING SHORT ABOUT BUNNY AUSTIN'S MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COULSTON, England _ Bunny Austin focuses his alert and kindly
blue-green eyes on the TV screen, and then looks out the window.
Same picture: rain. Lots of it. Not much of a day for the fair
ladies in their Wimbledon finery.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Henry Higgins had it wrong. Since he and Eliza Doolittle
were Londoners, he should have phrased it: The rain's a pain that
falls mainly on a plain called Wimbledon _ and has nothing to do
with Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it rained in my day, too,'' smiles Henry Wilfred ``Bunny''
Austin, a sartorial benefactor who ought to be remembered in the
prayers of every male tennis player. ``But I'm sorry when it rains
during Wimbledon because it's such a delight for me on the TV. I
can't get out anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunny Austin, who will be 93 in August, is the answer to a
couple of trivia questions. Who was the last Englishman to grace
the Wimbledon final? And who emancipated men's knees by amputating
his pant legs to introduce shorts on the international circuit?
</P>
<P>
   Before Bunny's revolutionary tailoring, long white flannel
trousers were the encumbering but accepted costume. ``I acknowledge
that I'm best known for that. But not very happy about it because I
was quite a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about that. Austin, cultivated, genial and sharp, has
been pretty much immobilized by a fall three years ago, and largely
forgotten. Sitting in his pleasant room in a retirement home
located in a bucolic sector of Surrey, he is most proud of the
framed document on the wall among sunny prints of Utrillo and Van
Gogh. It's his certificate of admission to a pantheon, the
International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon finalist in 1932 and 1938, French finalist in 1937, he
was a world top 10 resident 11 straight years from 1928, No. 2 in
1931 and 1938. Moreover, ``The most rewarding part of my career was
Davis Cup _ going to Paris to take it away from the French in 1933
and holding it until 1937.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin was a player, all right, but one who has lived in a
couple of shadows: the shorts breakthrough, and teammate Fred
Perry, the greatest of all Limeys, the last of their Wimbledon
champs, 1934-35-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it took two of us to win those four Davis Cups. Fred
couldn't do it alone,'' Bunny points out correctly. ``But he
usually got the credit.'' Yet Austin does hold the British singles
record in Davis Cup: 36-12.
</P>
<P>
   Don Budge, the 6-1, 6-0, 6-3, victor over Austin in 1938,
remembers him as ``a beautiful strokemaker, steady groundstrokes
and good volleys. Quick on his feet. He really played well that day
despite the score.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin nods. ``Don's nice to say that. I thought I hit the ball
all right, but at that time he was unplayable. The best I ever
faced. Don could have played with anyone today. I feel our great
players could have, but most players today are much better, and I
enjoy watching them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have imagined, though, in 1938 that I would be the
last Englishman in the final. All those years ago. Roger Taylor, a
semifinalist in 1973, should have won, but I've almost given up
hope. I'd like to see (Tim) Henman go all the way this year, but I
admire what (Jim) Courier did against us in the Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin was unlucky to reach finals that linked him with
juggernauts: Ellsworth Vines in 1932, then Budge, the original
Grand Slammer for whom Bunny represented the third side of that
quintessential quadrilateral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vines?'' he laughs about the 6-4, 6-2, 6-0, defeat. ``As
unplayable as Budge that day. He had 30 aces in 12 service games,
and some of them I never saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunny, who bears a schoolboy nickname _ ``I think it was my
protruding front teeth that gave me a sort of rabbit look'' _
feels, ``My best tennis was in Davis Cup. The finale of 1934, over
the US, when I beat Sidney Wood and Frank Shields. He was Brooke
Shields's grandfather, a great bon vivant, who once sailed to the
States by accident after the French. Frank was attending a
going-away party on a liner at Cherbourg, forgot to get off and
thus missed Wimbledon. The champagne must have been very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for shorts hit him ``in New England, either
Boston or Newport, 1932. It was ghastly hot. Flannels soaked with
sweat meant you carried an awful lot of weight between knee and
shoe. I'd played soccer in school, so why not shorts for tennis. It
made sense. I bought a pair in New York in 1932 and used them at
Forest Hills. The next year I wore them here, on Centre Court, and
thought there'd be a fuss. But no one cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor did they when my sister, Joan, was a bit daring in 1931,
the first woman to play on Centre without stockings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunny likes Anna Kournikova's attire and is sure his sister
would, too. ``I've seen it all. I remember seeing the champion,
Mrs. Lambert Chambers, in dresses to the ground, and the women
sometimes bleeding from the stays in their whalebone corsets.
Suzanne Lenglen came along and changed all that in 1919 with her
short skirts. She was absolutely hypnotic. Beautiful body. Moved
beautifully. I couldn't take my eyes off her.''
</P>
<P>
   A concierge in Monte Carlo couldn't take his eyes off Bunny, and
tried to be helpful. ``It was in my early days of shorts. I left
the hotel for the courts with a topcoat over mine. The man seemed
embarrassed, but he worriedly said, `Mr Austin, excuse me, but I
think you've forgotten your trousers.' I thanked him and
explained.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunny has forgotten little, and his Hall of Fame membership
assures that he'll be remembered.

(ATTN: N.C.)  
 RANDALL JARRELL: HOW A POETRY CRITIC BECOMES LOVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (editors: bold-faced words should be italicized)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I doubt there has been a critic since George Bernard Shaw who
got so much joy and outrage out of his subjects as Randall Jarrell;
but that wasn't the point about either man. The point was that
whether they were delighted or gloomy, their readers experienced
startled hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Leithauser introduces his selection of Jarrell's essays:
``Randall Jarrell once wrote, in praise of William Carlos Williams,
`When you have read ``Paterson'' you know for the rest of your life
what it is like to be a waterfall.' Yet there's another way to
ascertain what it is to be a phenomenon that flows, coruscates,
sings and revitalizes: you might turn to the essays of Jarrell
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, to continue this chain-infection _ of what? of
infectiousness _ there are Leithauser's coruscating and
revitalizing remarks about Jarrell. Jarrell was a veritable Typhoid
Mary when it came to generating pleasure by engaging with poetry.
Here are a few quotations.
</P>
<P>
   For the true gold (Jarrell bit it to test it, and his teeth were
sharp):
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Stevens. ``There is about him, under the translucent
glazes, a Dutch solidity and weight; he sits surrounded by all the
good things of this earth, with rosy cheeks and fresh clear blue
eyes, eyes not going out to you but shining in their place, like
fixed stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Moore: ``She has great limitations _ her work is one
long triumph of them.'' Not  &UR; over &LR;  them but  &UR; of &LR;  them; as you might
say a pride  &UR; of &LR;  lions. For Jarrell, great poetry can make even
worms glow, not as glowworms but as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For gilt or brass or fool's gold:
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Spender, who began one poem with the line, ``I think
continually of those who were truly great'': ``It isn't Mr. Spender
but a small, simple _ determinedly simple _ part of Mr. Spender
that writes the poems; the poet is a lot smarter man than his style
allows him to seem. (If he were as soft and sincere and sentimental
as most of his poems make him out to be, the rabbits would have
eaten him for lettuce, long ago.)''
</P>
<P>
   On W.H. Auden, plain, reasoned and socially responsible: ``We
see not the will, but the understanding, trying to do the work of
the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Also _ not because it is poetry but because it is as pertinent
as 40 years ago _ Jarrell on the optimism of the Enlightenment:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us know, now, that Rousseau was wrong: that man, when
you knock his chains off, sets up the death camps. Soon we shall
know everything the 18th century didn't know, and nothing it did,
and it will be hard to live with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell died in 1965. Leithauser and Michael di Capua (once
Jarrell's loving and beloved editor and now the publisher of this
collection) know perfectly well that he was wrongly buried, and
that it only takes uncovering the grave for him to resume a nervy
literary conversation that is as pungent today as it was then.
</P>
<P>
   Take the spirited survey of 50 years of American poetry that
Jarrell delivered at a 1963 White House literary bash organized by
the Kennedy administration. You feel not just how fresh and apt his
pronouncements still are but also how irreplaceable. We are going
to need another such assessment of what will be rounding up to
another 50 years; and we won't get it because nobody argues poetry
that way anymore: inhabiting and performing it.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with this collection is a memoir of Jarrell by his
widow, Mary von Schrader Jarrell. They lived in Greensboro, N.C.,
where he taught at a branch of the University of North Carolina
until one night when a car struck and killed him while he was out
walking. There were rumors of suicide, but Mrs. Jarrell quietly
chooses to believe the official accident verdict; rightly, no
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Her memoir is a tribute to the man, the poet and their marriage.
Her gifts as a writer are limited: the reiterated finding of
happiness is not so much conveyed as willed. In its selective
details the memoir is more of a sundial than a weather report.
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a bit of sun. If an awkward sublimity creeps in
when Mrs. Jarrell celebrates the relationship, some of her offhand
sketches are very fine. There is a wry portrait of the pride of
poets _ vanity of poets would be more like it _ at the White House
meeting. There is the glowing, courtly Jarrell trying to sell Allen
Ginsberg on Robert Frost. He was barely a few lines into ``Home
Burial'' when the Beat poet broke in: ``Coupla squares yakking.''
</P>
<P>
   The memoir's most sensitively written passages concern Jarrell's
frequent, painful blockages as a poet. Other poets have praised his
disinterested ardor in advancing their work; Robert Lowell is cited
by Leithauser : ``Randall was the only man I have ever met who
could make other writers feel that their work was more important to
him than his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was the key: an instinct, one that made him such an
extraordinary critic, for pitching his tent on the common ground of
poetry in preference to his particular pea patch. What a contrast
with the Alpha-poet claim staking of a Frost, a John Berryman and
of Lowell himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jarrell tenderly notes her husband's pain and his recourse
to filling the vacuum with years of translating ``Faust.'' ``There,
at his side, I saw in the bewildering absence of his own art how an
artist endures a time of self-extinction and longs for something to
fill that void.'' But it is in his words more than hers _ he was
the writer, after all _ that we catch a glimpse of her constancy
and behind it, her own pain:
</P>
<P>
   ``During these times the only person who helps much is my wife:
she always acts as if I'd written the last poem yesterday and were
about to write the next one tomorrow.''

NEVER TOO OLD FOR ROMANCE AND SAFE SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, July 6.)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a delicate topic but someone better be talking to Aunt
Ethel about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's out dating again she could be having sex (and why
not?) and she needs to know that she is just as much at risk as
anyone getting involved with a new partner.
</P>
<P>
   So before she comes back from her cruise with a T-shirt saying
``All I got in the Caribbean was HIV'' she needs to know about the
new facts of life.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to be a swinging senior but not if you end up
with AIDS, a message that health workers are trying to get across
to a generation that may not have had new lovers or even sex for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Older people, an age category that can start as low as 50 or
from 65 on up, depending on who you're talking to, are not a huge
risk group for AIDS but a definite one. In California in 1998,
people age 50 and older accounted for almost 12 percent of the
state's AIDS cases. Men in their 60s and older accounted for 2
percent of AIDS cases. Women in the 65-and-older group accounted
for 3 percent of the AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   Had they been tested early enough they might have mitigated the
disease with medication before the HIV virus turned into full-blown
AIDS. But you know how it is with some people. They were raised
differently. They're squeamish talking about sex of any kind, let
alone safe sex. And until now they've been pretty much ignored by
AIDS education and prevention efforts, which focused largely on
young people.
</P>
<P>
   For older people AIDS wasn't a factor when they were last out
looking for lovers. Unless it's affected a friend or relative, the
most they know about AIDS is what they read. Until they rejoined
the dating circuit, exposure to AIDS might not have been relative
to their life.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who may never have taken sex education. These
are women whose biggest worry around sex was an unwanted pregnancy
but that concern eventually ended. Yet, being post-menopausal is no
protection against AIDS or Hepatitis C or other sexually
transmitted diseases that weren't as virulent or even known in
early birds-and-bees lectures.
</P>
<P>
   These are men who haven't carried a condom in their wallets
since they rolled their cigarettes in their T-shirt sleeve and who,
even if they contracted a disease in the past, didn't experience it
as long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's AIDS and the times demand that older people have
to deal with some of the same cold facts that young lovers do. Like
talking about having sex before you have it. Like not giving into
the passion of the moment unless there's protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to talk about the C-word _ condoms,'' said Mary
Flett, who's been an AIDS education worker since the epidemic
began. ``There's reluctance.''
</P>
<P>
   One professional woman in her mid-50s said she ended a
relationship because the man took offense when she insisted he use
a condom. He was insulted, she said, even though she explained the
domino theory of AIDS. The HIV virus can incubate for seven to 10
years. It doesn't matter how confident you are of the health status
of your own sex partner, you don't know about that partner's former
partners. And so on. She was married and having babies during the
free- love period. By the time she was divorced and back to meeting
men, casual sex was risky business, although she says not all men
her age see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like his attitude,'' she said. ``I told him you
should be just as worried about me as I am about you.''
</P>
<P>
   While AIDS isn't the death sentence it once was, health worker
Flett asked, ``Who wants to be dealing with other issues of aging
and get an HIV diagnosis on top?''
</P>
<P>
   Viagra has increased the need for new AIDS vigilance upon the
part of born-again romantics, said Flett, who's with the Center for
HIV Prevention and Care in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have someone who hasn't been sexually active and now has
the opportunity. But they also need some awareness and sense of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to anyone in a new relationship is the same
regardless of age. Use a condom and get an HIV test if you think
you've been exposed to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The test isn't routine in a general blood test but you can ask
your doctor for one. If that's awkward there are anonymous testing
sites where you can test and also get good tips on healthy sex with
no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a belief system that people over a certain
age don't have sex at all,'' said Flett.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there is assurance, from Bob Dole and others, that this
isn't true. Sex doesn't necessarily have an age limit.
Unfortunately, neither does AIDS.

Porsche's new 911. Only one thing about the convertibles that
Porsche builds hasn't changed or been upgraded by technological
advances in 50 years of motorcar making: the simple fun of driving
a topless car. It doesn't matter whether it's a shiny six-figure
exotic from abroad or a rusting three-figure junker from the

nothing else _ and the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet does it with
exceptional grace. (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

In January, on her 75th birthday, Newman bought a Dell Dimension
model and signed up for a computer class from SeniorNet, a
nationwide, nonprofit program designed to make older Americans
comfortable with a computer. (Mahoney, Austin American-Statesman)

</P>
<P>
   FORUMS _ The Usenet forum was for owners of Chia pets, those
ceramic animals from mail-order TV. And there in the list of
subjects was a query from someone desperate to keep her dog from
chasing cars. A chia dog that chases cars? That would be worth
sending a photographer, if those TV prowl vans don't beat us to it.
And there was another pottery-pet question asking whether a mother
cat would adopt a kitten from someone else's litter. And some
advice on controlling fleas (another startling problem, considering
recent advances in ceramic technology). And someone complaining
that her landlord won't let her keep a ferret. (Stough, Austin

Emerson Research, a branch of Emerson Radio Corp., introduced a new

Oceanic and Aerospace Administration weather warning radio

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ One of the defenders for the Pristina
soccer club might move a little slowly this year. He's coming off
the disabled list from a shrapnel wound from his time in the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But, 27-year-old Hysni Gjinovci(CQ) felt good kicking a ball
around Tuesday while his teammates jogged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the second greatest day for me. The first was the
liberation, this is second,'' Gjinovci said. ``This is my love. I
love soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Made possible by the withdrawal of Serb troops and the
protection of NATO peacekeepers, ethnic Albanians re-entered the
Pristina stadium as players for the first time in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer practice was a sign, two weeks after NATO entered
this war-shattered province, that aspects of normality are slowly
returning to its provincial capital. Street lights are beginning to
work, a few restaurants have opened and, according to British
military police, the number of murders is steadily dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1989, when Serbia removed the autonomous status of
the province of Kosovo, official soccer teams were purged of ethnic
Albanian players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian players were not allowed to play in the 40,000 seat
stadium. They formed their own parallel leagues and tried to play
in small villages and fields, often being made to stop by Serb
police.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian leaders of the local soccer teams wanted to show that
they, too, are getting back to business. They held a mid-day
exhibition in front of about 60 pleased fans.
</P>
<P>
   The field was a little shaggy and the players rusty. They played
a half-field scrimmage only.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the stands, the locker rooms still showed the creepy
signs of occupation by Serb troops, who ran a campaign of
atrocities during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Two empty
ammunition crates sat on a training table, blood stained the seats
by the lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the players held a moment of silence for the many
ethnic Albanians killed _ several players are still missing and at
least one is known murdered. Then they turned to applaud their 60
fans and popped open champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Beqir Aliu was president of the Pristina team until 1989. He was
repeatedly arrested by Serbs as he tried to organize black-market
games. His brother, a soccer player, was killed by Serb troops
during the NATO air war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the happiest day of my life. This is the only moment
that I have forgotten about my brother,'' said the 48-year-old Aliu
as he watched the team take the field. ``I promised I would restart
... Sports brings people together.''

 &HT;    Becoming educated about gay issues
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on in the documentary ``It's Elementary: Talking About Gay
Issues in School,'' a curly-haired fourth-grader sums up his
feelings about homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how their life is, they're gay. So what?'' he says with
the kind of moral certitude only a 9-year-old can muster. Then,
without missing a beat, he raises a more pressing issue with his
teacher: ``Can I go to the bathroom now?''
</P>
<P>
   With a chipper earnestness and a bare-bones premise, ``It's
Elementary'' profiles a half-dozen schools around the country that
are incorporating lessons about gay life into their curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to teach diversity and tolerance, the schools invite
speakers into their classrooms, hold weeklong celebrations and have
teachers lead students in candid discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone's pleased. The Christian Coalition of
Georgia petitioned WPBA president Milton Clipper and Gov. Roy
Barnes to cancel the broadcast, saying it ``promotes a lifestyle
that is unhealthy and in direct contradiction to the traditional
family model.''
</P>
<P>
   The station's decision to air the program would seem courageous
under different circumstances. But this isn't ``Tales From the
City,'' the 1994 miniseries that featured gay and straight sex that
got sister station WGTV in hot water with conservative critics.
</P>
<P>
   For one, there is no explicit sex talk. When a curious middle
schooler asks a guest speaker ``how do you guys do it?'' he
politely tells her he's not allowed to discuss his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to recruit you,'' he tells her. ``We are not
here to make you gay or lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, trying to make the students think. At times
it seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   It's evident as a group of fourth-graders listens to Disney's
``The Lion King'' theme song and are surprised that the pop idol
who sings it, Elton John, is gay. There's also the unmistakable
flash of insight as a group of second graders discover a schoolmate
has two mothers at home, not a mom and a dad.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad such moments are few. Once you get over the built-in
shock of children discussing homosexuality in school, there's not
much else here to keep it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It feels somewhat lopsided. Producers Helen S. Cohen and Debra
Chasnoff open the program with canned footage of a senator from New
Hampshire criticizing the homosexual curriculum as ``filth,'' and
there are later clips of irate parents protesting in New York. Both
images have a tacked-on look.
</P>
<P>
   What saves ``It's Elementary'' are the students; hopeful, smart,
precocious, funny kids who are learning how to handle a reality
some of their parents still have a hard time talking about.

 &HT;    `Greatest Commercials' not enough of good thing
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billing a special as the ``50 Greatest Commercials of All Time''
and then limiting it only to American ads is like listing the 50
best soccer players of all time and only counting Americans. It's
beyond narrow-minded, bordering on ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a world traveler to know that many of the
most creative (and outrageous) TV commercials are devised for
consumers in Great Britain, Japan and Australia. Heck, British beer
commercials alone rival the best of what America has produced.
</P>
<P>
   But we love our lists, so TV Guide polled 37 (American)
advertising executives as to what they thought were the best.
Although the criteria are never explained, it's hard to argue with
their top choice: Apple's famous ``1984'' ad, which ran only once,
during the 1984 Super Bowl. It was both fabulously produced
(directed by Ridley Scott, with an anti-Orwell, smashing-Big
Brother theme) and very effective: the Macintosh personal computer
it introduced flew off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Also ranking high: two classic Volkswagen ads from the '60s (the
funeral procession and the guy who drives the snowplow),
Alka-Seltzer's ``spicy meatballs'' and Federal Express'
fast-talking guy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its self-imposed limitations, what's most frustrating is
that there isn't one single ad that's presented in its entirety
without interruption. So we see Clara Peller bellowing ``Where's
the beef?'' and the little dog saying ``Yo quiero Taco Bell,'' as
tiny snippets. But what else could they have done to fit 50
commercials (plus the commercials that support the show about
commercials) into a half-hour?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who cares about TV commercials _ how they work, why the
good ones are so good _ might check out ``The 100 Best TV
Commercials'' (Times Books, $29.95), a new book independent of the
TV Guide list and TVLand special. International in scope and with
better analysis (it also ends up ranking ``1984'' as the best
commercial ever), the only thing missing from the book is the
ability to watch Michael Jordan and Larry Bird do their ``nothing
but net'' bit for McDonald's.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   8 tonight on TVLand.

KOSOVO'S GYPSIES: USED BY SERBS, HATED BY ALBANIANS 
</HEADLINE>

 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ Every morning, the Gypsy grave digger made
his rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a garbage truck through this town's ravaged streets,
Jevded Mazreco would go about the gruesome task of collecting
bodies of people slaughtered by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Mazreco says he buried more than 300 murdered ethnic Albanians
during Serbia's methodical three-month campaign of ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would bury 15 here and 12 there,'' he said. ``They made us
do this. It was either dig the graves, or die.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsies of Kosovo, or Rom, as they call themselves, said
they were forced laborers for the Yugoslav Army, police, and
paramilitary units that rampaged through Kosovo. Now the Gypsies
are labeled collaborators by the Kosovo Liberation Army and have
become the focus of brutal revenge by KLA troops and returning
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbian forces withdrawn and many Serb civilians fleeing,
the Gypsies are the ones left behind to blame. Hundreds of Gypsies
who tried to escape to Serbia were sent back to Kosovo by Serb
border officials. It seems once again Europe's Gypsies are caught
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It is the history of the Rom. In this conflict, and in wars and
campaigns of terror over the centuries, Gypsies have been forced to
choose sides to live. In this war as in many others, the Gypsies
have chosen the wrong one. But their role may also hold a key to
their survival.
</P>
<P>
   They know where the bodies are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Mazreco pulled hard on a hand-rolled cigarette as he pointed to
several large mounds of earth on the fringes of a Muslim cemetery
and said, ``I buried an entire family there, at least 12 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia, located in the Hague, which is seeking to
collect evidence to support the indictment of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and others, have interviewed Mazreco at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what it was like to pick up the bodies of children
and whole families?'' he asked. ``Do you think anyone would do this
if they were not forced to?''
</P>
<P>
   The father of six children said he mostly hides in his home now,
fearing that he will be labeled a collaborator and killed. He
insisted he was never paid for his grisly labor.
</P>
<P>
   He was simply told where to collect the bodies by the head of
the Prizren Public Works Department, Jova Vanovic, and the local
head of the feared Ministry of Interior Police, Petrovic Jakovic,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   This, investigators said, is an example of how Gypsies could
provide crucial insight to not just the location of mass graves,
but an understanding of the Serbian chain of command in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Mazreco, 45, had worked for several years as a
laborer in the Public Works Department. He mostly collected garbage
and occasionally dug graves.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mazreco was paid $20 a month for his work. But during the
war, he said, he was not given a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Works offical ``Vanovic told me my payment was that I
would not be killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks of slaughter and the nights of heavy NATO air
raids, Mazreco said, he would hear the Serbian officials gathering
at the Public Works Department garage joking about the use of a
garbage truck to dispose of the ethnic Albanian victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried when I saw those poor people who had been killed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic Albanians do not buy the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Nejar Betuca, 50, an ethnic Albanian refugee who had just
returned from living three months in a refugee camp to find his
home burned and looted, burst his way into the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just as responsible as the Serbs. They are
collaborators,'' he said, pointing a finger at Mazreco and three
other Gypsies standing in the Public Works Department lot filled
with broken tractors, smashed cars, and old trucks. Betuca was
there looking for his stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   ``They guided the paramilitaries to our homes to kill us and
then they stole everything we owned,'' said Betuca, being held back
from the Gypsies by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Albanians haven't held back in attacking Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Five Gypsies were found killed in a field last week in the
village of Obilic by NATO forces who theorized that they had been
branded collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, German NATO troops found 25 KLA fighters who had
taken 15 elderly Gypsies to the Interior Ministry building in
Prizren for allegedly looting the homes of ethnic Albanians. One
Gypsy was found dead with his hands chained to a chair. The others,
most of whom were chained to radiators, said they were beaten and
told they would be executed before the peacekeeping troops raided
the building and disarmed the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the reigns of conquering empires, from the Ottomans
to the Hapsburgs to the Nazis, the Gypsies have been persecuted and
forced to keep moving in a diaspora that stretches from Russia to
Spain to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 Yugoslav census puts the number of Rom in Kosovo at
35,000 out of a total of 1.4 million. As in other European
countries, they live on the margins of society, cobbling an
existence out of day labor and street peddling. They are a closed
society with a deep mistrust of the ``gadge,'' or ``outsiders,'' as
they refer to all non-Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Gypsies move quickly out of war zones. During the
Bosnian war, most Bosnian Gypsies moved into Serbia; their caravans
lined the Danube River. But the NATO airstrikes knocked out bridges
and trapped many inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a ramshackle Gypsy village near Obilic, Fehmi Haliti, 46,
fearfully peered through a crack in a door newly reinforced with
corrugated tin before finally coming outside with a friend who held
a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   He is a local leader of the Rom community and explained that the
Gypsies of Kosovo have two divided cultures, one speaks Albanian
and one Serbian. The chiefs of these two different Gypsy clans were
represented at the peace talks in Rambouillet before the
negotiations collapsed and led to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the story of the Rom. We have always had to survive in
the middle of conflict. We will survive again, and we will move on
when we can. But now people are just trying to stay alive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating how the Gypsies exist within conflict, the grave
digger Mazreco was busy last Thursday burying the body of an
80-year-old Serb man who died of an apparent heart attack when KLA
soldiers kicked in the door of his home.
</P>
<P>
   A UN official who arranged the funeral said the Gypsies were the
only ones they could find to dig a grave for a Serb.

dubbed IDENT, didn't include a red flag to alert agents when
Resendez- Ramirez's fingerprints were scanned after his June 2
apprehension. The IDENT system, according to agents, is set up to
tell them how many times an immigrant has been detained, not to
give them the criminal history of everyone they catch _ it is not
linked to national crime networks like NCIC. Still, a California
agent says the suspected killer's prior deportations should have
caused agents to probe deeper into his past. (Harmon, Austin

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is addressed to the hibachi haters of the world, which is
to say everyone who finds crude little charcoal grills so dirty,
slow and inconvenient in countless other ways that they can wreck
any holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative: miniature gas grills. They are,
relatively speaking, pristine. By comparison with their charcoal
brethren, they are nearly effort free. But by definition, they are
also less powerful than a full-size gas grill; even a small
charcoal grill can get hotter. Can you actually grill well on them?
And how do the different brands compare?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that while there are a great number of the little
charcoal versions, there are really only two miniature gas models
available: the Coleman Powermax Grill Stove and the Weber
Go-Anywhere Gas Grill. To test them, I borrowed a neighbor's patio
for an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Both grills are a cinch to set up. The Coleman opens like a
suitcase, and has wings attached to the lid, which prop up and act
as wind guards. Gas canisters, which must be purchased specifically
for this grill, simply screw into the back and it's ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Weber requires a little assembly. It is more like a standard
grill, raised off the ground and fitted with a lid and a wooden
handle. It takes small propane canisters, which can be purchased in
hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of grilling in New York City. It is
illegal to bring gas canisters that are heavier than one pound into
a building in the city. (Both of these grills use canisters that
weigh less than a pound.) Grills must also be placed at least 10
feet away from any combustible surface and you must have either a
hose connected to a water source or a 16-quart pail of water
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Though the little Weber has an automatic starter, I had to light
it by hand. It seemed to be getting very hot, very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   After heating the grill on high for 15 minutes, I laid down my
first experiment: spicy poultry sausages. Nothing happened. I
checked the heat. It was indeed as high as it would go. I bent down
closer to the grilling surface. If I listened very, very carefully
I could hear a faint sputtering, a suggestion of cooking. There was
no smoke.
</P>
<P>
   While the sausages warmed, I moved on to skewered scallops. I
brushed some with olive oil and wrapped others in bacon. When I
laid them on the grill, I heard my first sizzle. Fat, I realized,
was essential to getting anything resembling a grill-like sear.
Without it, this was just going to be an outdoor toaster oven.
</P>
<P>
   I set the lid on top of the grill, and soon there was more
sizzling and a ribbon of smoke. As the bacon cooked, it dripped fat
and scallop juice onto what is called a flavorizer bar _ a vented
cover over the gas flame invented to replace lava rocks. When the
fat and juice hit the flavorizer bar, they immediately cook off,
circulating aroma and smoke inside the grill. I was getting
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The scallops wrapped in bacon cooked best, browning lightly on
the edges, and the sausages eventually cooked through but never
developed the deep grill marks and blistering I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Slabs of Vidalia onion brushed with oil browned on the edges and
softened slowly _ a pleasant effect not easily achieved with a hot
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Burgers made of ground chuck roast, not a terribly lean cut,
dripped and sizzled, as did lamb chops brushed with olive oil. But
with the lid down and the searing slow, the lamb chops cooked too
slowly. They browned on the outside but cooked through further than
I would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The grill worked. Kind of. With rigging, the food
browned. But it was underwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   I called the Weber-Stephen Products Co., the maker of the grill,
to see what it thought of the performance. Unfortunately, it seems,
it has limited ambition for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like comparing a grape to a full-blown piece of fruit,''
Betty Hughes, the company's director of consumer affairs, said of
the miniature grill relative to the larger backyard grills.
``There's just no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   My hopes for the Coleman Powermax Grill Stove, which appeared
more a camping convenience than a serious cook's appliance, had
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   I heated the grill to high and placed a fat round slice of onion
on top. Within a minute, it had dark, distinct grill stripes on it.
I actually needed to turn the heat (italics)down!(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   There is no flavorizer bar in the Coleman grill. The grill rack
is closer to the heating element and the base than the Weber, so
any drippings cook on the base, sending up wafts of smoke and
flavor to the food cooking above.
</P>
<P>
   There is also temperature variation on the grill. It is cooler
on the perimeter and hotter in the center, so when grilling the
onions for instance, I first browned them on the center, then moved
them to the exterior to finish cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The Coleman also has an extra feature: a gas burner. If you're
camping, this is great for any number of tasks: boiling water,
cooking hot cereal, heating canned soups. It is also helpful for
terrace grilling. You can heat a sauce or keep a marinade warm
while you grill meats.
</P>
<P>
   The sausages were next. Their casings blistered and colored, and
the meat heated through in just a few minutes. The grill striped
the scallops without drying them out or overcooking them. There is
no lid for the grill and it does not need one.
</P>
<P>
   But the real proof that this grill could do its job as well as
any miniature charcoal stove was when I cooked the burgers and lamb
chops. They crackled and sizzled the moment they touched down on
the grill. The burgers gained deep mahogany marks on both sides and
were perfectly pink in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The fat on the edges of the lamb chop warped and curled under
the heat, and the chops crisped beautifully on the outside while
staying rare on the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Grills are designed to sear food. And as these two grills made
clear, some sear food better than others. Both grills run on 10,000
British thermal units.
</P>
<P>
   BTUs, however, do not measure the efficiency of a particular
grill, or how quickly it sears food.
</P>
<P>
   That is where design comes in. On the Weber, the heat source is
farther from the grilling surface than on the Coleman, making it
more difficult to get it as hot as it needs to be. The Coleman has
another advantage: the base under the gas source is close to it and
angled upward so that heat is reflected in the direction of the
grilling surface, increasing its efficiency even more.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes the difference between outdoor grilling and
outdoor toasting.
</P>
<P>
   The Coleman Powermax Grill Stove is $139.99 at Paragon Athletic
Goods Corp., 867 Broadway (18th Street); (212) 255-8036. Coleman
Powermax Fuel is $4.50 for 6 ounces and $5.50 for 10.6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The Weber Go-Anywhere Grill is $54.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway
(80th Street); (212) 787-2000. Propane fuel is available at
hardware stores. &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: LESS WOULD BE MORE _ JAZZ FESTIVAL BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where there is jazz, there are inflated expectations.
Jazz is patriotism, American genius, our home-grown cultural
aristocracy. People who really love jazz routinely misunderstand
the scale of its popularity; they wonder why the pride of American
culture doesn't have a large audience.
</P>
<P>
   One result of this attitude, in the case of New York's two big
summer jazz festivals, Bell Atlantic Jazz and JVC Jazz, is that
``jazz'' _ the construct, the marketing word, the mystique _ is too
expensive to be supported by the music itself. The jazz needs to be
supported by other forms of music that share its audience (a
tradition of jazz festivals since the late 1960s) and by nostalgia,
which is more problematic. Nostalgia never fails to sell tickets
but usually results in lackluster shows.
</P>
<P>
   That is why I'll remember the 1999 Bell Atlantic festival
principally for a rock show by the Japanese band the Boredoms and
the JVC festival mostly for the nonjazz concerts by the Brazilian
performers Carlinhos Brown (two-thirds full) and Caetano Veloso
(sold out) that closed it last week. And that seems strange.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the two jazz festivals _ the mainstream, big-ticket
JVC and the more alternative, scrappy Bell Atlantic (previously
Texaco and Heineken) _ have gone through various phases of working
together and standing in opposition. The business story may be of
little interest to jazz fans; what's important is that the
festivals once offered different strengths. But now, with not quite
more concerts than ever but still a whopping number (38 at JVC this
year, 120 at Bell Atlantic), both are suffering from a lack of
identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Atlantic festival, which is produced by Knit Media and
therefore uses the Knitting Factory as its flagship performance
space, had a very representative time at the club from June 3 to
13: it was basically a sampling of the normal run of events there
throughout the year (with exceptions _ a rare reunion of members of
Ronald Shannon Jackson's Decoding Society, a series of Berlin-based
groups with no American reputation, a night of Charlie Haden duets,
a night of Dave Douglas bands).
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, programming based on the normal musical life of
the city, the bricks and mortar of the scene, feels honest, and it
answers the need to represent the state of the music. But in
practice, a schedule that swamps a few special attractions with the
ordinary fails to distinguish festival time from nonfestival time _
except that ticket prices double and audiovisual equipment captures
the music for Internet downloading.
</P>
<P>
   This is all to the good for those who have the proper Bell
Atlantic high-speed Internet connections and are in remote cities
and don't get to hear a lot of live music. But computer stuff
aside, we are physically in New York, yes? (On the plus side,
sponsorship by a telecommunications giant also led to a series of
music seminars for high school students on the Web, and at the
festival's Web site, www.jazfest.com, one can also custom design a
CD of live material from the festival.)
</P>
<P>
   For bigger events, Bell Atlantic Jazz used other spaces: Town
Hall for Grover Washington Jr. (booked partly as a corporate event
for Bell Atlantic brass), Roseland for the neo-swing band Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy (expensive tickets, expensive to produce, and it
didn't sell out), and the South Street Seaport Atrium for a
combination of rock and jazz shows.
</P>
<P>
   One has to admire Knit Media's simple achievement of booking
some great-to-interesting-to-loony noncommercial acts at the
Seaport Atrium, a major stage at a major festival. They included
the reunion of the free jazz group the New York Art Quartet (June
13), and the Boredoms _ who played one of the most purposeful and
mysterious performances (June 9) I've ever witnessed. To its great
credit, the festival did mix the two perceived camps of jazz _
tradition and the vanguard. But it did so without conceptual
muscle; since the downtown esthetic is about mixing and matching,
more attention should be drawn to how easily these supposedly
opposite teams can share stages and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the South Street Seaport Atrium: if it were one of
the wonders of the world, perhaps concertgoers wouldn't have minded
paying $20 to $30 to go there for bad sound. It does have a
pleasant deck overlooking the East River. Inside, however, it's a
mall, and experiencing concerts there was every bit as dispiriting
as going to hear art music at a food court (with a loud sports bar
one floor below). The planning and execution of individual nights
there also left much to be desired. For a night of female singers
on June 11, promoters seemed to expect that a middle-aged,
mainstream-jazz crowd would sit through five acts until after 1
a.m. in an unappealing place. The Skatalites concert on June 10
started almost two hours late and an electronic music night on June
4 had lost most of its crowd by 3 a.m., after interminable waits
between sets. This was not just a lack of creature comforts; it was
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   I think I would even give up comfort for better programming,
though. Where were the special lineups of past years, with groups
from Amsterdam, Chicago and elsewhere that we've heard about but
don't often get to see? And where were the experimental jazz groups
that have generated buzz, like Peter Broetzmann's Tentet (it played
in Quebec the week before Bell Atlantic started), the quintet led
by the MacArthur grant recipient Ken Vandermark (it played at
Tonic, in Manhattan, a week after Bell Atlantic ended) and the big
band led by pianist Guillermo Klein (he lives in New York), for
three examples?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One word: tributes. Homages to fallen idols suffused the JVC
jazz festival this year, as they did last year; almost a third of
its 38 concerts were homages to figures of jazz's past.
</P>
<P>
   In classical music, there's the concept of the premiere, an
enticement for any concertgoer who wants to stay current; it
narrows the focus of attention to a  &UR; thing &LR; , a new work. Jazz
musicians, of course, deal with the very fluid matter of group
improvisation, which at its best results in a changing experience
from night to night; they don't often come up with new long-form
compositions. So the jazz version of the thing-centered big event
has become the tribute concert.
</P>
<P>
   Compare JVC '99 to JVC '89, when only two of the 38 shows were
tributes. Look at who was still alive and playing in that festival:
Joe Williams, Art Blakey, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Gerry
Mulligan, Mel Torme, Don Pullen. Sure, one didn't need so many
tributes then. But on the other hand, is jazz not still freshly
made? Are people under 45, the not particularly nostalgic, just not
buying tickets? Jazz needs some new popular figures, it's true, but
shouldn't we be scaling down if necessary in order to move on?
</P>
<P>
   Some tributes this year came off well: Cassandra Wilson's homage
to Miles Davis, which she has been developing for years, and Ken
Peplowski's program of Benny Goodman big-band music, with which he
has previously toured. But tributes in general are frustrating.
It's difficult for any band to capture the essence of a beloved
composer, and the spectacle of soloists' filing onstage one after
another to grab one's attention becomes wearying. Newly
commissioned arrangements of old music would be wonderful, but
unless you're talking about a group that's part of an institution _
the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, say _ it's hard to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the festival _ with smaller audiences _ were some of
the best working bands and musicians in jazz: Dave Holland's
quintet, Greg Osby's quartet, solo piano performances by Brad
Mehldau and Gonzalo Rubalcaba. Working bands tend to provide great
nights of music, whatever the theme or rubric; they need to be
programmed as much as possible, as opposed to ad hoc supergroups.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of James Moody in two consecutive concerts _ as a
guest with Dave Brubeck on June 20 and playing the ``Charlie Parker
With Strings'' material the following night _ almost but not quite
constituted a thread: one more night of his terrific playing,
perhaps with a young saxophonist like Mark Turner (they made a
little-heard record together two years ago), and it might have
drawn some welcome attention to Moody and to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately it's hard for a critic to get a consensus reading on
either festival, because there weren't many surprises; with the
dust cleared, there's strangely little to talk about, and it
resists falling into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   There are some possible solutions to the nebulous character of
the festivals. One _ especially for Bell Atlantic _ is to put more
thought and more money into fewer concerts. The other _ especially
for JVC _ is to scale down. There's no need to abandon Carnegie or
Avery Fisher for the few artists who attract large audiences, like
Oscar Peterson and Cassandra Wilson. But JVC could start using more
small halls, clubs and outdoor spaces (how about some actual
festivity?) for smart, well-programmed bills; a result might be to
give the festival a sense of more deliberate planning, a curator's
touch rather than an opportunistic, whoever's-available feel.
</P>
<P>
   Both festivals desperately need to develop themes and threads
that provide personality. (Montreal's jazz festival does this with
its ``Invitation'' series, runs of three or four consecutive nights
spotlighting the same musician in a different context. It's an idea
worth stealing.)
</P>
<P>
   As far as I could tell, fewer critics than usual attended the
shows this year. Perhaps it's only the critics who have been there
and done that, not the New York jazz audiences. But based on the
excitement stirred up by other, smartly programmed, not exactly
competing summer festivals this summer _ the Vision Festival,
Tonic's New Music Festival and Central Park Summerstage _ I'm not
so sure. Everybody likes a fresh idea presented in the right size.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The heat is making people do weird things to ice
cream. Crazy things. Flavors like bay leaf, oatmeal, Serrano chili,
Sichuan peppercorn, honey-blossom water with dates.
</P>
<P>
   Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Happens every summer now. Chefs and their pastry pros get an
urge to start throwing everything but the busboy into their creme
anglaise: root vegetables, herbs, Belgian beer. And New York diners
keep pushing them further by actually eating the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the special ice creams and sorbets at Avenue
include that old standby white pepper, along with tomato cumin,
roasted beet, cucumber, garden mint, Tahitian vanilla steeped in
bourbon and, during the garlic festival in August, garlic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like cloyingly sweet things,'' said Scott Campbell,
Avenue's co-owner, chef and resident ice cream maker. No kidding.
Campbell trained as a saucier, and that's how he thinks of his
savory-sweet confections. ``The interesting thing about ice cream
is it's a sauce,'' he said, ``a sauce that's frozen and then
served.'' His garlic ice cream has some sauces in it, too (Tabasco
and Worcestershire), and is served with steak tartare, though one
customer ordered an entire bowl of the stuff for dessert ``and
survived,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   More ice cream is consumed in July than in any other month, and
most of it is still vanilla, according to the International Ice
Cream Association in Washington. In much of the country, that means
towering sugar cones dribbling over small hands, pints of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's devoured in binges of guilt and heartbreak, and more
business for the place with the 31 flavors.
</P>
<P>
   But here in New York, we'll be comparing notes on the corn ice
cream at Mesa Grill versus Bolivar's purple corn. Which, discerning
palettes want to know, tastes less like a can of niblets?
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Harley Brachman, the pastry chef at Mesa Grill and Bolo,
is an exuberant defender of his Southwestern inventions. ``Corn in
half the world is used as a dessert,'' he said. Serrano chili and
jalapeno also have what Brachman calls a ``historical background.''
The Aztecs put hot peppers in chocolate, he said. He puts them in
ice cream _ a startling marriage with a potent aftertaste you
either love or want to rename Brachman's Revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to combine gooey and creamy and crunchy and creamy,''
he said, employing the technical terminology of his trade. He's
doing cactus pear at Mesa Grill and, at its Spanish-inspired sister
restaurant, Bolo, he's got a fig and a honey quince ice made with a
quince paste called membrillo often taken at breakfast in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-branding is the buzzword in the retail ice cream world:
mixtures involving Breyer's ice cream plus Oreo cookies or Chips
Ahoy. Similarly catchy hybrids seem to be cropping up, at a more
rarefied level, in New York restaurants, except they call them
``infusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables are big in the new infusions, and so are herbs like
basil and spices like bay leaf. The beet sorbet at Aquavit is
swirled with vanilla yogurt and served with a chocolate ganache
cake _ ``a really old classic mix,'' said Kristen Murray, the
restaurant's former pastry chef. Ms. Murray was also responsible
for a balsamic apple concoction, as well as a curry zabaglione and
curry apple sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought it would be fun to try a curry,'' Ms. Murray
said. ``It's very fragrant.'' That isn't all. It tastes like, well,
curry. As if that weren't enough on its own, it shares the plate
with a poached peach tart in almond cream, pistachio pesto, lemon
coconut sorbet and grenadine tapioca. ``It's a very intense dish,''
she said. ``You kind of stand back and go, `My Lord!'''
</P>
<P>
   Shock value does play a part in the mania for bizarrely flavored
ice creams. These weird frozen experiments are another way for
pastry chefs, many of whom now crave recognition as much as their
bosses, to get noticed. At the Local, you might be offered a lime
and rosemary creation, modestly presented on an artist's palette.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel offers a mint risotto, a raspberry hibiscus and a
verbena, but they are as far as Thomas Haas, the pastry chef, is
willing to go. ``I'm not superconservative, but I strongly believe
in classics,'' Haas said. ``You can twist them a little, but don't
overtwist them.'' He distances himself from the relentless quest
for novelty at other restaurants.
</P>

   ``Some people want to make themselves a little more interesting
through this,'' he said. ``They want to make a name for themselves.
But it's like with the fusion cooking, it often turns into
confusion cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   But something about ice cream makes even otherwise sane pastry
chefs go a little nutty. Part of it is what the customers will
tolerate. As Brachman observed, ``People won't go that far out on a
weird cake, but if it's ice cream they'll try anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Racicot said when she started making oatmeal ice cream at
Aquavit, ``A lot of people were a little bit weirded out by it at
first, but it flew.'' When Ms. Racicot moved to Picholine as pastry
chef last month, she took her oatmeal recipe with her.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason chefs go wild on ice cream is that they can.
Ms. Murray, who replaced Ms. Racicot at Aquavit, pointed out that
``because the base is so simple, you can do so many infusions that
are visually appealing and flavorful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even easier _ and possibly cheaper _ they can be ordered up as
custom flavors from a specialty maker like Ciao Bella. F.W. Pearce,
one of Ciao Bella's co-owners, said his company used to get one
special request a week from New York chefs. Now, he said, there are
as many as 10 a week, often multiple requests from single
restaurants. Bond Street wants its wasabi root, Cafe Bari its
honey-blossom water with dates. Beer-based demands have been
pouring in from Heartland, Belgo and Markt.
</P>
<P>
   Beer is big: Even places that aren't Belgian or brew pubs are
flavoring ice cream with a boozy kick. Monkey Bar has a Sierra
Nevada Pale Ale ice cream, Bayard a cherry lambic sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   Ciao Bella charges restaurants $3 to $5 more for a five-gallon
tub of custom ice cream or sorbet. A tub of one of the company's
100 existing flavors goes for $24 to $27, sorbets $24 to $34.
``We're able to get a premium because the restaurants have so much
room in their pricing,'' Pearce said. Room is a polite way of
saying they can charge $5 to $10 for a scoop when it's only costing
them 50 cents to $1, with minimal labor.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet racket, the ice cream trade. Its history is a little
vague. No inventor or specific date of origin is known, though
Alexander the Great is said to have enjoyed snow and ice flavored
with honey and nectar and Catherine de' Medici introduced a kind of
proto-gelato to the French court when she married Henry II. Long
before Howard Johnson's 28 flavors, Baskin-Robbins' 31 and Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Chubby Hubby, the 19th-century New York restaurant
Delmonico's served its society clientele novelty ice creams:
asparagus and pumpernickel rye.
</P>
<P>
   H.L. Mencken once denounced ice cream for ``leading the younger
generation from the straight and narrow path of spinach.'' But
Mencken could not have anticipated Avenue's garden mint flavor,
which gets its green color from an ingredient not mentioned on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Spinach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things,'' said Avenue's Campbell, ``are better not
known.''

   MINTED RISOTTO ICE CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Daniel
</P>
<P>
   Time: 90 minutes, plus cooling and freezing
</P>
<P>
   For the ice cream base:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped loose
</P>
<P>
   20 large fresh mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   6 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   For the risotto:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Finely grated zest of 1 Meyer (or 1/2 regular) lemon
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt.
</P>
<P>
   1. Make the ice cream base: In a medium pot, combine the milk,
cream and vanilla bean pod and seeds. Bring to a boil. Remove from
heat, stir in the mint leaves and cover. Let rest 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and
sugar until pale. Set a stainless steel bowl into a larger bowl
filled halfway with ice water. Keep close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   3. Strain the milk mixture into a clean saucepan and bring back
to a boil. Gradually pour half the hot liquid over the yolks,
whisking to combine. Return entire mixture to pan, and cook over
medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. When mixture
thickens slightly (it should lightly coat the back of the spoon)
and the bubbles on top are the same color as the liquid underneath,
strain into the chilled bowl and cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   4. While ice cream base is cooling, prepare the risotto. Pour
the milk into a small saucepan, add the sugar and lemon zest and
bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. In a medium pot, combine rice with 1 cup cold water in a
medium pot. Add salt, and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer,
and cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly all the water
evaporates. Begin to add the warm lemony milk, 1/4 cup at a time,
stirring constantly over medium heat. Wait until most of the liquid
is absorbed before adding another 1/4 cup milk. Keep cooking and
stirring until all the liquid has been added and the rice is tender
but a bit soupy. Combine with the ice cream base, and cool
completely. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until
completely chilled.
</P>
<P>
   6. Freeze in an ice cream machine according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Cover in plastic wrap, and place in
the freezer for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 quart.

REPORT CRITICAL TO PEACE EFFORT DELAYED A DAY

<P>
   BELFAST _ In what could be either a desperate play for time or
the first glimmer of hope, the planned release Tuesday of a report
that was supposed to offer the last real chance to forge a
compromise over IRA weapons and clear the way for a power-sharing
government in Northern Ireland was delayed until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, met with representatives of the Irish Republican Army
and Protestant loyalist paramilitary groups Tuesday night, trying
to gauge how serious the various paramilitary groups are about
turning in their weapons by next May, Irish and British government
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were similar to those held in April 1998, when the
prime ministers received assurances from paramilitary groups that
they would support the Good Friday Agreement, the political
settlement that is now in danger of collapse because of the dispute
over IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by retired Canadian general John de Chastelain, was
to assess whether the disarming of the IRA and other paramilitary
groups is possible by next May. It now will be released just hours
before Wednesday' midnight deadline set by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The report was held back after a spokesman for Blair claimed its
release Tuesday could jeopardize ``real progress'' being made in
the negotiations overseen by Blair and Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said that de Chastelain's
report ``was ready'' but that Blair and Ahern ``were able to tell
him that despite difficulties, they were making real progress. The
progress will be relevant to General de Chastelain's report, and in
those circumstances he has agreed to delay formal presentation of
his report . . . so that he can take account of the progress
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not publicly explain what constituted that
supposed progress, but government sources said a deal could hinge
on Blair and Ahern receiving assurances from the leaders of the
various paramilitary groups that they were serious about turning in
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Reg Empey, a member of the Ulster Unionists negotiating team,
flatly rejected suggestions that any progress had been made. Other
unionists suggested the report was being altered to put pressure on
them to accept a compromise and sit with Sinn Fein in a
power-sharing government before the IRA begins disarming. The
refusal of the unionists to form the government, and of the IRA to
turn in any weapons, is at the core of the dispute that threatens
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   British and Irish government sources here on the second of three
days of negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute over IRA
weapons said de Chastelain needed clarification on the IRA's
intentions. Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, made a submission
to de Chastelain, but sources close to the disarmament commission
he heads said that the submission was unclear on what the IRA was
prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern ``want a definitive answer from the IRA'' on
whether it is prepared to turn in any weapons. Such an assurance
would then be offered to the unionists, who would be asked to drop
their demand for weapons up front.
</P>
<P>
   Blair urged both Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists, the largest
Protestant party, to take a leap of faith. Blair and Ahern have
vowed to continue negotiating until midnight, which Blair has
called the ``absolute final'' deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come so far,'' said Blair. ``People will simply
neither understand nor forgive if we don't make this thing work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's leader, Gerry Adams, said his party was committed to
all sections of the Good Friday Agreement, including disarming, and
criticized unionists who were saying the negotiations were
hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out there don't want smart remarks from their political
leaders. They want results,'' said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Irish police searching for the remains of people killed by the
IRA in the 1970s said Tuesday that they found the skeletons of two
people in Colgagh, County Monaghan, near the border with Northern
Ireland. The remains are believed to be those of Brian McKinney and
John McClory, two Belfast men whom the IRA said it killed in 1978
after they stole guns from an IRA arms dump.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's admission that it had killed nine people in the 1970s
and buried them in unmarked graves was intended to be a good-will
gesture, but the IRA's inability to pinpoint the exact locations of
the remains has made it a public relations disaster. Before
Tuesday, the remains of only one victim had been found.

CLINTON'S MEDICARE OVERALL OFFERS NO COST PREVENTIVE PROCEDURES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's proposed overhaul of Medicare
Tuesday includes a provision long sought by health care advocates _
a plan for Uncle Sam to pay the entire cost of diagnostic tests
designed to prevent serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, such as mammograms, colorectal cancer screening and
bone-density measurements, were part of the administration's 1993
massive health care plan overseen by First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. They would be offered to the 39 million elderly and
disabled Americans currently covered by the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, addressing administration officials and members of
Congress in the East Room of the White House, said his plan would
``create a much better match between the benefits of modern science
and the benefits offered by Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the diagnostic procedures that can detect diseases early
did not even exist in 1965 when Medicare was created, Clinton
noted. Preventive screening ``if done in time, can save lives,
improve the quality of life and cut health-care costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``It makes no sense for Medicare to put up
roadblocks to these screenings and then turn around and pick up the
hospital bills that screenings might have avoided. No senior should
ever have to hesitate, as many do today, to get the preventive care
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal would eliminate the 20 percent co-payments
Medicare recipients now pay for many of the screening procedures
and waive the $100 deductible for those diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded benefits build on changes pressed by the White
House and adopted by the Republican Congress in 1997. These changes
provided partial Medicare reimbursement for many of the same
preventive care procedures rather than reimbursement only for
doctor-ordered diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's chief economic adviser and an architect
of the new plan, said the president's expanded preventive care
benefits would cost an estimated $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The effort reflects ``the consensus in the health care community
and basically just common-sense _ that we should be doing
everything possible to encourage preventative care that saves our
government money over time and, more importantly, saves families
the heartbreak of more serious illnesses over time,'' Sperling
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes a nationwide education program to
promote health awareness among Americans over age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's comprehensive health care plan failed in 1994
after encountering massive opposition from the health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The president's latest plan, including first-ever partial
coverage for drug prescriptions, would be paid for over a 10-year
period from an estimated $72 billion in savings from cost-cutting
changes within Medicare, $11 billion in new levies on beneficiaries
and $45.5 billion from the federal budget surplus, Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond 10 years, costs would be borne by revenues from the
Medicare payroll tax and general revenue from the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Health Care Financing Administration said
Clinton's proposal would eliminate all cost-sharing by patients for
approved preventive health care procedures, leaving the entire cost
_ up to the ``Medicare approved amount'' _ to be paid by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The preventive health care procedures that would qualify for
cost-free coverage include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Annual mammograms for women over age 40.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pap smears, pelvic exams and clinical breast exams for women
every three years, with annual coverage for women who have had an
abnormal Pap smear in the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diabetes self-testing procedures, including blood glucose
monitors and testing strips for all diabetics, who would receive
free training in outpatient facilities on how to administer the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colorectal cancer screening for Medicare beneficiaries age 50
and older, including a fecal occult blood test every 12 months and
screening by scoping with a flexible tube once every 48 months. The
proposal also would cover colonoscopy procedures once every 24
months for Medicare beneficiaries at high risk for colorectal
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bone-density measurement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prostate cancer screening, with annual digital exams and blood
tests for a protein that is present when the prostate is diseased.

MUBARAK SHARES OPTIMISTIC U.S. VIEW OF INCOMING ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday hailed
the imminent changeover of government in Israel as a ``new dawn''
in the Middle East, a remark that reflects the view of the Clinton
administration as it prepares to step up its campaign for a
comprehensive peace between Israel and all of its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting an honorary degree here ahead of a White House
meeting this week with President Clinton, the Egyptian leader said
the victory by the Israeli Labor Party and Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak in the May election ``holds the promise of better days
for the people of Israel and Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The road ahead is long and the obstacles are many,'' Mubarak
said in accepting the degree at George Washington University. ``But
we have seen the birth of a new dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials described the meeting Thursday between
Clinton and Mubarak as the start of a intensive effort by the
United States to take advantage of a burst of good feeling in the
Arab world resulting from Barak's victory over Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, widely seen by Arab leaders as an implacable
enemy of the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wants to consult with President Mubarak on how
we can together help to push the peace process forward on all
fronts, with the objective of achieving a comprehensive peace,''
said Martin Indyk, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He said at a State Department news conference that the United
States hoped that there would be a warming of relations between
Israel and Egypt, which were severely strained during Netanyahu's
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it's important, as the peace process moves
forward, which we expect it will in the near future, that Egypt
take steps to broaden and deepen its relationship with Israel,''
Indyk said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are eager to hear from
Mubarak's views on the intentions of Syrian President Hafez Assad,
who has offered tantalizing hints in recent days that he is ready
to renew peace negotiations with Israel as a result of Barak's
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received messages,'' Indyk said. ``We've had our own
dialogue with President Assad over the past six months which lead
us to believe that he is keen to engage with the new government in
the hopes of achieving a comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Indyk said the United States was pleased by a recent interview
widely reprinted in Arab newspapers in which Assad praised Barak as
a strong and honest leader who seems interested in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Assad has not been one to praise the Israeli
leadership as honest and sincere and committed to peace,'' he said.
``I think that is an indication of his desire to engage with Prime
Minister-elect Barak.''

PAYING FOR AMUSEMENT PARK MAY BE NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBY McGILL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   School's out, the summer heat is creeping in, and the kids are
bored. If you don't find some way to entertain them, they're gonna
drive you nuts.
</P>
<P>
   How about a day at the amusement park? How does $141.32 sound?
</P>
<P>
   That's the average national cost of taking the tykes to the
amusement park for the day, according to a report released Monday
by Amusement Business magazine, a Nashville, Tenn.-based amusement
industry weekly.
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation, the study did find the national average
is $1.58 lower than it was last year.
</P>
<P>
   Compiled yearly, the study tracks the prices of 25 theme parks
across America by assembling what is known as a family price index.
</P>
<P>
   The index calculates the average national cost of the following
amusement park purchases: admission for two adults and two
children, parking, two hot dogs, two hamburgers, four orders of
French fries, four small soft drinks and two child-sized souvenir
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Most parks reported an increase in admission prices, but they
were offset by decreases in children's prices and souvenir
T-shirts, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first decline in average overall daily cost in the
five years that the report has been done.
</P>
<P>
   The three most expensive parks, according to survey are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal Studios Orlando, at $225.50 per day
</P>
<P>
   _ Busch Gardens Tampa Bay at $206.50
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal Studios in Universal City, Calif., $199.50.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive was Nellie Bly park in Brooklyn, costing $65
for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeff Jouett, spokesman for Six Flags' Marine World
Africa USA in Vallejo, Calif., parents would do well to stuff the
kids full of food before they go inside any theme park's gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real variable is going to be how many times you eat and
how much you eat,'' Jouett said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to the report, the average price of a hot dog
and a hamburger increased 14 cents to $2.46 and $2.99,
respectively. An order of fries will cost you 13 cents more this
year and a soft drink an added 8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for any new amusement parks to open up in your
area, don't get your hopes up, said Neil Begley, senior analyst
with Moody's Investor Services in New York. He said consolidation
in the regional theme park industry _ including Six Flags' merger
with Marine World Africa USA in October 1998 _ should keep the
industry steady for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that it's stable now with the consolidation that has
gone on,'' Begley said. ``I think that it is less likely that you
are going to have much groundbreaking.''

RAIN CANCELS ALL WIMBLEDON COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ After a glitch-free opening week that
whittled the men's and women's singles fields down to 16 contenders
each, Wimbledon wore rain like a second skin Tuesday. Not a single
ball was struck in competition, the first total shutdown at the All
England Club since 1997, when the first Thursday and Friday were
submerged.
</P>
<P>
   Steady drizzle kept the courts beneath tarpaulins for all but
the few mid-afternoon moments that featured the protagonists from
Monday's cliffhangers. Most notable of these was the the tense
Center Court contest between Britain's favorite son, Tim Henman,
and the U.S. Davis Cup squad's favorite pit bull, Jim Courier, who
marched through the mist to trade warm-up shots only to be driven
back inside for good. Their score stood just the way it had when
the harbinger of Tuesday's inclement weather terminated play on
Monday evening: Henman led 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 4-3 with Courier to serve
in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   And over on Court One, an impatient seven-time champion Steffi
Graf, 6-2, 4-2 ahead of 16-year-old qualifier Kim Clijsters, the
youngest player in the tournament, remained two games from her
anticipated quarterfinal berth.
</P>
<P>
   While the 6th-seeded Henman and Courier had the resolution of
their quarterfinal aspirations postponed for another sleepless
night, Andre Agassi, safely through to that round, celebrated his
rainy off-day in a low key way.
</P>
<P>
   No fan of putting in overtime on bumpy, slippery, unreliable
grass courts, the 4th-seeded Agassi, who did much of his practicing
for his 1992 Grand Slam title here indoors on hardcourts,
designated a half hour Tuesday to an indoor practice session. Then,
Agassi and his coach, Brad Gilbert, settled down in front of the
television in the player's rental manse and watched Pancho
Gonzalez, Agassi's former brother-in-law, and Charlie Pasarell mix
it up in a Wimbledon classic, the longest men's match in the
tournament's history.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9 epic comeback by Gonzalez took
five hours 12 minutes and, said Gilbert, provided a lengthy
distraction Tuesday when there was little else for Agassi to occupy
himself with _ except thoughts of his quarterfinal here against
Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten. Both players share a French Open
pedigree, with Kuerten the 1997 champion and Agassi the reigning
titleholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just right where he wants to be, in the thick of things
in the second week,'' said Gilbert, whose charge became the first
man since Rod Laver to acquire all four slam titles with his
victory at Roland Garros. Fittingly, the protean 29-year-old
Agassi, whose appearance over the years has vacillated as wildly as
his results, became the first man to win the slams on three
different surfaces. When Laver, Don Budge, Fred Perry, and Roy
Emerson compiled their Grand Slams, the majors were confined to
grass and clay.
</P>
<P>
   At Paris, Agassi was committed to rebounding from the failure of
his marriage to Brooke Shields, which ended in April, by winning
the only slam title he'd failed to master. Here at Wimbledon, he's
determined to become the first player since Bjorn Borg to make the
direct, and difficult, segue from a French Open championship on
clay to a Wimbledon crown on grass four weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say I feel as good as my game,'' said Agassi, still
basking in his French triumph and his completed Grand Slam
collection. ``It has sunk in as deep as I'm capable of
comprehending. I can only imagine that I won't ever quite have an
appreciation for what it means to live my life knowing what's it's
like to win all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to win more, finish the year at No.1,'' said Agassi,
who finished 1997 ranked 122nd and hadn't won a Grand Slam title
since commandeering the Australian Open on his first visit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's Wimbledon philosophy is similar to that of the
five-time champion Pete Sampras, who believes the second serve and
the return are the pivotal shots on this surface, where cavalcades
of aces from sharpshooters like Greg Rusedski and Goran Ivanisevic
are as predictable as the rain delays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the most important shot in grass court tennis is the
second serve,'' said Agassi, who puts ``hold games,'' not aces, at
a premium. ``I'm not surprised that I can have enough in the rest
of the departments of my game to overcome a big server.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's next opponent, Kuerten, is more durable than dangerous,
and Agassi predicted their first-ever grass clash will be an
``interesting'' encounter, especially since Kuerten leads their
rivalry, 2-1. Kuerten all but predicted an Agassi victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a chance, but he's playing wonderful, and I'm sure he's
the favorite,'' said Kuerten, whose previous Wimbledon campaigns
ended in two first round round losses. ``Nobody expects me to go to
the quarterfinal; it's going to be a lot of fun. Hopefully he don't
hit too hard and he let me play and enjoy it a little, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi, on a mission to remain on a Grand Slam roll, isn't
planning to be very charitable. ``I'm shooting for an important
goal,'' said Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed as to how his support will swing in Sampras'
direction only if he finds himself dismissed before the final
round. ``I'd love to see him accomplish six Wimbledons if I happen
to lose here,'' said Agassi about his contemporary's much-heralded
bid to tie Emerson's all-time slam record of 12 by capturing a
third straight title here.

 &HT;    Two die in morning airplane crash
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Firefighter Matt Driver got within a yard of the
burning plane. Through the smoke he could see small movements, and
under the roar of traffic from the expressway and the crackle of
flames he could hear a voice murmuring ``Help me, help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the fire reached another fuel cell and roared up in his
face. He could no longer see the plane, he could hear no more cries
and he had to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and Mike Roberts, both Atlanta firefighters who were on
their way to work when they saw a twin-engine plane go down beside
I-20 Tuesday morning, along with an unidentified citizen with a
fire extinguisher, made an heroic effort to rescue the two men
aboard but were driven back by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims was identified as Robert Dodson, 29, of
Memphis, Tenn. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office said
Dodson died from blunt trauma. Pathologists were awaiting dental
records before positively identifying the second victim.
</P>
<P>
   All eastbound lanes of I-20 heading toward Atlanta were shut
down for about an hour Tuesday morning, and it was well past rush
hour before all lanes were reopened. Traffic was backed up for
miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from the National Transportation Safety Board were
investigating the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Beechcraft Baron 58, owned by Paragon Air Express in
Nashville, Tenn., was making its daily Nashville-Atlanta-Mobile,
Ala. run to deliver checks to and from banks in those cities when
it took off from Fulton County Airport shortly after 6 a.m. It
immediately ran into mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the pilot of the six-passenger plane radioed
the tower that he was turning back. They said he did not indicate
what kind of problem the plane was experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the plane was ``sputtering.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Joyce, a Delta Air Lines employee, was driving down I-20 en
route to work when the plane crossed over the interstate in front
of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had taken off and was going at a fair rate of speed, and he
seemed to me to be having a hard time getting it up,'' Joyce said.
``It looked like he was trying to do a sharp turn to get back to
the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce lost sight of the plane as it crossed over trees along the
south side of the interstate. ``When it crossed over the trees, it
seemed to be sideslipping or banking real hard. I was waiting to
see him come up above the trees on the other side and the next
thing was a big cloud of black smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver and Roberts, who arrived on the scene at virtually the
same time but in separate cars, said the plane banked sharply to
the right, avoiding the industrial area south of the freeway, and
turned back northward toward the airport. But instead of righting
itself, the plane continued to roll to the right until it was
upside down, and then plunged straight into a narrow strip of
hardwood trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretty much went straight down,'' Fulton County Fire Capt.
Terry Coursey said.
</P>
<P>
   He said firefighters got the first call at 6:29, reached the
scene seven minutes later but took almost half an hour to beat down
the flames because hoses had to be carried down the long, steep
bank into the woods and then have foam canisters attached to them
to fight the aircraft fuel fire.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that as he and Driver dashed down the embankment,
``We yelled out to see if there were any survivors. We heard
somebody moaning, but then there was a big explosion. There was
nothing we could do. There was too much fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver said six or seven other people rushed down the slope, one
of them carrying a fire extinguisher. ``The guy with the fire
extinguisher did a good job,'' he said, ``but then it flashed up on
us and we had to bail out.''
</P>
<P>
   The man with the fire extinguisher apparently drove away without
identifying himself.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton firefighters brought a small bulldozer to the crash scene
to plow a path about 50 yards through the trees to the remains of
the plane, which were burned to an unidentifiable mass. Papers
thrown from the plane on impact littered the slope around it.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the two victims were brought out shortly before 11
a.m., and investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration
and the NTSB took over the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Powell, the lead investigator for the NTSB, said they would
have to rely heavily on information from witnesses, but ``you'd be
surprised'' what can be learned from wreckage burned even as badly
as the Beechcraft.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have a preliminary report ready on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Warner writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
Atlanta, Ga. Mike Morris, Bill Montgomery and Gary Hendricks

<P>
   DAYS-BEFORE-THEATER (Modena, Italy) _ ``The Days Before: Death,
Destruction and Detroit III'' was originally conceived as a piece
about the Apocalypse, and its 12 scenes are filled with bizarre
imagery and stylized movement. Each includes an excerpt read by the
actress Fiona Shaw from Umberto Eco's novel ``The Island of the Day
Before,'' the texts seemingly unrelated to the onstage action.
Robert Wilson, who conceived, designed and directs it, calls ``The
Days Before'' ``a celebration of humanity.'' Originally
commissioned by the Lincoln Center Festival, it will have its world
premiere in New York on Wednesday. By Anne Midgette. Photo.

<P>
   ASSAYAS-FILMS (Paris) _ Olivier Assayas is someone who believes
in spontaneity and openness to the world. One of the most
significant talents among the new generation of filmmakers working
in France, he is known for his mobile, often handheld, camera style
and for his probing explorations of young people's lives. Assayas'
new film, ``Late August, Early September,'' which opens on
Wednesday, is a loosely structured, evocative depiction of a group
of thirtyish Parisians who are drawn together by the untimely death
of a slightly older writer friend. The film, shot in the spring of
1998, has proved to be Assayas' most successful in France so far,
winning praise last fall at both the Toronto and New York film
festivals. By Laura Winters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BALLET-DANCE (Undated) _ Going forward by looking back
may be bad advice, but American Ballet Theater has danced better
and better the more it has concentrated on the past _ a
19th-century repertory. Four of the seven full-length ballets in
the company's recent season at the Metropolitan Opera House were
French and Russian classics created more than 100 years ago. The
20th century did intrude, chiefly through the questionable transfer
of Kenneth MacMillan's ``Anastasia'' (1971) from the Royal Ballet.
To see Ballet Theater at its best, however, was to see it in
``Giselle'' and ``La Bayadere.'' By Anne Kisselgoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BORIS-GODUNOV-OPERA (New York) _ Modest Mussorgsky wrote ``Boris
Godunov'' twice. The first version, composed at white heat in 1868
and 1869 to a libretto adapted from Pushkin, comprises seven
tableaux organized into four acts and lasts barely two hours. It
was submitted to the directorate of the Imperial Theaters in 1871.
The directors were impressed but asked for changes, including a
substantial female role. A second ``Boris,'' completed in 1872,
consists of a prologue and four acts, and lasts almost three hours.
Today, at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere, ``Boris'' is often
performed with Mussorgsky's original vocal and instrumental parts.
But what we usually (at the Met, always) hear is a conflation of
1869 and 1872. This results in a panoramic ``Boris'' longer than
either version Mussorgsky composed: an abundance of marvels but,
arguably, not a finished product. By Joseph Horowitz. &QL;

<P>
   OAR-ALBUM (Undated) _ Alexander (skip) Spence, who died in
April, recorded ``Oar'' in December 1968, an album of songs he had
written in Bellevue Hospital. He produced it himself and played all
the instruments himself. Released on May 19, 1969, ``Oar'' showed
one of the bleakest undersides of the '60s. It was a snapshot of
mental illness, a portrait of bitter isolation in a time of
communal celebration. On Tuesday, Sundazed Music will reissue a
remixed and remastered version of the album with 10 bonus tracks.
By Karen Schoemer.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE-CUBE-ALBUM (Undated) _ The Chicago Underground Trio's

It is a graceful collage of free jazz and art rock. By Adam Shatz.

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FRANK-O'HARA-ART (Undated) _ Frank O'Hara proved that friendship
is an art form all its own, as a new exhibition reminds us. The
show, ``In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art,''
opens next Sunday at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles
and remains on view through Nov. 14. An appealingly sentimental
affair, it rounds up some 100-odd works by 25 members of the O'Hara
gang _ from canonical Abstract Expressionists (Willem de Kooning,
Franz Kline, Philip Guston) to underrated figurative painters
(Fairfield Porter, Alice Neel, John Button) to celebrated Pop Art
pioneers (Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg) to at least one essential
eccentric (Joe Brainard, who took his cue from comic strips before
giving up art to devote himself full-time to reading Victorian
novels). By Deborah Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   UNCLE-SAM-ART (Undated) _ Contrary to popular belief, Uncle Sam
wasn't born on the Fourth of July but on Sept. 13, 1766, in
Arlington, Mass. And he had many guises before James Montgomery
Flagg painted a stern, white-haired man proclaiming,
ungrammatically, ``I want YOU for U.S. Army.'' Uncle Sam's namesake
was Samuel Wilson, a meat packer who settled in Troy, N.Y., and
supplied food to American troops during the War of 1812. According
to legend _ and to an eyewitness report published in The New-York
Gazette and General Advertiser in 1830 _ a workman joked that the
letters ``U.S.'' on Wilson's shipping crates stood for ``Uncle
Sam'' Wilson. The anecdote spread and led to the patriotic symbol
now reproduced in political cartoons, advertisements, posters and
fine art. By Sarah Bayliss.
</P>
<P>
   LA-REBUILD-ARCH (Los Angeles) _ Seven years after the Los
Angeles riots shook Southern California and the world, the words
``South-Central'' still evoke the open wounds of urban decay and
social dislocation. But here on a wide swath of once-grand Vermont
Avenue at 81st Street, seedlings of renewal are taking root this
summer. Against all odds, 36 mustard-colored, stucco town houses _
half of them built above storefronts facing the street and the rest
around an interior court _ are filling up with first-time
homeowners, most of them single mothers. In the process, Vermont
Village Plaza is testing anew the possibilities of the New Urbanism
of its award-winning architect, Daniel Solomon. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-RKO-281 (Undated) _ When Orson Welles made his masterpiece
``Citizen Kane'' in 1941, it was no secret that the film's
protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, was a barely fictionalized
version of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate whose
enormous empire was then beginning to falter under a barrage of
debts. But there was a drama behind the drama, as Welles _ then
just 25 and swelled by the arrogance of youth and genius _ found
himself up against the full force of Hearst's fury. Hearst was
desperate to stop the film, no matter what the cost, and nearly
succeeded in having it destroyed before it had ever been released.
Now the story of their battle is to be the subject of its own film.
``RKO 281,'' which takes its name from ``Citizen Kane's'' working
title at the RKO studio, will have its premiere on HBO in November.

OUR RATING: 3 stars 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _The ``South Park'' movie blasts other adult-themed
cartoon features out of the water, and it isn't just because it
shows Saddam Hussein and Satan having trouble in their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's tasteless, childish and utterly obscene. And yes,
those familiar animated tykes Cartman, Stan, Kenny and the rest get
to talk far dirtier than they do on the popular Comedy Central
series that spawned them two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' is also a clever and
highly topical parody of post-Columbine kid-culture paranoia that
has theater owners promising to police customers while electronics
companies scramble to place program-blocking chips in TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to say ``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and
Matt Stone got lucky with this very funny and fast-paced script,
which jumps from a military attack on the Baldwin brothers to the
murder of Bill Gates to the devil and Hussein as gay lovers
plotting to take over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The crudely animated picture opens with a big production number
_ there are several hilarious musical interludes here _ in which
South Park's population celebrates its redneck mountain town.
However, life isn't all burgers and beer _ a foul-mouthed and
flatulent Canadian duo called Terrence and Philip are undermining
the kids, teaching them naughty words and dirty songs by way of a
hit movie that's just hit town.
</P>
<P>
   But South Park's third-graders aren't supposed to be seeing the
movie _ it's R-rated, just like ``Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' itself.
</P>
<P>
   How to get around the problem? Easy _ Cartman and the gang
bribes a homeless guy to buy them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   When the tykes come home spouting Terrence and Philip's
profanity, parents and teachers launch a crusade against Canada.
War is declared, and one of the kids is implanted with a chip
giving electrical shocks when he says bad words.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' ripped from today's headlines?
Partly so, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least it's the ``Citizen Kane'' of
construction-paper cut-out animation. Every penny of the film's
$14.50 budget is up there on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger, Longer'' is raunchy, outrageous entertainment for
adults, thanks to those perfectly realized musical numbers and an
approach that holds nothing sacred and everyone and everything _
from Winona Ryder to the military _ up for good-natured lowbrow
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Terrence and Philip movie, ``South Park: Bigger,
Longer &AMP; Uncut'' is definitely not for kids. &QL;

 &HT;    America's Junior Miss, every parents dream
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sarah Jane Everman of Kennesaw (Ga.), is not only the
new America's Junior Miss, she's every parent's dream.
</P>
<P>
   The win on Monday is just the latest honor for Everman, 18, who
graduated this summer from Pebblebrook High School with a major in
dance and minors in vocal and drama. From best actress in the 1998
state one-act play competition (as Ariel in ``The Tempest'') to
slots in the Governor's Honors program and the National Honor
Society, her resume bulges with overachievement. She's a member of
Mount Paran Church of God and has taped public service
announcements against drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she's off to Myrtle Beach, S.C., for an appearance on
TNN's ``Crook and Chase Show.'' After the 3 p.m. show, she'll head
to New York for another round of media schmooze fests, then back to
Atlanta by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running on about three hours sleep but I'm pretty
excited,'' she said Tuesday from Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Everman was chosen from eight finalists. Her parents, John
Everman of Houston and Linda Everman of Kennesaw, watched from the
audience with her sister and two dozen other supporters, including
several Pebblebrook faculty members. TNN will air the competition
at 9 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Between her wins in the local, state and national competitions,
Everman has picked up $57,000 in scholarship money for the
University of Cincinnati, where she will study musical theater
starting this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Reece, director of Pebblebrook's performing arts school,
describes Everman as a talented young woman with a strong faith
who's been a role model for younger students. Between classes and
play rehearsals, she routinely put in 12-hour days in high school.
In the past four years, she appeared in every play except one that
the school produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much of a social life,'' Everman said. ``It's
pretty much I just see my friends at school every day, then
rehearsals.''
</P>
<P>
   As for dating, she said laughing, ``that's for later.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, she wants to concentrate on starting college and a year
of appearances for Junior Miss. Everman, who enrolled at
Pebblebrook because of her interest in dance, soon expanded her
scope to singing and drama. She hopes for a career in live theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I did a show I realized that's where I was comfortable,''
she said. ``I think I've been blessed.''

OUR RATING: 2 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Imagine O.K. Corral pals Wyatt Earp and Doc
Holliday in a bad episode of ``Star Trek,'' and you have an idea at
the second-rate mishmash that is ``Wild Wild West.'' It's this
summer's ``The Avengers,'' a substandard big-screen remake that
tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one.
</P>
<P>
   This ``West'' heads south right away as director Barry
Sonnenfeld is unable to conjure up the same blend of comedy, action
and special effects set pieces that worked so well in ``Men in
Black.'' Here he's created a tone-deaf movie, hindered in no small
way by S.S. Wilson's and Brent Maddock's humor-free script.
</P>
<P>
   Why Sonnenfeld, who has made some fine films in his time (``Get
Shorty,'' the ``Addams Family'' remakes) would entrust his $125
million movie to a couple of writers who list ``Short Circuit'' and
``Ghost Dad'' as their major credits is a mystery that federal
agent James West would have a tough time solving.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the movie undoubtedly went through its share of
rewrites and script doctoring. But rather than improve the final
product, the tinkering has produced a confused film that isn't sure
whether it wants to be 007 or ``Deep Space Nine.'' Not even Will
Smith's considerable star power (think how sorely director Roland
Emmerich missed him in last year's ``Godzilla'') can save this
movie from being a bumbling bore.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stars as federal agent West, a man who loves guns, tight
pants and awkward racial humor. (The movie makes a pained attempt
to explain an African-American's prominence in 1870s law
enforcement.) West is paired with Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline), an
Old West Inspector Gadget.
</P>
<P>
   It's a left-brain, right-brain thing. Gordon hates guns and
favors nonviolent sleuthing (usually involving some silly
disguise). West (to quote the day's president, Ulysses S. Grant)
``shoots first, shoots later and asks questions in between.
</P>
<P>
   Per the buddy-movie formula, West and Gordon dislike each other
at first but eventually come together through a mutual respect.
(Unlike, say, the audience's relationship with this movie, where
such a bond never forms.) The two agents must put aside their
differences to combat the evil Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth
Branagh) and his 80-foot steam-driven tarantula.
</P>
<P>
   It's all meant to be silly fun (``There's a giant spider heading
toward our president!''), but the movie's many elements rarely
coalesce in an enjoyable way. Smith and Klein don't quite mesh as
actors, and the film's gadgets and contraptions are rather
standard-issue. Salma Hayek is on hand mostly to show off her
shapeliness.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the giant, Erector-set tarantula isn't nearly as
cool as the filmmakers seem to think it is. It's indicative of the
movie's jokey, aren't-we-something bravado which, ultimately, comes
off pretty hollow in light of its performance.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of nice action scenes, and the two leads
occasionally generate some funny moments. Too often, though, the
results fall flat. Example: West finds Gordon examining a
scientist's detached head. West, incredulous: It's a man's head.
(Pause) IT'S a man's head. (Pause) It's a MAN'S head. (Pause) It's
a man's HEAD.
</P>
<P>
   Go at your own risk. &QL;

   It's not that we aren't close. We are. But we haven't always
been.
</P>
<P>
   I figured shopping for the dress would help solidify our ``new
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   I also thought it would clarify what I did and did not want the
wedding to be.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, not flashy. Intimate, not grandiose. Modern, not
traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, my plan was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, it was a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   We were in Los Angeles, where I grew up. My mom had planned the
day and had booked three appointments at different boutiques.
(Appointments, she explained to me, are crucial because bridal
salons only service one client at a time.)
</P>
<P>
   Our 10 a.m. stop was the largest and most expensive on the list.
Everything in the store sparkled. Bouquets of white flowers bloomed
on the counters and reflected in mirrors that were behind, next to,
and in front of me. And of course, there were rows and rows of long
white dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The moment we walked in, two middle-aged women bustled up and
asked my name. When they realized I was their appointment, they
lurched into action.
</P>
<P>
   First, they circled me. Then they started making strange
clicking noises with their tongues. Finally, they began to coo and
to repeat, as if it was a mantra, that I would be a
``bee-oo-tee-ful'' bride.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost comical. Almost, because they were serious. And,
because I had no escape.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's smile told me I had to stay.
</P>
<P>
   So, I took a deep breath and let the women go to work.
</P>
<P>
   They began by walking me through the store, holding out dresses
and asking my opinion. Not that it mattered. I hated almost
everything, but I still ended up with a bedroom-sized dressing room
full of gowns.
</P>
<P>
   They led me into it gleefully. A floor-to-ceiling mirror in the
dressing room permitted me to see myself from all angles. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   I stood politely waiting for them to leave so I could begin.
But, they just stood there smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit me. They were staying.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my mother in horror.
</P>
<P>
   The women poo-pooed my muttering about shyness and insisted that
only they knew how to put the gowns on properly. Their presence was
essential, they said. Pivotal to my success as a bride.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my mom and she shrugged, but didn't offer me an out.
Slowly, I undressed and stood still while they zipped, buttoned,
tucked and clipped.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, I was transformed.
</P>
<P>
   No more jeans and unmatched socks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I was a perfect vision in white.
</P>
<P>
   A snowflake.
</P>
<P>
   A cream puff with a tiny middle.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's eyes filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   The women bubbled over. At one point, they got so effusive I had
to order them to pipe down or get out.
</P>
<P>
   They eyed each other quizzically. The princess, they seemed to
say, was part ogre.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help myself. I felt like an idiot. And I had a
million angles to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   But my mother was beaming.
</P>
<P>
   And my father, she said, would be thrilled if he saw me in such
a dress.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped for a moment and considered this.
</P>
<P>
   Was it really so bad?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't what I wanted. In fact, it was the opposite. But
couldn't I live with it if it made them so happy?
</P>
<P>
   I looked back at my mom. For a moment, I could see nothing else.
It was just me and her and all those years and disappointments in
between.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't been the perfect daughter. At times, I hadn't even been
a good one. I was rebellious and had spent more time away from home
than in it.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, if I could do this one thing right, none of that
would matter. For once, I would be everything they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about this as we walked out of the shop. I considered
it as I stood in another store, with yet another set of women
clucking and clicking around me.
</P>
<P>
   I carried it with me on the plane home, on my way to work each
day and home each night. It started to bother me that I was
spending so much time worrying about something as silly as a dress.
</P>
<P>
   But, somehow it had become bigger than just silk or lace. It was
my childhood, my adult life and the conflict between the little
girl I had been and the woman I had become.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, it was my mom who helped me solve the problem. She
did it by telling me a story about her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   She was younger than me _ just out of college. She and my father
had been high school sweethearts and both families were eager for
them to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Like me, my mother was the only girl in her family. That meant
her wedding was more than just a personal celebration. It was a
family event.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, my grandmother, was a perfectionist who planned
everything meticulously. She envisioned begonias in the aisle,
bite-sized chocolates on the tables and strolling violins during
dinner. And, she wanted my mother to wear a tailored silk dress
with a schoolgirl bow in the front, a long train on the back and a
pill box hat.
</P>
<P>
   My mother wore the dress. But she never liked it. Especially not
the hat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her dislike was so deep that 30 years later, she
refused to let me CONSIDER wearing her dress.
</P>
<P>
   No, she said. She didn't want to see the dress again. And, she
wanted me to love what I wore.
</P>
<P>
   That's when we both realized that I couldn't wear the dress from
the shop. It wasn't me.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wonderful moment. Worth all the strain of the past
months. Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief second, we traded places. I saw her as a young
bride; she understood me as an independent woman.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, our epiphany did nothing to solve my dress
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It just sent me back to the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping took me months, but eventually I found a dress I love,
a fitted gown of ivory silk and organza.
</P>
<P>
   The dress won't be ready until a few weeks before the wedding.
That means I won't have to think about it _ or worry about my
family's reaction _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Still, finding it has allowed me to relax.
</P>
<P>
   And, it's given me and my mom time to focus on what's really
important.
</P>
<P>
   Like whether I should wear a veil.

CLINTON'S MEDICARE OVERALL OFFERS FREE PREVENTIVE PROCEDURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (EDs: CHANGES headline, substituting the word free for no cost(  
 By STEWART M. POWELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's proposed overhaul of Medicare
Tuesday includes a provision long sought by health care advocates _
a plan for Uncle Sam to pay the entire cost of diagnostic tests
designed to prevent serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, such as mammograms, colorectal cancer screening and
bone-density measurements, were part of the administration's 1993
massive health care plan overseen by First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. They would be offered to the 39 million elderly and
disabled Americans currently covered by the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, addressing administration officials and members of
Congress in the East Room of the White House, said his plan would
``create a much better match between the benefits of modern science
and the benefits offered by Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the diagnostic procedures that can detect diseases early
did not even exist in 1965 when Medicare was created, Clinton
noted. Preventive screening ``if done in time, can save lives,
improve the quality of life and cut health-care costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``It makes no sense for Medicare to put up
roadblocks to these screenings and then turn around and pick up the
hospital bills that screenings might have avoided. No senior should
ever have to hesitate, as many do today, to get the preventive care
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal would eliminate the 20 percent co-payments
Medicare recipients now pay for many of the screening procedures
and waive the $100 deductible for those diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded benefits build on changes pressed by the White
House and adopted by the Republican Congress in 1997. These changes
provided partial Medicare reimbursement for many of the same
preventive care procedures rather than reimbursement only for
doctor-ordered diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's chief economic adviser and an architect
of the new plan, said the president's expanded preventive care
benefits would cost an estimated $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The effort reflects ``the consensus in the health care community
and basically just common-sense _ that we should be doing
everything possible to encourage preventative care that saves our
government money over time and, more importantly, saves families
the heartbreak of more serious illnesses over time,'' Sperling
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes a nationwide education program to
promote health awareness among Americans over age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's comprehensive health care plan failed in 1994
after encountering massive opposition from the health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The president's latest plan, including first-ever partial
coverage for drug prescriptions, would be paid for over a 10-year
period from an estimated $72 billion in savings from cost-cutting
changes within Medicare, $11 billion in new levies on beneficiaries
and $45.5 billion from the federal budget surplus, Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond 10 years, costs would be borne by revenues from the
Medicare payroll tax and general revenue from the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Health Care Financing Administration said
Clinton's proposal would eliminate all cost-sharing by patients for
approved preventive health care procedures, leaving the entire cost
_ up to the ``Medicare approved amount'' _ to be paid by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The preventive health care procedures that would qualify for
cost-free coverage include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Annual mammograms for women over age 40.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pap smears, pelvic exams and clinical breast exams for women
every three years, with annual coverage for women who have had an
abnormal Pap smear in the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diabetes self-testing procedures, including blood glucose
monitors and testing strips for all diabetics, who would receive
free training in outpatient facilities on how to administer the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colorectal cancer screening for Medicare beneficiaries age 50
and older, including a fecal occult blood test every 12 months and
screening by scoping with a flexible tube once every 48 months. The
proposal also would cover colonoscopy procedures once every 24
months for Medicare beneficiaries at high risk for colorectal
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bone-density measurement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prostate cancer screening, with annual digital exams and blood
tests for a protein that is present when the prostate is diseased.

 &HT;    CNN to launch pricey ad campaign aimed at boomer marketBy
Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN USA will launch a $25 million ad campaign on
Thursday, the largest in the news channel's history.
</P>
<P>
   In another first, the campaign will extend simultaneously across
television, newspapers and the Internet. The campaign's promotional
theme line is ``You are what you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is CNN's largest campaign by a long shot,'' says Steve
Korn, vice chairman and chief operating officer of the
Atlanta-based CNN News Group, a unit of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   To help kick off the campaign, CNN announced Tuesday a
replacement for longtime anchor Lou Dobbs, who left his popular
Moneyline Newshour show last month. Dobbs is being replaced by two
current CNN news people, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A long time in the planning, the ad campaign comes as CNN faces
increasing competition that has cluttered a cable TV news niche it
once had to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Today, CNN and its sister news channels compete against MSNBC,
Fox News and financial channel CNBC and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   CNN remains by far the leading news channel on cable TV. It saw,
for example, a 25 percent jump in its average daily household
viewership during the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   And parent Time Warner wants to ensure CNN stays the leader _
especially among the channel's core audience of affluent baby
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign is really part two of a larger strategy underway
for the past 18 months. First came an effort to raise the quality,
in terms of both appearance and content, of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   CNN recruited former ABC News executive RicK Kaplan as the
president of CNN USA. Kaplan began new shows such as Newstand and
hired new anchors.
</P>
<P>
   Now CNN wants to promote these changes in the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing the campaign on those people who remain our
vital core audience,'' says Korn. That audience is people age 35-54
with incomes of $50,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to this group, the CNN campaign will feature
successful baby boomers from all walks of life. Among those
appearing in ads will be New York Yankee's pitcher Roger Clemens,
Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson, founder of
Virgin Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   CNN will roll out its campaign in three stages. The first, which
begins Thursday, will feature financial program Moneyline Newshour.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of the campaign will begin in mid-July and
feature Larry King Live. And phase three, which will begin in late
August, will feature the Newstand news magazine show.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run at least through the end of the year, says
Korn. At that time CNN will decide whether to continue it.

TV SPECIAL DEVOTED TO ALL-TIME GREATEST COMMERCIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I have a confession: I love TV Land. Give me a
25-year-old episode of ``All in the Family'' over the latest
installment of ``Friends'' any day. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But I used to love it more. When the channel, an offshoot of
Nickelodeon's Nick at Nite, first began in 1996, it had no
advertisers. Instead, it showed old commercials. Dubbed
``retro-mercials,'' these were as popular as the channel's
programming.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of TV Land's charm came from the feeling of having
hijacked a time machine back several decades. While some of these
older shows had continued to run in syndication, they'd often been
cut to fit more commercials in _ new, loud, charmless commercials
that broke up the nostalgic vibe.
</P>
<P>
   All good things must end, and now TV Land's commercials are
mostly of the current variety. A cable channel, after all, has to
make money either by charging you or charging advertisers to reach
you. Unfortunately, TV Land missed an opportunity with its
first-ever original production, ``TV Land Presents the Greatest
Commercials of All Time,'' to re-create the time warp of its early
days.
</P>
<P>
   This half-hour special, based on TV Guide's current cover story
picking the 50 greatest commercials, is too short and choppy to do
its subject justice. I kept hoping they'd show a commercial all the
way through, but the only one they show in its entirety is the
``1984'' commercial for the Apple Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the show is disjointed montages of old commercials
interspersed with commentary from ad executives and (snore)
journalists. A framing story pairing fast-talking Fed Ex spokesman
Frank Moschitta and ``Joe Isuzu'' David Leisure is clever ... the
first time around. Then it, too, starts to feel like an intrusion
on what we really want to see _ the commercials themselves. &QL;

AU PAIR'S PARENTS CHARGED IN FUNDS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The parents of former British au pair Louise Woodward,
who was convicted of killing a Newton, Mass., baby in 1997, were
formally charged by police in England Monday with bilking their
daughter's defense fund of at least $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Cheshire police in England said Tuesday that
Gary and Susan Woodward face counts of theft and false accounting.
The couple allegedly defrauded their daughter's defense fund of
about $15,000 for room and board that they had received for free
from Elaine Whitfield Sharp, the Marblehead, Mass., lawyer who was
formerly part of Louise Woodward's defense team. They allegedly
doctored an invoice as evidence of the payment, police charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   During their daughter's murder trial, money flowed to the family
from around the world from people who believed Woodward should not
be held responsible for the death of Matthew Eappen, the
8-month-old who lapsed into unconsciousness while in her care.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was found guilty of second-degree murder by a jury, but
that conviction was reduced by Judge Hiller B. Zobel to
manslaughter. Zobel sentenced her to the time she had already
served in jail and she was released. She went home to Britain after
the Massachusetts Supreme Judical Court upheld Zobel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Following Woodward's manslaughter conviction, the defense fund
grew, with donations meant to pay for an appeal that might clear
her name.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Sexton, the Liverpool lawyer who represents Susan Woodward,
did not return phone calls seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Associated Press reported that he had said that Susan
Woodward ``vigorously denies the allegations which have been made
against her and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is heartily sick of the vicious lies and poisonous gossip
which have been directed against her and her family and looks
forward to the opportunity of setting the record straight when this
matter comes to court,'' Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp has repeatedly said that she did not charge the
Woodwards room and board.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her Marblehead law office Tuesday, Whitfield Sharp
threatened to sue the Woodwards' attorneys for libel if they
continue to point the finger at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think that attacking me is a good defense, they're in
trouble,'' Whitfield Sharp said. ``It's a sad day when all they
come up with is `Elaine Whitfield Sharp is crazy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They are lawyers,'' she said. ``But they are certainly not
immune from being sued.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Jones, the woman who founded the defense fund in the
Woodwards' hometown of Elton, England, but who fell out with the
Woodwards over the fraud allegations, said she learned of the
charges ``with great sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like everyone else. Very sad,'' Jones said in a
telephone interview. ``They've been charged. If it's proved, it's
proved. If it's not, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was carried out by both Cheshire police and
the FBI. The Woodwards were arrested for questioning by Cheshire
police on May 6. On Monday, they were formally charged and then
released on bail pending their appearance in Chester magistrate's
court July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards have split up in the aftermath of their daughter's
trial. Reflecting on the seemingly endless saga Tuesday, Whitfield
Sharp said she hopes the public will separate the alleged criminal
acts of Louise Woodward's parents from the charges made against
their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp said she remains among those who believe there
was enough reasonable doubt to acquit the teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying she was innocent,'' Whitfield Sharp said. ``I
am saying the evidence did not support a conviction. Those are
completely separate things.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, meanwhile, the Rev. Ken W. Davey, the British
minister who was chairman of the defense fund, said he heard about
the charges but declined comment Tuesday ``because the case is
sub &UR;  &LR; judice,'' using the legal term that limits public discussion
of pending legal cases in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Davey ruefully noted that had similar discretion been followed
in Louise Woodward's case, reporters probably wouldn't be calling
him seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's supporters contend she was convicted, in part,
because of negative pre-trial publicity in the United States. Such
coverage is tightly controlled in Britain.

`FAMILY GUY' LOSES SPONSORS OVER ALLEGEDLY OFFENSIVE CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox's new animated show ``Family Guy,'' which had the makings of
a new hit during its run on the air this spring, is in trouble with
a list of important advertisers, some of which have already pulled
commercials from the series.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisers, which include Coca-Cola and Philip Morris, had
each received strongly worded letters as part of a letter-writing
campaign directed by a Connecticut school headmaster who complained
that the show includes anti-Semitic, racist and sexist humor.
Executives at Coca-Cola and Philip-Morris, however, said that they
dropped out as sponsors based on their own review of its content.
</P>
<P>
   The headmaster, the Rev. Richardson Schell of the Kent School in
Kent, Conn., who is also an Episcopalian priest, did not disclose
to the advertisers that he had a personal connection to the creator
of ``Family Guy,'' Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane was a 1991 graduate
of the Kent School, and Schell was headmaster at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives, who declined to be named, discussed the
situation in response to questions from the media. They said that
one week before the show went on the air in January, the headmaster
contacted MacFarlane and asked him to change the last name of his
cartoon family, because the name, Griffin, is the same last name as
that of Schell's assistant, Elaine Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Schell did not return phone calls to the school and his home
Tuesday. MacFarlane, through Fox executives, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives explained more about the connection between
MacFarlane and Schell, like the fact that MacFarlane's mother was
for 15 years a college guidance and admissions adviser at the Kent
school.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that Schell ``also lobbied another member of
MacFarlane's immediate family.'' MacFarlane told Fox executives
Tuesday that his mother recently resigned. Fox also said that when
the network and MacFarlane elected not to change the name, ``this
upset Schell greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Advertising Age on Monday, Schell said that
although he wrote his letters to advertisers under the heading
Proud Sponsors USA, he said there was no such organization and that
he was acting on behalf of himself. He said he had never protested
any other TV show.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, which did not mention the connection to
MacFarlane, he said, ``It's a moral matter for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox describes the show as a satire of political correctness. The
show has been attacked by some critics for some tastelessness;
others have reviewed it favorably.
</P>
<P>
   But Schell's campaign clearly led some of the advertisers to
re-examine the content of the show. A long list of current and
potential sponsors now say they will not advertise in the show,
including such big advertisers as Sprint, Chrysler, The Gap,
Kellogg's Pepsi, Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris had already had bought commercials in ``Family
Guy'' to advertise a ``youth smoking prevention'' campaign. After
getting Schell's letter, the company decided to withdraw support
for the show, because, as company spokeswoman Mary Carnavale put
it, ``it is not consistent with our values as a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Nesvig, the head of sales for the Fox network, said Fox had
lost three or four advertisers so far as a result of Schell's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Fox had had experience with viewers who seek to
damage shows by asking advertisers to withdraw their ads. In 1989
Terry Rakolta, a resident of Michigan, managed to get a number of
big companies, including Coca-Cola, to pull their ads from the Fox
comedy ``Married With Children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what the implications of this are,'' Nesvig
said. ``Terry Rakolta helped put Fox on the map as a network. But
we're in a different era now.''

TV NOTES: TWO FOR THE `MONEYLINE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TV-FAMILY-GUY) 
(bl) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Moving quickly to fill the gap left when Lou Dobbs resigned
three weeks ago, CNN on Tuesday named new co-anchors for
``Moneyline News Hour,'' the early-evening business news program
that Dobbs created and anchored for 19 years. One newcomer is an
old hand at financial news, Stuart Varney; the other is Willow Bay,
the co-anchor of two CNN prime-time programs, ``CNN and Fortune''
and ``CNN and Entertainment Weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   Varney, like Dobbs, joined CNN at its inception, and worked
there covering financial news for 18 years before taking the past
year off for what he called a sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a spectacular opportunity,'' Varney said Tuesday by
telephone from Derby, England, where he was visiting his mother.
``Lou created the premier financial news program, and I would just
like to follow in those footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bay, who will continue on the two prime-time shows as well,
said doing ``Moneyline'' was another step in her professional
evolution. ``The work I've been doing at `CNN-Fortune' is covering
business,'' she said, ``and what I've been doing for
`CNN-Entertainment Weekly' is focusing on the entertainment
industry as a business, the business of moviemaking or the business
of Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN felt pressure to move fast because its main financial news
competitor, CNBC, immediately pumped resources into its ``Business
Center'' program, expanding it from 30 minutes to fill the same
hour from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. as ``Moneyline''; shifting its
best-known anchors, Ron Insana and Sue Herera, there, and spending
lavishly on promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the first week of those changes, brought a 13 percent
ratings gain for ``Business Center,'' to an average of 238,000
households, still trailing the 293,000 homes ``Moneyline'' reached
that week.
</P>
<P>
   Another CNN competitor could well make the 10 p.m. time slot
more competitive in the fall, if Tuesday's second-quarter Nielsen
numbers for cable networks are any indication. Since Paula Zahn
took over as anchor of Fox News Channel's 7 p.m. news in March,
that broadcast has more than doubled its ratings (to an average of
167,000 households).
</P>
<P>
   Last week Fox News Channel president Roger Ailes named Ms. Zahn
anchor of a new 10 p.m. news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   That hour had been an interview show, with Catherine Crier as
host; Ms. Crier left last week to join Court TV. Ailes wants to
make it a hard-news program, more like ABC News' ``Nightline,'' and
cited Ms. Zahn's experience at CBS News as a reason. The new show
will start in August.

LAW SETS IT IN GRANITE: FIRST PRIMARY WILL BE N.H.'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ You can chisel it in granite: New Hampshire will
hold the first presidential primary for the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to scare off any threats to New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary status, Governor Jeanne Shaheen signed
into law Tuesday a bill that would allow the state's 2000
presidential primary to be held as early as 1999. In fact, the law
literally allows the vote to be held any time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to making sure we remain a week before any
other state,'' said Shaheen. She said the law is necessary because
many other states are trying to move up their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Months before any votes will be cast, the Granite State is in a
heated competition with others states trying to establish a
foothold _ and magnify their influence _ early in the presidential
nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   About half the states, representing three-fourths of party
convention delegates, will hold primaries and caucuses between the
end of January and March 14. This so-called front-loading has
resulted in an early intensity to campaigning, organizing and
fund-raising because the Republican and Democratic nominations are
likely to be locked up within a one-month period next year.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire law used to require Secretary of State William
Gardner to set the date of the primary at least seven days prior to
any other state's primary. The new law would allow him to set that
date as early as the year before the general presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gardner has not set a date for New Hampshire's 2000
primary. Iowa state law, meanwhile, requires the Iowa caucuses to
be held eight days before New Hampshire's primary. Recently, New
Hampshire's primary has fallen sometime in February of the election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides passing legislation, New Hampshire lawmakers have tried
other avenues to protect the primary. For example, a bipartisan
group has urged presidential candidates to sign a pledge promising
not to campaign in states that hold their primary within seven days
of New Hampshire's.
</P>
<P>
   Eight candidates have signed that pledge: Patrick J. Buchanan,
George W. Bush, Bill Bradley, Elizabeth Dole, Al Gore, John Kasich,
John McCain, and Bob Smith. Five others have not signed: Lamar
Alexander, Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, and Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Spiliotes, a government professor at Dartmouth College,
said the state's latest effort to maintain its influence and
position borders on the ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in danger of becoming absurd,'' Spiliotes said. ``It's
clear that other states are no longer intimidated about moving
their primaries up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hugh Gregg, the former Republican governor, said no one
seriously intends to hold the primary in the year before the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason we did that was to let the country know, and
particularly Delaware, that we're not fooling around,'' Gregg said.
``Nobody has any conceivable thought that that's going to happen,
but it made a point and that's what we intended to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary is worth millions of dollars in revenue to the state
as candidates and journalists trek through its hotels and
restaurants. Besides the money, there is an intangible prestige
factor for the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   However, advocates of the first primary say New Hampshire is one
of the few places in the country where candidates are measured in
one-on-one meetings with the voters, rather than through 30-second
television advertising buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not just that we're first,'' explained Shaheen.
``We're a place where candidates don't need the establishment
behind them or need to spend millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire officials attribute part of their predicament to
the Republican National Committee for not forbidding states from
holding their Republican primaries too close to New Hampshire. The
Democratic National Committee, on the other hand, has refused to
grant waivers to states that wish to move their primaries within
seven days of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
is pushing states to adopt a rotating regional primary schedule
that would give all states an opportunity to hold their primary
early. His plan, however, would exempt Iowa and New Hampshire from
the rotation, allowing them to continue to be first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone today feels this is a disaster,'' said Galvin, who is
meeting in St. Louis with members of the National Association of
Secretaries of State's committee on presidential primaries. ``It's
chaos, it's chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar of primaries and caucuses will largely be settled
Thursday, the RNC deadline for states to notify the party of when
it will hold its election. But Galvin said it is already clear that
most states have moved up their primaries in order to gain
influence, even though most voters are unlikely to be interested so
early in the process. The New Hampshire law reflects the absurdity
of the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see it now,'' Galvin said. ``Al Gore in a Santa Claus
outfit and George Bush as a reindeer. The rest will all be elves.''

AU PAIR'S PARENTS CHARGED IN FUNDS CASE 
</HEADLINE>

 By KEVIN CULLEN AND ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The parents of former British au pair Louise Woodward,
who was convicted of killing a Newton, Mass., baby in 1997, were
formally charged by police in England Monday with bilking their
daughter's defense fund of at least $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Cheshire police in England said Tuesday that
Gary and Susan Woodward face counts of theft and false accounting.
The couple allegedly defrauded their daughter's defense fund of
about $15,000 for room and board that they had received for free
from Elaine Whitfield Sharp, the Marblehead, Mass., lawyer who was
formerly part of Louise Woodward's defense team. They allegedly
doctored an invoice as evidence of the payment, police charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   During their daughter's murder trial, money flowed to the family
from around the world from people who believed Woodward should not
be held responsible for the death of Matthew Eappen, the
8-month-old who lapsed into unconsciousness while in her care.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was found guilty of second-degree murder by a jury, but
that conviction was reduced by Judge Hiller B. Zobel to
manslaughter. Zobel sentenced her to the time she had already
served in jail and she was released. She went home to Britain after
the Massachusetts Supreme Judical Court upheld Zobel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Following Woodward's manslaughter conviction, the defense fund
grew, with donations meant to pay for an appeal that might clear
her name.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Sexton, the Liverpool lawyer who represents Susan Woodward,
did not return phone calls seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Associated Press reported that he had said that Susan
Woodward ``vigorously denies the allegations which have been made
against her and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is heartily sick of the vicious lies and poisonous gossip
which have been directed against her and her family and looks
forward to the opportunity of setting the record straight when this
matter comes to court,'' Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp has repeatedly said that she did not charge the
Woodwards room and board.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her Marblehead law office Tuesday, Whitfield Sharp
threatened to sue the Woodwards' attorneys for libel if they
continue to point the finger at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think that attacking me is a good defense, they're in
trouble,'' Whitfield Sharp said. ``It's a sad day when all they
come up with is `Elaine Whitfield Sharp is crazy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They are lawyers,'' she said. ``But they are certainly not
immune from being sued.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Jones, the woman who founded the defense fund in the
Woodwards' hometown of Elton, England, but who fell out with the
Woodwards over the fraud allegations, said she learned of the
charges ``with great sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like everyone else. Very sad,'' Jones said in a
telephone interview. ``They've been charged. If it's proved, it's
proved. If it's not, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was carried out by both Cheshire police and
the FBI. The Woodwards were arrested for questioning by Cheshire
police on May 6. On Monday, they were formally charged and then
released on bail pending their appearance in Chester magistrate's
court July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards have split up in the aftermath of their daughter's
trial. Reflecting on the seemingly endless saga Tuesday, Whitfield
Sharp said she hopes the public will separate the alleged criminal
acts of Louise Woodward's parents from the charges made against
their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp said she remains among those who believe there
was enough reasonable doubt to acquit the teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying she was innocent,'' Whitfield Sharp said. ``I
am saying the evidence did not support a conviction. Those are

DISARMAMENT REPORT SEEN AS KEY TO RESOLVING STALEMATE IN BELFAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Negotiators on Tuesday turned their
hopes of meeting an imminent deadline for resolving the impasse
threatening the Northern Ireland peace agreement to a long-awaited
report on whether paramilitary organizations are willing to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The report has been prepared by retired Gen. John de Chastelain
of Canada, the head of an international disarmament commission set
up by the accord, and a key part is based on answers to a
questionnaire he put to the groups asking how committed they were
to turning in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla organizations' insistence on maintaining their
arsenals has stalled the vital next step in the peace accord _ the
transfer of power from the British government to the new Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists, the biggest party in the legislature, are
refusing to let Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, take its seats in the Assembly's executive cabinet
without a move to disarm by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   A deadline of midnight Wednesday has been set by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who, with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern,
has been in Belfast since Monday jointly conducting the final talks
as the two of them did in April 1998 before the signing of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A similar declaration of a firm deadline during those talks
served to focus frustratingly inconclusive negotiations and produce
an agreement, and that was Blair's purpose this time in setting the
June 30 date. July 1 is also the day that the new legislatures in
Scotland and Wales assume their powers, making it a fitting
historical moment for the Northern Ireland Assembly to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said that the deadline was ``absolute'' and that he had
``no plan B'' if the deadline expired with no decision. The
strategy seemed to be having a positive effect as representatives
of the parties to the accord spoke to reporters gathered outside
the Stormont Castle Buildings Tuesday evening with little of the
fatalism that has characterized their comments in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the de Chastelain document was becoming the
vehicle for a resolution emerged after the two prime ministers held
a lunch meeting with the Canadian and then said delivery of the
report, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, was being postponed until
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The delay was seen as a way of gaining time to incorporate
critical negotiating points into the document. A spokesman for
Blair explained that there was ``business being done here by the
prime ministers that is relevant to what the general is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to outline the timetable for paramilitary
disarming or decommissioning, as it is called here, leading up to
the deadline of May 2000 envisaged in the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of the report took on added significance this week
when David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists and the first
minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suggested that a
statement by Sinn Fein committing the IRA to disarm by that date
could satisfy his party's demand and allow the creation of the
power-sharing cabinet to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's comment raised the hope that he might drop his ``no
guns, no government'' insistence that there must be actual
disarmament before Sinn Fein could enter the executive cabinet in
exchange for an enforceable IRA disarmament pledge. Blair has
already put forward the notion, intended to reassure the Unionists,
that Sinn Fein's participation in the government would forcibly end
if the IRA failed to disarm in the allotted time.
</P>
<P>
   The de Chastelain report and the role it might play in
reconciling the Catholic and Protestant sides emerged at a moment
when all other efforts seemed to have failed and the despairing
possibility loomed that the carefully calibrated and much hailed
agreement designed to end three decades of sectarian violence might
be in danger of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can underestimate the formidable
difficulties we face,'' Blair said at the outset of the second day
of talks, ``but we've been here before, we've done it before and we
can do it again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tensions were on the rise in the province after a decision on
Monday by the government-appointed Parades Commission to ban the
annual march from Drumcree Church through a Catholic neighborhood
in Portadown and the linking of bomb material captured by Irish
police in a truck headed for Northern Ireland to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA connection to the confiscated explosives became known
when the two men arrested in the case asked to be admitted to the
wing of the Irish jail housing members of the guerrilla group.
Unionist politicians in Belfast argued unsuccessfully that the
episode constituted a violation of the IRA's commitment to a
cease-fire that underpinned Sinn Fein's participation in the peace
effort and should result in expulsion of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In Portadown, Royal Ulster Constabulary police were putting up
barricades and digging trenches at the rural parish that has been
the scene of violent confrontations each July the last five years,
and leaders of the Orange Order, which sponsors the march,
scheduled daily parades in the town leading up to this weekend's
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   They also prepared to welcome an estimated 150 Orangemen and
victims of IRA violence who are crossing the province this week in
a ``long march'' of solidarity with the Orangemen of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, the militant Protestant political figure,
said Blair had assured him Tuesday, however, that he was still
trying to find a way to settle the Drumcree standoff. David Jones,
the spokesman for the Portadown Orangemen, said his people might
now abandon their longtime refusal to meet with the residents of
the protesting Catholic Garvaghy Road neighborhood if it would
enable the men to parade this Sunday.

   WASHINGTON _ Like father, like son.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush obviously learned important political
lessons from his father, the former president. One thing he could
not learn, however, is reverence for the Constitution's First
Amendment because his father didn't have any.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man is willing to leave its magnificent message alone.
</P>
<P>
   While in the White House, George Bush supported a constitutional
amendment to criminalize the burning of the U.S. flag, a
pseudo-patriotic attack upon the great document's protection of
freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   It was a political low to which the president of the United
States, leader of the free world, should never have stooped. He was
campaigning for reelection at the time, but that is no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Flag-burning is neither widespread nor a threat to the dignity
of either Old Glory or the republic. And the Supreme Court held
long ago that symbolic gestures are the equivalent of speech and
are therefore protected from government repression.
</P>
<P>
   But pandering politicians keep insisting they know better. The
nutty House of Representatives voted recently for the third time to
ban flag burning.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? It was applauded by the president's son, who
promptly told a New Hampshire questioner that he supported the
move. He is in mid-campaign, too, and it is still no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Bushes and the House may never have to face the
consequences of their constitutional ignorance. The Senate has
never approved the flag-burning foolishness and is still two votes
short of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor went on to reinforce his careless
constitutional attitude with a second stupidity during his initial
campaign swing. Incredibly, he endorsed another recent House
measure that trashes the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   This one would allow states to permit the display of the Ten
Commandments in schools and other public facilities. It's supposed
to be voluntary, but if you believe that, I have this genuine
diamond ring I'd like to sell you.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had no problem at all with hanging those religious
rules of behavior in public places.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution protects freedom of religion by forbidding
government establishment of an official faith and erecting a
barrier between church doctrine and state action traditionally
honored by the courts. Twenty years ago the Supreme Court struck
down a Kentucky law requiring the posting of the Commandments in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Commandments come in many versions _ as does religious faith
itself. Posting one version over another means the state has
authorized one over the other.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, covering public walls with biblical injunctions is
not going to stop one brainless kid with a bazooka from mowing down
his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   God is not a sound bite to be thrust forward for temporary
political gain. Prodded by self-appointed religious purists, the
House went berserk after the Littleton, Colo., high school shooting
over the Ten Commandments as a way of appearing concerned about
cultural violence without dealing with the problem of easy access
to guns.
</P>
<P>
   But why did Governor Bush fall for this hypocritical exercise?
</P>
<P>
   He stands with the Republican Party on the sensitive subject of
gun control. He doesn't want any new laws that might inconvenience
the sellers and buyers of the weapons of death. He recently signed
a new Texas measure that prohibited city lawsuits against
gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But he stayed largely on the sidelines during the congressional
debate over the gun issue. It wasn't his fight. He was wearing his
home-boy Texas blinders at the time.
</P>
<P>
   His overall goal is to move to the philosophical center,
sticking to basic right-wing positions but framing them in vague
ways that seem low-key and reasonable. Eventually, he will have to
say more on gun control and everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the anti-First Amendment brigade, however, puts Bush in
a dangerous category of legislators who believe their judgment is
superior to that of the timeless principles of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sides with a crowd that believes Congress has the right to
push the religious and free speech views of its majority on other
free citizens who may think differently. He sides with zealots and
ignorant opportunists who hide behind patriotism and religion to
promote a selfish agenda of getting re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   This is not where a responsible presidential candidate should
stand. The First Amendment is too important to our basic freedoms
to be so cavalierly trod upon.

REPORT CALLS FOR FINES AGAINST UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The University of California system should not be
protected by federal law from paying fines for safety violations at
the two nuclear weapons laboratories it runs, congressional
investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released during a congressional hearing into safety
conditions at America's nuclear laboratories, the General
Accounting Office called for changing the law that blocks the
Energy Department, which owns the labs, from forcing the university
system to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 law, called the Price-Anderson Act, the Energy
Department is allowed to cite both for-profit and nonprofit
organizations, such as universities, that contract to do research
in its labs. However, the nonprofit organizations are not required
to pay fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forcing the nonprofits to pay these fines would do a lot to
bringing more accountability to the system,'' GAO investigator Gary
L. Jones told the House Commerce Committee's oversight and
investigation panel.
</P>
<P>
   The law was enacted to protect universities from having to pay
fines using money from their public endowments.
</P>
<P>
   According to David Michaels, assistant secretary for
environment, safety and health at the Energy Department, the
agency's primary form of punishment is issuing public notices of a
lab's safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, by getting the word out about violations, we
believe the labs have a great incentive to fix the problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress and the GAO disagreed, saying the
law needed more teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not working,'' said Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., who called
UC's handling of the two laboratories ``careless.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, nonprofit contractors have been fined but not forced
to pay $605,000. Of these fines assessed on nonprofit
organizations, the UC labs accounted for $425,000, or 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The UC system was cited for:
</P>
<P>
   _ Failing to implement a plan to protect workers and the public
from radiation after a fire and explosion involving radioactive
material occurred at the Los Alamos facility in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turning off or modifying without consent monitors that alert
workers to radiation exposure at the Lawrence Livermore lab in
California.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exposing workers at Lawrence Livermore to radiation levels
that exceeded safety limits because lab officials failed to
implement radiation protection requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report noted that the violations were not
life-threatening. The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Van Ness, senior vice president of the UC system, said
enforcing the fines was unnecessary and that public notice of
violations was enough to ensure that labs meet safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reputation is our single most important asset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Ness said that the possibility of losing future contracts
with the Energy Department ensured a ``commitment to excellence''
by nonprofit organizations. ``The potential loss of the contract is
much more significant than any fine that would be assessed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, during questioning by the subcommittee chairman, Rep.
Fred Upton, R-Mich., Van Ness acknowledged that the University of
California has never had to compete for its Livermore and Los
Alamos contracts and likely will not in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Energy Department owns the Livermore and Los Alamos
facilities, the university runs all of the labs' operations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J.
Bliley Jr., R-Va., said the representative was concerned about the
GAO report and that he would look at changing the law. The Commerce
Committee oversees the Price-Anderson Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it is now, the nonprofits have very little
accountability,'' the spokesman, Eric Wohlschlegel, said.

CAMPAIGN BEGINS TO TELL NAZI VICTIMS HOW TO GET COMPENSATED BY
SWISS BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A campaign began Tuesday to inform victims of Nazi
persecution how to claim compensation from a $1.25 billion fund set
up by two Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   People can apply even if they or their relatives never had a
Swiss account. A full-page advertisement ordered by a U.S. court is
being published in 500 newspapers and magazines in 40 countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toll-free numbers and a Web site in seven languages, including
Yiddish, have been set up, said the World Jewish Congress, which,
with a panel of lawyers, oversees the effort. The eligible victims
or targets include Jews, Gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals
and the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   The ad has a coupon that can be mailed for more information.
Applications, which are not in the ad, are at
www.swissbankclaims.com. The site lists toll-free numbers for many
countries. In the United States, it is (888) 635-5483. Claims have
to be filed by Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began with news conferences in New York, Tel Aviv
and other cities. The plan, approved by Judge Edward Korman of U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn, lists these categories of claimants: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ People with rights to assets, including bank accounts or
investment funds, deposited in Switzerland before May 9, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who had valuables, including art or similar assets that
the Nazis looted or removed.
</P>
<P>
   _ People forced into slave labor for companies that may have
deposited the revenues gained from that labor in Swiss companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who fled the Nazis but were turned away at Swiss
borders or, after having entered, were mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   _ People forced into slave labor at a site anywhere that a Swiss
company, bank or government agency owned or controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, reached in August, provided that the United Bank
of Switzerland and Credit Suisse pay the first installment of $250
million to an escrow account this year. Three additional
installments start this year. The distribution of the money could
begin late next year, said Elan Steinberg, executive director of
the World Jewish Congress.

<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ A horse named Zekan waited outside,
harnessed to a cart. Shan Salihu, 64, was upstairs _ if that word
applies to a building so demolished that no stairs are left _
tossing down the pieces of wood that will make his new house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaach!'' he yelled down to his relatives, who were stacking
the wood in the horse cart. ``You should put something down there
so these things don't get destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The wood once served as the closet doors for the Serbian police
housed in the military barracks here. NATO planes smashed the
building, along with everything else on the base here, in its
78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now Salihu, a Kosovo Albanian whose house in the nearby town of
Koronice was burned by Serbian forces, is rebuilding his life from
the Serbs' wreckage. It is not at all surprising, given how much
raw material sits in twisted heaps here, but he smiled and
acknowledged an irresistible symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a bit like a souvenir,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much money in Kosovo, and aid groups are just
beginning their work. But the refugees who have returned here in
the last two weeks are shooing cows from their living rooms,
sweeping out tons of rubble and already working hard to rebuild,
the best they can.
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanians are restocking their homes with goods _
silverware, blankets, jewelry _ looted from the burning houses of
Serbs and Gypsies who have fled Kosovo in fear.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not seem accurate to say that all, or even most,
returning Albanians are stealing from the Serbs. For instance, the
family of Armend Gashi, 15, spent their last $300 on new roof tiles
and timber to fix up their store and home in the village of Nagavc,
which they say was attacked by Serbian bombers on April 2. After
two days of work, he and his father covered the roof, except for a
six-foot patch in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Armend said they have no idea how they will restock the store
itself, which his father had run for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when we'll open,'' he said as his mother scrubbed
the carpets. ``We don't have the money. We're just covering the
roof to protect us from the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take years, maybe decades, for Kosovo to return to
normal. But the newly swept floors and repaired roofs are one sign,
just over two weeks since NATO troops arrived here, that life is
inching back to the way it was, though with far fewer Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern city of Prizren, school has reopened, as have
many restaurants. Buses are running, The price of fuel, food and
beer are dropping. Backhoes have begun shoveling piles of garbage
from the streets. (Fires rise from the countryside, and it is hard
to tell at first whether it is trash burning or houses that once
belonged to Serbs.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work is cosmetic, though essential. Ibrahim Berisha,
48, was scrubbing graffiti, in black and silver spray paint, from
the wooden doors that lead into his home in the village of Rogove.
It was left by Serbian soldiers, who scrawled obscenities aimed at
NATO and phrases like ``Death to Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the footprints they left, I will wipe them clean.''
Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
   In Nagavc, one family of nearly all women and children has been
working from six in the morning until late at night since they
returned from Albania a week ago to make their house livable again.
</P>
<P>
   Outside sat the third tractor wagon of rubble they had shoveled
from the house's two floors. They found their television and VCR,
wrapped in plastic, in the hole where they had buried them. They
dug needlepoint pictures of fashionable women out from piles of
roof tiles and hung them on the wall again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels very good,'' said one of the women, Xhemile Krasniqi,
28, who was hurt in the bombing. ``It's our village. We are back on
our land.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are not sure they will stay. The house, damaged by a
Serbian bomb, is all askew and may be beyond repair. Worse, Servete
Kryeziu, 34, had hurriedly buried her mother, Azize Krasniqi, 58,
who died in the bombing, in the garden out back, now sprouting with
tomatoes and corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only to pass the winter,'' Ms. Kryeziu said. ``There are
bad memories here, and it's destroyed. How can we live there with
the grave of our mother?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here in Djakovica, people have been picking through the
abandoned Yugoslav military base for anything that might be useful
again. In the surrounding neighborhood, there is more than a little
anger toward the base.
</P>
<P>
   For decades it had been a remote border outpost with only 50 or
so soldiers. Then after 1981, when Albanians staged protests for
independence, the central government confiscated the villagers'
farmland to build a complex for no fewer than 1,500 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built this with the people's money,'' complained Rasim
Thaqi, 40. ``They didn't have their own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaqi was getting back at them by standing atop the destroyed
mess hall, methodically removing the thick timbers that braced the
roof. He said he would use some of it for firewood. But he has
other timbers inside the courtyard of the house that he and his
brother share, which was also heavily damaged by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets some help _ money or engineering advice _ he said he
would use those timbers to rebuild the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would always be on my mind _ a reminder,'' he said. ``To
remember that I took a part of the Yugoslav army's barracks to
rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Outside the police barracks, where Salihu was throwing down the
doors, more timbers stood stacked waiting to be carted off. An old
man wrenched out an iron sink, so heavy he had to rest several
times as he dragged it out.
</P>
<P>
   The next building over, at the side of the motor pool, Shaban
Morina, 40, lifted a window frame out of a heap of rubble, then
tossed it back. Everyone did their jobs too well: the Serbs who
burned down his house and the NATO planes that bombed the compound
to almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find anything,'' he said. ``I wanted windows, but they
are all destroyed.''

 &HT;    Medicare Reform at a Glance
 &HT;    289. With MEDICARE.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are highlights of President Clinton's Medicare reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   _ Establishes a voluntary plan to cover 50 percent of
prescription drug costs. The government's share would be up to $500
of costs in 2002 and $2,500 in 2008. _ The prescription benefit
would cost about $24 a month in 2002 and $44 a month by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beneficiaries with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty
level (currently $11,000 for an individual, $17,000 for a couple)
would not pay any drug premium or cost sharing.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENTIVE CARE
</P>
<P>
   _ Eliminates copayments and deductibles for all preventive
services covered by Medicare, including cancer screenings,
mammographies and diabetes-management benefits.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   _ Gives Medicare new authority to seek competitive prices for
services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requires managed care organizations to offer a package of
``core benefits'' which Medicare will cover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offers beneficiaries an incentive to go into lower cost
managed care plans by reducing premiums 75-cents for each dollar
below the average amount charged by a plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extends provisions of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that reduce
payments to Medicare providers. The provisions are scheduled to
expire in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   COST SHARING
</P>
<P>
   _ Indexes the $100 deductible for Part B, which covers
physicians and related services, for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adds a 20- percent copayment for laboratory services.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE BUY-IN
</P>
<P>
   _ Allows people 62 to 65 to ``buy into'' the Medicare program
for about $300 a month. Displaced workers between 55 and 62 could
buy in for $400 a month.

TEXAS AUTHORITIES NAB ESCAPED TEXAS KILLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Escaped murderer Clifford Jones, who spent two nights nearly
naked in the East Texas woods after fleeing one of the state's most
secure prisons, was found in a tree Tuesday and surrendered, prison
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught our guy,'' said prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who fled the Estelle prison unit shortly after noon
Sunday, was spotted by a guard at 1:25 p.m. Tuesday about 2 1/2
miles from the prison northeast of Huntsville. The escapee, who
scrambled up a tree as officers closed in, was asked to come down
and give himself up, which he did, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, at first thought to be hiding out in the woods naked, was
wearing his white prison-issue boxer shorts when he was captured.
He appeared to be suffering from dehydration and mosquito bites,
and asked for food and water, which he was given when he was
returned to the prison, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering where's he's been, he's in good condition,''
Fitzgerald said. ``He wasn't a walking welt,'' he added, referring
to earlier indications that the inmate had climbed a poison
ivy-infested oak tree Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 33, was serving a 26-year sentence _ 20 years for killing
a Dallas man and attempting to kill a police officer, and six for
assaulting a prison guard. He now faces charges for escape and will
be transferred to another prison unit for medical treatment,
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice,
meanwhile, ordered an internal investigation of Jones' escape from
the 2-year-old prison, which was built as a prototype for prisons
housing some of the state's most dangerous offenders. Already,
prison officials have modified plans for four more prisons under
construction to take into account flaws that allowed Jones to
escape. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On Sunday, as Jones was being led from his cell to a caged
recreation area, he slipped out of his handcuffs and shoved a guard
out of the way before climbing a 25-foot fence and squeezing
through an 8- to 10-inch gap between the top of the fence and the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   After scaling a second fence and a camera tower, he vaulted over
the razor wire atop the prison's outer fence. A perimeter guard in
a van fired two shots at Jones, but missed.
</P>
<P>
   Security cameras recorded Jones shedding his shoes and stripping
off his prison uniform about 100 yards from the prison before
running into the woods. Search dogs followed Jones' trail to an oak
tree covered in poison ivy vines, where officials believe the
killer spent the night.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, as crews worked to shore up security at
Estelle, welding additional fencing to fill the gap through which
Jones escaped and adding razor wire to the camera towers, about 300
searchers used dogs, boats and helicopters to hunt for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   They had few leads until about 3 a.m. Tuesday, when a helicopter
equipped with heat sensors detected the prisoner in chest-deep
water near the prison. The helicopter was running low on fuel and
wasn't able to land because of the wooded and swampy terrain,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the helicopter spotted him, we redoubled our efforts in
that area and were closing in when a guard saw him,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``He was found in the area where we were searching all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the first inmate to escape from a Texas prison this
year. Last Thanksgiving, seven condemned killers escaped death row
at the nearby Ellis I unit. One of them, Martin Gurule, cleared the
prison's outer fences, but was found dead in a creek near the
prison after a massive weeklong manhunt. An autopsy showed that he
had drowned shortly after his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Prison board member Mac Stringfellow of San Antonio, who will
lead the investigation into Jones' escape, also investigated
Gurule's break-out. In that case, investigators concluded that
negligence by prison employees was to blame. The prison warden was
demoted and his two assistants were reassigned to other prisons,
while at least three guards were disciplined.

   MYLES-VERDICT (Los Angeles) _ Two men who robbed and shot a
North Hills woman as she picked up her daughter from Bible study
classes were convicted of murder in a crime that shocked the San
Fernando Valley. Laurie Myles's 9-year-old son tried to save his
mother's life, as she bled to death. Now 15, he said the conviction
is bittersweet justice. ``The only thing I could do is smile _ it's

10,000 SERB PROTESTERS DEMAND RESIGNATION OF MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CACAK, Yugoslavia _ In the first major anti-government
demonstration since NATO stopped bombing Yugoslavia, about 10,000
people packed into the central square of this war-damaged
manufacturing city Tuesday to demand the resignation of President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of speakers said that Milosevic, by committing robbery
and murder in Kosovo in the name of the Serb people, has shamed
Serbia in the eyes of the world, ruined the economy and tried to
cover up his failures by a campaign of lies in the state-owned
media.
</P>
<P>
   In this city where several large factories were destroyed by
American bombs that killed five civilians, not a single speaker
blamed the United States for devastation that will likely take
decades to recover from. Instead, the speakers accused Milosevic of
``evil'' that provoked attacks from Serbia's traditional allies in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has shamed us in front of ourselves, in front
of God and in front of the whole world,'' said Milan Protic, a
history professor from Belgrade and a leader of the Alliance for
Change, an umbrella group of opposition parties that organized the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Vladan Babic, coordinator of what the Alliance for Change says
will be a series of rallies across Serbia in coming weeks, told the
crowd that the point of the demonstration was to send a simple
message to Milosevic: ``Go away! Go to Cuba and study Stalinism
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cacak is one of the few cities in Serbia where the opposition is
in complete control of the city government. The rally's organizers
said they did not yet plan any demonstrations in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Three months of daily rallies in Belgrade in the winter of
1996-97 brought huge crowds into the streets demanding that
Milosevic resign. But due in part to in-fighting among opposition
leaders, the demonstrations fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Just as Tuesday's demonstration began, a loud explosion went off
in a far corner of the central square. The crowd was stunned into
silence by the blast, but it hurt no one. A device used in war
games to imitate the sound of artillery reportedly caused the
explosion. It was not clear who planted it.
</P>
<P>
   After demonstrators saw that nobody was hurt, the rally resumed
and they joined in shouting, ``Red Bandits, Red Bandits,'' a
familiar reference to Milosevic and his government.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The state of war imposed here during NATO's 11-week bombing
campaign ended last weekend, but the Serbian government has not
lifted its ban on public gatherings. The city of Cacak decided to
go ahead with the rally despite being told by Serbian police that
it was illegal, said Dusan Dzinkovic, the vice-mayor.
</P>
<P>
   On roads leading into this town of about 80,000, Serbian police
stopped a number of buses and cars, some from Belgrade carrying
opposition party leaders, as well as foreign and local journalists.
A few foreign reporters said they were turned back.
</P>
<P>
   During the rally, Vuk Obradovic, an opposition leader, thanked
the Yugoslav Army for the local soldiers who he said picked up
demonstrators and brought them to the rally after police had
stopped busloads of opposition activists outside town.
</P>
<P>
   Army reservists have blocked roads and bridges in several towns
in central Serbia in the past week, protesting that they have not
been paid during the war. It was not clear, though, if these
reservists were the ones who helped bring demonstrators to town.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to our army for enabling people to break through the
police barricades on some roads and come to join us. They are with
us and we are with them and they know it,'' said Obradovic, a
former Army general who resigned in 1992 to protest the conduct of
Serbia's war against Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army has had a rocky relationship with Milosevic
over the years, marked by frequent purges and grumbling about
declining living standards, as the Serbian leader has shifted money
to the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian police officer on the outside of town said after the
rally that he and his fellow officers had stopped no one from going
into Cacak and accused the speakers at the rally of spreading false
information.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the rally said it was the first of what they hoped
will be about 20 to 25 demonstrations across Serbia in the next
five weeks. Only then, they said, will they go to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the police harassing us, it is easier to organize
locally,'' Protic said. ``Belgrade should come as the
culmination.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The opposition crushed the ruling Socialist Party in elections
in Cacak in 1996, taking control of all but eight seats in the
70-member town council. The already high anti-Milosevic temperature
of Cacak soared during Serbia's war with NATO. The city's popular
mayor, Velimir Ilic, complained publicly that the Yugoslav Army had
caused the death of four civilians in the town by parking its tanks
near private houses. They were hit by NATO bombs aimed at the
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   After Ilic's complaints found their way onto Radio Free Europe,
military police tried to arrest him on May 19 and he went into
hiding. Ilic used Tuesday's rally as a coming out party, and his
appearance on stage ignited the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am the happiest person in the world because I am with
you again,'' he said. ``But I could cry because of what this
government has done to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor challenged the Serbian government to arrest him now,
saying that he would no longer hide from authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was as notable, though, for who did not speak. Vuk
Draskovic, the charismatic leader of the largest opposition party
in Serbia, had refused to join the opposition alliance. He says the
time is not yet ripe to take to the streets to demand that
Milosevic leave power.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Belgrade, Draskovic said Tuesday that
he hoped to pressure change in the Milosevic regime without
disruptive demonstrations and sniffed that, in any case, there is
no viable opposition movement in Serbia without his Serbian Renewal
Movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for journalists no one would have any knowledge
neither of the alliance nor of their rallies,'' he said. ``The
alliance groups small parties with no influence, and everything
they organize will substantiate that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's dismissive remarks were the only mention of
Tuesday's demonstration that appeared in the evening on state
television, which is controlled by Milosevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a wiltingly hot afternoon in Cacak's town square,
expectations were low that demonstrations alone could force
Milosevic to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no hope that this rally will change anything,'' said
Vladimir Lukic, 25, who is soon to graduate with an engineering
decree from a Cacak college whose windows were blown out this
spring by NATO bombs. ``These demonstrations have happened before
and they didn't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lukic said he came out to shout for Milosevic's
resignation ``because this is the worst country in Europe. I am
sick and tired of this regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he blamed the United States or the countries of Western
Europe for the bombing that in April closed his college, Lukic
said, ``No. This is not the will of the American people, it is the
consequence of the crimes that have been going on in this country
for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukic, a towering young man with a gold ring in his left
earlobe, said that he is hoping to escape Serbia next year. He said
that his widowed mother, who teaches in the local high school, has
not been paid for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no future and I plan to go to the USA, if I can,'' he
said. ``I will even go to Cleveland. I hear in films that it is the
ugliest city town in America, but I will even go there.''

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ The ghosts seem to think this old
schoolhouse belongs to them, thumping and moaning, crying out for
help, offering themselves for sex, turning themselves into white
cats.
</P>
<P>
   People who work here say the ghosts are the restless souls of
victims of the Khmer Rouge, and their forms are as varied as the
imaginations of the people who describe them.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, these people say, the ghosts have become newly agitated.
Their master is back: the buck-toothed schoolteacher nicknamed Duch
who turned the Tuol Sleng high school building into the most
efficient and terrifying torture chamber of the Khmer Rouge years.
</P>
<P>
   Having run a prison that dispatched at least 14,000 people to
their deaths from 1975 to 1979, Duch (pronounced dook) escaped with
other ousted Khmer Rouge leaders into Cambodia's western jungles,
where he converted to Christianity and returned to his old role as
a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In May he was discovered and arrested, and has admitted ordering
torture and killings. Now he awaits trial in a military cell _ far
more commodious than the brick-walled pens of Tuol Sleng _ just 300
yards down a muddy, rutted lane.
</P>
<P>
   He would know the prison well if he returned. It has hardly
changed since he fled in January 1979 after executing the last
half-dozen prisoners, still shackled to their metal cots in bare
interrogation rooms. The bodies are gone, but the cots and shackles
remain. Dried blood still blackens the cracks of the tile floors
beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuol Sleng prison has been preserved unrestored as a museum
since the Khmer Rouge fled a Vietnamese invasion after a Cambodian
reign of terror in which at least a million died. Its windows are
broken and its bars are rusting, surrounded with weeds and refuse,
filled with the twittering of tiny birds.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of its ground-floor rooms are a montage of hundreds of
portraits of prisoners who were greeted with the flash of a camera
when they arrived and, if they survived their torture, were trucked
to a killing field when they left.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year, monks visit to chant Buddhist exorcisms to calm
the ghosts. But for the 40 guides and custodians who provide
security by sleeping here in rotating shifts of 10, the nights
still seem haunted.
</P>
<P>
   Keo Lundi constantly hears a thumping, like that of someone
jumping down from a wall, but every time he leaves his cot to
investigate, he finds nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Lach Kalyan saw a spectral white cat as she swept the back
rooms, growing larger every time she glanced at it until she threw
down her broom in terror and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Lor Chandara once made the mistake of sleeping in a doorway that
was apparently a passage for invisible prowlers and ended up
wrestling with something as insubstantial as the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   One security guard, Keo Lundi said, was tormented night after
night by the image of a young woman who offered herself, unwanted,
at the edge of his cot. But when he kicked at her, he encountered
only the flimsiness of his mosquito net.
</P>
<P>
   Workers say another guard died of a heart attack here after
sharing a communal dream of ghosts with three companions.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a little while ago that a worker was startled, in
broad daylight, by screams for help coming from the back of the
building, several museum guides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like a real person being beaten or killed,'' said
Keo Lundi, who ran to investigate. ``I'd never heard a sound like
that. We looked and looked, but there was nobody there. So we think
it was a ghost, come to take revenge now that Duch is back.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of Duch _ whose real name is Kang Kek Ieu _ is
everywhere in the small, dark upstairs room where Mrs. Lach Kalyan,
44, works alone as the custodian of the Tuol Sleng archive.
</P>
<P>
   On the walls, in glass-fronted cabinets and scattered on a
tabletop, fraying and fading together, are portraits of the chief
Khmer Rouge killers intermingled with the vacant and frightened
faces of their victims.
</P>
<P>
   Reach into a pile of pictures on the table and pull out a
smiling photograph of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader, who died

seeming to ask, as many of the prisoners did when they arrived,
``Where am I?''

   In one cabinet is a reproduction of Duch's rules of conduct for
interrogations, written in chalk on a blackboard with the
starchiness of a strict schoolmaster:

<P>
   ``Answer exactly what you are asked. Never try to dodge the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Answer immediately without taking even a moment to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not scream when you are beaten or electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do nothing. Sit still and wait for my orders. If there is no
order, keep quiet. When I give you a command, obey immediately
without protest.''

   Late afternoons are the worst here among the archives, Mrs. Lach
Kal-yan said, when the building has fallen quiet, the sky begins to
darken and the images around her almost seem to come to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was here and the clouds got very black,'' she said.
``The wind started blowing and the windows were shaking. I was
alone. The clouds got darker and darker, and the room got darker
and darker, just like an American ghost movie. I ran downstairs and
ran home. Even you would have been scared if you were here, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the grounds, though, where the guides sometimes play
volleyball near an outdoor torture rack, the ghosts retreat.
</P>
<P>
   A busload of tourists from Taiwan, together with their
Vietnamese girlfriends, files out past a cluster of one-legged
beggars. A vendor sells soft drinks and postcards. The air is
pungent with the smell of frying garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a man runs past wearing only shorts and jogging shoes.
It is Lor Chandara, who left his job as a guide here eight years
ago, on his daily run through the grounds of Tuol Sleng.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not strange,'' he said, when asked about his choice
of running track. ``I live nearby and it's convenient to come here.
And it's really good, I tell you, jogging. If I don't jog for one
day I feel ill. Plus it lowers the cholesterol.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ NATO troops here thought they had a big
catch Tuesday when they came across eight armed men in a cafe, all
wearing the uniform and insignia of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Since midnight Monday, members of the rebel group were supposed
to be confined to barracks, and if they ventured out, must not
carry weapons or wear uniforms or insignia.
</P>
<P>
   This case seemed a clear breach. The men, all with camouflage
fatigues, short cropped hair and revolvers in holsters, wore the
bright yellow and red badge of the KLA, with its black
double-headed eagle, on their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the NATO soldiers who were violating the
demilitarization agreement, and there were a few embarrassed faces
after they got the men down to the police station.
</P>
<P>
   They had detained two of the KLA's top commanders and local
heroes; Suleyman Selimi, the commander of the National Guard, who
is more popularly known by his nom de guerre ``Sultan,'' and Sali
Lushtaku, the commander of the Drenica zone in central Kosovo, the
heartland of the Kosovo resistance. The men had just been meeting
with the commander of the NATO forces in Kosovo (KFOR), Lt. Gen.
Michael Jackson, to discuss the demilitarization process. After the
meeting they had stopped at a cafe to eat before returning to their
headquarters on the edge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   That was where a NATO patrol of Canadian and British paratroops
spotted them. They brought in two armored personnel carriers, and
some 20 soldiers with automatic weapons and surrounded the
restaurant and its little outdoor terrace.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement with NATO signed last week, KLA
commanders are still allowed to wear their uniforms and carry
pistols when on official business. They can also be accompanied by
three bodyguards each.
</P>
<P>
   The issue at stake in the confrontation was more one of pride
than anything else. ``Tell the commanders that as of last night
they are not allowed to wear uniforms. They should come with us. We
do not want any problems,'' the NATO officer in charge said through
an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Selimi replied: ``We have permission to carry weapons, but we
will come with you in our own car if you think it is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Selimi insisted on driving his own car, but allowed NATO
soldiers to ride with him. Cheered by a crowd of onlookers, they
were led off to the police station by a NATO jeep and followed by
an armored troop carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The men were detained for some 30 minutes in the police station,
and then allowed to depart, with their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called them in to find out who they were. We wanted to
interview them and they satisfied us completely,'' said Sgt. Maj.
David Moore, who was in charge of the police station. ``They were
the model of etiquette and so were we.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he had established who they were, he said he offered the
men a cup of strong British tea, which the Albanians declined.
</P>
<P>
   A British spokesman, Col. Robin Hodges, said some 2,000 KLA
members were now inside designated assembly points. That number is
one-fourth of the estimated total of 8,000 who constituted the
armed force during the war, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some others probably have taken off their uniforms and gone
home, he said. ``We are going to shepherd these people back, not
bully them. We are here to implement an agreement, not to dominate
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's incident underlined the sensitivities of the KLA
commanders, who may not be ready to give up the security and the
prestige their uniforms and guns bring them.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed how wary NATO troops remain of anyone with a
weapon. British troops opened fire and killed a gunman in Lipljan,
just south of Pristina Tuesday. Out on normal patrol, they heard
gunshots, apparently the result of an argument between two men. A
man emerged from the building, aiming a pistol at the soldiers and
after shouting a warning, they shot and killed him.
</P>
<P>
   It is looting, however, that remains the main criminal activity
that NATO troops are battling with full time. British troops have
resorted to flying helicopters equipped with searchlights low over
sections of the city to deter nighttime arsonists and looters.

NASDAQ, S&AMP;P 500 APPROACH RECORD HIGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks staged another broad advance Tuesday as the
NASDAQ composite index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
moved close to their record highs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the solid gains, traders said the increase in prices
appeared to have more to do with technical adjustments to
portfolios than a shift in investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The main market gauges have been under pressure for weeks as
high valuations and the threat of a series of interest rate
increases by the Federal Reserve have combined to sow seeds of
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed governors began two days of meetings Tuesday and will
announce the outcome Wednesday afternoon. The central bank is
widely expected to raise rates by one-quarter of a percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought holds that with few signs of inflation,
the Fed will need to raise interest rates only once this year. But
there is a real possibility that this could be the first in a
series of moves. At the end of last week, many had expected trading
activity would remain light and convictionless until the Fed
revealed its intentions.
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterintuitive,'' said Bob Gasser, head of U.S. equity
trading at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``With valuations where they are
and on the eve of what could be more than one increase in interest
rates by the Fed, I don't understand'' the recent rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose for the third consecutive
session Tuesday, gaining 160.20 points, or 1.5 percent, to
10,815.35.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which was raised to a ``buy'' by analysts at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, United Technologies and General Electric, led
the blue-chip index higher.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market averages also did well.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 surged 20.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,351.45,
16.11 points below its high, reached on May 13. NASDAQ gained
39.67, or 1.5 percent, to 2,642.11. The index is now just 9.94
points below its high on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller-company stocks continued what has been a strong
quarter-long rally. The Russell 2000 index gained 5.47 points, or
1.2 percent, to 454.08.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was much higher than recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 820 million shares changed
hands. Volume on the NASDAQ market was 952 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gasser and other traders said much of the activity
centered on the reconstruction of various market indexes, including
the S&AMP;P 500 and the Russell 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch Communications, which has been acquired by Vodaphone
and will be leaving the S&AMP;P 500 index Wednesday, and Best Buy,
which is replacing it, were heavily traded stocks. Airtouch fell 3
1/2, to 107 1/2. Best Buy rose 3, to 65 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   And some 350 issues, including many Internet stocks, have seen
their market capitalizations expand to the point where they no
longer qualify to be included in the Russell 2000 index. They will
be replaced by others whose market capitalization falls within a
$1.4 billion ceiling and a $180 million floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time with Airtouch and Best Buy,'' Gasser
said. ``All told, I spent about 90 percent of my time on these
index reconfigurations.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First
Boston, said, ``At the end of the day you could see the rebalancing
taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't want to be a hero,'' at this juncture, he added.
``What you really want to see is what the Fed does, and how the
market reacts to early second-quarter earnings reports. The next
couple of weeks will be very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were some fundamental reasons for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   A series of positive announcements from Asian countries,
including Japan and South Korea, helped to bolster stocks of
companies that do a lot of business in the region, like United
Technologies, General Electric, Applied Materials and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies, which derived about 17 percent of its sales
from Asia last year, gained 3 3/4, to 68 15/16. General Electric
rose 3 1/2, to 109 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, the world's leading semiconductor equipment
maker, said its sales in Southeast Asia might double this year. The
stock rose 2 3/4, to 69 1/8. And Intel gained 2 1/4, to 59 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which have been the worst performing group this
quarter, regained some ground Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer rose 3 13/16, to 104 7/8. Warner-Lambert shot up 4 3/8,
to 67 1/8. And Merck gained 1 7/16, to 71 1/2.

NEW RULES FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO TAKE EFFECT AS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
LAW EXPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Corruption investigations against high government
officials will change significantly at midnight Wednesday with the
expiration of the Ethics in Government Act, the law that gave the
country Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr and 19 other
independent counsels during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Thursday, decisions about how and whether to launch
ethics investigations of top officials will be left to Attorney
General Janet Reno, who has sent to Congress for the information of
its members the rules her department will use in handling such
inquiries. The rules, under which her department will name special
prosecutors in certain cases, give her far more discretion than the
current independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, she dispensed with the convoluted and
controversial procedures of the independent counsel law, with its
three-judge panels to appoint the counsels and multi-stage
preliminary inquiries on whether the attorney general should
request such an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she left to herself the authority to decide crucial
matters now strictly governed by the statute, such as when to
appoint someone from outside the Justice Department to carry out an
investigation of a high-level administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Under Reno's draft guidelines, she alone would be responsible
for appointing a special prosecutor, as such prosecutors would now
be known, only after she decided that an investigation would pose a
conflict of interest within the Justice Department and that such an
outside prosecutor was in the public interest. Under existing law,
appointments are not made by the attorney general, but by a
three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   There will be few mourners of the Ethics in Government Act and
not a chance that lawmakers will revive the statute in its present
form.
</P>
<P>
   The law, enacted in 1978, stands as a crumbling monument to
Watergate and the Saturday Night Massacre, the crisis over
President Nixon's effort to fire a special prosecutor that inspired
the statute. But after 21 years, the high-minded focus of the law
seemed to change along with Washington's scandal glutted culture,
turning the independent counsel into an inquisitorial, first-strike
weapon to be aimed at incumbent administrations of both parties.
The total cost of all independent counsel inquiries as of April was
$167 million.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general was an enthusiastic supporter of the
independent counsel law shortly after taking office in 1993. But
after years of being bludgeoned over her decisions, she announced
at a congressional appearance in March that the statute was too
``structurally flawed'' to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   A few lawmakers have offered proposals to preserve aspects of
the current law, including one offered Tuesday by a bipartisan
group including two Republicans, Arlen Specter or Pennsylvania and
Susan Collins of Maine and two Democrats, Carl Levin of Michigan
and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. Theirs would keep the law
largely intact, but tinker substantially with central provisions,
narrowing the number of officials covered, raising the threshold
for appointment, improving the quality of independent counsel
appointees. Few lawmakers give such ideas much chance of winning
much support _ at least not unless the Justice Department's new
approach fails.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the new regulations nor the expiration of the law has
any impact on existing independent counsels like Starr and the four
other currently serving prosecutors. These independent prosecutors
are investigating the activities of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, former Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros and events surrounding former Secretary Mike Espy's
tenure at the Agriculture Department. Espy was acquitted of charges
that he accepted illegal gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the sitting prosecutors, only Starr has hinted that he might
consider closing down when the law expires. He offered a possible
sign of his intentions on Monday when lawyers following the case
said that he had reached a plea bargain agreement with Webster
Hubbell, a former top Justice Department official.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deal, in which Hubbell would plead guilty to lying about the
role he and Hillary Rodham Clinton played in a failed Arkansas land
deal, would avert a trial and end the last pending prosecution in
the nearly five-year investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics law lies in ruins largely because it failed,
abysmally, in the view of almost every official who has been
scrutinized by independent counsels, in its goal of extracting
politics from inquiries into alleged abuses by top government
officials. Starr himself is a critic of the statute and testified
against its renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican and chairman of the
Governmental Affairs Committee, said after his committee held a
series of hearings to consider amending the law, that he had
abandoned any effort to fix it. He instead recommended: ``Give it a
decent burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not the first president to complain of excesses by
an independent prosecutor armed with grand jury subpoenas. But no
other president has been so seriously threatened. After Starr's
referral of alleged misdeeds involving Monica Lewinsky, Clinton was
impeached by the House but acquitted after a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's predecessors also complained that independent
prosecutors had turned political differences into criminal
offenses. During the terms of President Ronald Reagan and George
Bush, Lawrence E. Walsh, the Iran-Contra independent counsel, was
regularly attacked by Republicans for his aggressive investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh continued to investigate for six years until President
Bush delivered a death blow in the form of a Christmas Eve pardon
in 1992 _ after he had lost the election to Clinton _ absolving
former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and five other
officials who had either been charged or convicted of wrongdoing in
the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Even Walsh, however, concluded that the law should be
drastically narrowed. ``It's had its moment and that moment has
passed,'' Walsh said. ``Let's see how we get along.''

HEAT'S ON FOR ODOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, R.I. _ For about 30 minutes, steady bouncing of
basketballs and quick-stop squeaking of athletic shoes could be
heard on the opposite side of the University of Rhode Island's
Tootell East Gym. Then it gave way to footsteps heading toward the
door, which flung open after being shoved by an angry,
sweat-drenched 19-year-old who had spent the previous half-hour
trying to impress NBA scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They picked a great gym,'' shouted URI sophomore Lamar Odom,
reaching for a nearby empty trash can to hold open the door so
fresh air could enter the gym _ which had no open windows and no
air conditioning. After a few failed attempts, he lowered his head
and returned inside to brace the elements again.
</P>
<P>
   You have to feel for Lamar Odom. Many facets of his life have
been all too similar to the pressure cooker he worked out in Monday
night, and too often his need to break away for fresh air
outweighed his willingness to withstand and endure.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has played just one season of college basketball, Odom
is the most talented prospect in the NBA draft. At 6 feet 10
inches, he can play all five positions. He is a text-book perimeter
shooter but thinks pass first. He sees the floor well, can create
off the dribble, and has a quick, fluid first step.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, he handles pressure with the composure of a
seasoned veteran: In his first collegiate game, he scored on a
finger roll with 5.7 seconds left to lift URI past Texas Christian.
In his penultimate game, he scored on a 25-foot 3-pointer at the
buzzer to beat Temple in the Atlantic 10 tournament final, giving
URI its first conference title.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's safe to say that the four teams present for the
workout (Toronto, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami, and Chicago) did not
sit through the suffocating air to check out Odom's skills.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to hear his side of the story _ why, after
committing to the NBA draft and signing with an agent, did Odom
skip a Bulls workout and fail to show up at the predraft camp?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Bulls assistant coach Frank Hamblen put it, ``I just
wanted to know if there really was a Lamar Odom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Queens, N.Y., resident said he didn't shoot well in the
workout and added, ``I'm looking forward to (the draft), but
hopefully I didn't take myself out of the top five.'' It was his
first meeting with assembled media since May 17, when he announced
he was forgoing his last two seasons of college eligibility to
enter the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Odom is concerned about his stock with NBA scouts because
``everything that has been going on has been so crazy. But I'm a
fighter. I wanted to come back because it's a crazy business and at
19 years old, you have to be ready for everything. It caught me a
little bit off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the business part of it, for a 19 year old, someone who
doesn't really have anyone close to him, a father figure who can be
there and that really knows everything that's happening, all of
this I had to take care of myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught me off guard, and I just love the innocence of
college basketball, and with Jerry (DeGregorio) being the head
coach, (URI) is a great place to play. It made it hard to sleep at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom is still a gem in the eyes of scouts. Chicago has the first
overall pick, Los Angeles fourth and Toronto fifth, respectively,
and it is doubtful they would have ventured to Kingston two days
before the draft if they weren't interested in Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Washington Post reported that Toronto and the
Washington Wizards (seventh pick) were exploring swapping picks,
enabling the Wizards to possibly select Odom or Miami of Ohio star
Wally Szczerbiak. DeGregorio, who has also served as Odom's mentor
and advisor, said he has been besieged with calls from agents,
scouts, marketing firms, management groups, and trading card
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say Odom's indecision hasn't bothered some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating in the evaluation process,'' said
Hamblen, ``because you also want to deal with someone on a personal
basis. I know that we are not the only franchise that's
disappointed. For whatever reason, there have been a lot of broken
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the recent wavering came at a time when Odom had
appeared to be shedding that reputation. It began to take root when
he left Christ the King High School in Queens after his sophomore
season and attended Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, N.Y.,
then left there for St. Thomas Aquinas in Milford, Conn., where
DeGregorio once coached.
</P>
<P>
   Odom signed a national letter of intent to attend Nevada-Las
Vegas, then was released from the letter after a Sports Illustrated
article questioned the validity of his entrance exam scores. He
opted to try and earn a scholarship at URI as a nonmatriculating
student his first year but left a few times that year while
attempting to make the grade, including once during final exams.
</P>
<P>
   Odom finished his one-year career at URI as one of the school's
most celebrated players. He averaged 17.6 points and 9.4 rebounds
per game, and was named A-10 rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   When Odom declared himself eligible for the draft, he said he
would not sign with an agent before the draft, and he added that he
could not foresee anything that would make him change his mind and
return to URI. Asked that day about his wavering in the past, Odom
said that was indicative of growing pains and added, ``I'm a man
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom did, however, go on to sign with New York-based agent Jeff
Klein. But following a workout with the Vancouver Grizzlies, he
decided he wasn't ready for the NBA lifestyle after all. Klein
ultimately resigned as Odom's agent.
</P>
<P>
   Odom's change of heart came a day after DeGregorio indicated
that Odom was not pulling out of the draft and was merely seeking
new representation.
</P>
<P>
   Underclassmen who sign with agents forfeit their eligibility.
URI officials initially offered to help Odom prepare a long-shot
appeal with the NCAA, but then changed their minds, stating that
the facts surrounding the situation didn't warrant going forward.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest part about Odom's tale is that it often leads people
to draw the wrong conclusions; he is actually a very bright,
approachable individual.
</P>
<P>
   But even Odom knows he needs to work on his decision- making: In
the past, when the going got tough and he left, Odom was always
able to return to another chance. Now he knows that some actions
are irreversible. Perhaps he found out just in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it a shot and it didn't work,'' said Odom about trying
to return to school. He added he harbors no ill feelings toward URI
for changing its mind. ``As soon as they told me I couldn't come
back, I got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about changing his mind about signing with an agent, Odom
said if he had to do it all over again, he would not have done so,
but would have sought legal counsel instead. Moreover, he said he
still would have explored going to the NBA. He said difficulties
with people around him led him to renege on attending the predraft
camp. ``That was when I decided to return to Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just would have kept my options open. Me signing with an
agent killed my chances of coming back,'' Odom added. ``But I'm
happy to be an NBA player. This is what I've always wanted, what
I've always dreamed about.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeGregorio said he repeatedly has been asked if he was surprised
Odom wanted to come back. ``And my comments are that I would have
been surprised if he didn't come back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very safe place for him. He likes it here. He likes
being with his friends, the college lifestyle, and the social
aspects of it. He loves his teammates and he's very close with his
coaching staff. I think once he looked out and viewed what was out
there in terms of that lifestyle he just realized that, `Maybe I
could wait another year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bozeman said that when he was coaching at California, he
had three players leave early _ Jason Kidd, Shareef Abdur-Rahim,
and Lamond Murray. He said Abdur-Rahim, who wanted to leave solely
to take care of his family, changed his mind then changed it again,
and was drafted by Vancouver as the third overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   But Bozeman said that Odom's indecision is not unique to college
basketball because players usually want to showcase their skills
immediately upon leaving school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you're out there, basically,'' said Bozeman. ``I
think there is a maturity factor there. I think he probably wanted
to crawl back into the cocoon of college basketball, and there's
nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is pursuing new representation, Odom said, ``I'm
trying. But it's no great hurry. I've been in contact with Billy
Hunter, and I think he will wind up handling some of my work. It's
a new age with a player where you don't need an agent the first
couple of years. Everything is set in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   After working out, Odom was swarmed for autographs by several
youngsters who were at URI attending the US Scholar- Athlete Games.
At one point, a girl tapped on the shoulder of an onlooker, pointed
to Odom and said, ``You see that guy right there? He's going to be
famous someday.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can duplicate his collegiate exploits at the pro level,
and improve his decision-making skills, Odom likely will be. Still,
to hear him talk, he would still put it on hold for a chance to
play four years of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any advice for young players who will face a
similar decision, Odom quickly fired back, ``Stay for four years of
college,'' he said. ``You will make it much easier. You will learn
so much. Four years of college is the best thing I think anybody
can do.''

CMGI BUYS MOST OF COMPAQ'S ALTAVISTA IN $2.3B DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its largest deal yet to build its Internet holdings, CMGI
Inc. will buy most of Compaq Computer Corp.'s AltaVista search
engine in a deal worth about $2.3 billion, mostly in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Tuesday will give Compaq, the
Houston-based computer maker, control of about 16 percent of CMGI
and a seat on the Internet venture company's board as its largest
outside investor.
</P>
<P>
   In return, CMGI will gain control of 83 percent of AltaVista and
the task of turning the lagging search service into a full-fledged
Internet portal site.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, rumored for a week, ends some uncertainty about
Compaq's Internet strategy and marks a maturation of CMGI, whose
shares rose 13 percent after the agreement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most of CMGI's market valuation of $10.5 billion
relates to small investments it once made in start-up companies
that later blossomed, including Lycos Inc. and GeoCities.
</P>
<P>
   Now CMGI is looking to capitalize on users who visit the
plethora of chat, news, and retail-service sites it operates or in
which it holds stakes. AltaVista could make an ideal platform for
links to services such as the Raging Bull financial news site or
the Furniture.com shopping service, said CMGI chairman and chief
executive David Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have the broadest reach on the Internet,''
Wetherell said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Compaq declined to discuss specific financial terms of
their agreement, but Wetherell said the additional revenue from
AltaVista would roughly double CMGI's current operating revenue of
about $160 million. Each company will also spend about $50 million
to bolster advertising for AltaVista, he said, compared to the
roughly $1 million Compaq has spent on branding so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, CMGI will also take control of
related AltaVista business units such as Shopping.com, and will
issue a $220 million three-year note to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   For Compaq, the deal finally clarifies its intentions toward
AltaVista, which has stagnated since the computer maker acquired it
along with the rest of Digital Equipment Corp. in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Digital once touted AltaVista's speed, but under Compaq's
stewardship AltaVista has failed to keep up with competitors
including Lycos and Yahoo Inc., which have added new services and
transformed themselves from search tools into full-fledged portal
sites. In May, AltaVista attracted 10.6 million visitors, compared
with 31 million for Yahoo, according to Media Metrix Inc. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said earlier this year it might sell public shares of
AltaVista, and as recently as Monday AltaVista was rolling out new
services it said would make it more competitive. But Tuesday,
Compaq's chairman and acting chief executive Benjamin Rosen said
CMGI might map out a better future for AltaVista, and that his
company hopes to capitalize on CMGI's diverse holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it made more sense to have a share of (CMGI's) broad
portfolio rather than 100 percent of one property,'' Rosen said in
a conference call with analysts and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the companies might sell public shares in AltaVista,
but for now the unit and its 475 employees will remain in Palo
Alto, Calif., under the direction of Rod Schrock, a Compaq veteran
named to head the company earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista's problems had drawn many skeptics, and people
familiar with the company said before striking its deal with CMGI,
Compaq had also held talks with other parties including Yahoo,
Lycos, and Time-Warner Inc. (All declined official comment.)
</P>
<P>
   The deal also muddies the outlook for CMGI's relationship with
Waltham-based Lycos, an AltaVista competitor in which CMGI still
holds a 20 percent stake. Lycos once seemed a natural partner for
some of CMGI's services, but Wetherell and Lycos chief executive
Bob Davis fell out earlier this year over a different merger
proposed by Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, analysts were generally positive about the
CMGI-Compaq deal and suggested it would position the Andover firm
to consolidate traffic among its various properties and affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Compaq) are selling it to people who can actually create
some value out of it,'' said First Albany Corp. analyst Ullas Naik.
``CMGI has reached a certain level in its growth curve where they
needed a major deal like this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hambrecht &AMP; Quist analyst Paul Noglows, ``Strategically it
makes sense, since one of the things that CMGI has always been
about is drawing traffic and funneling through all sorts of
different services.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement implied a total value of $2.7 billion for
AltaVista. Assuming total revenue of about $160 million, CMGI is
paying about 14 times earnings for its stake _ in line with the
valuations of other Internet stocks, Noglows said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also noted that by taking on the task of operating
AltaVista, the deal will help CMGI avoid a regulatory
classification as an investment company. Among other things, that
would require its shareholders to pay higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Share in CMGI, based in Andover, Mass., rose 12 5/8 to close at
110 5/16 in Nasdaq trading. Shares in Compaq rose 1 1/16 to 23 3/8
in New York Stock Exchange trading.

VERE BIRD, 89, WHO LED ANTIGUA TO INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vere C. Bird, a child of the slums and a Salvation Army drummer
who carried the Caribbean island of Antigua to independence and
then sired the family dynasty that has led and dominated the
country ever since, died June 28 in the capital, St. Johns. He was
89.
</P>
<P>
   At his death after a long illness, the Caribbean News Agency
quoted his son, Lester Bird, who is also his successor as prime
minister, as saying, ``He raised us and produced us to continue in
his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear from the context if he meant Antiguans generally,
or himself and his brothers. In fact Vere Bird had done both,
changing the political and social destiny of the island and
becoming what native Antiguan writer Jamaica Kincaid described as a
family patriarch ``who thinks that the government is his own
business.``
</P>
<P>
   Despite drug and gun-running scandals that touched his family
and government, Bird was regularly returned to office until he
retired in 1994, paving the way for his son. At his death, his
oldest son, Vere Bird Jr., was the agriculture minister while a
younger one, Ivor, a former Cabinet member who has been tainted by
scandal, directed the family-owned radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., who was born in a ramshackle shanty and
never went beyond grammar school, was a large, athletic and
powerful man with a preacher's voice and a sharp tongue. As in the
case of so many who were to become leaders of independent Caribbean
states, he first tasted power and attained prominence as a labor
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of his popularity among the 65,000 citizens on the
islands of Antigua and Barbuda was established in the early 1940s,
when these dots in the leeward chain were sugar-producing colonies
ruled from London and dominated by planters.
</P>
<P>
   Like Norman Manley and Alexander Bustamante in Jamaica, Eric
Gairy in Grenada and Dr. Eric Williams in Trinidad, he used
organized labor to confront both the planters and the colonial ties
that maintained their power. As president of the Antigua Trades and
Labor Union, he led sugar cane workers in strikes for higher wages
during World War II. He also pressured plantation owners to turn
over plots and home sites to the sugar harvesters who had been
their tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The union soon branched off into the Antigua Labor Party and in
the late 1940s, Bird won his first election to what was then still
a colonial legislature. In 1951, when universal suffrage was
introduced, the party led by Bird won every seat in Parliament, a
feat it would regularly repeat. In 1981, when Antigua became fully
independent, he became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as tourism replaced the sugar production as Antigua's
economic mainstay, Bird's record of nationalism and populism seemed
to pay increasing dividends to his person and to his family.
According to Franklin W. Knight, a historian at Johns Hopkins and
the author of ``The Caribbean,'' Bird became one of the ``unusual
number of charismatic, caudillo-style politicians'' produced in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiguan political opposition charged that under the Birds'
rule, the island became a haven for international con men; in
recent years, U.S. government agencies have identified Antigua as a
key transit point for South American cocaine bound for Europe and
as a money laundering center. Ms. Kincaid, whose memoir ``A Small
Place'' dealt with growing up in Antigua, described the place in
this later period as ``a monument to rottenness.''
</P>
<P>
   Several scandalous revelations lay behind the criticisms. In May
1990, a court in Tel Aviv indicted an Israeli officer on charges of
illegally shipping assault weapons to Vere Bird Jr. in order to
have them forwarded to the members of the Gacha drug cartel in
Columbia. When islanders responded with protests and signs
proclaiming ``The Birds Must Go,'' the younger Bird resigned his
Cabinet post as minister of public works, but no charges were filed
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years earlier, a Canadian company called Space Research
owned by Gerald Bull was permitted to test howitzers on the island.
After a newspaper that was later shut down by the government
reported that the company was shipping arms to the white minority
government of South Africa, Space Research quietly withdrew. In
1990 Bull was in the news again when he was shot to death in
Belgium, where he was reported to be working on a gigantic cannon
for Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Ivor Bird was fined $75,000 after being caught with a 25
pound shipment of cocaine as he boarded a plane at the airport
named for his father. The following year U.S. officials expressed
concern about the arrival on the island of what they described as
organized crime groups from Russia, reportedly involved in money
laundering, drugs, arms sales and extortion. Another scandal
involved efforts by the ruling family to sell off the sands of a
highly unusual pink beach.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such embarrassments, Bird countered with speeches
reminding residents of the time when the only work available was
backbreaking labor of cutting cane and when drinking water came
from dirty ponds. He would make these speeches into his 80s,
accompanied by his wife, Lydia, his daughter Lisette, and his sons,
who also included Curtis, a lawyer, and Roswald, a teacher. His
household also included a mistress named Cutie Francis.
</P>
<P>
   His body will lie in state at Antigua's Parliament.

CELLULAR ONE DUMPS PLAN TO CHARGE FOR UNANSWERED CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being deluged with angry calls from customers, Cellular
One has pulled the plug on a plan to begin charging for calls 15
seconds after the send button is hit, even if no one answers the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had planned to implement the new billing
procedure Thursday, said it would continue its existing policy of
billing customers after 30 seconds have elapsed. That's the
equivalent of about six rings; 15 seconds would have allowed only
three rings. Other cellular phone companies begin charging only if
a connection is made.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-sentence statement, the company said it reversed
itself after ``evaluating our pricing and product plans to ensure
we're meeting our customers' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But customers and sources inside the company said the about-face
occurred only because of a loud chorus of customer complaints. The
company had notified customers of the planned change in April, but
most did not become aware of it until a Boston Globe story on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several called the Globe to complain. John R. Fisher of Walpole
was so incensed that he said he planned to drop Cellular One when
his contract expires in November. Another caller, who asked not to
be identified, said he wanted to cancel his contract immediately
but couldn't because a penalty clause would have kicked in. The
caller said other cellular phone companies allow you to opt out
with no penalty if the company changes terms of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One, a subsidiary of SBC Communications of San Antonio,
defended the 15-second billing approach last week by saying its
network is utilized whenever a call is initiated. Because Cellular
One bills in one-minute increments, the 15-second policy would have
meant calls that ring longer would have carried at least a
one-minute charge, from 10 cents to 52 cents, depending on the
customer's calling plan. If the caller had free minutes, they would
start being deducted after 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   SBC operates cellular firms under various names in many parts of
the United States, including much of Texas, Connecticut,
Washington, D.C., and Chicago. But SBC chose to move to 15-second
billing only in the Boston market, which stretches from southern
New Hampshire to Rhode Island. It declined to say why.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Greyser, a marketing and communications professor at
Harvard Business School, said the company's change of heart will
probably minimize the damage. ``I would characterize their initial
decision as an unwise, arguably stupid, decision,'' Greyser said.
``Rescinding it is better than making the original decision and
sticking with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lowenstein, senior vice president at the Yankee Group
consulting firm in Boston, said he was astounded Cellular One was
moving to charge customers for calls after 15 seconds when the
trend in the industry is to give away more for less.
</P>
<P>
   John Palmer, executive director of marketing for Bell Atlantic
Mobile, said he suspected that rival Cellular One must have heard a
lot of static from its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's hypercompetitive wireless industry, no one has to
tolerate any type of unnecessary charge that they think is
unfair,'' he said.

`SOUTH PARK' CREATORS FOUGHT FOR R RATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The makers of the ``South Park'' movie don't deny
that the outrageous cartoon comedy deserves its R rating. They do
say, however, that the battles to bring the foul-mouthed little
film to the screen didn't have to be so, well, animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call them skirmishes. It was more a constant
battle,'' said Trey Parker, who with partner Matt Stone created the
``South Park'' series on Comedy Central and made the new movie,
``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut.''
</P>
<P>
   It took months of negotiations between the film's creators and
the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) before the movie
ratings board granted ``South Park'' an R, meaning anyone under 17
must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The board had initially insisted on the NC-17 rating, which
means no one under 17 may be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would've been the kiss of death, and we knew it,'' Parker
said. ``We got a series of notes describing what the MPAA objected
to. And it started with this certain scene we couldn't believe they
wanted us to cut. So, just because we were angry and just because
we could, we made it 10 times worse and five times longer and
resubmitted it to make them watch it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they came back going, `OK, that's better.' We learned
every time they told us to take something out, we'd replace it with
something much, much worse and much funnier.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers said the MPAA first annoyed them by giving
``Orgazmo'' _ their comedy about porno films _ an NC-17, the mark
of death commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, we didn't have a studio behind us, and there
wasn't anything we could do,'' says Parker, who dubbed ``Bigger,
Longer &AMP; Uncut'' much edgier than their earlier film. ``I mean, the
board didn't even give us notes telling us what they objected to.''
</P>
<P>
   But the $20 million ``South Park'' movie had Paramount Pictures
muscle behind it, and this time the filmmakers got notes _ lots of
them.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't cartoon violence but sexual content that upset the
board. For example, at one point in the process, the MPAA
complained of a scene where ``South Park's'' cartoon kids surf for
porn on the Internet and come across a particularly nasty Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we took that out and had them find something far worse,''
Parker, 29, explained. ``The board accidentally made the film
better. But my goal in life is to take that thing (the MPAA) down,
because it's so arbitrary and wrong. They target bad language but
don't care about violence.''
</P>
<P>
   MPAA president Jack Valenti defended the board from assertions
that it cares more about screen sex than violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to generate publicity for your movie, what do you
do? You trash the ratings system,'' Valenti told The New York
Times. ``The ratings are not designed to please motion picture
studios or producers or raters. They're designed to give advance
cautionary warnings to parents. And that's the only audience we
care about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Parker and Stone _ who had final cut _ say some of the
jokes the MPAA ruled too dirty for the multiplex have been recycled
for TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie board is more strict than the TV people,'' Stone,
27, said. ``But it wasn't like we started out with `Who can we
offend, and how can we do it?' It's a musical _ an R-rated,
animated musical.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' mirrors
current events. In a pivotal scene, the animated tykes sneak into
an R-rated movie, go home and begin repeating all the filthy
language they've heard in the film, sparking a political firestorm
that eventually leads to war with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, one of the kids is implanted with a ``V-chip''
that gives him an electronic shock every time he utters a bad word.
Ironically, the movie opens today, one day before new TV sets go on
sale equipped with a parent-comforting V-chip designed to block
objectionable programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park's'' creators acknowledge many of their most loyal
fans are under 18 and admit some of those youngsters will see the
80-minute film regardless of the rating and despite the promises of
theater chains to check identification when selling tickets to
teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans will see it one way or the other, and I hope other
people will, too,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kay Bergman, the voice of Mrs. Cartman, Sheila Broflovski
and Mrs. McCormick in ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut,'' says
the film clearly deserves its R rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dearly hope parents are going to be cautious about this film
and not bring young children to see it, because it's very raw, and
we do a lot of things that we can't do on TV,'' she said. ``People
don't always understand that `South Park' is not for kids just
because it's animated and children are the main characters. It's
designed for an older audience. That's why it's on TV late at
night, as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Parker and Stone insist the message of the
comedy is ``question authority'' while pointing out there's
probably worse language heard in most high school cafeterias than
in their film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, we're expecting controversy,'' Parker said. ``We wrote
the script a year ago, and it's just ironic that the spotlight has
been on some of these issues. If anything, it makes the film more
poignant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High School slayings in Littleton, Colo., hit
Parker and Stone close to home, since Stone grew up in the state,
and Parker was born there. Stone's parents still live in Littleton,
and the filmmaker says he took his SAT's in the high school's
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have happened anywhere,'' he said. ``We were as
shocked and saddened as everyone else about what happened.'' &QL;

REBEL KURDISH LEADER SENTENCED TO DIE BY TURKISH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A Turkish security court on Tuesday sentenced
the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to death for his 15-year
campaign against the Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the violence that followed Ocalan's arrest in
February, the sentence set off concerns for security around the
country and beyond. But there were no reports of violent reaction
either in Turkey, where the police were on high alert, or
elsewhere. Kurds staged peaceful protests in Bonn, Moscow, the
Hague, Paris and other European cities. Others scuffled with police
in Rome and Nicosia, Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments, including the United States, appealed for
calm and urged Turkey not to carry out the sentence. Ocalan's rebel
group said it had no plans to order retaliation for the verdict
because the Turkish state ``still has the power to amend this.''
The Kurds in southeast Turkey began their armed struggle for an
independent state 15 years ago, rebelling against Turkey's attempts
to suppress their language and culture. Both sides have been
accused of atrocities during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the three-judge panel that pronounced the sentence,
Turgut Okyay, said Ocalan's fighters had ``murdered thousands of
innocent people, among them babies, children, women and the
elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocalan and the organization he ruled carried out terrorist
actions aimed at dividing the state,'' Okyay said. ``His activities
constitute a serious, immediate and great danger to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   During his trial on the prison island of Imrali, Ocalan
confessed his responsibility for killings but said he had changed
his views and was now ready to make peace. He said that if his life
is spared and the government grants greater cultural freedom to
Kurds, he would ask his followers to give up their guerrilla
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he also warned that if he is hanged the conflict would grow.
He said 5,000 of his followers were ready to stage suicide attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not accept this charge of treason,'' he said in a brief
statement before the sentencing. ``I believe I have struggled for
the unity of this land and for a free life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, 50, showed no reaction as he was sentenced. Relatives of
Turkish war victims who were in the courtroom, together with their
lawyers, whooped for joy and began singing the national anthem.
Ocalan rose to his feet, smiled wanly, shambled out of the glass
booth in which he has been seated throughout the trial and left the
courtroom through an adjacent door.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction of treason carries a mandatory death sentence in
Turkey, so the verdict was widely expected. A long appeals process
may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The case will automatically go to a higher court for review, and
if the sentence is upheld there, both Parliament and President
Suleyman Demirel must approve it if it is to be carried out.
Military commanders may be able to influence the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is also expected to appeal to the European Court of Human
Rights, whose jurisdiction Turkey has accepted in the past. Such
appeals can take a year or longer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The political wing of Ocalan's party, the Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK, issued a statement in Vienna after the verdict
saying that party leaders would ``look at this new development from
all sides, discuss it, and then implement the strategy and actions
as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The PKK has regarded this process as illegitimate from the
beginning,'' the statement said. ``With this ruling, the Turkish
side has ignored the call by the Kurdish side for a peaceful
settlement of the war and an end to the bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders say that the PKK has served as a tool for
foreign powers seeking to divide Turkey. They have repeatedly
refused to consider its cease-fire proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In southeastern Turkey, however, many Kurds openly express
admiration for Ocalan and his movement. They complain about their
region's low level of economic development and what they perceive
as the government's refusal to recognize their ethnic rights. These
sentiments helped Ocalan's build his movement into one of the
world's most potent guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
   They have achieved some victories. When the Kurds took up arms
against the Turks, their language was banned on the streets, their
music was not allowed to be played and Kurdish-language education
was forbidden. Today, Kurdish conversation and music can be heard
but the language is still not taught.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial Ocalan acknowledged that his fighters have
carried out all the attacks they were accused of and described some
of their activities as ``the mistakes of people with a peasant
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments and human rights advocates say that Turkish
security forces have burned several thousand villages, tortured
Kurds in detention centers, and supported death squads that killed
many suspected Kurdish nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, Demirel said that since the armed
conflict began in 1984, it had cost the lives of 5,302 civilians,
5,555 soldiers and security officers, and 23,638 PKK members.

BOSTON FINANCIER, EVERCORE BUY INSERT FIRM FOR $1.9B 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston financier Thomas H. Lee and Evercore Capital Partners
announced Tuesday a $1.9 billion buyout of the nation's largest
printer of newspaper advertising inserts, New York-based Big Flower
Holdings Inc. Lee will reportedly take 60 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street uncertainty about the deal led Big Flower shares to
plunge nearly 4 points to 31 9/16. Standard &AMP; Poor's indicated it
might slash Big Flower's credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Big Flower was founded in 1992 by current chairman Theodore
Ammon, a former Kohlberg Kravis Roberts takeover specialist. It
provides what it calls highly targeted advertising and promotional
products and services to 3,000 customers, such as newspaper inserts
aimed at high-income communities and direct mail campaigns. It
reported revenue of $1.8 billion for the year ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Bloomberg Business News,
citing a person familiar with the transaction, said when the deal
is complete, Thomas H. Lee Co. will own about 60 percent of the
company and Evercore 15 percent. The deal includes $900 million to
buy outstanding stock and assumption and refinancing of $955
million in debt, Bloomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Under proposed terms, Big Flower shareholders would get $30 cash
per share and $5.25 worth of preferred stock accruing 10 percent
annual dividends. Ammon's management team will continue to run the
company and own a substantial fraction of shares.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas H. Lee Co., which manages $5 billion, said Big Flower has
``an outstanding management team and great market positions'' with
big growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   The deal needs shareholder approval at a meeting set for
September or October. Tuesday's annual meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's recent deals include taking large stakes in Patriot
American Hospitality Inc., Eye Care Centers of America, battery
maker Rayovac, Safelite Glass, Fisher Scientific International, and
Experian Information Solutions. Evercore is headed by former US
deputy treasury secretary Roger Altman. Last month it paid $850
million for the publisher of the National Enquirer and Star
supermarket tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1.4 million shares of Big Flower changed hands in New
York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, six times recent daily volume.
Big Flower announced in April it was considering a sale or other
strategic transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The deal led rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's to put several Big
Flower corporate credit ratings on ``credit watch with negative
implications.'' More information about the structure and rationale
for the deal is expected in Securities and Exchange Commission
filings this week.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Securities, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co. are committing financing for the deal, Big Flower
said.

 ISTANBUL: PKK members.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days after Ocalan's capture last February in Kenya, where
he had been living under the protection of Greek diplomats, Kurds
in Turkey and in many European cities erupted in violent anger.
After the death sentence was pronounced on Tuesday, Germany's
interior minister, Otto Schily, urged the 2 million Kurds living
there to ``remain calm and not to get swept up in ill-conceived
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments by American officials reflected a combination sympathy
for the Turks and concern about their treatment of Ocalan. The
White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, called Ocalan ``an
international terrorist who should be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the United
States was concerned about ``the initial nine days of incommunicado
detention imposed on Mr. Ocalan and the limited access of Ocalan's
lawyers to private consultations with their client and to written
material included in the prosecution case.''
</P>
<P>
   European governments strongly urged that the death sentence not
be carried out. Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema of Italy, which
denied Ocalan asylum, warned Turkey against ``distancing itself
from Europe'' and said: ``One cannot even think of carrying out
this sentence.'' President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic also
said he opposed executing Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said avoiding
execution would show Turkey's adherence to ``high principles of
humanity.'' A French government spokeswoman said a commutation
``would be in keeping with Turkey's European calling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe, which is dedicated to promoting democracy
and human rights on the continent, said none of its 41 member
states had executed a prisoner in the last two years, and called
upon Turkey, which is a member, to extend the unofficial moratorium
on executions that has been in force here since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there seem to be real opportunities to bring an end to the
terrorist actions in the southeast part of Turkey and to establish
peace,'' the council said in a statement. ``These opportunities
must not be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   The council said Ocalan had been given a fair trial, but the
private human rights group Amnesty International disagreed, saying
the trial ``violated both national law and international
standards.'' The chief human rights officer of the United Nations,
Mary Robinson, said ``lack of due process'' made the verdict
``particularly disquieting.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion in Turkey still seems heavily favorable to
carrying out the death sentence. It is shaped in part by relatives
of Turkish war victims, hundreds of whom cheered wildly and hugged
each other on the docks of Mudanya, near Ocalan's island prison,
when the verdict was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit opposes the death penalty on
principle, but his main coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, whose
party includes many militant nationalists, has said he will do all
he can to assure Ocalan's execution.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days various intellectuals, including some close to
the government, have been urging that Ocalan's life be spared. A
former Turkish ambassador to the United States, Sukru Elekdag, said
Turkey should use this ``historic opportunity'' to end the war by
commuting the death sentence and recognizing ``Kurdish identity.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent newspaper columnist wrote: ``Let us not hang him
because he will then be a symbol; because Turkey will then be
isolated; because a democratic country does not act with vengeance;
because terror will then never end; and because Turkey, to remain
part of the democratic world, must realize that Kurds are living on
their soil and respect their demand to protect their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yilidrim Akbulut, the speaker of the Parliament, reflected
what may be the view of many government leaders. ``This was
definitely the necessary punishment,'' Akbulut told reporters soon
after the verdict was announced. ``Those who practice terror must
pay the price.''

GILLETTE SUES RIVAL OVER RAZOR PATENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Gillette Co. is suing a small rival for infringing on
its patents used to make its Mach3 razor, less than a week after an
inventor and a local engineering firm made similar claims against
Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after claiming that lawsuit was baseless, Gillette
disclosed Tuesday it filed a federal lawsuit of its own three weeks
ago against American Safety Razor Co. of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ASR, as the company is known, asserted that Gillette's suit is
without merit.
</P>
<P>
   If Gillette can successfully persuade the court that ASR's new
three-bladed Tri-Flexxx infringes on some of its Mach3 patents, ASR
might have to pull the Tri-Flexxx off the market and redesign it,
Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised that Gillette would sue us over these
matters,'' countered ASR president Jim Murphy. ``ASR strongly
believes that the products cited in Gillette's filing do not
infringe on the intellectual property rights of Gillette.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides infringing on its patents, Gillette's lawsuit asserts
that ASR has made misleading comparisons to the Mach3 in its
Tri-Flexxx advertising and that the packaging of Tri-Flexxx is so
similar to Mach3's as to confuse consumers.
</P>
<P>
   When it debuted last year, Mach3 was billed as the world's first
three-bladed razor; Gillette said it has invested more than $1
billion in Mach3's development and marketing launch.
</P>
<P>
   Tri-Flexxx seems poised to be positioned as a low-cost
alternative to Mach3. A four-pack of Mach3 razor cartridges has a
suggested retail price of about $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   ASR makes razors retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sell
under their own brand names. Retailers set their own prices, which
are lower than those of the national brands.
</P>
<P>
   Given the difficulties Gillette has faced in selling its
products in such ailing economies as Russia and Brazil, sustaining
Mach3's early success is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ASR would seem like a gnat nipping at Gillette. ASR had $297
million in 1998 sales. Gillette razor sales were $3.03 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``ASR has not been able to garner a 1 percent share of the
worldwide blade market, but still we must defend our intellectual
property rights,'' said Gillette spokesman Eric Kraus. ``If we
don't, any competitor could violate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is the ``market leader'' in many product categories,
Gillette has often been a target of rivals who seek to improperly
copy its success, or of rivals who use their ads to disparage
Gillette products, Kraus said; in many cases, Gillette responds to
such challenges with ``aggressive'' legal action.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth time in two decades Gillette has taken legal
action against ASR; the earlier cases were resolved in Gillette's
favor, according to Kraus.
</P>
<P>
   In unrelated news, Gillette said it recently informed the 263
employees who work at its Duracell World Technology Center in
Needham, a Boston suburb, that most will be offered transfers to
Duracell's divisional headquarters in Bethel, Conn. Plans call for
the transfers to take place 9 to 12 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gillette employees now working in Gillette's Boston plant
will later be transferred to Needham, as will some workers at a
Maryland facility slated to close.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are part of a reorganization plan announced last fall
that envisioned cutting 4,700 jobs, or about 11 percent of
Gillette's worldwide work force, over an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Not all those offered transfers to or from Needham may take
them. As a result, Gillette declined to say what the Needham head
count might be after transfers are completed next year.

BUSH IN FUND-RAISING LEAD AS BRADLEY KEEPS UP WITH GORE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush has accumulated at least
$20 million in just four months, raising more money, more quickly,
than any presidential candidate in history. But the most surprising
early windfall has gone to former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
who has raised more than $11 million to close the money gap with
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by three days of receptions in California this week that
will net $4.2 million, Bush has amassed more money than all his
Republican opponents combined. Bush's early success, another sign
of how expensive the 2000 election will be, also establishes him as
the leader in the money race over Gore, the front-runner for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1, Bush outraised Gore by nearly a 2-1 ratio. By the
close of the second quarter on June 30, Gore will have raised
between $18.2 million and $18.5 million this year, his aides said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that our success in these first two quarters
demonstrates the broad and strong support the vice president enjoys
across the country,'' said Marla Romash, deputy chairman of the
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley, the only Democrat challenging Gore,
has raised enough money to have the resources to remain the
alternative to the vice president through many of the early
primaries in 2000, aides said Tuesday. Bradley had a strong second
quarter, raising about $7 million in the last three months and more
than $11 million this year, supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest in his candidacy,'' said Eric
Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley's campaign, ``and a lot of people
from different backgrounds have made it clear they want to be
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bradley's surprise showing, Ms. Romash, the Gore deputy
chairman, said: ``I would suggest that there is a more valuable
comparison to be made in terms of how much support each candidate
is getting in voters. Democrats are supporting Al Gore, in some
polls, by a 3-to-1 margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the presidential election is more than 16 months away,
the current dash for checks of $1,000 or less is even more
important this year because most of the important primaries will
occur in the first few months of 2000. Because the first straw
ballot will not occur until August in Iowa, party leaders closely
scrutinize the fund-raising totals as evidence of each candidate's
ability to attract support and meet the high costs of running a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates intend to release their second-quarter
totals on Wednesday, but they do not have to file their quarterly
reports with the Federal Election Commission until July 15. Some
campaigns were putting out low estimates about their fund-raising
totals so far, hoping, like corporations' modest quarterly profit
estimates, that the actual numbers will be seen as having exceeded
expectations. For example, aides to Bush would say only that he had
raised ``at least $20 million,'' even though several supporters
said privately that the campaign had raised substantially more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the final tally, Bush's record-shattering pace is
remarkable because he did not personally begin to raise money until
June 12 in Iowa, about two weeks after the Texas legislative
session ended and midway through the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected that we would do this well,'' said Dave
Beckweth, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Bush's success is due to the prowess of a fund-raising
clique named ``the Pioneers,'' a group of more than 150 Republicans
who pledged to raise $100,000 each. On Monday, in Austin, a
thank-you reception was held for 90 Pioneers who have already met
their goal. In Texas alone, the Bush campaign has raised $11
million, one supporter said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising skill has hampered the ability of most other
Republican contenders to raise money. Most candidates have reduced
their expectations, hoping now to merely outraise the rest of the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining candidates, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
finished second in the money race among Republicans with a total of
$4.1 million. McCain raised $2.5 million in this quarter, aides
said. McCain also transferred $2 million from his Senate campaign
treasury to his presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Bush, we have raised nearly double what anyone else
has raised,'' said Howard Opinsky, the spokesman for McCain. ``We
continue to meet our fund-raising expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, the former American Red Cross president, has had
a disappointing start, but she raised $2 million in the second
quarter, her supporters said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a respectable second quarter and we expect to be
competitive with the rest of the pack,'' said Ari Fleischer, a
spokesman for the Dole campaign. ``While other candidates are at
risk of taking their last gasps of air, we're going to find an
auxiliary oxygen tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher Steve Forbes had his best fund-raising quarter
ever in the last three months. Forbes, who spent $37.5 million of
his own money in 1996, is expected to raise a total of $2.5 million
in the second quarter, his supporters said. Forbes had a
fund-raising dinner in Manhattan that raised $1.2 million alone,
his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who had to make cutbacks
in staff to meet payroll, has raised about $2.2 million this year.
``We've reorganized our campaign,'' said Bryan Kennedy, Alexander's
political director. ``We're meeting our financial goals. We're
meeting our political goals. And we'll have enough money to be
fully competitive in the early states.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle raised approximately $1 million
in the second quarter, giving him a total of about $3 million for
the year. But that result is disappointing; Quayle's supporters had
predicted in February that he would raise $3 million by April 1.

BRADLEY TROLLS FOR DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT IN NEW HAMPSHRIE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Reminiscing about piano lessons, the French horn
and trumpet playing, Bill Bradley brought his unconventional
campaign for president here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he also picked up an endorsement from Mark
Fernald, one of the 13 Democratic state senators, and from 13 of
the 154 Democratic House members. (Vice President Al Gore, by
contrast, has been endorsed by 10 Democratic senators and a
majority of the House Democratic caucus supports him.) Later, at a
dinner in Boston Tuesday night, Bradley raised about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   As he seeks the nation's highest office, the former New Jersey
senator and New York Knicks basketball player is visiting people
and groups that he says do good work, listening to their stories,
and telling a few of his own. He says he won't begin issuing policy
proposals until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the Concord Community Music School, Bradley almost forgot to
tell the room full of activists that he was running for president.
Instead, he seemed to get lost remembering the days when his mother
forced him to take piano lessons in the third, fourth, and fifth
grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother insisted on it,'' he said. But one Christmas,
Bradley said, there was an envelope under the tree. In it, his
mother wrote him a note. ``It said, you no longer have to take
piano,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bradley said he now has a fantasy of taking up the
piano again when he is 78, ``or maybe a little older.'' He said
that after a couple years of practice, he would like to open a
piano bar and play for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he also used to play the trumpet, until the band
leader urged him to switch to the French horn because there were
too many trumpet players in the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here today to salute the music school for everything
you do,'' Bradley said. ``By the way, I'm running for president of
the United States. That's why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from the audience, Bradley said that
if elected, he would increase funding for the National Endowment
for the Arts to support music schools and other artistic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creativity lifts the human spirit and let's it soar,'' Bradley
said. ``More people ought to have that.''

 OFF THE WALL: Old Glory Gets New Treatment in the Bathroom  
   
 By Terry Nagel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Betsy Ross never dreamed her patriotic sewing
project would wind up like this: A German company has embedded the
American flag pattern in a glass sink.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In honor of the opening of its first U.S. store, AquaDreams has
introduced the ``Stars and Stripes'' sink, retailing for $13,000 _
``$1,000 per colony!'' the press release says.
</P>
<P>
   The shimmering red, white and blud sink was created at the
company's German workshop using glass fusion. During the process,
metal oxides creating the pattern are infused into glass under
intense heat.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua Dreams offers other glass-fusion sinks, including a $4,000
small ``Tiger Eye'' sink with brownish sparkles and little pearls
to a $16,000 double sink called ``Wasserschatzi'' (``water
treasure'' in German) that mingles colors of the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The sink designers also fuse flower designs, rainbows and
corporate logos into basins. They work with more than 30 jewel
tones.
</P>
<P>
   With talk lately of amending the U.S. Constitution to protect
the flag, does it dishonor Old Glory to mold its likeness into a
sink?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' says Nadia Soncksen, U.S. manager of AquaDreams.
She recalls thousands of designers and customers walked by the sink
at a trade show in Las Vegas and ``they thought it was so original
and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ultimate test, she adds, ``even some Republicans liked
it.''

 Editors note: Psst! Read the latest? If not, you haven't
read  HotStuff, the San Francisco Chronicle's weekly roundup of
great 
 new home-and-garden items and places to visit. This week, we'll 
 tell you where to get a special prayer fountain and unusual 
 ceramics from Italy.   Handmade Prayer Fountains Send a Wish for Kindness  
   
 OAKLAND, Calif. _  Maura Singer Williams was director of an AIDS
hospice in San Francisco two years ago when the budget was slashed,
eliminating a fountain that was planned for the new courtyard.
Since she was an experienced sculptor, she says, ``I thought I
would make one for them.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   She created a fountain that helps others appreciate the practice
of Buddhist mindfulness, using water the way that Tibetan prayer
flags use wind.
</P>
<P>
   A prayer of loving kindness is inscribed on a spiral of copper
tubing; as water comes out the end of the tube, it hugs the bottom
of the spiral and flows back down into a rock-filled bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain was such a hit that Singer Williams teamed up with
a friend, Amy Hutto, to make smaller versions suitable for homes.
Their Oakland-based company, Egg Universe, offers 15-inch-high
fountains made out of cast concrete in earth tones of antique amber
and fern green. Custom colors also are available. The fountains
cost $360 each and can go indoors or outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer printed on the copper spiral was derived from
Buddhist teachings. It says, ``May all beings be well and happy.
May all beings be harmonious and peaceful. May all have the light,
the way out of suffering, the way home. May we each share our
bright, wondrous nature for the benefit of all beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, says Singer Williams, is ``to generate a loving
kindness prayer within your own heart, then send that out to
others.''

 &UR; San Francisco Store Sells Unusual Ceramics From Italy &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Many travelers find themselves overwhelmed by the
beautiful ceramics they encounter in Italy, and end up shipping
home caseloads of vibrantly colored plates and pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But with new stores specializing in Italian ceramics opening in
the Bay Area, it's no longer necessary to go abroad for the pieces
you once looked at longingly in Siena or Urbino.
</P>
<P>
   One such store is Pesaresi Ceramics, which opens July 2 in San
Francisco's Crocker Galleria. The store features ceramics from four
regions of Italy: Tuscany, Marche, Umbria and Sicily. Among the
items you'll find are wrought-iron garden furniture with tile tops,
urns painted with pastoral scenes, and tableware in modern
geometric and fruit patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $20 for a mug to $8,000 for a  &LR; vaso di &LR; 
 &LR; farmacia, &LR;  a large decorative canister that was once used to store
medicine in pharmacies. A snake-handled vase, made in the 1880s by
Molaroni in Pesaro, Italy, is an example of the type of merchandise
available at Pesaresi Ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   Store owner Alessandra Taboni hails from Marche, a region known
for artistic ceramics since the Renaissance. Some of the store's
best pieces come from Castel Durante, near Taboni's hometown of
Pesaro, and boast a prestigious DOC  &LR; (denominizioni &LR;   &LR; d'origine
controllata) &LR;  label. This designation is awarded by the Italian
government to certify that products are made in a particular area
and in the time-honored tradition.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Pesaresi Ceramics, Crocker Galleria, 50 Post St. (near &LR; 
 &LR; Montgomery Street), San Francisco; (415) 362-4570. Open from 10 &LR; 
 &LR; a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. &LR; 
 &LR; Saturday. &LR;

This column is intended for novices in the kitchen.    LEARNING TO COOK: Tomatoes Make Life Simple  
   
 By Marion Cunningham 
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce is one of those
easy-to-make dishes that is always welcome for dinner. And the
sauce couldn't be easier than when the tomatoes bake in the oven.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baking brings out the sweetness in the tomatoes, and enhances
their flavor even when they're not at their prime. The tomatoes get
extra appeal with the flavors of parsley, garlic and olive oil, the
classic Italian seasoning trio.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, when they're in the oven, the tomatoes cook unattended;
you don't need to be hovering with wooden spoon in hand. Use the
time instead to prepare a simple salad to serve alongside.
</P>
<P>
   My Italian aunt used to finish a simple spaghetti supper with a
chilled glass of cocoa topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. If
you feel lazy and don't want to heat up your kitchen, serve Aunt
Frances' Cocoa Dessert.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   12 Roma or plum tomatoes (about 13/4 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the tomatoes:  &LR; Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise
and place them cut side up in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Season
lightly with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the garlic, parsley and olive oil:  &LR; Peel and finely
chop the garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Wash the parsley and pat dry; remove and discard the stems.
Finely chop the leaves and set aside 1/2 cup. Put any remaining
parsley in a covered dish and place in the refrigerator for later
use.
</P>
<P>

of the olive oil in a small bowl. Using a spoon or your fingers,
pat the garlic mixture on the tomatoes and drizzle on 2 tablespoons
olive oil.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The Chronicle offers readers the recipe
for an outstanding dish at a Bay Area restaurant, plus the chef's
secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow.   SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Pork Pairs Well With Blue Cheese  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Most people think of fruit when they think of
pork, but the fact that this pork tenderloin dish doesn't is what
makes it so exciting. The sauce is made with tangy blue cheese,
which actually pairs with the meat to make it all the more sweet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I ran across this dish was at Antica, the
charming neighborhood Italian restaurant at the corner of Polk and
Union streets.
</P>
<P>
   At Antica, chef Ruggero Gadaldi has created a menu that reads
like the offerings of most other Italian restaurants but tastes
worlds apart. His lamb shanks are some of the best in the city. And
one of the best desserts is the Coppa Antica, a blend of pastry
cream, whipped cream and crisp meringue.
</P>
<P>
   While the restaurant is small, it's developed a Bay Area
following because of its food, first-rate service and charming
interior that features warm wood accents and an ebony stained
floor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Antica Trattoria, 2400 Polk St. (at Union Street), San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco; (415) 928-5797. Open for dinner Tuesday- &LR;   &LR; Sunday. &LR;

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the marinade:  &LR; Bring the water to a boil in a large

simmer until slightly thickened. Crumble in the cheese, stirring
until it melts. Strain if desired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To grill the pork:  &LR; Remove the skewers of pork from the

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Andronico's Maintains Culture of a Family 
 Business While Business Booms  By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Some memorials are hewn in stone, august and cold.
Others are less forbidding _ redwood trees planted in the memory of
a loved one, songs, endowments to charity.
<P>
   John Andronico's memorial is the grocery company he guided from
the Depression-era, mom-and-pop store founded by his Greek
immigrant parents, Frank and Eva, to the upscale Bay Area grocery
chain that boasts eight dynamic stores.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expansion, the store most dear to John Andronico was
his parents' original grocery on Solano Avenue in North Berkeley,
where he would walk from nearby Thousand Oaks School as a young
boy. A complete remodel of the that store is just about finished.
</P>
<P>
   Since John Andronico's death in March, his son, Bill, is at the
helm, serving as president and CEO of the privately held company
and overseeing the completion of the ninth store in the chain, set
to open in Danville later this summer. While co-founder Frank has
also passed away, his wife (and Bill's mother), Eva, still chairs
the board.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the business is expanding today, not all previous
expansions were successful. Ventures into Richmond, Alameda and
Oakland in the 1940s were short-lived, and Hayward and Pleasant
Hill stores were eventually sold or leased to other grocery
companies in the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The current expansion started when the company acquired and
remodeled two moribund Co-Op stores in Berkeley in the late '80s.
In the same period, the Andronicos put their family name on the
markets, a change from the stores' original name of Park and Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Andronico's hasn't looked back since. Bill Andronico says that
transforming the old Solano Avenue store while simultaneously
completing the Danville store, the company's most ambitious
project, was a lot to tackle at once. Unlike other branches that
moved into existing buildings, the Danville store is being built
from the ground up. But the family decided to give Solano its face
lift in honor of John.
</P>
<P>
   Bill says his dad would be delighted with the very '90s changes
_ an in-store bakery with artisan breads and a sushi station among
them _ and the fact that the changes are being carried out without
closing the store for even a day.
</P>
<P>
   Attention to customers' expectations is the key not only to
survival but to the success of a family-run business such as his,
says the entrepreneurial grocer. His stores' success seemingly
flies in the face of trends. Industry studies, he says, predict
that by the year 2001, 50 percent of America's grocery business
will be handled by just five large chains.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are pockets in the country that buck the trend,
and the Bay Area is one of them. As chains get bigger and more
impersonal, he believes, some consumers will continue to seek out
stores that are not only upscale but are also personal.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much the business grows, says Andronico, ``We must
never lose sight of our style. We must maintain the culture of a
family business'' _ even if that family has grown from the handful
of clerks who assisted Eva and Frank Andronico in 1929 to 800
employees in 1999.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of
professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.   TASTER'S CHOICE: Turkey Takes Top Honors Among the Un-Hot Dogs  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For a Fourth of July barbecue, many people will
throw hot dogs on the grill. Those looking for a healthier
alternative to beef and pork franks turn to poultry hot dogs, most
of which are lower in fat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted 11 brands of poultry hot dogs, some made
solely of turkey or chicken, others a combination. Some
manufacturers make both a chicken and a turkey hot dog. In one case
the turkey hot dog outscored its same-brand chicken cousin by 10
points, while another manufacturer's two franks differed in score
by only two points.
</P>
<P>
   The hot dogs differed significantly in price and in fat content.
The least expensive was $1.59 for one pound (eight hot dogs) while
the priciest was $3.89 for 12 ounces (six hot dogs). Fat ranged
from five to 12 grams per serving.
</P>
<P>
   Uncured, nitrite-free hot dogs were not popular. None of the
four tasted scored high enough to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to &UR; Foster Farms &LR;   &UR; turkey franks  &LR; (one pound,
$2.29 at many supermarkets). Three panelists especially liked the
texture, one describing it as ``best of show.'' Another taster
thought it was a bit salty, but still liked the overall flavor.
Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to &UR; Safeway jumbo turkey franks  &LR; (one pound,
$1.69). One panelist described the flavor as smoky and ``adult.''
Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   Third place was a tie between  &UR; Foster Farms chicken franks  &LR; (one
pound, $2.29 at many supermarkets) and  &UR; Zacky Farms chicken &LR; 
 &UR; franks &LR;  (one pound, $2.19 at Andronico's).
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists thought the Foster Farms chicken frank most
resembled regular beef or pork hot dogs, but two others found the
texture too smooth and soft. Three would buy it; two might.
</P>
<P>
   One panelist described the Zacky Farms chicken frank as an
``awesome balance of flavors,'' but another thought it tasted
overly smoky and disliked the soft texture. Four would buy it; one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Zacky Farms turkey franks &LR;  (one pound, $2.19 at Andronico's)
came in fifth, scoring just two points lower than Zacky Farms
chicken hot dog. Two panelists thought it was too smoky, but two
others liked the balance of flavors. One panelist detected an odd
metallic flavor. Three would buy it; two might.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie-O jumbo turkey franks, Louis Rich original franks,
Diestel uncured turkey franks, Applegate Farms uncured turkey hot
dogs, Rocky uncured chicken hot dogs and Applegate Farms uncured
chicken hot dogs scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Patricia
Hart, dietitian and consultant; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For
All Seasons, San Francisco; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

 &HT;    Home Depot improves website for advice-seekers
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do-it-yourselfers will find a heap of help on Home
Depot's remodeled Web site today.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement giant was expected to launch a new version
of www.homedepot.com this morning. There aren't products for sale
yet, but the ramped-up site lays the groundwork for online sales
that will start in the fall, said Jeff Cohen, group president of
direct marketing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We`re taking the continuous improvement path with our Internet
strategy,'' Cohen said. ``The new site is a major step.'' Cohen
said the site will be updated every three to four weeks with new
features.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is that the Web site, previously filled
with corporate and shareholder information, has been reworked to
target consumers looking for home improvement advice. The number of
how-to projects was doubled to 120, and each project includes
do-it-yourself steps that are animated with simple graphics that
can be downloaded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The how-to pages, which include printable lists of supplies and
tools needed to tackle the project, will be a likely starting point
for Home Depot's first attempt at online sales, Cohen said. For
example, a consumer looking for tips on how to change a lock or
install a ceiling fan could have the option of buying a kit to do
so, he said. It's the first hint from Home Depot on what it might
sell online as the company works out pricing and shopping issues.
In the meantime, the supply lists should at least send consumers
running to their nearest Home Depot store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Projects are certainly the centerpiece of our Internet
strategy,'' said Cohen, who noted that the company opted not to
create a separate subsidiary for the electronic commerce venture.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance Warehouse, Home Depot's mail-order subsidiary in San
Diego, will process orders, phone calls and e-mail requests
generated by the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The new site contains twice the amount of information of the old
site, including new features such as paint and wallpaper
calculators that estimate the amount of materials needed based on
room dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the company's electronic commerce launch this
fall, though, may be one of the more significant aspects of its
strategy. Several competitors have already ventured into online
sales.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. recently started selling major
appliances and tools on www.sears.com. And Lowe's Home Improvement
Warehouse sells some tools and other branded products through
manufacturer's sites. Lowe's expects to start selling products on
www.lowes.com in late summer, said spokesman Brian Peace.

SEEKING VIAGRA EQUITY, MORE STATES REQUIRING INSURERS TO COVER
CONTRACEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.H., N.C., Vt., Ga., Conn. Maine, Hawaii, Nev., Calif.,
Idaho, Md., Texas., Minn., Mass., Wash.)  (nk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Viagra, it turns out, has a political side effect.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's anti-impotence sensation has led to this year's
byproduct: Around the country, more than a half-dozen state
legislatures, swayed largely by insurers' coverage of Viagra
treatment, have recently passed measures requiring carriers that
cover prescription drugs to pay for women's contraceptives as well.
More states are expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, New Hampshire's Legislature became the latest to
send a ``contraceptive equity'' bill to the governor, joining North
Carolina, Vermont, Georgia, Connecticut, Maine, Hawaii and Nevada.
In an additional half-dozen states, New York and California among
them, contraception bills have passed at least one house in recent
months, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Such measures have been introduced in more than 30 legislatures in
all.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, women's advocates had little success in pushing
insurance coverage of contraceptives. But now that Viagra has been
made available and quickly included in many insurance plans, they
say, they have been able to add to their arsenal of arguments the
tough-to-beat issue of basic fairness: If insurance can help a man
enhance his sex life _ and at a pricey $10 or so a pill _ it ought
to help a woman enable her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little blue pill gave the birth-control pill that's been
around for 40 years great credibility as an issue, because it's so
clearly juxtaposed,'' said state Sen. Jackie Speier, who is
sponsoring the contraception bill in California. Viagra made any
argument against mandated contraception coverage ``laughable,
really,'' she said. ``No one can really argue it with a straight
face anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent legislation requires coverage of
birth-control pills, intrauetrine devices, diaphragms and the
long-term hormonal treatments Norplant and Depo-Provera. Experts on
women in politics say the speedy success of so many contraception
bills reflects not only good timing but also the rising power of
women in state legislatures. One concrete result of that growing
power has been greater attention than ever to women's health, with
new laws on issues like breast cancer and ``drive-through'' baby
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   On certain issues like contraception coverage, female
legislators tend to join forces across party lines, rally their
male counterparts on both sides of the aisle and become hard to
stop, said Debbie Walsh, associate director of the Center for the
American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   And while men have acted as sponsors and supporters of many of
the contraception bills, Linda Tarr-Whelan, president of the Center
for Policy Alternatives, a Washington group that has helped
legislators push for the measures, said that overall, the wave of
contraception bills amounts to ``the most striking example in the
legislative sessions that have just finished of the power of
women's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Such power is considerably more pronounced in state
legislatures, where women are now an average of 22.3 percent of the
ranks, than in Congress, where they are only 12.1 percent and where
party lines tend to be harder for women to cross.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, championed a
contraception coverage bill last year without success, although a
measure requiring such coverage for all federal employees did pass.
Encouraged in part, a spokesman said, by progress at the state
level, Snowe introduced her bill again two weeks ago with Sen.
Harry Reid, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   But even in states where women hold strong leadership positions,
the going has often been far from easy for the contraception
coverage bills. The Washington Legislature, for example, has a
higher proportion of women, 40.8 percent, than any other state
legislature in American history, and yet its contraception bill,
which passed the Senate in March, remains pending in the House,
hampered by questions about its cost.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, where the contraception bill did pass, ``we were in
the bitterest of fights,'' said state Rep. Nan Grogan Orrock, who
sponsored it. ``The right wing,'' she said, ``pales beside the
business community,'' which opposed saddling employers with another
insurance requirement.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Even in Maine, where the state Senate's president, a Democrat,
and its minority leader, a Republican, joined forces to sponsor the
bill, there was a tricky moment: After it sailed through both
houses last month, Gov. Angus King, an independent, said the cost
gave him some reservations about signing it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the widespread theory goes, he exchanged views with his
wife, a former lobbyist for Planned Parenthood, said state Sen.
Jane A. Amero, the minority leader. The governor expressed support
for the bill the next day _ he has since signed it _ ``and I think
his wife had a lot to do with it,'' Amero said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In general, resistance to the bills has come from Roman Catholic
groups that oppose birth control and have fought, with mixed
success, for exemptions for religious institutions. There has also
been some opposition from anti-abortion groups that see
morning-after pills as virtual abortion drugs, and from business
and insurance groups complaining of yet another state mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho's contraception bill foundered in committee, said a
sponsor, Wendy Jaquet, Democratic leader in the
Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of influence the insurance companies have in our
Legislature,'' Jaquet said, ``and there's a real concern about
raising premiums. And it's hard to get across the argument that
this is really prevention, and if you have a baby the insurance
companies pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   But in general, several successful sponsors elsewhere said,
pointing to a Viagra parallel has helped dissipate much of the
opposition.

<P>
   A similar Viagra effect has been observed as far afield as
Japan, the only industrialized country that bans birth-control
pills. Japanese medical authorities have long kept the pills off
limits, citing concerns about their safety. But earlier this month
the country's top medical advisory council suddenly changed its
mind and recommended lifting the ban, propelled in part, it seemed,
by the uproar from women's groups that pointed to the speedy
approval of Viagra as proof of discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the statistic that coverage advocates most
often cite is that women between the ages of 15 and 44 spend 68
percent more on out-of-pocket health costs than do men, much of it
on contraception. (Among that age group of women, birth-control
pills are the most commonly prescribed drug.) The advocates note
that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are
unintended and that although 93 percent of health maintenance
organizations cover contraceptives, only about half of indemnity
plans do so. A drop in unplanned pregnancies, they argue, would
lead to a decrease in infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For their part, opponents tend to denounce the addition of yet
another mandate on insurers and yet more costs for employers,
estimated at $1.43 a month per employee. When the cost of insurance
coverage rises, they argue, fewer employers and consumers buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, polls have shown, tend to favor requiring insurance
companies to cover contraception. So do an array of medical
organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists. Maryland, ahead of the pack, enacted a contraception
coverage bill in 1998, and several other states, including Texas
and Minnesota, have similar though less sweeping regulations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One interesting aspect of the wave of contraception coverage
bills is that Viagra, which counteracts impotence, is not an exact
logical parallel to pills or devices that counteract conception.
But it was close enough to be used that way by lawmakers who saw
their moment and jumped at it, political analysts note.
</P>
<P>
   Such shrewdness among women in politics seems to be growing,
said Elizabeth A. Sherman, director of the Center for Women in
Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts in
Boston. Also at play, she and others said, is the growth of women's
caucuses, research organizations and leadership groups that give
them a strong position to push from when such a moment comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when an issue like this or drive-through delivery comes up,
they already have a caucus and have respected women who have been
in power and are ready,'' Ms. Sherman said. ``It's the political
infrastructure that makes it possible for women in power to drive
these issues right to the top of the agenda.''

Editors Note: Package includes main story and recipes.  Spud Fest '99: Red, white and blue salads get you through the 
 Fourth in style  
   
   
 By Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Potatoes are such humble little things, oddly
shaped, strangely colored. But they star in American cuisine, and
perhaps nowhere more than in potato salad. And let's face it _
potato salad is as much a part of Fourth of July as are fireworks.
<P>
   Even though most food historians believe that the potato salad
originated in Germany, it's potato salad Americans crave on
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   But which potato salad? There are almost as many recipes for the
``classic'' version as there are cooks. Some people insist on
mayonnaise-based dressings while others think vinaigrettes work
well. Some home chefs wouldn't dream of using starchy potatoes;
others think these varieties absorb the dressing better. And then
there's the debate as to whether to add the dressing when the
potatoes are hot or cold.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any ``right'' answers to these questions; it's all
a matter of personal preference. The following recipes are some of
my favorites and use a variety of potatoes, dressings and
techniques. You can create your own signature dishes if you keep
the following in mind:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Know the difference between starchy, waxy and new potatoes. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Starchy potatoes, like russets or white rose, will fall apart
more readily. On the other hand, they tend to absorb dressings
better.
</P>
<P>
   Waxy potatoes, like red-skinned or white-skinned, don't fall
apart as easily, but also don't absorb as much dressing.
</P>
<P>
   New potatoes, which are just young potatoes of any variety, are
best suited for potato salads because they're small enough to be
cooked whole and retain their shape after being cooked and cut.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Know your cooking techniques. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Boiling potatoes in salted water adds some flavor to the spuds,
but tends to turn the skins an anemic gray color. Steaming keeps
some of the color of the skins, but doesn't let the salt get into
the potato during cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs like to roast potatoes for their salads, but the
flavor of cold roast potatoes can be problematic.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Choose accompanying ingredients for texture, color and accenting &LR; 
 &UR; flavors.  &LR; Celery is a natural because it adds crunch. But asparagus
also adds a crisp element along with color and a unique flavor.
Consider other ingredients like bell peppers, pickles or cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Finally, get creative with your dressing. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you're using mayonnaise, add a splash of vinegar or citrus
juice to cut the richness, then add herbs or spices like thyme,
rosemary, fresh mint or curry powder.
</P>
<P>
   With vinaigrettes, you can be even more creative with
ingredients like roasted garlic, fresh herbs, citrus juices or
peels.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you follow these recipes, use them as guidelines or make
your own creation, don't pass up this all-American opportunity to
stage your own spud fest this weekend.

POTATO SALAD WITH ASPARAGUS AND PESTO VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Note: This salad is sophisticated enough for a summer dinner
party, but so delicious it's wonderful at a family picnic, too. Try
to serve this one as soon as it's been made because the pesto will
discolor when exposed to air. Alternately, assemble all the parts
and refrigerate separately (press plastic wrap directly onto the
surface of the pesto), then throw them together when you're ready
to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound asparagus, trimmed, cut into 2-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste

until just tender, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic in a food processor. Add the
basil, parsley, walnuts and lemon juice and process until finely
chopped. With the processor running, gradually add the oil and
process until mixture is emulsified. Stir in the cheese. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the potatoes. Run under cold water until cool. Drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the asparagus with 2 tablespoons pesto. Arrange in the
center of a platter. Toss the potatoes with the remaining pesto.
Arrange around the asparagus.

 &HT;    South Carolina assembly in special session for 'video poker
mess'
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Star Lanes in Greenville, S.C., had a snack bar,
lounge and 32 lanes of bowling. But it wasn't enough _ until the
eight video poker machines came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money,'' said general manager Ernest Pyles.
``It's just another way to raise revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just in bowling alleys. The machines are as common
as tourists at Hilton Head and can be found in gas stations, hair
salons, restaurants and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   About the only one not getting a cut of the $2.5 billion-a-year
industry is the state government.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered into special session by Gov. Jim Hodges, who vowed
during his fall campaign to clean up the ``video poker mess'' left
by his predecessor, the South Carolina General Assembly is on the
verge of putting on the November ballot a referendum that would let
voters decide whether to regulate the controversial industry _ or
kill it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges rose from limited notoriety last year and upset incumbent
David Beasley after the challenger received millions from gambling
interests, which also bankroll several state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Last year before the National Gambling Impact Study Commission,
Columbia psychiatrist Frank Quinn testified that 36,000 video poker
machines in South Carolina made gambling more accessible than in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said gambling companies in The Palmetto State represent
the same kind of threat the fictional heartless banker Henry Potter
did to his hometown in ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The relevance of the special session long-term is whether
we're going to be living in Pottersville or not,'' Quinn said. ``It
appears they've bought our legislature and our governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, South Carolina sells video poker licenses for $2,000
a pop. That generates more than $60 million for the general fund,
but it's the only direct return to state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the regulation debate has centered on taxing video poker
proceeds as high as 25 percent. A machine returns an average of
$87,000 a year in gross receipts and $25,000 in annual profit,
based on industry reporting to the state.
</P>
<P>
   If video poker became an indispensable part of state funding, it
would be hard for legislators to ban the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake financially,'' said Bill Moore, a
political scientist at the College of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   If voters don't eliminate video poker in November, players will
be able to win a maximum of $500 a hand, compared to the current
$125 allowed during a 24-hour sitting.
</P>
<P>
   The old law attempted to keep the betting to a low-stakes form
of entertainment. With the higher amount, losers are more tempted
to wipe out their losses with a big win, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that's the crux of the entire debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that could be controlled, then all the other issues would
flow from there,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Pyles, the bowling alley manager, said limiting jackpots would
discourage players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why play $600 if your incentive to win is only $500,'' said
Pyles, whose typical players are women who come in after work.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has 7,600 gambling sites compared to 2,400 in
Nevada, Quinn said. As he testified before the gambling commission,
Quinn said video poker creates a ``cannibalistic economic loop,''
with in-state residents constituting the primary players. Job
creation is limited to minimum wage employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money is invested in capital development,'' Quinn said.
``There is no $2 billion Bellagio (casino) in South Carolina but we
literally have doublewides in cornfields'' that house video poker
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Democrat-controlled state Senate passed a
referendum that would have let voters decide on state-imposed
regulations. But the GOP-led House failed to deliver the two-thirds
vote it needed to send the measure to this fall's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Legislative Black Caucus refused to vote,
protesting Hodges' refusal to fund economic measures that would
have benefited their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be some strong sentiment that we should use
this as a vehicle to get the attention of the leadership in support
of what we want,'' said Rep. Leon Howard, a Democrat from Columbia.

 ONLINE INVESTING/HARRY DOMASH  &HT;     Taking In-Depth Look at a Mutal Fund 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SECOND OF TWO PARTS.
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In my latest column, we used Morningstar's Quicktake report to do
an initial analysis of a mutual fund. We found out whether the fund
was load or no-load and used Morningstar's return, risk and overall
ratings to determine whether the fund's track record warranted
further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume we've found a fund worth a further look. We'll use
Morningstar to analyze the fund in depth.
</P>
<P>
   Log on to Morningstar ( &LR; www.morningstar.net &LR; ) and type the
fund's symbol into the data-entry box to bring up the Quicktake
report, then click Risk &AMP; Return on the Quicktake menu.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the fund's total return for one-, three-, five-and
10-year periods, along with shorter-term statistics.
</P>
<P>
   What I find especially useful is the fund's return compared with
the Standard and Poor's 500 index for each period. I don't pay much
attention to the one-year performance, but I do look for funds that
consistently outperformed the S&AMP;P over the longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Largest Holdings
</P>
<P>
   Click on Portfolio in the Quicktake menu to display the fund's
10 largest holdings. Spend some time here. You can learn a lot
about the fund and its potential future performance by looking
carefully at the portfolio. If you've selected one of the recent
top-performing funds, you'll probably see most of the following
stocks in the portfolio: America Online, Dell Computer, Lucent
Technologies, Pfizer, Merck and Microsoft. All great companies, but
consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_These stocks all appreciated enormously during the past year and
are selling at high valuations. Do you think they will continue to
appreciate at a similar rate in the future? There's no right or
wrong answer to this question. If you say yes, continue with your
evaluation, otherwise go on to another fund.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
_Check the funds you currently own. Do they have the same companies
in their portfolios? If so, you're not diversifying by buying
another fund with similar holdings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
_What industries are represented by the top 10 holdings? Say a fund
owns several bank stocks, and you think that rising interest rates
will hurt bank earnings in the coming months. A different fund owns
oil companies, and you think the recovery in Asia will increase
demand for oil and push prices and profits up. Your analysis of the
industry sectors would lead you to favor the second fund over the
first.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
_A fund may hold companies you don't want to own. For instance,
several funds have large holdings of Philip Morris, which you'd
want to avoid if you don't want to own tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Watch Out for Turnover
</P>
<P>
   Check the turnover percentage shown below the top 10 holdings.
Turnover measures a fund's trading activity. A turnover of 100
percent means the fund, on average, replaces its entire portfolio
every year.
</P>
<P>
   When a fund sells stock at a profit, it incurs a capital gain.
Mutual funds must distribute to shareholders most of their realized
capital gains that are not offset by realized losses by the end of
each year. These gains are taxable to shareholders. The more a fund
trades, the more taxes are likely to accrue.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: If your fund is in an IRA or other tax-sheltered account,
you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the money.)
</P>
<P>
   Turnover also tells you something about a fund manager's trading
style. High turnover indicates a short-term-oriented manager. Low
turnover indicates a buy-and-hold style. The average turnover for
U.S. equity funds is around 90 percent. I look for funds with less
than 50 percent annual turnover.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Fund Expenses
</P>
<P>
   Select Nuts &AMP; Bolts from the Quicktake menu and then click on
Fees &AMP; Expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The expense ratio includes all expenses incurred to run the
fund, from paying the manager's salary to the electric bill. The
expense ratio is deducted from a fund's investment returns before
you get paid.
</P>
<P>
   Consider two funds with exactly the same stock holdings. Both
funds' portfolios increased in value by 25 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Fund A's expense ratio was 0.5 percent, and Fund B's expense
ratio was 2 percent. Fund A's shareholders received a 24.5 percent
return while Fund B's shareholders received only 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Price/Earnings Ratio
</P>
<P>
   The final data we'll look at in Morningstar is the average
price/ earnings ratio of stocks in the portfolio. A company's P/E
is its stock price divided by its annual earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   A mutual fund's P/E is the weighted average P/E ratio of
companies in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the fund's P/E by selecting Portfolio from the
Quicktake menu and then selecting Stylebox basics.
</P>
<P>
   I've found a fund's P/E to be an important factor in determining
future performance. General equity funds with portfolio P/E ratios
above 30, on average, underperform the market, especially in weak
markets.
</P>
<P>
   This restriction does not apply to funds specializing in
specific industries such as health care, technology, etc. Specialty
funds almost always have above-market portfolio valuations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Manager info
</P>
<P>
   A fund's performance depends, in part, on the the skill of the
manager. But what if the manager changes?
</P>
<P>
   A different site, Fund Alarm ( &LR; www.fundalarm.com &LR; ) keeps track
of management changes and gives you its opinion on the change's
impact.

 GAO WANTS LAB SAFETY PENALTIES AGAINST UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress' investigative arm says in a report to be released
Tuesday that the University of California should be fined for
safety violations at Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos nuclear
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   In a report being released to a House subcommittee, the General
Accounting Office found a range of violations at the labs,
including exposing workers to radioactivity and lax procedures for
preventing nuclear accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes the Energy Department for not following
through with proposed safety rules and calls for strengthening the
nuclear safety enforcement program. Among its recommendations is
fining nonprofit contractors like the University of California for
safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   The report will be the focus of a hearing Tuesday by the House
Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Congress enacted legislation permitting the Energy
Department to impose penalties on contractors. Since enforcement
began in 1996, it has assessed more than $1.8 million on its
contractors for 33 safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   But UC and other nonprofit contractors have been exempt from
penalties, partly out of concern about putting public assets at
risk. Since 1996, nonprofit contractors have been exempt from
$605,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; No Accountability
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the GAO argues that eliminating the exemption
could be a valuable tool to hold UC and other nonprofit contractors
responsible for safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have these contracts, and they really have no
accountability,'' agreed Eric Wohlschlegel,cq  &LR;  a spokesman for the
House Commerce Committee. ``UC is one of the most serious
violators, and they are exempt from any penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy found in March 1998 that workers at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore were exposed to
radiation that exceeded limits because of poor safety procedures.
In July 1998, the lab was found to have repeatedly violated
precautions designed to prevent uncontrolled nuclear reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The fines assessed but uncollected for the two incidents totaled
$313,125.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was
cited for lax monitoring of radiological contamination and not
taking adequate corrective actions. UC, which manages the lab, was
exempt from a $112,500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department wants to continue the exemption and has
even recommended that it be expanded to nonprofit subcontractors
and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Nelson, UC's director of contracts management, said he had
not seen the report and could not comment on its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we are interested in maintaining the highest level
of safety we can at our operations,'' he said. ``But we don't think
anything has changed since 1988 in terms of why nonprofits were
exempted.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report points out that when the exemption was first
allowed, nonprofit contractors did not receive fees above their
reimbursable costs, and now they do.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 the University of California has received $14 million
of its $25 million annual fee as a reward for good performance.
Currently $10 million to $12 million is reinvested in the
laboratory for research.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report comes as the University of California and the
Energy Department are under fire for security breaches at the labs
that allowed China to obtain highly classified nuclear technology.

BUSH SPEAKS SOFTLY, GOVERNS TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Austin, Texas _ Listen to George W. Bush talk about compassion,
inclusion and diversity on the campaign trail, and one might be
uncertain of his political leanings.
<P>
   Take a look at his record as governor, and the confusion ends.
</P>
<P>
   In 41/2 years as governor of Texas, the son of the former
president has established himself as a bedrock conservative. He is
a solid Republican who has advanced the party's core agenda,
frustrated liberals and civil libertarians, and overseen the demise
of the Texas Democratic Party. Most Americans know little about the
man who, according to virtually every public opinion poll, is the
overwhelming favorite to be the GOP nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is regarded as the most powerful Texas governor in a
generation, he is a political novice who says he was more
interested in becoming the next Willie Mays than following in his
father's footsteps. He lacks the hard edge of fellow Texans Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, two prominent House Republicans who are
almost always at the heart of Washington's partisan battles, but he
has a resume that will disappoint few conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record as governor shows him to be many things: a skilled
communicator who makes friends of his political opponents; a
strong-willed executive who seizes every opportunity to advance his
agenda; a unifier who reaches out to Latino voters; a moral
crusader who speaks of the existence of God and urges abstinence as
an alternative to abortion; a down-to-earth Westerner with a love
for baseball and a history of women, drink and chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as he barnstorms through California in his maiden
trip to the West as a presidential candidate, he will sell himself
in much simpler terms _ as a likable conservative, comfortable in
his own skin and confident of his ability to lead.
</P>
<P>
   And on that, everyone can agree. With his preference for
compromise rather than confrontation, his self-deprecating humor
and disarming smile, Bush has been able to bridge the partisan gap
in the state capital of Austin in ways that would be unthinkable in
Sacramento or Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a very good meeter and greeter,'' said Molly Beth
Malcolm, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. ``If all
we're looking for is a guy with a nice smile and a good handshake,
he's a very good candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his record, Democrats are far less complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   He is pro-business, pro-guns, pro-death penalty, anti-tax,
anti-abortion, anti-affirmative action and has been criticized by
environmentalists, labor leaders and advocates for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's conservative ideology was reflected in the four campaign
priorities of his 1994 bid to unseat then-Gov. Ann Richards: an
overhaul of the juvenile justice system, improvement of public
schools, a reduction in welfare benefits and tort reform. By the
end of his first year in office, all four had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Tough new penalties were instituted for juveniles, and the
capacity at detention centers was tripled. The practice of
promoting school-children to the next grade regardless of their
accomplishments was ended. Local school districts were given more
authority, and test scores are up. Welfare payments were limited to
two years. Caps were placed on punitive damages, as businesses
cheered the less-litigious climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what he wanted to accomplish. He laid out an agenda,
and got it done,'' said Tony Garza, a longtime Bush associate who
is now the state's elected railroad commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Bush is only the second Texas Republican elected
governor since Reconstruction. But Texas _ which is emerging as one
of the most Republican states in the nation _ has responded
enthusiastically to Bush, re-electing him in November with 69
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a governor in Texas who has been such a
force since John Connally,'' said Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, recalling
the Democratic icon from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas economy has boomed during Bush's tenure, allowing Bush
to cut property taxes by $3 billion. The state _ like California _
has become a mecca for the high-tech industry and trade with Mexico
and other Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush deserves credit for the state's strong economy is a
matter of debate. Much like Republicans who say that President
Clinton is not responsible for the nation's strong economy,
Democrats in Texas downplay Bush's role in their state's growth.
Sure he cut taxes, they say, but so did more than half of the
governors in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush record on social issues has been subject to harsher
attack. Civil libertarians complain that the state's justice system
is stacked against defendants and call it a national laughingstock.
Welfare payments are among the lowest in the country. Consumer
groups complain that the tort law overhaul is too pro-business.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion Rights Action League has identified 16
pieces of legislation signed by Bush that they consider grave
threats to a woman's right to an abortion. The measures range from
a requirement that doctors notify parents 48 hours before
performing an abortion on a minor to a prohibition on spending
state money on clinics that offer abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists blamed Bush this spring for dooming a measure
that would have required air polluters to comply with air quality
standards by September 2001. Bush favored voluntary, rather than
mandatory, standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has been largely absent on environmental issues
this (legislative) session,'' said Ken Kramer, director for the
Sierra Club in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On guns, Bush affirmed Texans' fondness for firearms in 1995
when he signed a law to permit residents to carry concealed
weapons. Earlier this month, he signed a bill to make it more
difficult to sue gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product
should be responsible for the criminal misuse of that product,''
spokeswoman Linda Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is an unapologetic supporter of the death penalty, a stance
that is a political strength in a state that has executed more
inmates in the past two decades than any other. Recently, a
convicted Canadian killer was executed in Texas, prompting a group
of Canadian journalists to ask Bush what he would tell their
countrymen who think of Texas as a remnant of the Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Canadian and you come to our state, don't murder
anybody,'' Bush responded.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made his mark, even though the governor of Texas is a
constitutionally weak position, with no cabinet, no power to make
judicial appointments and no legislative function other than the
authority to veto bills.
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to grasp the need to win friends among Democrats,
who had majorities in both the Texas House and Senate when he came
to office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   During his first days, Bush went straight to the offices of
Texas legislators of both parties. He talked; he laughed; he won
many of them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like him. People want to like him. He uses that in a
very disciplined, very effective way,'' said Perry, who as
lieutenant governor would become governor if Bush moved on to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Democrats remain fiercely opposed to Bush's
policies, he is well liked. Some have crossed party lines to become
his allies. When longtime Democratic leader Bob Bullock died
earlier this month, Bush delivered the eulogy as Bullock had
requested. When Bush hosted 2,000 donors in Washington last week,
Robert Junell, a powerful Democratic member of the Texas House,
introduced him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is rarely involved in partisan fights. He is not dogmatic,
nor is he beyond giving credit to political opponents. When he
signed a education reform bill in 1995, he did it in the district
of Texas House Democrat Paul Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has soared in Texas during Bush's rise. Ten
years ago, of the 29 cq &LR; positions elected statewide, only two were
held by Republicans. Today, all 29 are held by Republicans. Much of
the turn reflects the decline of the Democrats throughout the
South, as conservatives who shunned the GOP since Reconstruction
began to abandon the Democrats. Others give Bush his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be as strong in Texas today without this strong,
charismatic guy at the top,'' said Perry, who formerly was a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sidestepped the dangers encountered by California
Republicans. For example, although Texas shares some of
California's problems with illegal immigrants, Bush was careful not
to make enemies while California Republicans have been virtually
abandoned by Latino voters ever since Gov. Pete Wilson championed
Proposition 187 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent a considerable amount of political capital in the
border communities, trying to woo the Latino population, which
comprises about a third of Texas. He has appointed scores of
Latinos to state positions. He frequently visits the border and has
brushed up on his Spanish, becoming conversational.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juntos Podemos'' read a huge banner over his inauguration
parade, beside an English translation: ``Together We Can.''
</P>
<P>
   Five governors of nearby Mexican states attended Bush's swearing
in, and while Republicans like Dan Lungren in California were
receiving just 20 percent of the Latino vote, Bush received more
than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charge Bush with opportunism and say that his
attention to Latinos has been little more than tokenism. Bush spent
$4 million _ about one-fifth of his entire campaign budget _ on the
relatively small El Paso market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was setting himself up to run for President of the United
States,'' said Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also charge Bush with taking credit for policies that
are theirs. In his presidential stump speech, he talks about giving
a $3,000 raise to teachers. The raise was part of a Democratic bill
that some Democrats say he fought against. He also talks about
expanding health care to children, though as governor he fought for
a much more modest proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who sit in Texas and watch, it's very hard for
us to stomach,'' Malcolm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no guiding principles. The one thing he believes in is
that he should be _ and will be _ elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to get a sense of what Bush stands for is to hear him
deliver a commencement address, something he does numerous times
each spring. Much of it could come only from a conservative _ the
discussion of the existence of God, of the need for personal
responsibility, of the moral emptiness of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest applause _ and for many the most memorable line
_ is something that cannot be so easily labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Without fail, Bush tells graduating seniors to remember:
```Baseball should always be played outdoors, on grass, with wooden
bats.'''

BUSH COURTS TINSELTOWN, HISPANIC VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, preparing for the
political version of a Hollywood screen test, partially blamed the
television and film industry Tuesday for violence among young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a correlation between violence in movies and
youth violence, but I also think there's a correlation between
violence and drug use and alcohol abuse and lack of parental
love,'' said Bush, who was scheduled to attend a small, exclusive
reception and fund-raiser with entertainment industry
representatives that was expected to net $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I meet with the movie people I'm not going to single them
out,'' Bush told reporters earlier Tuesday. ``I'm going to say:
`We're all responsible for ushering in the responsibility era.
We've all got to play a part.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on his first visit to California since he began his
presidential campaign, also sought to portray himself as a
Republican candidate who can attract a range of voters from such
Democratic strongholds as the Hispanic community to the high-tech
world of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic rival, former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, have been campaigning hard in the state,
which is viewed as a must-win for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes to increase his campaign donations from California to
$4.2 million for the campaign finance reporting period that ends
Wednesday. His campaign reportedly will announce he has raised
about $23 million since early March _ an amount that dwarfs those
of his GOP rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to make inroads with Hispanics in California,
where a voter-approved ballot initiative seeks to deny medical and
education benefits to illegal immigrants. That initiative,
Proposition 187, was supported by former Gov. Pete Wilson, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who received nearly half the Hispanic vote in his
re-election in November, opposes the California initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking for the (Hispanic) vote. And I'm talking about a
message that is inclusive and an education system that refuses to
leave people behind, an education system that measures and gives
parents more options when there is a failure,'' said Bush, who
sprinkled his remarks with Spanish throughout the day of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   As for Proposition 209, the California ballot measure that ended
affirmative-action programs in state hiring, contracting and
university admissions, Bush said he supported ``the spirit of no
quotas and no preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know, though, that quotas won't work when it comes to
meeting certain social obligations such as encouraging capitalism
to be spread all around the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who brands himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' was
to be the star attraction at a reception hosted by Terry Semel,
chairman and co-chief executive officer of Warner Bros. and Warner
Bros. Music Group and a long-time supporter of Democrats, including
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Semel went to the Texas capital earlier this year with a group
of Californians to attend a Bush luncheon at the Governor's
Mansion. After that visit, Semel offered to host a private
reception at his Bel Air home for Bush, according to campaign
spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood traditionally favors Democratic candidates, and GOP
candidates such as Dan Quayle win points among conservatives for
blaming the television and film industry for violence and other
social problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had only mild criticism for the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Hollywood lauds responsible behavior and responsible
decisions and responsible actions,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, violence can beget violence. But people behave
violently for all kinds of reasons,'' he said. ``But the whole
point I'm going to make with the movie folks is that all of us, all
of us, need to work together to change the culture. One industry
alone doesn't bear all the brunt.''

</P>
<P>
   At stops in La Jolla, Del Mar and Irvine, Bush sounded familiar
campaign themes of personal responsibility, local control of
schools, rebuilding the military and reducing marginal taxes, but
he avoided mentioning abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet small groups of abortion-rights protesters were on hand
outside the hotels where he gave speeches in La Jolla and Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Hayes-Raitt, the National Abortion Reproductive Rights
Action League's southern California director, called Bush ``the
most anti-choice governor in the nation'' for signing a bill last
month that requires doctors to notify parents before performing an
abortion on a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush said he will do everything in his power to restrict
abortion, and so far he has. What will he do as president?''
Hayes-Raitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the always-controversial issue has proved
problematic in recent years for statewide candidates who oppose
abortion rights, according to political observers.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush becomes the GOP nominee, California Democrats are likely
to exploit Bush's position _ he opposes abortion except in cases of
rape, incest and to protect the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been campaigning around the country as a moderate on this
issue, and clearly he isn't,'' Hayes-Raitt said.
</P>
<P>
   While protesters waved signs outside events, the crowds inside
cheered his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   At a fair in Del Mar, Bush received a rock star's welcome as he
worked his way through a crowd of several hundred people shaking
hands, posing for pictures and signing autographs. Many people
chanted ``Viva Bush!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to disappoint you, but it's not worth that
much,'' he told one youth who sought his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Scott Delmas asked Bush: ``Will you please bring
integrity back to the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   After Bush moved on, Delmas identified himself as a registered
Democrat leaning toward support the Texas governor next year. He
said integrity transcended all other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he brings integrity, he will make decisions based on
that,'' Delmas said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a 4-H tent, Bush mixed with participants who were showing
their lambs. As he left the tent, he said he could sense excitement
about his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hungry for something. I hope I'm the person to give
it to them,'' he said.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Why Starbucks Bid for Williams-Sonoma  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It seems absurd: The world's biggest coffee shop, Starbucks Corp.,
trying to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc., a seller of leather armchairs
and mixing bowls.
<P>
   Starbucks' acquisition offer, rebuffed by San Francisco's
Williams-Sonoma earlier this month, was unexpected because it
ignored the conventional rules of retail mergers. Typically such
deals tout synergistic benefits in areas like real estate, buying
raw goods or marketing _ none of which have much traction in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Seattle's Starbucks, a brick-and-mortar retailer,
proposed buying Williams-Sonoma, a brick-and-mortar retailer, as an
Internet play _ an opportunity for Starbucks to hitch a ride on
Williams-Sonoma's e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, such a combination would have made no sense.
Even today it seems a bit wacky. But it also provides a striking
example of how the digital world is redefining businesses as analog
as a double decaf macchiato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business as usual is dead and the rule book has been thrown
out,'' said Jamie Owens, president of the Retail Group, a Seattle
consulting firm. Companies today ``are not fish nor fowl, they've
got fins and feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks declined to comment on the acquisition attempt, first
reported in The Chronicle on Friday, and Williams-Sonoma will say
only that it is not for sale. Sources say that Williams-Sonoma's
board voted to reject Starbucks' overture in an emergency meeting
in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers see the move as vintage Howard Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz, Starbucks' chief executive, is proving as ambitious on
the Web as he has been with physical stores. This is a man who, a
decade ago, looked at a country where coffee is available on every
street corner and proceeded to roll out a national chain of coffee
bars. Now he heads a $1.3 billion company that sells coffee, tea,
canned drinks, and ice cream in supermarkets and more than 2,000
coffee bars around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz sees the Web as a key meeting place in the lifestyle of
the future, and he plans to be there. At the center of his strategy
is a lifestyle portal and cable television franchise that will
feature information, entertainment and e-shopping for upscale
women.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Starbucks agreed to partner with Oxygen Media of
New York, which is designing such a portal. Details are sketchy,
but Schultz said in a statement, ``We'll be able to provide a
seamless customer experience through our retail stores, cable and
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Already 70 percent of Starbucks high-income customers are on the
Internet, Schultz noted, so he's got the right kind of upscale,
wired demographics for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces of Starbucks' Internet strategy include investing
millions of dollars in chat-room developer Talk City in April and
the launch earlier this month of an online and in-store magazine,
Joe, in cooperation with Time Inc. A press release described Joe as
a new vehicle for ``conversation, community and culture'' allied
with the Starbucks brand.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem: coffee drinks aren't available on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers can't serve latte, at least not yet,'' noted retail
analyst Bonnie Kramer Tonneson of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Even coffee beans, which constitute a small minority of
Starbucks' sales, don't have much Net potential since Starbucks
operates physical shops on almost every corner, making access to
beans at least as convenient as at  &LR; www.starbucks. &LR;   &LR; com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So who does Starbucks turn to for a highly branded, well-known
merchant partner that can attract wealthy shoppers and generate
significant Web sales? Although Williams-Sonoma is late to the Web
_ it just launched its first full-scale site June 1 _ its
high-cachet brand name, big-ticket merchandise and loyal customer
base make it a logical partner.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams-Sonoma has its own Internet strategy in mind. Three
days after rebuffing the coffee-maker, Williams-Sonoma announced a
deal with CondeNet, the online magazine affiliate of Conde Nast
magazines. Williams-Sonoma expects to be a player in a portal/cable
TV business under development by CondeNet and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer is rolling out a full-scale Williams-Sonoma
kitchenware store this fall, adding to its new wedding registry at
 &LR; www. &LR;   &LR; wswedding.com &LR; . Next year it plans to launch two Pottery
Barn home furnishings sites, a registry and a store.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cohen, president of the consulting firm Strategic
Mindshare, likens Starbucks' lust for Williams-Sonoma to the
purchase of cataloger Fingerhut Companies Inc. by Federated
Department Stores Inc. earlier this year. Fingerhut's appeal was
its expertise in back-end order fulfillment, which Federated
intends to apply to its e-commerce businesses, said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma also boasts crack fulfillment systems, and
carries the additional value of well-known and highly regarded
brand names _ Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Hold Everything and
Chambers. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Conventional retailers like Williams-Sonoma ``already have
equity in consumers' minds, (and) trusted brands have everything to
do with the future of e-commerce,'' said Owens.
</P>
<P>
   The Starbucks overture raises questions about Williams-Sonoma's
future as an independent company. One reason it was considered a
desirable takeover candidate is that its stock is priced more like
that of a modest store and catalog merchant than a hot e-commerce
play.
</P>
<P>
   But that is starting to change. Shares have risen 20 percent
since news of the Starbucks bid became public, closing yesterday at
$35.81, up $1.81. Whether Williams-Sonoma is now being valued for
its e-commerce potential or as an acquisition target is hard to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Tonneson believes the stock still has plenty of upside potential
since investors are just beginning to think of it as an e-commerce
play. Consequently, Williams-Sonoma executive stockholders are
unlikely to sell now and miss out on any future stock run-up, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why give that away to someone else, when now they're really in
the game?'' Tonneson said.

 FDA Says Approved Drugs Are Not Without Risk  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
When it comes to pharmaceutical drugs, Americans should understand
that safe doesn't mean risk-free, Food and Drug Administration
Commissioner Jane Henney told biotech industry executives yesterday
in Berkeley.
<P>
   Henney, who heads the agency charged with testing drugs for
safety and efficacy, made her remarks in answer to a question at a
daylong industry gathering at the University of California at
Berkeley's Haas School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has drawn heat lately after some newly approved drugs
turned out to have harmful or deadly side effects even after going
through the lengthy FDA approval process. Henney told the audience
of roughly 200 industry executives that her agency needs to do a
better job of explaining that ``there is and always will be an
element of risk'' that new drugs will have unanticipated side
effects or will be improperly used or prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say we do safety tests, we understand safety is a
risk-benefit equation,'' Henney said. ``People have translated that
into `safe,' meaning no risk, and that's not the concept we want to
get across.''
</P>
<P>
   Henney, who took over as head of the FDA in November, is the
first woman to hold that post. She devoted most of her hourlong
appearance to assuring industry executives that the FDA will
continue looking for ways to speed up the process of reviewing drug
candidates without giving short shrift to safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   She said one way the agency will try to accomplish this
balancing act is by beefing up its in-house scientific research.
For example, she said, FDA researchers have begun looking at the
risks involved in modifying animal organs, like livers or hearts,
for transplant into humans, a field called xenotransplantation.
Henney said FDA researchers are looking at whether animal organs
might carry viruses that could infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   After she left the stage, Henney answered questions about
genetically modified foods. Environmentalists, among others,
criticize current  &LR; FDA rules that assume genetically modified foods
are safe and require no FDA approval, unless the company making the
modified food reports that it could cause some allergy or other
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Critics distrust this self-policing policy, but Henney said ``by
and large the system has worked well'' and she sees no need for
change at the current time.
</P>
<P>
   Henney's policy-oriented remarks were a departure from the
financial focus of the conference, which took the form of a series
of executive panel discussions. With the biotech sector in a long
slump on Wall Street, financial gloom characterized the panel
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't enough money out there,'' said Vaughn Kailian,
chief executive of COR Therapeutics. ``With 1,300 biotech
companies, we're going to have to be laying people off whether
consciously or unconsciously, by starving them (the companies)
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many issues facing biotech executives is how to deal
with the retail investors who hold a majority of the shares in many
early stage biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Eastman, chief executive of Geron Corp. in Menlo Park, said
more than 70 percent of his firm's stock is held by small
investors. Geron repeatedly has garnered national headlines for
scientific breakthroughs, like discovering a protein that seems to
rejuvenate cells. Such news has sent its stock soaring, only to
tumble quickly as investors realize how many years can elapse
between discovery and product.
</P>
<P>
   Joking that Geron's stock chart ``looks like the Himalayas,''
Eastman said biotech executives must walk the line between creating
excitement for the scientific potential of their work and stressing
how long it takes to turn ideas into profits.
</P>
<P>
   Kailian, jumping in as moderator, encapsulated the challenge of
communicating such risks to lay investors with this hypothetical
pitch: ``Give me your 5,000 bucks, and you have a 2 percent chance
of seeing this turn into a product.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which was organized by the Nasdaq exchange, ends
today with a luncheon address by David Lawrence, chief executive of
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, who will talk about how HMOs are
struggling to pay for new products coming out of the biomedical
industry.

 _ SF CHRON   Helping Your Children Invest 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My 13-year-old daughter has $1,500 she would like to invest in a
mutual fund. Can you recommend any well-managed funds that would
let her open an account with this amount?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are few, if any, funds _ well managed or not _ that
will open a standard account for your daughter. Typically, they
want an investor &UR;  &LR; to start with an initial investment of at least
$2,000, notes John Collins, a spokesman for the Investment Company
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not be a sport and give your daughter at least $500 more
to invest? (Because she is under age 18, it will have to be a
custodial account, with you or your wife _ or both _ placing the
trade orders.)
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility would be to have her transfer her money to
an Individual Retirement Account. Practically all mutual funds
impose much lower limits on initial investments made through IRAs.
With $1,500 in an IRA, your daughter will be able to open an
account with just about any fund she chooses. (Again, in the case
of your daughter or any other minor, we are talking about a
custodial IRA account.)
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that she may not be eligible to contribute $1,500
to an IRA. She can do so only if her earned income for the year is
going to be at least that much. Does she make $1,500 per year from
baby-sitting, lawn mowing or lemonade sales?
</P>
<P>
   I would rather not recommend a specific mutual fund _ or any
other security.
</P>
<P>
   However, anyone interested in mutual-fund investments should at
least take a look at the funds that track the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index. These index funds have outperformed the vast majority of
managed funds year after year, yet they charge much lower
management fees than most other funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Depreciation Rules
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent column, you answered a question about how to
depreciate a computer bought for personal use and later transferred
to a newly created sole proprietorship. I was shocked that you told
this poor guy he had to depreciate the computer over five years
when, in fact, he can depreciate up to $18,500 worth of equipment
in the first year of ownership under Section 179 of the tax code.
Someone should tell him this because as a startup proprietor, he
will need all the tax breaks he can get.
</P>
<P>
   A: What you say is correct only if the computer was converted
from personal to business use in the same year it was purchased. If
it wasn't, then it indeed will have to be depreciated over a
five-year period, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse
Weller.
</P>
<P>
   Section 179 allows you to depreciate equipment in a single year
provided that it is the same year you placed it in service. The
ceiling was $18,500 for the 1998 tax year, but it moved up to
$19,000 this year. Next year, it increases to $20,000, and in 2001
and 2002, it will be $24,000. It tops out at $25,000 in 2003.
(Those figures could change; there has been talk in Congress about
accelerating the increases or permitting even greater limits.)

<P>
   The asset you depreciate under Section 179 must be used at least
50 percent of the time for business. If it is mainly for personal
use _ in the case of a computer, for example, if you spend endless
hours every day palavering in chat rooms _ then it doesn't qualify
for Section 179 depreciation.
</P>
<P>
   If the equipment is used for business 60 percent of the time,
for example, it qualifies for first-year depreciation _ but only 60
percent of the price can be depreciated.

All Is Wells
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently got a notice from Wells Fargo informing me that my
credit card account is being transferred, effective July 1, from
Wells Fargo Bank (Arizona) to an affiliated bank, Norwest (Nevada).
The notice also states that the account will be governed and
interpreted in accordance with Nevada law. How does this affect me?
Will I lose any rights under Nevada law?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wells Fargo spokesman Lance Berg says you won't lose any
rights. ``From the customer's standpoint, there will be no change
whatsoever,'' he says, ``except for a change in the address where
they send their bill payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg particularly stressed that there will be no change in the
fees or interest rates on your account.
</P>
<P>
   Moving accounts from Arizona to Nevada is part of a Wells plan
to consolidate certain operations, Berg notes. ``The reference to
Nevada law refers to how we are required to operate under the laws
of that state. It is strictly an internal thing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Despite brighter-than-expected
economic performances in Brazil and Mexico, a spate of new economic
data around Latin America in recent days suggests that the
recession gripping the region will be deeper and more prolonged
than most economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Plunging regional trade and retail sales, persistently low
commodity prices and growing jitters over the financial health of
several Latin American governments _ all complicated by fears that
U.S. interest rates will rise _ have led forecasters to lower their
projections of growth and recovery well into the next year. As a
result, unemployment is rising in most of the region's countries,
and consumers are spending less.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month the currencies of Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and
Venezuela have come under pressure. Colombia devalued the peso on
Monday by about 10 percent. Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and
Venezuela have reported lower-than-expected economic growth in
recent days. Repeated cuts in interest rates have not turned around
the Chilean economy, as many economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine government's cost of borrowing has sharply
increased amid investors' concern over the expanding budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, there are growing indications that unpaid debts are
jeopardizing the health of several major banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the effects of the Asian crisis, the Russian virus
and even the Brazilian crisis would have been milder and shorter,''
said Jose de Gregorio, an economist at the University of Chile.
``With the exceptions of Mexico and Brazil, all the countries are
doing worse than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report released on Monday, Bear, Stearns lowered its
previous 1999 growth estimates for all countries in the region
except Mexico and Brazil. The gross domestic product for the region
this year, adjusted for inflation, was projected to shrink by
one-tenth of a percentage point. Many economists had projected
expansion of 2 percent or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns projected 3.5 percent growth for the region in
2000, which is considered a relatively modest rebound in light of
the sharp contraction of trade and the flight of foreign investment
this year as well as in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is under pressure as it prepares for a Fed rate
increase in the face of falling prices in much of the world,'' the
report said. ``Exchange rate weakness is likely in 1999 for most
countries, with sizable devaluations possible in Colombia and
Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   The report predicted that despite a growing demand from the
United States for South American goods, exports would fall 5
percent from already weak 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been an exception to the trends, with the government
last week forecasting that its economy would grow by 3 percent this
year, largely because of expanding trade with the United States.
Mexico's ties to the strong American economy have also helped
strengthen confidence in the peso _ which settled in New York
Tuesday at 9.425 to the dollar, up from 9.45 _ and in lower Mexican
borrowing rates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mexico's growth, Bear Stearns estimated that the
purchasing power of the region as a whole would contract by $173
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the anchor of the South American economy, and its
performance in recent months has also been better than expected,
considering the financial crisis that erupted with devaluation in
January. Interest rates have come down without pumping up
inflation, while temporary cuts in consumption taxes have helped
increase production and sales in the important auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   In February, economists predicted a contraction in Brazil of up
to 4 percent this year; now the Brazilian output is expected to
contract by 1 percent. Still, the economists remain cautious.
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration elsewhere has become noteworthy in recent
weeks in the so-called Southern Cone _ where the Argentine, Chilean
and Uruguayan economies are suffering their worst downturns in
several years. Chile announced this week that May unemployment had
risen to 9.8 percent from 8 percent in April, well above what
government and private economists had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine government recently recalculated the decline in
first-quarter output to 3 percent from 2.8 percent, and this week
officials conceded that unemployment _ now 14.2 percent, or two
points above the already steep level of last October _ could exceed
15 percent in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The human costs of this deepening recession in Argentina were
suggested in the dismal quarterly sales figures reported last week
by the nation's supermarkets, with declines of 15 percent or more
in such staples as powdered milk, beef and sausage compared with a
year earlier. Car sales in Argentina have fallen 31 percent in the
first five months of the year from the corresponding period of
1998.

 Businesses Not Ready For Y2K But Lawyers Are  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Every business and industry in the United States has companies that
still have not done enough of the work needed to fix the Year 2000
computer problem, speakers at a symposium in San Francisco said
yesterday.
<P>
   But there are more than enough lawyers primed and ready to go to
handle the flood of lawsuits that are expected if Y2K failures
start to appear, said Steven L. Hock, chief executive of Triaxsys
Research LLC of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you check the Web pages of major law firms in this country,
(at) 99 percent of them, you'll find Y2K featured as a specialty
practice area,'' Hock said during the opening day of a Year 2000
conference at the Fairmont Hotel. ``The mere fact they are gearing
up for litigation means that there will be lots of it.``
</P>
<P>
   About 150 corporate computer system managers and company
executives are attending the three-day National Year 2000 Symposium
to hear how their fellow computer professionals are handling the
glitch, which could cause computers to run amok on January 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hock said the legal ramifications of the Y2K problem should
serve as fair warning for every firm small and large ``to go the
extra mile'' to fix its own systems and develop contingency plans
to stay in business if there are Y2K failures.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that U.S. companies are making progress but still have
far to go. Financial services firms, for example, are regarded as
generally far ahead of other industries, yet a Triaxsys study of
Fortune 100 companies showed 47 percent had still only done the
minimum amount of Y2K work by the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In manufacturing, only 10 percent of the companies had reached
that minimum level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single industry has laggards who have a long way to
go,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a company fixes its own internal computer systems to
handle Y2K, it still has the legal duty to investigate how key
business partners such as parts suppliers are preparing. Extensive
testing and outside audits can help bolster a company's defense in
case of lawsuits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have passed similar
_ and controversial _ bills designed to limit corporations'
exposure to Year 2000-related suits. Both bodies are trying to
hammer out the differences in their bills to send the legislation
to President Clinton, who has threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Hock, former managing partner of the law firm of Thelen, Reid &AMP;
Priest, warned that no matter how the final Y2K law is shaped,
companies should not expect to use it as an attorney-proof shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that the legislation is going to deter
litigation, then you are laboring under an illusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic companies are still better off than firms in certain
countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, said Stephanie
Moore, a research director with the Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   One common problem is an ``unbelievable level'' of
misunderstanding of the basic Y2K problem by government officials
and company executives in those countries, Moore said. A government
minister in Mexico recently proclaimed the Y2K problem nearly
solved, yet a survey showed only 5 percent of the population knew
what the problem was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have information technology managers in France who are
desperately trying to prepare their systems despite the lack of
support from their executives,`` she said.
</P>
<P>
   The message, she said, is ``make sure you anticipate the
unavoidable and react to the failures.``

 &HT;    McCain takes risk with fund-raising stance
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the George W. Bush bandwagon rolls through
all the major primary states, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is
focusing his presidential campaign on two states where he hopes his
wartime record and maverick politics will play well.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first of the year, McCain has divided his campaigning
almost exclusively between New Hampshire and South Carolina,
deciding not to risk a test vote in the Iowa straw poll in August.
</P>
<P>
   McCain returns to New Hampshire again today to open a fresh
assault on the nation's campaign finance laws, defying the
conventional wisdom that campaign finance reform is an issue that
won't sell with Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the speech coincides with the close of the year's
second quarter fund-raising cycle. Like some of his rivals, McCain
has been making a last-minute effort to court contributors. He
e-mailed subscribers to his Web site this week and asked them to
make contributions over the Internet before the June 30 reporting
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Today's speech in Bedford, N.H., is pure McCain: patriotic, bold
and full of heart. In an advanced transcript of his remarks, the
Arizona Republican accuses President Clinton of turning the Lincoln
bedroom into a ``Motel 6'' in return for large donations of soft
money. But McCain also blames soft money for corrupting his own
party, noting that pork-barrel spending in Congress has
``dramatically'' increased since Republicans took control in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reform government,'' McCain said Tuesday. ``I want
to reform the tax business. I want to reform education. I want to
reform the military. All of that is made dreadfully more difficult
when you have a system that allows special interests to dominate
the legislative process over the average citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts doubt that McCain can make much headway with a
cause that many Republican voters believe is a non-issue. ``His
campaign will go nowhere if it is based on the attractiveness'' of
campaign finance reform or tobacco legislation, McCain's other
national issue, said GOP pollster Whit Ayres. ``His campaign is
based fundamentally on his story, which is a compelling story.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain believes that his outspokenness on campaign finance
reform and other issues will gradually distinguish him from the
rest of the GOP field, including Bush. McCain was the most forceful
of the presidential contenders on the subject of Kosovo, and he
almost never shies away from making direct answers to controversial
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But outspokenness also comes at a price. McCain has been one of
the loudest critics of the ethanol program, a federal program that
costs taxpayers $600 million a year but is popular among many
Midwestern corn farmers. McCain's campaign acknowledges that the
candidate's views on ethanol could hurt him among Iowa voters, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strong views on tobacco could also hurt among some
voters in South Carolina, said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who is
supporting the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign finance won't hurt him,'' said Sanford. ``Tobacco
will. I've heard people say they can't support him because of his
stance on tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   In several of his eight visits to South Carolina this year,
McCain has addressed the tobacco issue head on with tobacco
farmers, explaining that his proposal to levy new fees on
cigarettes to finance a federal campaign to reduce teen smoking
included $3 billion in subsidies to help tobacco farmers shift into
other crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very satisfied with that,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the nation's first primary in New Hampshire, McCain is
counting on South Carolina to give him the momentum he will need to
stay competitive with Bush in California and the large primaries
that quickly follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Palmetto State would seem a natural fit for McCain, a
decorated Vietnam pilot who survived five years of confinement and
torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese. South Carolina has
the highest per capita concentration of veterans of any state, not
to mention a large garrison of active-duty personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is crucial to John McCain,'' said Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.), who is supporting McCain. ``If you have not gained
momentum by South Carolina, you are in trouble. His stand is in
South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the endorsement of 18 local legislators, McCain conceded
that he has a ``huge, long way to go'' in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been to South Carolina only once as a candidate, but he
leads the field of other Republicans, according to the most recent
in-state poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got more than 55 percent of the support of hard-core GOP
primary voters, followed by Elizabeth Dole with 14 percent, former
Vice President Dan Quayle with 6 percent and McCain with 5 percent,
according to a poll released in May by Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson political scientist James D. Woodard, who authored the
poll, said he had expected McCain do well because the poll was
taken in April, when Kosovo and McCain were in the news. Instead,
the poll numbers confirmed the surge Bush has gotten almost
everywhere, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact is that (McCain) is not electrifying people
the way he needs to to win,'' Woodard said. ``I've never seen the
kind of enthusiasm for a candidate before he ran that I have seen
for Bush.''

 Will Rate Hike Cool Hot Housing Market?  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
An expected jump in interest rates this week isn't likely to cool
off the red-hot Bay Area housing market, at least not this summer.
<P>
   Mortgage lenders and homebuyers seem to already have anticipated
that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at its
monthly meeting today and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders already have boosted mortgage rates, with no noticeable
impact on Bay Area home prices or demand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the steep rise in home prices _ the median price hit a
record $301,000 in May _ the median mortgage payment is still
smaller than it was nine years ago because interest rates are
lower, noted John Karevoll, an analyst with Acxiom Dataquick.
</P>
<P>
   Based on May's 6.9 percent interest rate, homebuyers who made a
20 percent down payment on a median-priced home would be paying
$1,587 per month on their mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   That is $241 per month less than the all-time high: a $1,828
mortgage payment on a median-priced house in March 1990. At that
time, the median-priced house cost only $251,000, but mortgage
rates stood at 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At current home-price levels, the old record for monthly
mortgage payments would be surpassed if mortgage rates were to rise
as high as 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely to happen unless inflation takes an
unexpectedly sharp upward turn _ something the Fed hopes to head
off at its meeting starting today.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts expect the Fed to raise the federal funds rate by
0.25 percentage points right away, while a minority expects an
immediate 0.5 percentage point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital Management,
thinks rates might increase by as much as 0.75 percentage points in
multiple stages before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   However, because Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
been warning repeatedly about inflationary dangers in the hot U.S.
economy, mortgage rates have already risen.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the average rate in the Bay Area for a 30-year,
fixed-rate ``conforming'' loan (for less than $240,000) was 7.5
percent _ up 0.6 percentage points from 6.9 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates could continue to rise if inflation seems likely
to surge. But at the moment, that doesn't seem likely, Schlossberg
says.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are unlikely to dip _ although the rate of increase could
slow somewhat from the strong pace of recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of money people seem to be willing to pay for Bay
Area housing is nowhere near what we know to be the limits,'' says
Karevoll. ``We could have a rise in interest rates of a couple of
percent before we reach the stretched-thin financial situation we
saw during the 1988-90 housing boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical data gathered by Acxiom Dataquick confirms that big
mortgage-rate gains don't necessarily push down home prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the average mortgage rate shot up to 9.1 percent from 6.7
between October 1993 and November 1994, the median Bay Area home
price actually rose slightly _ from $223,000 to $224,000.
</P>
<P>
   During another big rate rise _ from 6.9 percent in February 1996
to 8.1 percent in September 1996 _ prices rose substantially, from
$224,000 to $236,000.
</P>
<P>
   The experts don't expect huge interest rate increases in the
current low-inflation environment.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has been
running at a modest 2 percent annual rate or less in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed tightening is just an insurance policy,'' Schlossberg
observes.
</P>
<P>
   While he considers the insurance advisable, Schlossberg adds:
``I don't see the need for big interest-rate increases. The
restraining influences on inflation are still in place: excess
capacity worldwide, the strong dollar (which holds down commodity
prices), continued corporate restructuring to improve efficiency,
and the investment in efficiency-raising high technology.''  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist with the California
Association of Realtors, says upticks in mortgage rates normally
stimulate demand at first, with prospective homebuyers rushing out
in a panic to buy before rates go higher still. But this hasn't
happened with the latest uptick, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to brokers throughout the state on a regular basis,
and only one or two have reported any stimulatory effect from
rising rates.''
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that panic hasn't set in because ``by historical
standards, mortgages are still affordable.''

 _ SF CHRON   Internet Mortgage, Credit Card Firms Trying to Cash In on Online 
 Success 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
OK, you joined the crowds online to trade stock. But are you ready
to take out a credit card or get a mortgage on the Internet?
<P>
   Karen Murphy and John Lee were. The Mountain View couple got a
loan from iOwn.com, a 3-year-old Web-based mortgage broker, to buy
a $310,000 house in North Berkeley, a purchase that closed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Their verdict? They say Web surfing got them a super rate: a
7.25 percent fixed-rate loan for $248,000 that converts to an
adjustable loan after five years, with 1 percent of the loan amount
rebated at the close of escrow.
</P>
<P>
   But the lender they found through iOwn, First Nationwide
Mortgage, peppered them with last-minute questions and demands,
causing them to miss the financing deadline in their purchase
contract. Fortunately, the seller agreed to give them more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty nerve-racking,'' said Lee, a 31-year-old
Microsoft marketing director, about his mortgage. ``I feel
confident I got the best possible rate, and iOwn has a great
dedication to customer service. But they're still working out the
kinks.''
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up the current state of online borrowing.
Internet-only companies such as iOwn and credit card purveyor
NextCard say the Web offers great prices, broad selection and
unbeatable convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can literally customize the terms for you,'' said NextCard
chief executive Jeremy Lent.
</P>
<P>
   And online mortgage companies offer rate-comparison software
that lets borrowers find the best loans available on the market
with the features they want.
</P>
<P>
   But electronic-commerce experts say the Web falls flat handling
complicated transactions in which human beings, not computers, make
the final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A mortgage is an example of a loan that has to be individually
underwritten for each customer. Those are tougher to complete
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit products go from simple to very complex,'' said Jay
Norman, a Chicago electronic-commerce specialist with the
consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``It's the less-complex
loans that best fit the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit card applications are simple because a few pieces of data
about employment, residence and income are all that's needed to
make a decision. NextCard says it grants approvals within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But mortgages require property appraisals, title searches and
proof of insurance. Applications often end up on the desks of human
underwriters who can stop the process in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean homebuyers shouldn't shop for mortgages or
other complicated loans online. They simply should know that ``no
matter what they do on the Web, there are still people pushing
paper behind the scenes,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, online lending still represents a minuscule proportion of
the total credit market.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a Boston consulting firm, recently estimated
that just 1 percent of the $2 trillion in consumer credit extended
this year will be lent via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with stock brokerages, in which one-third of all
retail trades now take place online.
</P>
<P>
   But things are about to change. ``The online credit market is
poised to take off,'' forecasts Forrester analyst James Punishill.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league lenders, including Countrywide Credit, the nation's
No.2 mortgage company, and First USA, the second-ranking credit
card issuer, are making big bets on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a flock of well-financed startup companies are
building all-Internet businesses to reach borrowers in virtually
every lending niche, including specialty areas such as auto loans.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fastest-growing new companies are based in the Bay
Area, including San Francisco's NextCard, the largest all-Internet
credit card issuer; iOwn, also based in the city; and Dublin's
E-Loan, the largest Web-based mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, Forrester predicts that nearly 10 percent of mortgages,
more than 16 percent of credit card loans and more than 25 percent
of student loans will be made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based lending has been slower to take off than the brokerage
business because consumers haven't seen offers they can't resist.
The rock-bottom commissions for trading stock online can run as low
as $5 compared with 10 or 20 times as much for trading off line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value proposition isn't as clear and compelling,'' said
Punishill.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, online mortgages generally are cheaper than traditional
loans though the benefits are not as immediately apparent. That's
because the savings are in the origination fees, not the loan terms
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   IOwn charges a $400 processing fee plus 0.5 percent of the loan
amount, and E-Loan levies a single fee of 0.5 to 0.75 percent of
the loan. That compares with fees as high as 1.5 percent of the
loan from traditional mortgage brokers. The companies charge less
because they assign staff loan specialists to each customer and
don't use commissioned brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken the loan agent out of the process and substituted
salaried employees,'' said E-Loan President Janina Pawlowski.
</P>
<P>
   That strength also can be a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton Co.'s Linda Wolan, the real estate agent used by
Murphy and Lee, said she didn't have the same clout with iOwn that
she might have had with one of her regular mortgage brokers. When
things went awry, she couldn't intervene the way she ordinarily
might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the control I normally do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, iOwn said it's trying to avoid such pitfalls by
automating underwriting tasks. For example, it now orders and
receives appraisals electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to streamline the process and eliminate as many
of those variables as possible,'' said Charles Reed, iOwn vice
president of lending services.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with mortgage brokers like iOwn, E-Loan makes most
of its mortgages itself. When it is the lender, it can avoid the
kinds of glitches that often crop up with third-party mortgage
companies. It sells its loans to Fannie Mae, the intermediary that
buys retail mortgages and repackages them for sale to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, E-Loan makes more money when it lends money itself
than when it brokers a mortgage. But the company says its
loan-selection software finds the best rate for customers whether
it's an E-Loan product or a loan from another company.
</P>
<P>
   Online credit cards don't offer clear savings. Though NextCard
says i offers lower rates, a consumer probably can find a company
offering better terms among the thousands of card issuers in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly not the same value'' as in an online mortgage,
said Punishill.
</P>
<P>
   What a company like NextCard provides is an unmatched ability
for a customer to tinker with terms and features and then get
instant approval on an application.
</P>
<P>
   NextCard, for example, lets applicants choose from a variety of
rewards programs and adjusts interest rates depending on sizes of
balances transferred from other card issuers. It even lets some
customers put photographs on the front of their cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What some people put on their card is their pet,'' said Lent,
the CEO.
</P>
<P>
   But beware. NextCard has tight standards. It prefers applicants
with solid credit records and large balances outstanding on their
cards. Only about one in four members of the public meet the
company's underwriting criteria, Lent said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lachut, a 24-year-old software marketing specialist in
Pittsburgh, was one of those who made the cut. He took out a
NextCard Visa last year and was so impressed that he bought 100
shares of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   The application ``took about two minutes,'' Lachut recalled.
``Plus, I don't get an outstanding amount of junk mail from them.''

 &HT;    Georgia governor campaigns for Hispanic citizenship
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Maritza Soto Keen tried to register new voters at
a predominantly Hispanic flea market in DeKalb County last year,
she quickly learned she was going about her task all wrong. Rather
than asking Hispanics whether they were registered voters, she
said, ``the question should be, `Are you a United States citizen?'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they take that step to become a citizen,'' said Keen,
executive director of metro Atlanta's Latin American Association,
``they will take that next step to exercise their responsibility
and privilege to register to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes wants to make sure they do.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Barnes threw his support behind a campaign supported
by Keen's organization and others to increase voter registration
among the state's Hispanic residents, the fastest-growing ethnic
group in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he called on federal officials to speed
citizenship applications so more Hispanics and other immigrants
will become eligible to add their names to the voting rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can no longer be denied that the faces of our economy and
our people are changing,'' Barnes said during a news conference to
announce the registration drive, adding that he plans to ``educate
and actively recruit'' Hispanic voters before next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting,'' he said he will tell them, ``is the voice that
really counts.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's blessing of the privately funded registration
effort reflects the fact that Hispanics have an importance _ and an
illusiveness _ that is increasingly attracting attention from
political figures across the ideological spectrum. Among others,
presidential candidates such as Democratic Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican, are aggressively
courting Hispanic voters, even as officials try to determine just
how many of them there are.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state officials not only don't know how many
Hispanics are currently registered to vote, they can't say
definitively how many Hispanics reside in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia voter registration forms ask applicants to declare their
race _ white, black or ``other'' _ but do not allow potential
voters to describe themselves as being of Hispanic ancestry or as
belonging to any other ethnic group. Among states with large
Hispanic populations, Florida takes a similar approach, while
election laws in two others _ California and Texas _ don't call for
collecting any racial or ethnic information from voters.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics ``generally fall under the `other' category,'' said
Kara Jones, a spokeswoman for Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox,
the state's chief elections officer. About 2 percent of Georgia's
3.5 million registered voters have checked ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hispanics are estimated to comprise about 5 percent of
all voters nationally, their presence has barely been noticed in
Georgia elections. When the Voter News Service, a research company
supported by news organizations, interviewed voters leaving Georgia
polls last fall, less than 1 percent said they were of Hispanic
descent.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic turnout may or may not have been proportionate to
the state's Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 207,053 people of Hispanic
origin live in Georgia _ not quite 3 percent of the state's 7.5
million residents.
</P>
<P>
   But in endorsing the voter-registration drive, Barnes cited a
significantly higher Hispanic population figure _ 475,000 _ that
came from a recent report to the state Board of Regents.
Researchers at Georgia State University counted the number of
Hispanic children enrolled in the state's public schools and
extrapolated the larger figure.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever number is correct, Georgia is believed to have nearly
twice as many Hispanic residents now than it did in 1990, and the
number is expected to double again within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Bachtel, a demographer at the University of Georgia,
disputed projections, cited by Barnes, that Hispanics may soon
become the state's largest minority group. Noting that African
Americans make up 29 percent of the population, far more than
Hispanics would account for even if their numbers doubled again,
Bachtel said: ``Georgia is a traditional black-white state. I don't
foresee the day where the Hispanic population is a dominant
population group.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes _ who hopes an accurate census count next year will give
Georgia another seat in Congress _ said the Hispanics' rapid
population growth is why he has recently paid so much attention to
their concerns; in addition to endorsing the voter drive, he also
has appointed a panel of Hispanic leaders to recommend legislation
addressing issues affecting their community.
</P>
<P>
   He denied Tuesday that his interest in Hispanic affairs was
related to his support of Gore, and said it had not been prompted
by either Gore's campaign or the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I don't think I'm registering a band of
Republicans. Even if I were, I would still be in favor of
registering.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts aren't so sure. Larry Sabato, a political
scientist at the University of Virginia, described Barnes' action
Tuesday as ``a dead giveaway'' that Democrats are worried about
retaining the Hispanic votes they can normally count on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening all over the country with both sides,''
Sabato said. ``Everyone recognizes that Hispanics are a critical
swing bloc in the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics recognize their political importance, too, said Sora
Chavez McFarlane, executive director of the Georgia Hispanic Voter
Registration Campaign. The campaign, she said, will ensure that
``every single one in Georgia who's Hispanic is going to be
registered to vote. We're going to count.''

RISES IN PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE LED TO HIGHER SURPLUS
ESTIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MEDICARE-CLINTON) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where did the Clinton administration find $1
trillion?
</P>
<P>
   The White House's new analysis of the federal budget _ which
shows a windfall of more than $1 trillion in the next 15 years on
top of the previously anticipated $4.9 trillion cumulative surplus
in that period _ is built on good things happening deep in the
economy and in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians do not much care where the surplus is coming from,
only in how much they have to play with. With the Congressional
Budget Office set to release its own updated projections on
Thursday, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday that he expects to
increase the size of the proposed Republican tax cut to take
account of any new money that become available.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the $775 billion, 10-year tax cut that Republicans
had planned, they may now shoot for a tax cut of $1 trillion or
even more, Archer said. In suggesting that Republicans would seek
an even bigger tax cut, Archer and other Republican leaders set out
a hard-line strategy for dealing with the White House, which wants
to hold down the size of any tax cut and instead put the bulk of
the surplus into Social Security, Medicare and new spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should say, `Oh, goodie! We have more
money''' to spend, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, told reporters on Capitol Hill. Rather, Lott said, the
extra money ``makes it a lot easier and more justifiable'' for
Congress to pass a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the partisan battle would not be possible if the government
did not find itself awash in good fiscal news, albeit, news
predicated on optimistic assumptions and educated guesswork about
where the economy is heading. None of the developments driving the
growth of the surplus are by themselves terribly surprising or even
new. Taken together, though, they are sufficient to create
breathtaking flows of money into the government's coffers and
reshape the political debate over the nation's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in Washington over arcane budget matters is so
intense, said Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the
Congressional Budget Office, because ``adjustments that are small
to professional economists can have immense political importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even tiny changes, multiplied by the world's largest economy,
make big differences over the years. The most important of them
include an increase in the administration's estimate of growth in
productivity, or how much each worker can produce in a given period
of time. When productivity improves, so does the economy's ability
to expand without inflation _ and therefore to generate a steady
increase in tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which the economy is enjoying a permanent increase
in productivity growth is part of a broader debate over whether the
economy has entered a new era in which massive investments in
technology have made businesses and workers much more efficient.
Administration officials said they were not endorsing the new era
concept, but simply reflecting the reality that the economy has
been performing better than its previous estimates predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a constant tension in these economic forecasts to be
prudent and realistic at the same time,'' said Jacob J. Lew, the
White House budget director. ``If we put out numbers that
underestimate economic trends, they wouldn't be credible. On the
other hand, we went to great lengths not to overstate the economy's
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   In its new analysis, the administration estimated that
productivity growth would be 1.6 percent annually through 2002, up
from 1.3 percent in the analysis it prepared in February. Over the
longer run, it estimated that productivity growth would slow
somewhat, to 1.4 percent annually, a figure that is still higher
than its previous long-range estimate of 1.3 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   The improved productivity outlook _ plus the economy's extremely
strong performance for the past several quarters _ underpinned an
increase in the administration's growth estimates. From this year
through 2004, the administration is now estimating that the economy
will expand by an annual average of 2.5 percent, up from 2.2
percent in the administration's last budget analysis in February.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economy is already bigger at this point than the
administration had predicted. Merely applying the old projected
growth rates to the new higher levels of revenue and income would
produce a large part of the additional surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In real life terms, stronger growth means more people are
working, earning bigger paychecks _ and paying more taxes. The
experience of the last few years shows how strong growth has
translated into the beginnings of the revenue cascade that the
administration now anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surge in revenues is coming from individual income
taxes. For next year, for example, the administration now expects
individual tax receipts to total $921 billion, up more than $21
billion since the February estimate. Corporate income tax receipts
are expected to come in somewhat lower than previously anticipated,
reflecting slower profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the growth in individual income tax receipts stems
directly or indirectly from the long bull market on Wall Street.
Individuals are reaping substantial capital gains, and more and
more people are being compensated with stock or in ways that
reflect the performance of their employer's shares.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the rising stock market can be seen clearly in
receipts from inheritance taxes levied on estates, many of which
contain big holdings of stocks and bonds that have appreciated in
value tremendously in recent years. The administration estimated
that estate and gift tax revenue next year would be $31.4 billion,
up from $27 billion in its February estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone count on the new budget projections? Not really.
Economists cannot project federal revenues and spending a few years
out _ much less 15 years hence _ with any precision.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the administration and the Congressional Budget Office
can claim that their assumptions and projections are reasonable,
which may be as good as it gets for the purpose of policy decisions
whose implications play out over decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Coca-Cola Co. tries to regain its footing in Europe after a
contamination scare that caused the biggest product recall in the
company's 113-year history, executives have made a rare admission:
that mistakes were made in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Such humility is far from routine for the soft-drink giant,
renowned as it is for superb marketing and a corporate structure
that is well-oiled from top to bottom. But the crisis in Europe, in
which hundreds of people said they felt sick after drinking Cokes,
has revealed a different Coca-Cola, one that stumbled repeatedly,
making an unfortunate situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
   When the outbreak began, Coke executives took several days to
make the matter a high priority. An apology to consumers came more
than a week after the first public reports that people had fallen
ill. It was not until June 18 _ 10 days after the first schoolboy
became dizzy and nauseated after drinking a Coke _ that top company
officials arrived in Belgium. And when Coke did begin to respond,
it attempted to minimize the reports of illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am genuinely amazed that they have reacted like this, and I
don't know what has gone on inside the company to make them react
like this,'' said David Arnold, a Harvard Business School marketing
professor who has studied Coke for years.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal rule of consumer-products marketing is that the
customers' perceptions _ often divorced from the facts _ are what
count, he said, adding that a company like Coke, which has built an
$18.8 billion business out of sugar water, should know that better
than anyone. ``They should have said yes, there appears to be a
problem, instead of arguing the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be weeks before the damage to Coca-Cola can be fully
assessed. Analysts have already knocked a few pennies per share off
earnings estimates for the current quarter for both Coca-Cola and
Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's bottler in Belgium. Beyond that, it
is clear that in Europe, which accounts for about 26 percent of
Coca-Cola's profits, Coke must take aggressive steps to restore its
image.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe L'Enfant, a senior executive with Coca-Cola
Enterprises, told a Belgian television station on Sunday that the
company ``perhaps lost control of the situation to a certain
extent.'' While the firm had a crisis management strategy, he said,
``The crisis was bigger than any worst-case scenario we could have
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's muted initial approach to its problems appears to
have backfired. In a news conference in Brussels last week, company
chairman M. Douglas Ivester said he had chosen to ``take a lower
profile on this,'' at the request of Belgian Health Minister Luc
van den Brossche, and other officials of Belgium's government.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Coke had taken a low profile well before any ministers took
charge. A bar owner outside Antwerp reported May 12 that four
people felt sick after drinking bottles of Coke that smelled
strange. That incident did not lead to public safety warnings,
although samples were tested, and no mention was made of it after
other incidents were reported, beginning June 8, because, a
Coca-Cola spokesman said, it was unclear whether they were
connected.
</P>
<P>
   government officials in Belgium and France complained repeatedly
about Coca-Cola's apparent inability to tell them, in timely
fashion, what it knew. ``You can say that since the beginning,
Coca-Cola has presented real contradictions,'' said one French
official involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those contradictions were evident within Coke itself.
One spokesman said this week that the May 12 incident was widely
known, since it had been ``extensively covered in the Belgian
press.'' Another spokesman said minutes earlier that he had never
heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   When the first reports of illness were made June 8, local
executives of Coca-Cola Enterprises were called in. That day, a
Tuesday, schoolchildren in Bornem who had been sold Coke in
200-centiliter glass bottles by their schools experienced
dizziness, nausea and other symptoms that ended with 42 of them
being hospitalized over the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Odilon Hermans, the director of the St. Mary school in Bornem, a
well-to-do suburb of Brussels, contacted the Coca-Cola Enterprises
bottling plant in Antwerp that day. He said several managers
visited the school and the hospital before nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   While a Belgian health official said the bottler had recalled
several batches of suspect Coke on June 8, it was not until June 10
that remaining unopened bottles at the school were taken away,
Hermans said. ``It was after we had to push them a little bit in
the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government decided to get deeply involved on June 10, after
eight children from Bruges, outside Brussels, had to be
hospitalized, said Susan Grognard, an assistant to van den
Brossche, the Belgian Health Minister. They said they felt sick
after drinking cans of Coca-Cola and Fanta, a fruit-flavored brand
owned by Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that moment, we began following it very closely,'' said
the health official. Coke executives were summoned to van den
Brossche's offices for a meeting the following day.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place at noon. About four hours later, the
ministry learned that 13 more children had been hospitalized in
Harelbeke, showing the same symptoms as the children in Bruges and
Bornem.
</P>
<P>
   The news came at a sensitive time. Belgian elections were only
two days away. Two ministers had already lost their jobs as a
result of an earlier, unrelated scare in which animal feed
contaminated with dioxin, a substance that can cause cancer, was
found across Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, the Belgian government informed the European
Commission and French officials of the steps it had taken. The
Belgians also set up a call center to field questions about Coke.
It received more than 200 calls by Monday, June 14. That day, 42
children were taken to the hospital in Lochristi. Eight more were
hospitalized in Korttrijk the next day.
</P>
<P>
   As more reports of illness were made, the government ordered
Coke to remove its products from schools. The removal was not a
perfect process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a situation where there was a vending machine in a
school and the building was locked, and we couldn't get to it over
the weekend,'' said Randy Donaldson, a Coca-Cola spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, voters removed the prime minister from office, and on
Monday, the Belgian government ordered all Coke products off the
market. Luxembourg enacted its own ban the next day. The government
of the Netherlands banned Coke products shipped through Belgium.
And health authorities in France asked Coca-Cola to shut down its
plant in Dunkirk, near the Belgian border, after Coke said that a
substance found on some cans shipped from Dunkirk was not normally
used by the company.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola executives said that flawed carbon dioxide, the gas
that produces the bubbles in a carbonated soft drink, probably
caused the smell some of the Belgian children reported. And the
substance on the cans, para-chloro-meta-cresol, was traced to
wooden pallets used to transport them from the Dunkirk plant. The
pallets, ordered from a Dutch company, used the solvent although it
did not meet Coke's specifications, said Robert Pagani, senior vice
president for operations at Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   As the bans spread in Europe, Coca-Cola resolutely insisted that
its products were not bad for anyone. ``It may make you feel sick,
but it is not harmful,'' said Rob Baskin, a spokesman at company
headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, in a statement issued at 10:30 p.m. Brussels time,
Ivester issued a terse apology from Atlanta. ``We deeply regret any
problems experienced by our European consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That day, German officials removed Coke products that had been
bottled in France or Belgium. Consumer groups in Germany and
elsewhere said the company had been less than direct and was
unreassuring in its public explanations, including assertions that
the drinks were safe even though people had gotten sick after
consuming them.

   In responding, Coca-Cola executives displayed a curious
indifference to the political and social concerns in Europe, which
ranged from fears of dioxin to trade squabbles over bananas,
surrounding the events involving their own products. In such an
atmosphere, ``this would be quite scary to a consumer, because you
would assume that Coca-Cola, which is a totally artificial,
manufactured product, would not have any problems,'' Arnold said.
``Meat or fruit might be a risk. But not something like
Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester arrived in Brussels for the first time June 18. At one
point that day he telephoned James Burke, the chairman of Johnson &AMP;
Johnson during the Tylenol tampering crisis in the 1980s, and
talked ``at great length,'' according to Burke's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   As he did so, regional health authorities in Spain were
recalling thousands of cases of Coke products, and Germany warned
consumers to be sure their Cokes were made in Germany, to be safe.
There were no reports of illness from Germany or Spain, and none
from Luxembourg or the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   As the bans on Coke products continued into Monday, June 21,
Ivester issued a memo to all of his company's 28,000 employees. The
subject was the ``Belgian Issue,'' and it said, among other things,
that the company's ``quality control processes in Belgium
faltered.'' Suggesting there was no cause for alarm, he added: ``I
have personally tasted the products and held the packages involved
with no adverse reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-page newspaper advertisements appeared that day in French
newspapers, asserting the safety of Coke products and listing a
toll-free number for people to call with any safety questions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Coke circulated a toxicologist's report it had
commissioned, which concluded that substances found in the products
in question _ such as hydrogen sulfide and the phenol compound _
were present in amounts too small to have caused the symptoms
people reported. It fanned rumors, reported in European newspapers,
that people who said they got sick were actually experiencing
``psychosomatic'' illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Coke ran ads in Belgian newspapers June 22 that consisted of a
more contrite apology, topped by a photograph of a smiling Ivester.
``I should have spoken to you earlier, and I apologize for that,''
the ad read. ``Over the past several days in Belgium, we allowed
two breakdowns to occur in fulfilling the promise of Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, June 23, Belgium lifted the ban on Coke's bottled
and canned soft drinks. Van den Brossche said Coke had agreed to
conditions, including more quality control, set by him.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, all other countries had followed suit, and complaints
of illness had, for the moment at least, ceased. An investigation
continues in France, focused on the Dunkirk plant. Vending machines
remain shut down in Belgium until the authorities check all 11,000
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the company announced a recall in Poland, this time of
its Bonaqua bottled water. Mold was found growing at the bottom of
1,500 bottles, according to Coke officials, who said it was not
dangerous, although Polish health officials said it could cause
digestive problems.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following through on a promise to preserve Medicare
for the aging baby boom generation, President Clinton on Tuesday
proposed fundamental changes in the program to make it more like
private health insurance and to add coverage of prescription drugs,
a benefit long sought by the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal, one of the biggest domestic policy initiatives of
the last three decades, would help keep Medicare solvent until
2027, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The president who rode into office with a promise to guarantee
health insurance for all said he was hoping to close his
administration by enhancing the giant health program for the
elderly and the disabled. The number of Americans 65 and older is
expected to double in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged a potential contradiction
in their efforts to shore up Medicare while creating a costly new
benefit. The savings from structural changes in the program,
including greater competition and prudent purchasing techniques,
would be dwarfed by a huge infusion of cash from the federal
treasury: $374 billion in the next 10 years, and a total of $794
billion from 2000 to 2014.
</P>
<P>
   The economic context for Clinton's proposal could hardly be
better. A vibrant economy has generated a windfall of federal
revenue. The White House said this week that it foresaw surpluses
totaling nearly $3 trillion over the next decade. One in eight of
those dollars would go to shore up Medicare under the president's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nation bursting with prosperity, no senior should have to
choose between buying food and buying medicine,'' Clinton told a
bipartisan audience at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, drug coverage would be voluntary, but the
administration said it would be such a good bargain that almost
everybody would take it. In 2002, the first year of the proposal,
each person would pay a premium of $24 a month _ $288 a year _ for
drug coverage. Medicare would cover half of a person's drug costs,
up to a limit of $1,000 on the first $2,000 of drug expenses. The
premium would rise to $44 a month in 2008, and the government would
pay a maximum of $2,500, or half of drug expenses up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a drug benefit our seniors can afford, at a price
America can afford,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said the fast-growing budget surplus improved the
prospects for passage of a major Medicare overhaul. But beneath the
inklings of bipartisanship Tuesday, the old suspicions lingered.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress reacted cautiously. They did not reject
Clinton's proposals out of hand, saying they, too, wanted to
restructure Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for the elderly said enactment of a Medicare drug
benefit prior to next year's elections was a long shot. But they
rejoiced that Clinton had put the issue high on the nation's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton would offer drug coverage to all 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries, Republicans said Congress should start by
helping the 15.5 million who do not have such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert,
and the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, said, ``We should be
careful not to force those who already have prescription drug
coverage to accept a government-run plan that costs more and
provides fewer choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would ``bring to the traditional Medicare
program the best practices from the private sector,'' allowing the
government to use its immense purchasing power to bargain with
suppliers of medical goods and services. He also proposed changes
to encourage price competition among health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs and other forms of managed care dominate the commercial
health insurance market, but have attracted only 16 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing coverage of prescription drugs and improved
coverage of preventive health care services, Clinton said he was
trying to modernize Medicare. ``Nobody would devise a Medicare
program today, if we were starting all over, without including a
prescription drug benefit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, beneficiaries would pay extra premiums
totaling $110 billion over the next 10 years, and the government
would put up $118 billion.
</P>
<P>
   People with low incomes (under $17,000 a year for a couple)
would not have to pay premiums or the beneficiary's share of the
drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gail E. Shearer, a health policy expert at Consumers Union,
said, ``The proposed drug benefit offers consumers good value _ far
better than they can now get in the Medigap market,'' which offers
private insurance to supplement Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates that the new drug benefit would cost
the Treasury $21.8 billion a year in 2009, and it anticipates that
the costs then would be growing about 11 percent a year _ much less
than the increases in drug spending reported recently by private
health plans. This disparity will inevitably raise questions about
whether the administration has underestimated the long-term cost of
its proposal, as the government has done with other Medicare
benefits in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements of Clinton's plan had been disclosed in recent
weeks, but there were a few surprises Tuesday. For example, he
proposed to eliminate all co-payments, deductibles and other
charges that beneficiaries pay for preventive services covered by
Medicare. These services include screening for osteoporosis and for
breast, colon and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for a study to see if Medicare should cover
services to help people quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president also proposed to make beneficiaries pay
20 percent of the cost of laboratory services, for which they now
pay little or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he asked Congress to increase the deductible amount
that Medicare beneficiaries pay for doctors' services and
outpatient hospital visits. The deductible has been fixed by law at
$100 a year since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the deductible would be automatically
increased each year to reflect increases in consumer prices. In
other words, it would be indexed for inflation, as measured by the
Consumer Price Index.

 &HT;    Medicare plan eases sting of drug costs
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Guthrie Foster, in a black jumper and a khaki
broad-brimmed hat, braved the rain Tuesday to stop by King's Drugs.
As she stood near rows of bath soaps, heating pads, cards and
candles, the 86-year-old praised President Clinton's proposal to
change Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Foster depends on Medicare, the government health care plan for
the elderly. She has additional coverage through a Medigap policy
that covers expenses such as deductibles or hospital emergency room
visits.
</P>
<P>
   But like thousands of other elder Georgians, Foster must pay for
her prescriptions, which total about $100 a month for blood
pressure and bone medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems I just pay and pay and pay,'' she said. ``Anything
that could reduce the cost would be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed that Medicare include a benefit that would
split the cost of prescriptions for most senior citizens. Critics
say the price to taxpayers would be too high, pointing out that
private insurers and public health plans offering such benefits
have been struggling to contain costs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefit could help many of the 870,000 Georgians who
depend on Medicare, although it's unclear to what extent. Already a
majority of Medicare recipients receive some type of drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 315,000, for example, get up to five prescriptions a
month free of charge through Medicaid, the government health plan
for the poor. Almost 60 percent have insurance plans through former
employers or have joined HMOs, which often require only co-payments
of $10 to $15 per prescription.
</P>
<P>
   James Dudley, who qualifies for Medicare, said he pays $250 a
month in premiums for drug benefits tied to his former employer's
health insurance policy. The premiums allow Dudley, who opposes the
Clinton plan, to pay only $12 to $25 per prescription.
</P>
<P>
   But untold thousands of older Georgians _ especially lower
middle income and rural seniors _ are shelling out hundreds of
dollars every month without any discounts, advocates for the
elderly say. And those older patients, experts say, could be
greatly helped by the Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely people who have trouble paying for
prescriptions,'' said Ellyn Jeager of the Georgia Council on Aging.
``Even if they're not living day-to-day, medications can be very
expensive, especially when you're taking five, six or eight a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, an estimated one in three Medicare recipients pays
more than $500 a year out of pocket for prescriptions. Fourteen
percent spend more than $1,000 and 4 percent spend more than $2,000
a year, according to the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, one of the 10 poorest states for the elderly, almost
one in four is classified as making less than 135 percent of the
federal poverty level, which is $8,200 for one person. That means
many fail to qualify for Medicaid, yet are unable to afford private
plans or out-of-pocket expenses for medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not uncommon here to see the little old lady in front of
you (in a pharmacy) ask whether she can buy four or five pills
instead of the entire prescription,'' said Mary Jo Nickodem, state
coordinator for the AARP Vote program. ``It's not hard to figure
out what happens if they can't take the medication they need. We
end up with greater health costs and higher hospitalization
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Anderson, owner of King's Drugs, said his elderly
customers often complain about the high price of their
prescriptions. Many are on fixed incomes and can't afford newer
medications that work better and cost more.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, one in three Georgians live in rural areas and
don't have access to HMOs and other health plans that include drug
benefits. Only seven insurers offer Medicare HMOs in Georgia, with
most being concentrated in urban centers like metro Atlanta,
according to the state's Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal plan outlined Tuesday, beneficiaries could
receive up to $1,000 a year for purchasing medication, with the
premium for drug coverage starting at about $24 a month. It would
then climb in subsequent years to about $44 a month. The government
would pay half the cost of the prescription drugs, with a maximum
cap of $2,000. Anything above $2,000 would be paid by the
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors could dovetail the benefits with other plans they might
pick or already have. The advantage, advocates say, is many elderly
people would no longer be driven to high-priced insurance plans
merely for the drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Clinton's plan would prove too costly,
particularly as baby boomers age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, pharmaceuticals comprised about 5 percent
of health care costs. In the next couple of years, they're expected
to surpass 20 percent,'' said Charles ``Chip'' Cangialose, a health
economist in Emory University's Center for Clinical Evaluation
Sciences. ``They're becoming a much larger part of the health care
dollar ... and if you add the benefit, you're going to add _
dramatically _ to the cost'' of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies say it would cost $15 billion to $25 billion a year
to add drug benefits to Medicare, according to the American
Association of Health Plans in Washington. Managed care companies
report their drug costs are climbing an average of 15 percent per
year, said Karen Ignagni, spokeswoman for the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly drug costs are problematic,'' said Charlie Harmon,
vice president for public affairs at Blue Cross/Blue Shield of
Georgia, which offers Blue Choice Platinum, the Medicare HMO that
has the largest membership in the state. ``We are very concerned
about the president's initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Medicaid program has also seen a steady increase in
costs. Last year, more than $119 million was spent for drugs on
110,000 Georgia residents 65 and older who also qualified for
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Experts aren't sure whether Medicaid costs would dip if Medicare
offered a drug benefit. But in some cases, Medicaid might pick up
the cost of the premiums for drug benefits offered through
Medicare, if the president's proposal is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, many seniors _ and their doctors _ said they
will wait to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always want our patients to get and take the medications
they need,'' said Dr. John Ed Fowler, president of the Medical
Association of Georgia. ``But we'll need to see whether this
proposal conflicts with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in line at King's Drugs, Foster, a former dean of the
Atlanta College of Art, agreed, saying she would like to know more
details about the plan before giving her full support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not having to pick between food and my medications,''
Foster said. ``But I certainly can't be extravagant either.''

MEXICO CITY ROBBERS KILL 2 AS THEY STEAL MILITARY PAYROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In one of the most brazen criminal attacks in
memory here, armed robbers on Tuesday ambushed elite soldiers of
the Presidential Guard two blocks from Ernesto Zedillo's
presidential residence, stealing a $50,000 military payroll and
killing an army colonel and a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   The midday attack appeared certain to increase the perception
that criminal violence is out of control at a moment when
politicians from all three main parties are converting crime into a
central campaign issue in state and national races.
</P>
<P>
   Gangland-style killings have become increasingly routine in
Mexico City. But the Mexican army is widely feared, and anti-crime
experts said street crimes that focused on military officers were
extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo was not in danger. He was at a meeting of Latin American
leaders in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The six gunmen, described by witnesses as extremely young,
perhaps teen-agers, drove two vehicles in front and behind the
soldiers' sedan as it stopped at a red light on an busy boulevard
that runs through a middle-class neighborhood adjoining Los Pinos
presidential compound.
</P>
<P>
   Running to the windows of the soldiers' car, the assailants
reportedly fired at least 26 shots into the sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started to shoot, and the soldiers in the white car
closed their eyes,'' said Adrian Kauffman, a student who saw the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The robbers seized an attache cash that was apparently filled
with cash and fled the scene unscathed in their two vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty bold,'' said Daniel Bell, general manager of
Kroll-O'Gara de Mexico, a security business. ``I've not heard of
attacks on military officers like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Robberies of payroll deliveries, however, are occurring at
``epidemic rates,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   With so many robberies, many companies are switching payroll
systems to direct electronic transfers to employees' bank accounts.

EMBATTLED BANKERS TRUST CHAIRMAN RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Frank Newman resigned Tuesday as chairman
of Bankers Trust Corp., apparently isolated and powerless after
Deutsche Bank AG acquired his company for $10 billion early this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concluded that the role originally envisioned for me will
not be necessary,'' Newman said Tuesday in a brief written
statement. ``I thought it made sense for me to step aside at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Newman would pursue ``other projects'' after
his departure on Wednesday, but did not elaborate. Deutsche Bank
officials said he was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Though Deutsche Bank and Newman's statement both portrayed the
resignation as amicable, it came after Deutsche Bank retreated from
a promise to give Newman a seat on its management board.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, 57, had come under increasing criticism after Bankers
Trust pleaded guilty to illegally diverting $19.1 million in funds
from dormant accounts between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Though Newman did not take over Bankers Trust until after the
practice was stopped, the guilty plea was a surprise to Deutsche
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche was deeply embarrassed by a small stock scandal three
years ago at Morgan Grenfell, the British investment bank it had
acquired in the early 1990s. To avoid a repeat, Deutsche Bank
executives established much tighter control over Bankers Trust and
indeed are doing away with the name itself.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original takeover plan announced last November, Newman
was to become co-chairman of Deutsche Bank's corporate banking and
investment banking division, known as Global Corporates and
Institutions. He was also supposed to become a member of Deutsche
Bank's management board.
</P>
<P>
   But after Bankers Trust's guilty plea, some of Deutsche's top
executives rebelled against giving Newman a board seat. When the
two banks formally completed the sale on June 4, they omitted any
mention of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Newman will not leave penniless. His contract with Bankers Trust
guaranteed him salary and bonuses of roughly $55 million, and
Deutsche Bank may pay significantly more in order to avoid an
embarrassing public fight.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, wants to use Bankers
Trust as a springboard into the United States and to strengthen its
position in investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a former deputy treasury secretary, was hired in late
1995 to clean up Bankers Trust after a series of scandals at the
bank involving high-risk derivative securities. He orchestrated
several acquisitions, including that of Wolfensohn &AMP; Co., a small
investment bank, and BT Alex. Brown &AMP; Sons, the Baltimore brokerage
firm with a reputation in high-technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Bankers Trust suffered heavy losses as a result of Russia's
economic collapse, and it was in desperate need of a strong new
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The German bank has thus far installed Bankers Trust executives
in several senior jobs. Yves de Balmann and Mayo Shattuck III have
been placed in charge of Deutsche Bank's global investment banking
operations. Mary Cirillo will be in charge of the bank's large
business in custodial services for securities.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank budgeted $400 million to $500 million for
incentive bonuses aimed at retaining key Bankers Trust executives.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, made it clear
in November that he was taking firm control. ``This is an
acquisition,'' he said, not a merger.
</P>
<P>
   As plans moved forward during the last six months, Newman had
become increasingly isolated. Deutsche Bank installed John Ross, an
American who had formerly run its Asian operations, in charge of
North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Though Newman was supposed to share power over the Global
Corporates business with Josef Ackermann, a Deutsche Bank board
member, he remained outside the lines of real operational
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's isolation increased when Deutsche Bank refused to name
him to its management board, known as the Vorstand. After Newman
and Breuer met in Paris last week, the two men agreed to part ways
by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were apparently pleased about Newman's placid
departure. Deutsche Bank shares rose 1.73 euros, or 3 percent, to
58.47 euros.

   US officials and Balkan experts agreed that the rally, ignored
by state-controlled Yugoslav television, reflected increasing
discontent with the Yugoslav president. US Defense Secretary
William Cohen said in Washington that he expected rising criticism
``in the wake of people understanding they have lost their jobs,
they have lost members of their family, they have been isolated
politically and their economy is going to take years to repair as a
result of his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   As police turned back hundreds of cars headed toward the central
Serbian town of Cacak _ whose mayor had gone into hiding after
publicly criticizing Milosevic _ hundreds more vehicles threaded
through back roads, and people from nearby villages walked to the
town. Many speakers arrived a day early, anticipating that
Milosevic's government, which has not lifted its ban on public
gatherings, would try to thwart the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the rally began, a bomb exploded in a parking lot,
leaving a sizable crater and shattering the windshield of a Yugo.
The crowd, shouting ``Red Bandits!'' _ a reference to Milosevic's
communist and socialist ruling coalition _ buckled and began to
flee, but the rally's first speaker, Milan Kandic, urged everyone
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us not to be afraid,'' said 18-year-old Visnja, a
student in Cacak. ``Everyone understood how important it was that
we not run. Anyway, what's one small bomb after everything we've
been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Some chanted ``Red Bandits!'' after the explosion, in a
reference to the communist and socialist ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the speakers addressed the crowd and spoke with a
singular voice, saying Yugoslavia must remove Milosevic to move
forward. They called for fair elections as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a government of traitors. They're in conflict with the
Serbian Orthodox Church, Montenegro and the world,'' said Zoran
Zivkovic, the mayor of southern Serbian town of Nis.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Cohen told reporters that it was ``too early to
tell'' whether the public protests would weaken Milosevic, but he
believed that the demonstrations would continue, and grow, against
the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   Eric D. Gordy, a Clark University sociologist and author of
``The Culture of Power in Serbia,'' said the demonstration may
indicate broad popular dissent against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it at a time when the regime still banned protests,
and specifically banned this one and set up roadblocks. I think
that also you have to think about the political environment
there,'' Gordy said. ``It's really hard for people to imagine that
they can achieve anything by protesting, because this regime has
destroyed everything in the past year. The fact that anybody would
show up at all is pretty major.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event chose to hold the rally without the
government's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advise the government to stop using the police against the
people as that never saved one dictatorship,'' said a statement
from the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   There were two minutes of silence; one for those killed in the
war, another for the removal of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The last speaker, Cacak's popular mayor Velimir Ilic, emerged
from several weeks of hiding to address the crowd. Demonstrators
adoringly chanted ``Veljo! Veljo! Veljo'' _ his nickname _ as he
moved toward the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Ilic fled Cacak during the war after the police tried to arrest
him for his anti-government statements. Ilic's voice trembled as he
spoke of his ordeal. He said monks in the mountain village of
Brezovici sheltered him while he hid from the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elder of the monastery told me not to carry a gun, but a
cross,'' said Ilic. ``I came back only with God's help.
</P>
<P>
   His speech sent a wave of emotion through the crowd. To wild
cheering, Ilic concluded: ``We want a new Serbia!''
</P>
<P>
   The rally was organized by the Alliance for Change, a coalition
of opposition groups who are calling on Milosevic to step down and
for fair elections. The Alliance plans to hold such demonstrations
all summer across Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the Alliance is to allow citizens to articulate
their rage in a positive manner,'' said Vladan Batic, the
Alliance's coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The police roadblocks show that the Milosevic's well-paid police
force is prepared to carry out orders and may take additional
measures to prevent such demonstrations. The Alliance is determined
to hold its gatherings in the face of a government crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely have to encourage young people to become
involved in the future of this country. Nobody can change the
government but us,'' said Obradovic, the Christian Democrat leader.
</P>
<P>
   Batic said that the Alliance would boycott unfair elections.
Without reform of election laws, the alliance promised to hold
parallel opposition elections instead that would establish a second
government.
</P>
<P>
   Since martial law was lifted last week, criticism of Milosevic
in the press has gained a steady momentum. A parade of Serbian
intellectual and cultural figures have called for his removal, as
well as the Serbian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   But the powerful nationwide television station, Radio Television
Serbia, still ignores any unflattering news about the government.
Even Studio B, the Belgrade television station controlled by the
Serbian Renewal Movement, Serbia's largest opposition party,
mentioned the Cacak rally only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the commander of the international peacekeeping force
said that more guerrilla fighters in the province had turned in
their weapons. Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson said he was ``broadly
satisfied'' that the disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army was
proceeding according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen said Tuesday that NATO forces must continue to move
quickly into Kosovo to prevent firefights between Serb
paramilitaries and ethnic Albanian fighters. There was special
concern that some Serb fighters had remained behind and, in a
reversal of roles with the ethnic Albanian separatists, would try
to play the role of guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will be important is for us to accelerate _ to the extent
possible _ the arrival of the full KFOR force,'' said Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen, referring to Kosovo Force peacekeepers.
About 14,000 peacekeepers are now in Kosovo, and Cohen said more
than 25,000 should be in the province in two weeks. Ultimately, the
force will number 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The full US contingent of 7,000 soldiers is expected to be in
Kosovo in about two weeks, said Army Lieutenant General Michael
McDuffie of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st Infantry Division soldiers are moving from Germany into
Kosovo. The Navy warship Bob Hope arrived Tuesday at the Greek port
of Thessaloniki carrying Army tanks, howitzers and other equipment
for the soldiers. A second US warship, the Soderman, is due in the
Greek port Saturday, McDuffie said.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of American troops into Kosovo has been fairly easy
because there was less damage to roads and bridges than expected,
he said. Another unexpected find: there have not been huge numbers
of ethnic Albanians found in mountain or forest hideouts throughout
Kosovo, McDuffie said. US intelligence reports had estimated that
up to 500,000 people were living in desperate conditions with
little or no shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have not found any large number of'' internally
displaced persons, he said, adding only that intelligence reports
and information from the United Nations had turned out to be
incorrect.

 &HT;    Akers rations her energy and adjusts to a new role for the U.S.
team
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No Women's World Cup Barbie dolls bear Michelle Akers' likeness,
and no clever commercials feature her as a glamorous soccer star.
</P>
<P>
   On a U.S. team basking in the limelight of newfound sports
celebrity during the Women's World Cup, Akers does not personify
any of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the 33-year-old defensive midfielder _ kept together with
the help of daily intravenous injections, a less stressful role on
the field and an abiding religious faith, as she nears the end of a
glorious 14-year career _ helped create what is swirling around her
and her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, 5 feet 10 with bushy blonde hair, a craggy face and
occasional slowness of step, is aware of the ``warhorse''
description that follows her. She even uses the term when talking
about herself. But for a woman who lives with chronic fatigue
syndrome and has endured no fewer than a dozen knee operations, she
insists that she never has felt better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good right now,'' she said. ``The only job I
have is to play. Day to day, I have a handle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, Brandi Chastain and
others make the media rounds, Akers spends time in the training
room, replenishing her body with nutrients, or by herself at the
team hotel, bundling up energy for the next practice session or
game.
</P>
<P>
   Akers has been well-rested the past week, scoring a goal and
playing the first half in a 7-1 romp over Nigeria and sitting out
Sunday's 3-0 win over North Korea. Her physical ability could prove
to be critical for Thursday's quarterfinal with Germany in
Landover, Md., in what could be the most rugged encounter for the
Americans. And that's what has kept her value high after being
switched from a primary role as a powerful scorer for the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that in every game she's going to leave everything
she has on the field,'' Foudy said. ``That's what you love about
her, that's what you love about playing next to her. We have to
have her out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After starring for the U.S. team in the first Women's World Cup
in 1991, where she scored 10 goals, Akers became the heart, soul
and persona of women's soccer. She grew to be a prominent sports
figure in Sweden, where she played professionally for three
seasons. Her goal last week was the 103rd of her career, putting
her fifth on the all-time international list, a feat lost among the
clamor over Hamm, who recently took over the lead with 111.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle may not be getting the commercials, but when you're
looking for someone to point to as where this all started, she was
the pioneer,'' said Bill Barker, the University of Georgia women's
soccer coach, who coached Akers at Central Florida in the
mid-1980s. ``For some reason, she's been chosen to be the player
who stepped up for women's soccer when a lot of people weren't
paying much attention at all.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to Sweden with the U.S. team for the 1995
World Cup, however, her abundance of energy was gone. She couldn't
force herself off the sofa after what were becoming longer and more
frequent naps, and it took her hours to cook, do laundry, run
errands. When a series of different diets didn't work, Akers, on
the verge of desperation, went to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Norway ousted the Americans in the semifinals, as Akers tried
gamely to recover from a broken bone she suffered near her eye
earlier in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my playing career was over,'' Akers said. ``I just
couldn't do anything, on or off the field. It looked like it was
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the diagnosis was in, the crazy diets stopped. Painstaking
detail to nutrition, exercise and outside activities were hard for
Akers to accept at first, but they have prolonged her career.
</P>
<P>
   While teammates were parading around the Sanford Stadium field
in July 1996, draped in the American flag and accepting their
Olympic gold medals, Akers was in the locker room hooked up to an
IV. She missed most of 1997 recovering from the Olympics and
plunged into a vocal role as a born-again Christian, finding it
impossible to separate her needs for physical and spiritual
sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything's been ripped out of your life, you become
very introspective,'' she said. ``I saw that God needs to be the
primary focus in my life and the foundation of who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers has hinted that next summer's Olympics probably will bring
down the curtain on her career, but she is savoring every moment
while strictly observing the habits that have gotten her this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been years of paying attention to very minute details and
then stepping out on the field and seeing what's there,'' she said.
``That's the part you never really know about from day to day, but
I think I'm holding up pretty well.''

 &HT;    CLINTON MODERNIZES MEDICARE
 &HT;    980&AMP;add. With Medicareglance30.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - President Clinton offered a plan Tuesday to
modernize the 1960s-era Medicare program by including a
prescription drug benefit and increased competition among managed
care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress immediately criticized the plan for not
providing enough protection against catastrophic medical expenses
and offering lavish coverage for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nation bursting with prosperity, no senior should have to
choose between buying food and buying medicine,'' Clinton said,
unveiling his plan before a packed audience in the White House East
Room.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would give the 38 million elderly and disabled
Medicare beneficiaries the option of having the government
subsidize half of their drug costs up to $1,000 beginning in 2002
and $5,000 when fully implemented by 2008. The government's maximum
payment then would be $2,500 per person.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would impose a $24 a month premium for the voluntary
Medicare Part D drug program. The premium would rise to $44 by
2008. The drug benefit would cost the federal government $118
billion over 10 years, much of which the administration expects
would be offset by reduced spending on hospitals and other
treatment because seniors were receiving proper medication.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty line -
currently $11,000 for individuals, 17,000 for couples - would not
have to pay the drug premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a drug benefit our seniors can afford at a price
America can afford,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Other facets of the plan include increased competition among
managed care plans to cover a core set of benefits, elimination of
deductibles and copayments for Medicare-approved preventive care
services such as cancer screenings, and extension of the provisions
of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act which reduce payments to providers
such as hospitals and HMOs. The provisions are scheduled to expire
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is credible, sensible and fiscally responsible. It
will secure the health of Medicare while improving the health of
our seniors,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement fulfilled Clinton's promise last March to
offer his own Medicare reform plan after the Bipartisan Medicare
Reform Commission fell one vote short of getting the 11 votes
needed to issue a recommendation to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's leaders, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., and Rep. Bill
Thomas, R-Calif., attended the White House announcement and later
said they saw Clinton's plan as a positive development - although
both were critical of numerous provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal does little to change Medicare's basic
structure, but with an infusion of the projected federal surplus,
it gives the program a sound fiscal future well into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Without changes, Medicare Part A , which pays for hospital
charges out of the payroll tax, is expected to be depleted by 2015.
Clinton's plan would take 15 percent of the surplus, nearly $800
billion over the next 15 years, and shift it into the Part A trust
fund, extending its life until 2027.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, after years of failing to provide a drug benefit
because it was considered too expensive, the fight now is likely to
be over how rather than whether to provide a prescription drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to make it available to all Medicare
beneficiaries, but only cover a portion of the costs. Republicans
want to make it available to fewer beneficiaries, but provide
catastrophic coverage to those with extraordinarily high bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would devise a Medicare program today, if we were
starting all over, without including a prescription drug benefit,''
Clinton said. ``We all know that these prescription drugs both save
lives and improve the quality of life, yet Medicare currently lacks
a drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on
health, which has jurisdiction over the Medicare program, said
Republicans are committed to providing drug coverage for seniors,
but in a different manner than Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than giving all seniors 50 percent coverage, Thomas and
other Republicans want full drug coverage for low-income seniors
and a cap on the maximum expense beneficiaries would have to pay.
The level of the cap has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also oppose giving the same drug benefit to all
elderly regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should somebody that has a $100,000 income get a federal
subsidy for prescription drugs?'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Florida senators split along party lines over Clinton's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bob Graham hailed the drug plan and Clinton's effort to
expand coverage for preventive care screenings - a proposal similar
to one Graham made earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare won't be relevant in the 21st century if we don't
cover the treatments that physicians use and patients require,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Connie Mack said he was concerned Clinton's drug
proposal would result in many elderly dropping their retiree drug
benefits or supplemental Medigap policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayers will be forced to cover prescription drug costs for
those who can afford it, which is not fair,'' Mack said. ``We
should start by providing prescription drug coverage to the
approximately one-third of the Medicare population who cannot
afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Optional trim
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal was hailed by some senior groups as a
positive starting point, but there were reservations about the
level of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going in the right direction by creating a universal
benefit and not just a poverty benefit,'' for prescription drugs,
said Daniel Schulder, legislative director for the National Council
of Senior Citizens, a group that has a liberal orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But Schulder said his organization would like to see the
government subsidize a higher portion of the prescription costs
than the 50 percent proposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Corry, federal affairs director for AARP, the nation's
largest senior organization, said ``whether we get it done this
year or next year, this is a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Corry said his members would have to ``chew on it a little'' to
determine whether they would support the plan with the level of
benefits Clinton proposed.

MARV ALBERT RETURNING TO NBC 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marv Albert returned to NBC Sports Tuesday to call
National Basketball Association games nearly two years after a
trial filled with embarrassing details about his sex life led the
renowned announcer to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of
assault and battery. NBC discharged him on the day he entered his
plea.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year NBC contract represents Albert's fourth job, one
year after he had been jobless. He calls NBA games on TNT cable for
Turner Sports and Knick games on WFAN Radio, and is host for the
``SportsDesk'' news program on the MSG Network. Turner had to
approve his NBC hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back a year or a year and a half ago, I thought I'd be
working, but I never took it for granted that all this would fall
into place,'' Albert said. ``There was always a distant hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert's salary from his four jobs will be between $2 million
and $2.5 million annually, about what it was when NBC dismissed him
and he was forced to resign from MSG.
</P>
<P>
   His rehiring at NBC does not mean a return to the No. 1
play-by-play slot, which will continue to be manned by Bob Costas.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's interest in Albert came amid his negotiations to join Fox
Sports for National Football League games. Three weeks ago, Dick
Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, called Albert's agent upon
reading of the progress of the Albert-Fox talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I'd better act immediately or I wouldn't be able to
do this for three or four years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He knew, but did not react, to being told in early May about the
Fox talks by Arthur Kaminsky, Albert's agent. A month later,
sensing that Fox could beat him, Ebersol called to negotiate a deal
with Albert. Ed Goren, the co-executive producer of Fox Sports,
said: ``I had to be a realist. You can't compete against what NBC
offered. You don't even want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky said: ``We would have been happy to make the Fox deal.
We were making progress. Once it was clear NBC would make Marv an
offer for the NBA and the Olympics, it was much more alluring
considering what Marv does.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert will also call boxing for NBC at the 2000 Summer Olympics
in Sydney, Australia, and ice hockey for the 2002 Winter Games in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's decision to rehire Albert was made easier because there
has been little adverse advertiser reaction to his hiring by MSG
and Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol's desire to bring Albert back is in contrast to the
announcer's rapid dismissal in September 1997, on the day he
pleaded guilty to biting a former girlfriend during a hotel
encounter earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   Albert assured Ebersol that he was innocent and would not plead
guilty, and when the announcer entered the plea, NBC dismissed him.
While not saying Albert would never again work at NBC _ Ebersol
said he would consider it if Albert fixed his life _ a return
seemed unlikely. ``We did what we felt we had to do,'' Ebersol
said. ``And Marv has done what he had to do in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert completed a year of psychiatric treatment, which resulted
in the expunging of his criminal record in Arlington County, Va.,
where he was tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood what had to be done and never felt `they did this
to me,''' said Albert, regarding his dismissal by NBC. ``I'm just
thrilled to be back.''

INSURERS REEVALUATING SUCCESSFUL AIDS-DRUG PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ At 8:48 a.m. the surveillance camera started
rolling. It filmed Robin Lambert as he crossed the street, his dog,
Harley, in tow. It recorded him leaving the Cumberland Farms,
reading his newspaper as Harley did his business in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator tailing Lambert in February had been hired by
his disability insurer MetLife. The company had shelled out $48,000
a year in disability payments since 1996 when Lambert left his job
with AIDS. Now, with his health stabilized by new protease
inhibitor drugs, MetLife was preparing to cut him loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I would be dead by now,'' said Lambert who was
notified in March that his insurance had been terminated. ``As we
live longer, (the insurance companies) are being more aggressive in
trying to take away our benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago AIDS was an almost certain death sentence. Now,
as new medications extend their lives, AIDS patients are
increasingly coming in conflict with their disability insurance
carriers. These companies, sometimes using surveillance, are
scrutizing AIDS patients claims with the same rigor they apply to
sufferers of other chronic ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the case that we do pay more ongoing attention to
people who are out on disability with AIDS'' than in the past, said
Catherine Harnett, a spokeswoman for UNUM Life Insurance Company of
America, a Portland, Maine-based disability provider. ``We do so
simply because we have discovered that people who are responding
favorably to treatment are able to go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   A Metlife spokesman said the company applied the same ``case
management procedures'' to all people with disabilities. He said as
a company Metlife is ``not taking a harder look per se at people
with AIDS who are on disability.'' He would not comment on the
specifics of Lambert's case, but said surveillance was only used
after a medical authority stated that a claimant could go back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   For AIDS patients, battles with insurers are nothing new. In
earlier stages of the epidemic, insurers fought not to cover health
or life insurance for those with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   While the success of the drug regimens now raises the prospect
of extended periods of insured disability, it also provides
insurers with a reason to stop costly disability benefits. But AIDS
activists and doctors who treat patients with AIDS accuse the
insurance companies of being overzealous. They say stories in the
media have given a false impression that the new drug therapies are
cure-alls.
</P>
<P>
   While many people on the new protease-inhibitor drugs do live
full and productive lives, other recoveries are short-lived. And
many experience severe side-effects caused by their medications
_diarrhea, chronic fatigue, and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing private disability insurers taking extremely
aggressive and unreasonable positions when terminating people with
AIDS from benefits,'' said Benjamin Klein of the Boston based group
Gay &AMP; Lesbian Advocates &AMP; Defenders, who represented Lambert in his
case against MetLife.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert argued he still suffers from debilitating fatigue, while
the insurer claimed that its investigation showed he could work
professionally: the videotape had shown him visiting the Portland
restaurant he had bought. Klein said his client rarely spent more
than an hour or two at the restaurant and questioned whether he
could ever return to his former position in the human-resources
department of a coporation.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife eventually restored Lambert's disability payments after
negotiations with Klein. But Klein said many AIDS sufferers in
similar straits aren't able to wage a legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These insurance companies understand that most people are not
going to be able to find a lawyer to challenge them,'' Klein said.
``So they have an economic incentive to be aggressive rather than
cautious in terminating benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome Groopman, an AIDS specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess
Hospital, said most of his AIDS patients on disability are eager to
re-enter the workforce. But he said they faced the very real
possibility that their AIDS might flare up again, leaving them with
less of a safety net than they'd previously had. ``Most insurance
companies are loath to take these kinds of people,'' Groopman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Delozier, an AIDS patient who is covered by Harvard
University's total disability plan, was told in May that the
university intended to terminate his coverage. He'd been on
disability since 1995 when he left his job as director of fiscal
services at the Harvard School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just losing the whole system of support that I've taken
for granted,'' Delozier, 51, said.``Everything was in place for me
to live in genteel poverty and die a dignified death. Now, I don't
know what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Delozier's health has fluctuated wildly over the last decade.
After numerous exerimental drug therapies failed, he was put on
salvage therapy, a medication regimen for patients who have
exhausted all other theraputic options. While his viral count _ a
measure of AIDS virus presense in the blood _ was once as high as
750,000 viral copies per deciliter, it has dropped to a less
ominous level of 6,000. But in a March 1999 report, his physician,
Dr. Kenneth Gold, stated he would eventually fail his drug regimen,
adding that he continued to be plagued with severe diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, though my counts on paper look good, I feel much
worse than I did four years ago,'' Delozier said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University would not comment on the specifics of the
case, citing Delozier's privacy. In its letter to Delozier, Harvard
repeatedly quoted doctors' notes reporting that Delozier was
feeling ``fine.'' The letter stated that ``mental health
ramifications'' were a large part of the reason for his disability.
Delozier was hospitalized in the 1990s for alcholism.
</P>
<P>
   But Delozier said ``fine'' was a relative concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell Dr. Gold, I feel fine, I mean I'm fine considering
I have AIDS,'' Delozier said. ``I'm taking lots of medicines with
evil side-effects.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gold said he was confident Harvard would reconsider its
decision during the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, he looks like one of those people with AIDS who is
doing fine,'' Gold said. ``But if you take a look at the whole
picture... just take one look at Richard and you can see that he's
a pretty sick guy.''

 &HT;    NBC pre-empts Fox, rehires Albert for NBA
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marv Albert's comeback has come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, NBC announced that Albert has rejoined the network.
Athough he will not get his old job as the lead NBA play-by-play
announcer, Albert will work regional and playoff NBA telecasts for
NBC, along with boxing at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and hockey at
the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walking back into the building was a wonderful feeling,
although the security guard did stop me,'' said Albert, who signed
a multiyear deal. ``It's hard to make a judgment on the word
'redemption.' It's better to look ahead than to look back, and
everything has gone in the right direction in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert, who spent 20 years with NBC, was fired by the network
after he was convicted of misdemeanor assault in 1997. He pleaded
guilty to charges of biting a woman during a sexual encounter in a
Virginia hotel room. He was out of broadcasting until New York's
Madison Square Garden Network re-hired him in 1998. Albert then
branched out to national cable when Turner added him to its NBA
roster.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports and Olympics chairman Dick Ebersol thanked Turner and
MSG for their roles in Albert's comeback and for giving their
permission to sign him. But Ebersol also said that Albert's
negotiations with Fox, which wanted him for the NFL, actually set
the wheels in motion three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading in the papers about the talks going on with Fox,
and that said to me the time had come to move, or the oportunity to
get Marv back would be three or four years away,'' Ebersol said.
``We did what we had to do (in 1997), but Marv has been a great
friend for a long time''
</P>
<P>
   Albert, whose duties with MSG and Turner remain the same, said
he was enticed by doing the NFL on Fox, but the lure of the NBA,
the Olympics and ultimately returning to NBC was too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick and most people at NBC have been very supportive, and I
understand what had to be done,'' Albert said. ``But I didn't take
the attitude they did this to me. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said Albert's NBA partner has not been
determined.Prentis Rogers writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

BUSH MOVES TOWARD THE CENTER ON IMMIGRATION AND QUOTAS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ George W. Bush plunged into the most populous
state Tuesday for the first time as a presidential candidate and
immediately cast himself as more temperate than most Republican
leaders here and in Washington on two emotionally charged ballot
measures that have roiled his party: immigration and affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   Bush distanced himself from a proposition that passed in this
state in 1994 that prohibits public services to illegal immigrants.
And he refused to endorse a proposition approved by this state's
voters in 1996 that outlawed affirmative action in the state for
hiring, employment, the education system and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by the Texas governor marked a striking departure
for a Republican presidential candidate because both measures were
championed by the last Republican who was elected governor of
California, Pete Wilson. Bush's stand is also at odds with the
dominant position of the congressional wing of the Republican
Party. And it differs from the position of most of Bush's rivals
for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   His comments in response to questions from reporters were the
most vivid demonstration thus far of how Bush is so confident of
his support that he has embarked on a general election strategy to
attract as broad a swath of voters as possible. With his more
moderate positions on affirmative action and immigration, Bush is
seeking to appeal to minorities and independent voters in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments are all the more notable because he is setting
the tone for the Republican competition. He is swamping his
opponents in the polls here and nationwide and on this trip he has
been showered with donations and greeted by packed gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have had a 187 in my state,'' Bush said of
Proposition 187, the initiative on immigration that curtailed the
rights of illegal immigrants to public services like schools.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a stop here whether he would have supported the
measure, Bush sidestepped the question but made his qualms clear:
``I said when it first came out I was against the spirit of 187 for
my state. I felt like every child ought to be educated regardless
of the status of his parents. I don't know what's happened in
California, but I do know that quotas won't work when it comes to
certain social obligations such as encouraging capitalism to be
spread all around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also sounded a moderate tone in refusing to stand behind
the measure on affirmative action, Proposition 209. ``I support the
spirit of no quotas, no preferences,'' he said, ``but what's
important to say is not what you're against _ what you're for. I'm
for increasing the pool of applicants and opening the door so that
more people are eligible to go to the university systems.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first of three days of appearances up and down this state
_ the king of electoral votes with 54 _ Bush acted like he was
already running a general election: He made no mention of his
Republican rivals. He played up his success in Texas at appealing
to Hispanic voters. And he cast himself as an inclusive candidate
who would not be tugged to the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that one of Bush's stops Tuesday was at the
Plaza de Mexico, a Latino area at the Del Mar Fair near here. He
worked his way through hundreds of people, many of who greeted him
with ``Viva Bush'' chants. Pointedly, Bush delivered some of his
remarks in Spanish, in which he is fluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to win California in a general election,'' Bush
repeated again and again to the Republican faithful. ``I intend to
become the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name one Republican who was a threat to Bush in
California, state Sen. Jim Brulte, a Bush supporter, was stumped.
``Expectations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's play-to-November strategy may not be risky in the primary
here because it may draw moderate Republicans, many of whom
defected and helped elect a Democrat, Gray Davis, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides putting forth more moderate positions, Bush made a play
for the Hollywood elite, who are traditionally more supportive of
Democrats and have been courted assiduously by Vice President Al
Gore. Terry Semel, the chairman of Warner Brothers and a prominent
supporter of Democrats, Tuesday held a reception for Bush at his
home in exclusive Bel Air.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to entertainment executives who believe that President
Clinton and Gore unfairly fault Hollywood for violence, Bush said:
``All of us need to work together to change the culture. One
industry alone does not bear all the brunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will again delve into Gore's territory on Thursday, when
his campaign holds fund-raising events in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bush vowed, this is only the beginning. Pledging to
concentrate his energies in this battleground state, Bush has told
supporters that he has the luxury to focus here because he is well
positioned in two other states with huge electoral prizes: In Texas
he is the favorite son and in Florida his brother, Jeb, is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At event after event in California, Bush was welcomed by
ebullient crowds _ as well as by expectations among many
Republicans that he can rescue their party in this state from
turmoil. No Republican has won California in a general election
since Bush's father, George Bush, won in 1988. And with the
election last year of Davis, Republicans lost control of the
governorship for the first time since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   George Gorton, who was a longtime top aide to Wilson but is
neutral in the presidential race, marveled at the outpouring for
Bush at a breakfast here Tuesday morning. ``This is the closest
thing to a legitimate draft I've ever seen in my life,'' Gorton
said. ``There are people here who are both from the right and from
the left of the party _ people you don't see in the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast Tuesday morning in San Diego, Gerald L. Parsky,
chairman of the Bush campaign in California, declared in his
introduction, ``Never again will you have speculation about how
aggressively Republicans should fight in California.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In random interviews at Bush's events Tuesday, many Republican
said they were not troubled by the governor's distancing himself
from the immigration and affirmative action measures that were
supported by most Republicans in California.
</P>
<P>
   John Hensley, a lawyer from Irvine, said he disagreed with Bush
on the two ballot initiatives but still expected to support him.
``It's nice to see a guy with a family and a proven track record,''
he said. ``That forgives a lot of sins. He's a good guy too, which
has a lot to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials in the state said they believed Bush
was most vulnerable for his stand against abortion and his refusal
to press for stronger gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is out of step with most Americans on gun safety, and he
is out of step with California,'' Roy Romer, the general chairman
of the Democratic Party, said in Washington on Tuesday.

CANADA-CUBA TIES, ONCE WARM, CHILL OVER HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The cozy relationship between Canada and Cuba that has
so infuriated U.S. presidents and congressional leaders has sunk to
its lowest point in years, principally because of Cuba's continuing
record of violating basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the recent conviction of several dissidents on whose
behalf Prime Minister Jean Chretien had personally intervened,
Canada is blocking all new assistance programs to Cuba that do not
clearly further the protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials have also decided not to encourage other
countries in the hemisphere to support Cuba's admission into the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Canada's Foreign Ministry say the new approach is
not a break with Cuba _ as some U.S. politicians had hoped it would
be _ but rather the refinement of a long-standing policy that
continues to have as its goal Cuba's transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still engaged with them, but we have to put some
northern ice in the middle of it,'' Chretien told reporters in
Ottawa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But some political analysts see the cooling of Canada-Cuba
relations as the inevitable result of dealing with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chretien is learning what Khrushchev knew before,'' said Larry
Birns, director of the Council for Hemispheric Affairs in
Washington. ``You can supply billions in foreign aid, as the
Russians did, and still have minimal leverage. Ultimately, Castro
is a nationalist, and he decides what he thinks is best for Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chretien visited Cuba in 1998, he presented a list of four
political prisoners whom he wanted Castro to release. But in March
the four were convicted of ``counterrevolutionary activities'' and
sentenced to up to five years in jail. Canada-Cuba relations then
sank to their lowest point since foreign aid was suspended in the
mid 1980s because of Cuba's military involvement in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy ordered a review of Canada's
contacts with Cuba and the policy of constructive engagement that
has been the basis of Canada's approach throughout the period that
Cuba has been ruled by Castro's Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States imposed an economic embargo on Cuba,
Canada moved in the opposite direction, believing that the best way
to bring about real democratic reform in the country was to
maintain strong ties. Canada also believed that it could use its
influence to prod Cuba into doing more to protect human rights of
its citizens, particularly political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   After the policy review was completed in April, Canada decided
to continue trading with and doing business in Cuba, which came to
$555 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the serious flaws in Cuba's human rights record,
Canada's Foreign Ministry believed that a tougher approach was
needed, at least until Cuba responded positively to Canadian
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy had demanded that all cabinet ministers with programs
in Cuba clear any official visits through him, and he has decided
that for now, planning for all visits should be suspended. That
meant the indefinite postponement of trips by the international
trade minister, Sergio Marchi, and the minister of international
cooperation, Diane Marleau.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has given Cuba $24 million in foreign aid over the last
five years. Officials say the funds have not been frozen completely
but are subject to a case-by-case review. Several projects have
already been suspended, including a plan to provide financial
assistance to help Haiti cooperate in a medical development effort
with Cuba. The Canadians fear that Cuba may use the medical
research more for propaganda than humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has also backed away from a commitment to lobby for
Cuba's integration into the hemisphere, particularly through
participation in the Organization of American States, from which it
was expelled in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Canada will host the organization's general assembly next June.

 _ SF CHRON   Internet Mortgage, Credit Card Firms Trying to Cash In on Online 
 Success 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; OK, you joined the crowds online to trade stock. But are you ready
to take out a credit card or get a mortgage on the Internet?
<P>
   Karen Murphy and John Lee were. The Mountain View couple got a
loan from iOwn.com, a 3-year-old Web-based mortgage broker, to buy
a $310,000 house in North Berkeley, a purchase that closed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Their verdict? They say Web surfing got them a super rate: a
7.25 percent fixed-rate loan for $248,000 that converts to an
adjustable loan after five years, with 1 percent of the loan amount
rebated at the close of escrow.
</P>
<P>
   But the lender they found through iOwn, First Nationwide
Mortgage, peppered them with last-minute questions and demands,
causing them to miss the financing deadline in their purchase
contract. Fortunately, the seller agreed to give them more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty nerve-racking,'' said Lee, a 31-year-old
Microsoft marketing director, about his mortgage. ``I feel
confident I got the best possible rate, and iOwn has a great
dedication to customer service. But they're still working out the
kinks.''
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up the current state of online borrowing.
Internet-only companies such as iOwn and credit card purveyor
NextCard say the Web offers great prices, broad selection and
unbeatable convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can literally customize the terms for you,'' said NextCard
chief executive Jeremy Lent.
</P>
<P>
   And online mortgage companies offer rate-comparison software
that lets borrowers find the best loans available on the market
with the features they want.
</P>
<P>
   But electronic-commerce experts say the Web falls flat handling
complicated transactions in which human beings, not computers, make
the final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A mortgage is an example of a loan that has to be individually
underwritten for each customer. Those are tougher to complete
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit products go from simple to very complex,'' said Jay
Norman, a Chicago electronic-commerce specialist with the
consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``It's the less-complex
loans that best fit the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit card applications are simple because a few pieces of data
about employment, residence and income are all that's needed to
make a decision. NextCard says it grants approv

   HOUSTON _ Exterminator Francisco Bermea was on a recent call
when he noticed a sheriff's patrol car drive slowly by.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy had a wanted flier in her hands and was comparing
Bermea's face to the photo of accused serial killer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez. It's a photograph familiar to most people who
have picked up a newspaper or watched a TV news program during the
last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took off my glasses so the deputy could get a better look
and I said, `It's not me,''' said Bermea, a 35-year-old Mexican
native who lives in Houston but often drives his pest control truck
to outlying towns for work. ``She laughed and drove away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' said Bermea, who also is local coordinator of
the Association for Residency and Citizenship of America. ``They're
doing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, a Mexican national linked to at least eight
slayings in Illinois, Kentucky and Texas, is on the FBI's Ten Most
Wanted list. As the manhunt grows, some Hispanics are complaining
that any man ``who looks like a Mexican'' is considered a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Hispanics are stereotyped anyway,'' said Maria Jimenez,
local director of another immigrants' rights group, the American
Friends Service Committee. ``So with thousands of calls coming from
all over the country, law enforcement and others need to be
cautious while engaging in a search. They need to make sure they're
individualizing their search instead of generalizing a whole
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Garcia, coordinator in El Paso of the Immigration Law
Enforcement Project, said the phenomenon is most intense along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate is that the sheriff's deputies and Border Patrol
are stopping almost everyone if they look like a Mexican,'' Garcia
said. ``People are getting arrested for just walking on the
(railroad) tracks. It's getting out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia fears the search for Resendez-Ramirez could hurt Hispanic
immigrants in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on the border, it's almost normal to be detained,'' he
said. ``But we are worried that the government will use this for
political gains to make tougher immigration laws or argue again for
troops on the border.''
</P>
<P>
   A Marine Corp patrol, deployed during an anti-drug surveillance
operation in 1997, shot and killed an 18-year-old goat herder in
West Texas. The use of Marines on anti-drug operations along the
border was later suspended, and the troops were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and law enforcement officials say they are being
careful to protect the rights of innocent people. But they vow an
aggressive search, noting that the suspect is accused of
particularly vicious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Railroad Co. police are teaming up with the FBI,
the U.S. Border Patrol and other law enforcement agencies in the
search for Resendez-Ramirez. The victims were all killed in homes
near railroad tracks, and the suspect is believed to travel the
country by hopping on and off freight trains. Most of the victims
were bludgeoned to death, and most of the women were sexually
assaulted. Fingerprints and other physical evidence point to
Resendez-Ramirez, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific police are inspecting trains and yards along
routes in 23 states, looking for people who illegally ride the
rails. They are stopping trains whenever they get a tip, said
company spokesman John Bromley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stop an average of 10 to 12 trains a day,'' Bromley said
from Union Pacific's Omaha, Neb., headquarters. ``We have had 14
such incidents in the last 24 hours on reports of trespassers on
the yard or rail.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, agents walk alongside the trains with dogs
sniffing each car. If a dog signals that something is wrong, the
agents will open a car and search it.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific police removed about 97,000 trespassers from rail
property last year, Bromley said. Half of those were illegal
immigrants, he said, mostly Hispanic males.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a zero tolerance for trespassers even before this
search,'' he said. ``But before, we would just order them to leave
the property. Now we're taking more time to identify them.''
</P>
<P>
   Railroad police for Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. also are working with the Border Patrol to search
trains. Spokesman Richard Russack said the FBI has requested that
company to remain on the lookout for the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss said there were no new
developments in the case, adding that the multi-agency task force
searching for Resendez-Ramirez continues to follow up on some of
the many leads it receives each day.

MARKET PLACE: BY ANY OTHER NAME, COULD CHINA.COM BE SO CONFIDENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In the helium-filled world of Internet investing, a
lot can ride on a new company's name. When that name is China.com,
you might reasonably assume its stock would float on gossamer
wings.
</P>
<P>
   After all, China.com Corp. combines two of the decade's hottest
investment concepts _ China and the Internet _ in a single stock
offering. While both have lost a bit of their luster among
investors in recent weeks, China.com seems convinced that putting
them together will prove irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Hong Kong, plans to raise $56.3 million
through an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock market in
two weeks. It began its road show for investors, at a lavish lunch
in Hong Kong on Tuesday, with a familiar mixture of intoxicating
predictions and fuzzy details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have presented one of the most exciting
investment opportunities in Asia,'' said Peter Yip, the vice
chairman and chief executive of China.com. ``No other company has
our integrated approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Yip noted that the number of Internet users in China was
projected to rise from 2.4 million in 1998 to 16.1 million in 2003,
a compound annual growth rate of 46 percent. As the first public
company to tap that vast market, Yip believes, China.com will be
one of the cyberheavyweights of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tantalizing prospect _ one that lured America Online to
buy 10 percent of China.com for $25 million earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at China.com's investment bank, Lehman Brothers, said
the offering was already oversubscribed. And analysts predicted
that China.com would take off like a rocket after the shares begin
trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has a great name,'' said Kaushik Shridharani, a
media analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. ``That will
drive investor enthusiasm for the stock, because most investors
don't delve into the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The details in China.com's case are eye-opening. Despite its
all-encompassing name, China.com does most of its business in Hong
Kong, where it operates an Internet portal service called
hongkong.com, an Internet advertising service and a Web design and
consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   China.com's Hong Kong portal _ and a similar one on Taiwan _
offer a menu of services, from English- and Chinese-language news
and information to e-mail, search engines and message boards.
</P>
<P>
   The company does operate a portal called china.com, which is
aimed at users in mainland China, but technology executives said it
generated little traffic. In a recent ranking of Web sites
conducted by the Chinese government, it placed 17th, behind
destinations like Sinanet and Sohu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the PR they've created, they really should be
generating more traffic,'' said Hanson Cheah, the executive
director of Asia Tech Ventures, a venture capital firm here that
specializes in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Farrall, an expert on the Internet in China who runs a
consulting firm in New York, said: ``China.com has never been a
factor in the Internet business in China. It doesn't register on
the radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   China.com said Tuesday that it had 400,000 registered users of
its three main portals. The company said it recorded 1 million
``page views'' a day, and would double that by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, China.com chief operating officer Peter
Hamilton acknowledged that the number of users ``doesn't satisfy
our internal objectives.'' But he added, ``We're satisfied with the
growth rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said the company's critics were placing too much
emphasis on its relatively low traffic. He said the company could
expand its reach through its regional advertising service, 24/7,
which places ads on Web sites in 11 Asian and Pacific Rim
countries, from Japan to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build a business based solely on China, you're going to
have a long and hungry wait for ad revenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most fledgling Internet companies, China.com has never made
money. In 1998, it reported losses of $11 million on revenue of
$3.4 million. More than three-quarters of its sales come from its
Web consulting business. And China.com said it would not turn a
profit until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its meager revenues, China.com has been able to attract
an impressive array of U.S. technology companies as partners. They
include Netscape Communications, Bay Networks, Sun Microsystems,
Pointcast, and most recently, America Online. But the critics note
that most of these partnerships have fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have any of China.com's ventures become real businesses?''
Cheah asked. ``As far as I can tell, none.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps China.com's most sensitive relationship is with Xinhua,
China's official news agency. Xinhua is one of the original
investors and still owns a 13.6 percent stake. In addition to
supplying China.com with mainland news, Xinhua edits news from
Reuters and Agence France-Presse that is distributed on the
company's Chinese site _ deleting references to Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Yip said it was an honor to work with Xinhua, adding, ``As we
all know, the Internet business in China is highly regulated.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the questions about its business, China.com has a couple
of probable advantages.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first China-focused Internet company to go public, and
it is doing so at a time when analysts say investors in the United
States are becoming jaded by the constant stream of Silicon Valley
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is entering the market at a time when other
high-profile Chinese companies are stepping out. China National
Petroleum Corp., the country's biggest oil company, and China
Unicom, a rival to the dominant China Telecom , are both planning
major share offerings.
</P>
<P>
   With potential investors overflowing a hotel ballroom in Hong
Kong, the buzz surrounding China.com was unmistakable. Shridharani
said such interest was bound to result in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that expectations are shaped by what's going on
in the States, investors are going to be disappointed,'' he said.
``This company is going to grow fast, but not on a scale that will
excite investors.''

INSURERS REEVALUATING SUCCESSFUL AIDS-DRUG PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ At 8:48 a.m. the surveillance camera started
rolling. It filmed Robin Lambert as he crossed the street, his dog,
Harley, in tow. It recorded him leaving the Cumberland Farms,
reading his newspaper as Harley did his business in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator tailing Lambert in February had been hired by
his disability insurer MetLife. The company had shelled out $48,000
a year in disability payments since 1996 when Lambert left his job
with AIDS. Now, with his health stabilized by new protease
inhibitor drugs, MetLife was preparing to cut him loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I would be dead by now,'' said Lambert who was
notified in March that his insurance had been terminated. ``As we
live longer, (the insurance companies) are being more aggressive in
trying to take away our benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago AIDS was an almost certain death sentence. Now,
as new medications extend their lives, AIDS patients are
increasingly coming in conflict with their disability insurance
carriers. These companies, sometimes using surveillance, are
scrutizing AIDS patients claims with the same rigor they apply to
sufferers of other chronic ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the case that we do pay more ongoing attention to
people who are out on disability with AIDS'' than in the past, said
Catherine Harnett, a spokeswoman for UNUM Life Insurance Company of
America, a Portland, Maine-based disability provider. ``We do so
simply because we have discovered that people who are responding
favorably to treatment are able to go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   A Metlife spokesman said the company applied the same ``case
management procedures'' to all people with disabilities. He said as
a company Metlife is ``not taking a harder look per se at people
with AIDS who are on disability.'' He would not comment on the
specifics of Lambert's case, but said surveillance was only used
after a medical authority stated that a claimant could go back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   For AIDS patients, battles with insurers are nothing new. In
earlier stages of the epidemic, insurers fought not to cover health
or life insurance for those with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   While the success of the drug regimens now raises the prospect
of extended periods of insured disability, it also provides
insurers with a reason to stop costly disability benefits. But AIDS
activists and doctors who treat patients with AIDS accuse the
insurance companies of being overzealous. They say stories in the
media have given a false impression that the new drug therapies are
cure-alls.
</P>
<P>
   While many people on the new protease-inhibitor drugs do live
full and productive lives, other recoveries are short-lived. And
many experience severe side-effects caused by their medications
_diarrhea, chronic fatigue, and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing private disability insurers taking extremely
aggressive and unreasonable positions when terminating people with
AIDS from benefits,'' said Benjamin Klein of the Boston based group
Gay &AMP; Lesbian Advocates &AMP; Defenders, who represented Lambert in his
case against MetLife.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert argued he still suffers from debilitating fatigue, while
the insurer claimed that its investigation showed he could work
professionally: the videotape had shown him visiting the Portland
restaurant he had bought. Klein said his client rarely spent more
than an hour or two at the restaurant and questioned whether he
could ever return to his former position in the human-resources
department of a coporation.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife eventually restored Lambert's disability payments after
negotiations with Klein. But Klein said many AIDS sufferers in
similar straits aren't able to wage a legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These insurance companies understand that most people are not
going to be able to find a lawyer to challenge them,'' Klein said.
``So they have an economic incentive to be aggressive rather than
cautious in terminating benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome Groopman, an AIDS specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess
Hospital, said most of his AIDS patients on disability are eager to
re-enter the workforce. But he said they faced the very real
possibility that their AIDS might flare up again, leaving them with
less of a safety net than they'd previously had. ``Most insurance
companies are loath to take these kinds of people,'' Groopman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Delozier, an AIDS patient who is covered by Harvard
University's total disability plan, was told in May that the
university intended to terminate his coverage. He'd been on
disability since 1995 when he left his job as director of fiscal
services at the Harvard School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just losing the whole system of support that I've taken
for granted,'' Delozier, 51, said.``Everything was in place for me
to live in genteel poverty and die a dignified death. Now, I don't
know what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Delozier's health has fluctuated wildly over the last decade.
After numerous exerimental drug therapies failed, he was put on
salvage therapy, a medication regimen for patients who have
exhausted all other theraputic options. While his viral count _ a
measure of AIDS virus presense in the blood _ was once as high as
750,000 viral copies per deciliter, it has dropped to a less
ominous level of 6,000. But in a March 1999 report, his physician,
Dr. Kenneth Gold, stated he would eventually fail his drug regimen,
adding that he continued to be plagued with severe diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, though my counts on paper look good, I feel much
worse than I did four years ago,'' Delozier said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University would not comment on the specifics of the
case, citing Delozier's privacy. In its letter to Delozier, Harvard
repeatedly quoted doctors' notes reporting that Delozier was
feeling ``fine.'' The letter stated that ``mental health
ramifications'' were a large part of the reason for his disability.
Delozier was hospitalized in the 1990s for alcholism.
</P>
<P>
   But Delozier said ``fine'' was a relative concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell Dr. Gold, I feel fine, I mean I'm fine considering
I have AIDS,'' Delozier said. ``I'm taking lots of medicines with
evil side-effects.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gold said he was confident Harvard would reconsider its
decision during the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, he looks like one of those people with AIDS who is
doing fine,'' Gold said. ``But if you take a look at the whole
picture... just take one look at Richard and you can see that he's
a pretty sick guy.''

POLICE SEE EARLY LINK BETWEEN SUSPECTS IN TREASURY THEFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Less than a year after he was promoted to deputy
Treasurer, Robert Foley approached the manager of the state's
Unpaid Check Fund with a scheme to loot millions of dollars from
the fund, according to a State Police affidavit released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, conspiring with two businessmen and
their own wives, Foley and John F. Trischitta allegedly stole
nearly $10 million in checks intended for companies that were owed
money by the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit released in Boston Municipal Court,
Foley and Trischitta, both of whom were arrested in the theft last
February, were able to carry out what is alleged to be the largest
theft of state money in the Commonwealth's history without raising
the suspicions of supervisors and auditors inside the office of
State Treasurer Joseph Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Foley even cashed more than $179,000 in stolen checks at the
Treasurer's office, according to the affidavit, which was based for
the most part on the testimony of Trischitta, who is cooperating
with the investigation by Attorney General Thomas Reilly's office.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from the affidavit is an insider's portrait how
Trischitta, who started his state career as a driver for Treasurer
Robert Q. Crane, and Foley, an ambitious, political appointee of
Malone's who juggled private work on state time, were able to treat
the fund as their own personal bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta agreed to cooperate with investigators on the second
day he was questioned by Reilly's investigators about the missing
money. In exchange for Trischitta's cooperation, Reilly's office
has agreed to recommend that he be sentenced to no more than five
years and a day in state prison. Theft by a state employee from the
state's treasury, the statute under which Trischitta and Foley
would be charged, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Although the thefts from the state Treasury exploded into public
view in mid-February with the arrest of Trischitta and then Foley,
the affidavit provides the first detailed description of how the
two men allegedly hatched their scheme, pulled off the series of
the thefts and then worked to cover them up.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit discloses for the first time that the two men
worked together and involved their wives in the scheme. To split up
some of the stolen money with an heir finder who was part of the
alleged scheme, Trischitta's wife and Foley's now-former wife, were
falsely listed as working for the heir finder's firm and issued
payroll checks to cover their husbands' share of the take.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if Reilly's office -- which had no comment on
Tuesday's release of the affidavit -- is considering prosecuting
the two women.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Trischitta had no past criminal record and that he
was cooperating in the investigation, Judith Lindahl, Trischitta's
lawyer, said that Reilly's recommended sentence was not lenient.
Gary L. Meyers, Foley's lawyer, had no comment on the allegations
in the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   No charges are currently pending against either Foley or
Trischitta or two heir finders, Martin Robbins of Danvers and
Thomas Ciliberto, of Warwick, R.I., who have been implicated in the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   All four were charged in Boston Municipal Court in February and
March with various counts of theft and bribery brought by Reilly's
office. However, Reilly last month asked that the charges be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that his investigators had found a woeful lack of
documents in the Unpaid Check Fund to build a paper trail, Reilly
said more time was needed to unravel the complicated dealings and
determine if more money had been stolen and if others were
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly recently told reporters that he is confident that the
Suffolk County grand jury, which is taking testimony in the case,
will return indictments. The affidavit provides some basis for
Reilly's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, Trischitta told investigators that
he and Foley devised the scheme to plunder the Unpaid Check Fund in
late 1992 or early 1993 shortly after Foley was promoted as Deputy
Treasurer, overseeing cash management for the entire state
Treasury. The fund contained millions of dollars in checks issued
by the state to private firms that for a variety of reasons were
never received or went uncashed.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta said that Foley first proposed that Trischitta leave
his position as the fund's manager and open up an heir finder's
firm, which would notify companies of the unclaimed checks and --
for a healthy fee -- work to get the money to them. However,
Trischitta said he turned down Foley's offer because he didn't want
to lose the health insurance and pension benefits that came with
his state job.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Trischitta said, Foley came to him with
another offer. He wanted him to approve a claim -- which Foley
acknowledged was phony -- to issue a series of checks amounting to
$1.6 million to DeMatteo Construction Co. of Braintree.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Trischitta said Foley told him the money would be split
up, with each of them getting $200,000 and ``connected people''
getting the lion's share of the money, $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the phony claim, Foley told Trischitta, ``We take
this to our grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the fund was filled with a hundreds of checks, most
amounting to less than a thousand dollars, Trischitta said Foley
told him not to put any checks for more than $5,000 on the lists
given to heir finders.
</P>
<P>
   Those larger checks were provided solely to Ciliberto, a close
friend of Foley's partner in an accounting firm, who operated an
heir finder business between 1993-1997, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta said he routinely approved the claims filed with
Ciliberto's firm, The Reinke Group, and in return he and Foley
recived 50 percent of the profits. To cover up their involvement in
the scheme, Trischitta's wife and Foley's wife were listed as
employees of Reinke.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 alone, Trischitta said, his wife received about $79,000
in checks from Reinke. In the following years, he estimated she
received about $50,000 a year.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Infuriating many Democrats, the White House on
Tuesday reached a basic agreement with Republicans in Congress on
legislation to limit lawsuits arising from Year 2000 computer
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said that all the main points had been
settled and that they hoped Congress would clear the measure for
the president's signature this week. The White House agreed that
only technical language remained to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, aggressively promoted by business interests and
the computer industry and opposed by trial lawyers and consumer
groups, generally follows the lines of the bill approved by the
Senate two weeks ago. Most Democrats voted against that bill, and
President Clinton promised at the time to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said some relatively minor changes
enabled the president to approve the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As described by lawmakers from both parties, it would set a
ceiling on punitive damages against small companies, give all
companies a grace period to fix breakdowns before they could be
sued, sharply limit class-action suits involving many plaintiffs
and protect wealthy companies against being held responsible for
computer failures caused by poorer ones.
</P>
<P>
   Many angry Democrats in the Senate and House said the White
House had encouraged them to cast a politically risky vote for the
bill and then sold them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a closed-door deal that will hurt consumers,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``Maybe we can dare hope that this will
be the last case of triangulation of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Triangulation'' is a term coined by Dick Morris, President
Clinton's former political adviser, to mean that the president
should not stand with Democrats or Republicans but at points above
or between them. Democrats use it nowadays to express their
irritation when Clinton does not follow the party line.
</P>
<P>
   What is called the Y2K problem results from the longtime
reliance of computer programs on only the last two digits of a
year. When confronted by 00, some computers, software and
electronically controlled machinery that have not been updated
might misinterpret it as 1900 rather than 2000, substitute another
year or simply freeze.
</P>
<P>
   These are the main aspects of the legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies with fewer than 50 employees could not be assessed
more than $250,000 in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   _ All companies would be given 90 days to fix a problem from the
time they were notified before they could be sued.
</P>
<P>
   _ No more than 100 plaintiffs could be involved in a
class-action suit, and no more than $10 million in damages could be
sought.
</P>
<P>
   _ Class-action suits would be diverted from state courts to
federal courts, making them more expensive and burdensome for
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ All companies responsible for a computer failure would share
the legal liability, and large, wealthy companies could not be
forced to pay damages beyond their proportional responsibility in
cases in which less affluent or bankrupt businesses are also at
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The central purpose of the measure is to prevent frivolous
lawsuits. But critics said there were insufficient protections for
consumers who suffered financial loss because of computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said President Clinton's main interest
was that the measure was confined to Year 2000 computer problems
and did not involve general tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the spokesman said small changes involving class
action suits and the proportional liability provisions convinced
the president that the bill was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was instrumental in working out
the deal. Insurance companies in Connecticut are especially
interested in limiting lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Business interests were gleeful. Thomas Donohue, president of
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which made the legislation its top
lobbying priority of the year, called it ``a watershed achievement
for business and the American economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said ``a potential global technology crisis'' had
been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But groups representing consumers were critical. When computer
problems develop, ``the public is going to be very angry, and small
businesses are going to be the most affected,'' said Joan
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the work on the bill all year has been the desire
of both parties to win the political and financial support of
wealthy individuals and companies in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican strategist in Congress said his party was not
willing to give much in the negotiations because the president was
over a barrel. If he vetoed the bill, it would have hurt Vice
President Al Gore specifically and Democrats generally in their
quest for support in Silicon Valley. By accepting the agreement, in
this view, the president gave Republicans what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic strategist added another element. He said Vice
President Gore, as he begins his campaign for the presidency, was
eager to rid himself of the taint of financial support from trial
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between trial lawyers, who are among Democrats'
biggest campaign contributors, and business interests, which are
the Republicans' biggest donors, has been a thread running through
legislative battles for the last several years. Among other issues,
it has arisen on product liability legislation, antismoking
measures and bills to regulate managed-care health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic strategist said that for Gore, the money from the
trial lawyers was probably not worth the criticism he faced for
taking funds from an unpopular source. But that may not be the
case, the strategist said, for Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a careful statement Tuesday, Mark Mandell, president of the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, said, ``It is positive
that this unique response to a unique situation will be law for
only three years and that the legal rights of anyone who suffers a
physical injury are preserved.''

MICHAEL HOOKER, PRESIDENT OF UMASS, 1992-95; AT 53 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn.: N.C.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Michael Hooker, who set a bold vision for reform as
president of the University of Massachusetts but left the task
early to head his beloved alma mater, the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill, died Tuesday. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a rising star from his earliest days _ the first in
his family to go to college, a college president at age 37 _ Hooker
was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in January.
</P>
<P>
   He took a two-month leave from his job as chancellor at Chapel
Hill this spring to undergo experimental treatment at the National
Institutes of Health. He had returned, working from home, earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   He chaired, by conference call, a meeting of his cabinet Monday
morning, and worked into the evening, before being admitted to the
University Hospital, where he died just before 2 a.m. Tuesday from
complications related to the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In three years as chancellor of the nation's oldest public
university, Hooker had become both an agent of change and a beloved
figure _ one friend recalled Chapel Hill students hoisting him up
and passing him through the crowds at a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just radiated personal energy and intellectual energy, he
drew people along in his wake,'' said Daniel Taylor, the former
head of the UMass trustees, who led the search committee that chose
Hooker unanimously as its president in 1992. ``He was a very
important figure in the history of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   In three years at UMass, Hooker was credited with securing more
state funding for the university and combining the five campuses
into one system. He set an ambitious five-year plan to make the
system ``world class'' by 2000, demanding that each campus compare
itself to its peers nationwide, and strive to meet higher
standards. Many of the things his plan called for _ eliminating
undersubscribed programs, raising admissions standards _ set the
foundation for the elevation of the university's reputation under
its new leader, former Senate President William M. Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Virginia coal miner, Hooker was raised from a young
age to appreciate the value of an education. His parents decided
early they would have only one child, so they could afford to make
him the family's first college graduate.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his doctorate at UMass-Amherst. As a teacher of
philosophy at Harvard in the mid-1970s, Hooker once said he used to
watch President Derek Bok and dream of becoming a college
president. He did so at 37, becoming president of Bennington
College just in time to rescue it from financial disaster. Two
years later, Esquire magazine featured him in a story on the ``Best
of the New Generation.'' Later, at the University of
Maryland-Baltimore County, Hooker was credited with bringing more
and better-qualified minority students on campus, and smoothing
racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker believed in, and spoke eloquently about, the need to
stress the original purpose of public, so-called Land Grant
universities, which the federal government created to make sure the
citizens of each state could not only be educated, but serve the
needs of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities have a reputation more deserved than we want to
admit for being self-righteously arrogant and disdainful of the
outside world,'' he told a Globe columnist in 1993, a year into his
term. ``But the world has changed. We have to wallow in the muck of
human problems without the luxury of standing aside and smugly
criticizing others for not solving problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulger said Tuesday, ``Michael Hooker recognized that the first
responsibility of a university is that of education, and the
community would be repaid for its investment through the service
performed by individuals in their subsequent lives and careers. He
served this community well and will be greatly missed by all of us
who knew him personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Professors and administrators criticized Hooker for leaving
UMass early, just three months after he announced his five-year
improvement plan, and three years into his term. He had promised to
stay 10 years. In a state where private colleges had long had a
lock on academic prestige, Hooker admitted it had been harder than
he realized to increase what he called ``public affection'' for
UMass. It would take Bulger, with well-developed social, business,
and political connections, to attract the money and support for the
public university.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, Hooker explained the move as a sort of
homecoming. As a child, his parents had taken him on tours of
campuses, with UNC one of their earliest stops.
</P>
<P>
   He adopted as the motto for the system, ``For the People,'' and
toured all of North Carolina's 100 counties to remind citizens of
the contributions UNC made to the community, emphasizing that what
had become known as an elitist university really did belong to the
taxpayers who fund it.
</P>
<P>
   An early believer of the importance of technology in higher
education, Hooker developed a program, partly funded by private
companies, that will ensure that each freshman has a laptop
computer by this fall. Nationally, he served on several panels on
technology in education, as well as one to enlist college students
in the effort to get elementary school students reading by third
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years from now, when we look back, what will be routine for
everybody, he thought of five years ago,'' said Mary Anne Marsh, a
Democratic political consultant in Massachusetts, who worked with
Hooker here and in North Carolina. ``He was light years ahead of
his time, and he died long before his time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Hooker brought a remarkable level of energy and a
compelling vision to this campus over the past four years,'' said
UNC-Chapel Hill Provost Dick Richardson. ``Chapel Hill has been
forever changed by the agenda that Michael placed before all of us.
He was a wonderful harbinger of the new millennium. We will all be
challenged by what he wanted this place, which he loved so much, to
become.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker met Carmen Buell, a state legislator from Greenfield, at
a UMass basketball game in 1993, and married her in 1995 with a
reception at the Mullins Center at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, of Chapel Hill; his daughter, Alexandra
Hooker, of Baltimore; his mother, Christine Hooker, of Roanoke,
Va.; and his wife's daughters, Jennifer and Cyndi Buell, both of
Charlotte.

HORMEL SWORN IN AS NATION'S FIRST OPENLY GAY AMBASSADOR

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ San Francisco gay rights advocate James C. Hormel
was sworn in Tuesday as U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who told more than 300 wellwishers,
``This is one of those glorious days when the nice guy finishes
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Hormel's installation was intended to send a
message that ``neither race nor creed nor sexual orientation is
relevant to the selection of an ambassador to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Hormel ``never lost his sense of humor, dignity and
graciousness'' while he was under attack by Senate conservatives
who blocked his nomination for 18 months because he is gay. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. _ who compared homosexuality
with alcoholism, kleptomania and sex addiction _ refused to bring
the matter up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, President Clinton on June 4 announced he was giving
Hormel a recess appointment while Congress was not in session.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, 66, who became America's first openly gay ambassador, is
an heir to the Hormel meatpacking fortune and is a former dean of
the University of Chicago Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Tanned and wearing a navy suit, red tie and white shirt, Hormel
took the oath of office on his father's Bible, swearing he would
``support and defend the Constitution of the United States against
all enemies foreign and domestic.'' The Bible was held by his
partner, Timothy Wu, 36, a San Francisco fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was held on a platform in the State Department's
main reception room, which has eight large crystal chandeliers and
tall gilded columns.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two minutes of applause, Hormel praised
President Clinton for appointing him. He also thanked his five
children, who stood to one side of the stage, and Wu, who will
become a White House fellow this fall. Hormel said of Wu, ``His
wisdom and resilience enabled both of us to endure

become a White House fellow this fall. Hormel said of Wu, ``His
wisdom and resilience enabled both of us to endure this challenging
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The new envoy added that thousands of letters of support had
encouraged him to ``stay the course.'' His favorite, he said, came
from a 93-year-old grandmother who said she had prayed she would
live long enough to see him sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker was Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a longtime
friend of Hormel. She said, ``Somewhere along the line we have to
stand up for what we believe is right. This one was right.'' She
then kissed Hormel on both cheeks and blinked back a tear.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who also spoke, said, ``Bigotry
based on sexual orientation is wrong anywhere, anytime and any
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Hormel shook hands and chatted with hundreds of his
supporters in a receiving line. He said he plans to leave for
Luxembourg within a month. Wu, who stood with Hormel, said he and
Hormel ``always had faith that this was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Hormel ``a special person''
and added, ``He's been an ambassador all his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's former wife, Alice Turner, who also attended the
ceremony, said the whole family had felt ``under attack.'' She said
the experience ``has been very powerful'' for their five children.
``They've been there for him. This has been a family cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's daughter, Sarah Hormel of Charlottesville, Va., said it
has been ``kind of hard knowing that there are 10 websites''
attacking her father for his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``My father deserves this more than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another guest, San Francisco Treasurer Susan Leal said the
Senate had put Hormel ``through hell.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno added that he hopes Hormel's
appointment will usher in a new chapter of tolerance. ``The hateful
derision directed at Jim for 18 months was inexcusable,'' Leno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Baum, a San Francisco psychotherapist, said he thought
Hormel's appointment will help to dispel prejudices of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel was twice was named to U.S. delegations to the United
Nations before being nominated as ambassador to Luxembourg, a tiny
country with 425,000 people that is 97 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The job of ambassador to Luxembourg, a place unfamiliar to most
Americans, became famous briefly when it was held from 1949 to 1953
by a wealthy woman named Perle Mesta. Her adventures as the
``hostess with the mostest'' became the basis for ``Call Me
Madam,'' an Irving Berlin Broadway musical starring Ethel Merman.
</P>
<P>
   About a half dozen protesters appeared at the main entrance of
the State Department as Hormel was being sworn in. They displayed
copies of what they said was pedophilia and pornography from a wing
of San Francisco's main public library that Hormel supported with a
$500,000 gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unfit to be ambassador,'' said Andrea Sheldon, executive
director of the Traditional Values Coalition, a Christian group, in
an interview. ``He has been the major financier of the homosexual
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His library may be the community standard in San Francisco,
but he does not represent the values and beliefs of the American
people at large,'' Sheldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Wright, spokeswoman for Concerned Women for America, a
conservative religious advocacy group, said Clinton's appointment
of Hormel was ``an end run around the Constitution.'' Hormel, she
said, ``is seen as a leader of a group that opposes laws and
viewpoints that support traditional families and morals.''

WORLD CONFERENCE SPLITS ON CURBING POPULATION GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With time running out, a 180-nation conference
struggling to repair a shattered consensus on limiting world
population growth was still divided Tuesday over issues ranging
from abortion and family planning to sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the conference is supposed to present an updated
action plan to a special session of the U.N. General Assembly. But
if the conference is still not ready, it may continue its
discussions in parallel with the General Assembly debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night a comparatively small group of conservative
Roman Catholic and Muslim developing countries, with strong support
from the Vatican, was blocking final agreement on several key
aspects of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago in Cairo, the countries meeting this week agreed
that the best way to curb population growth is not by setting
numerical targets and mounting birth-control campaigns. Instead,
they decided to try to improve the social status, education and
health of young women and men in the belief they will then limit
the size of their families.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Cairo strategy is designed to let the world's
population rise from some 6 billion at present to 9.8 billion by
2050 and thereafter hold it at around that level.
</P>
<P>
   But difficulties arose last March when the nations who had first
agreed upon the Cairo strategy met at the United Nations in New
York to draw up an action plan for completing it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives used this meeting to reopen key portions by
inserting language playing down family planning, restricting
abortion and asserting parental control over children's health and
sex education.
</P>
<P>
   While the composition of this group varies from issue to issue,
prominent members include Libya, Sudan, Morocco, Guatemala,
Nicaragua and Argentina as well as the Vatican.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Paying for the Cairo program is also problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Its cost was estimated at $17 billion in 2000 rising to $21.7
billion in 2015 with developing countries supposed to pay
two-thirds and industrial countries the remainder. Both groups are
well behind in their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   So far developing countries, which were expected to provide $
11.3 billion a year, have spent only $7.8 billion a year on
average, with most of this occurring in China, Brazil, Mexico and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Donors have done even worse, however. Their total contributions
are running at $1.9 billion a year, although at Cairo they pledged
to provide $5.7 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   After the April meeting failed to reach agreement the conference
was reconvened here last week. But Tuesday night it was still
divided on several important issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, conservatives dislike a call for governments to
provide young people with confidential advice on contraceptives and
reproductive health care, demanding greater parental oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the services are not confidential, young people won't use
them,'' said Ardrienne Germaine, president of the International
Women's Health Coalition, a New York-based women's group.
</P>
<P>
   Also unpopular with conservative groups is a Mexican proposal to
encourage sex education in school curricula in order to promote
``responsible sexual behavior'' and to protect adolescents from
``pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most nations in the world support the Cairo program,
the small conservative faction is able to exercise disproportionate
influence over the roughly 130 developing members of the United
Nations, because these countries try to vote as a bloc.
</P>
<P>
   And all members accept that an agreement that is primarily
intended to help the developing world reduce its growing population
will have little value if these countries do not formally endorse
it.
</P>
<P>
   By making improvements in the lives of young people the key to
population control, the Cairo strategy builds on the results of two
earlier major U.N. conferences.
</P>
<P>
   At their 1992 Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, U.N.
members agreed that economic development must be environmentally
sustainable, thus acknowledging that the world cannot support a
ceaselessly growing population.
</P>
<P>
   Then at their Vienna human rights summit meeting the following
year, these same nations agreed that women have special human
rights, including the right to education and freedom from all forms
of sexual violence and abuse.

   BRITAIN: NANNY'S PARENTS CHARGED
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Louise Woodward, the English nanny convicted of
manslaughter in the death of an infant in Boston in 1997, have been
charged by the police with theft from the trust fund set up to pay
for their daughter's defense. Sue Woodward, 42, and Gary Woodward,
43, who are separated, were charged with fraud. Their lawyer, Neil
Cobley, said they were accused of forging expense claims from their
time in the U.S. during the trial. ``The charges are vigorously
denied,'' he said.

   Pope John Paul II said he had a ``strong yearning'' to visit
holy sites in the Middle East next year, but he omitted the names
of cities, including Ur, in Iraq, Mount Sinai in Egypt, and
Nazareth, Bethlehem and Jerusalem, that were included in his
prepared text. The Vatican did not explain why the pope left out
specific places. But negotiations with Israeli officials over a

   The Interior Ministry acknowledged that it had illegally issued
``some 20 to 30'' gun licenses to TV stars and others who were
falsely identified as government officials. The ministry said it
had ordered the licenses retrieved, but refused to identify those
who received them or explain why they were given out. The
irregularities came under scrutiny with the recent gangland murder
of Francisco Stanley, an entertainer in whose clothing authorities
found an illegal gun license and a bag of cocaine.

   At least 18 Muslim villagers were murdered by gunmen in two

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After days of optimistic
pronouncements that a cease-fire was imminent in the Congo, a weary
South African delegate admitted Tuesday that ``Nobody knows how
long these talks will last.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's new foreign minister, Nkosazana Zuma, who
enthused at lunch that ``there is a bright light at the end of the
tunnel,'' later canceled her public schedule for Wednesday _ when
she was supposed to be in Cape Town _ and looked as if she would be
hanging out in Lusaka, Zambia's depressed and dusty capital, for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts from South Africa and the European Union
were unsurprised. Many had been pessimistic from the beginning of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   While the world has been willing to bomb Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic into submission and to lean heavily on India and
Pakistan to stop fighting, the pressure on the warring parties in
Congo is fraternal, and relatively weak. The United Nations would
like the fighting to end, and so would regional powers from Libya
to South Africa. But nations that might contribute peacekeepers _
including South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt _ cannot offer the
legions of trained men needed to police a country 200 times the
size of Kosovo, and the rest of the world is not volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the warring sides have little incentive to quit. While
each has failed at total victory _ for the rebels, ousting
President Laurent Kabila; for Kabila, driving them back out _ each
has nonetheless got the thing it most wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, surrogates for the Tutsi-led governments of Rwanda
and Uganda, have captured a huge buffer zone in which they are free
to hunt and kill the Hutu militias that raid Rwanda, Uganda and
Burundi. Kabila, despite losing a third of his empire, has
nonetheless kept control of the diamond and cobalt mines that are
reported to fill his offshore accounts in Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Eric Silwamba, chief of staff to Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba, entreated both sides to put aside their ``petty
political differences.'' But the issues they are said to disagree
on are actually fundamental. They amount to whether or not to admit
that the former Zaire is now two countries with two governments,
which now must make peace.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that, for decades, Congo has really been three
countries. A western one from the Atlantic coast to Kisangani, run
by the national capital, Kinshasa, its goods moving in and out by
barge on the Congo River. The eastern one, with Goma its chief
city, sees its goods move overland through Rwanda, Uganda and
Kenya. The southern one, with most of the mineral riches and
Lubumbashi as its main city, sees goods move south by rail and road
through Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is the jungle. Its roads are so neglected that
trucks often sink in the mud, and the ferries across its rivers are
often broken. For 30 years under the former dictator, Mobutu Sese
Seko, central government control was lax; taxation failed; soldiers
got their pay by looting.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is by air; communication by satellite phone. With war
stifling trade, it is lucky that the soil supports bananas and
cassava and the rivers teem with fish, or the interior would
starve.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels easily conquered the eastern third and for months,
have been eating slowly into the southern part, heading for the
diamond capital, Mbuji Mayi. However, they have recently split into
three factions, which could further subdivide the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's chief backers, Zimbabwe and Angola, have thrown blood
and treasure into saving his western capital and his southern
diamond fields. Zimbabwe's generals and its president, Robert
Mugabe, are said to own shares of the mines. Angola is fighting to
hurt its internal rebel movement, Unita, which has ties with Uganda
and bases in Congo. Both countries want to leave, but Kabila is a
stubborn, egotistical client who has stalked, willy-nilly, away
from earlier talks and is reported to have faked a bout of malaria
to delay joining these.
</P>
<P>
   A draft agreement is being debated, but reports from Lusaka, all
quoting anonymous sources, say it has many sticking points. It
envisions a cease-fire with all troops freezing in place. It
proposes integrating rebel units into the national army, starting
``a dialogue,'' overseen by outside powers, over the future
government of the Congo, and inviting in an international
peace-keeping force charged with disarming and arresting the Hutu
militias.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila is said to object to any political talks or integration
of the army units that question his rule or that put rebels on an
equal footing with him.
</P>
<P>
   His finance minister, Mawapanga Mwana Nanga, said Tuesday that
Kabila would sign a cease-fire only if it outlined a Ugandan and
Rwandan withdrawal. Of any talks on future government, he said,
``Everyone is free to come to Kinshasa and say what they want to
say, but it's an internal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the rebel leaders suspect they could be arrested and shot
if on arrival in Kinshasa and would see their fighting units
overrun if Uganda and Rwanda withdraw, they seem unlikely to accept
such conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe, which sent in 3,000 fresh troops on the eve of the
talks, is said to be suspicious of any peacekeeping force,
wondering whether it will be controlled by the United Nations or
the more tractable but disorganized Organization for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Richard Cornwell, an analyst at the Institute for
Security Studies in Pretoria, observed, disarming the Hutu
militias, who led the killing of more than 500,000 people in Rwanda
in 1994 and are now in the jungle, is hardly light work.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the United Nations and the European Union are
attending the talks, but seem content to sit and watch Chiluba
struggle, hoping for the best. A deal was supposed to be signed
last Sunday. Now the talk is about ``something by Saturday'' with
crucial elements to be worked out later.

 &HT;    Medical personnel say symptoms were real
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GHENT, Belgium _ Medical workers who treated adolescents who
touched off the Coca-Cola scare said Tuesday that they don't buy
the soft drink giant's explanation suggesting the illnesses may
have been emotionally induced.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were sick, medically sick,'' said Win Van
Voorsselaere, a licensed nurse who was on duty on June 14 when 30
teenagers were rushed by ambulances to St. Lucas Hospital here. The
teens said they were sick from drinking canned Coke products from a
vending machine at a nearby school.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted in part by this incident, the Belgian government banned
all Coke products the following day. Nearly 250 people reported the
beverages made them sick. The ban was lifted June 23, even though
scientists hadn't yet established a clear cause for the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Van Voorsselaere said the adolescents between the ages of 12 and
18 were suffering with vomiting, stomach pains and headaches. Some
reported slight fevers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight were sick enough to remain in the hospital overnight.
``They were presenting reliable symptoms of food intoxication,'' he
said. ``They ate or drank something that gave them those
symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood and urine tests proved negative, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A similar story was told by one of three physicians present June
8, when 39 students from a school 30 miles away arrived at the
emergency room at St. Joseph's Hospital in Bornam.
</P>
<P>
   Veronique Verdonck, an expert on gastroenteritis, said at least
15 of them were seriously ill and remained in the hospital
overnight. They also reported headaches, nausea, abdominal pain and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were objective symptoms we could see,'' Verdonck said.
``With so many symptoms, I can't imagine that this was hysteria or
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Paul Pendergrass responded by saying the
company believes that a bad smell and taste came from two sources:
faulty carbonated gas and a fungicide that was on wooden pallets
where cans of Coke were stacked.
</P>
<P>
   Experts hired by the company acknowledged that neither
contaminant was present in toxic levels, but they suggested that
the ``rotten egg'' smell and taste could have prompted the physical
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Verdonck dismissed Coke's explanation as inadequate. Instead,
she believes the soft drinks may have been tainted with something
else.
</P>
<P>
   The small bottles of Coke, which were sold at lunch time by St.
Mary Presentation School, smelled of ``petroleum or turpentine,''
said Verdonck, who tested them personally. ``It definitely didn't
smell like rotten eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pendergrass said such smells would be within the range of odors
the tainted Coke may have given off.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical tests have shown no such substances, but Verdonck
believes this could be because such compounds dissipate when
exposed to air.
</P>
<P>
   Unopened bottles are being tested at the University of Antwerp,
she said. The tests should be completed soon. Additionally, the
Belgian government is expecting an epidemiological report today
from the Louis Pasteur Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ann De Man, 14, one of the Bornam students, also described
experiencing a petroleum smell. Tuesday was her first day back at
school since she went to the hospital June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Kristof Fleurackers was also one of the four students who
returned to school for the final day of classes for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they still suffer fatigue and muscle pain two weeks
after the incident. Kristof, also 14 and normally active, fears his
symptoms will ruin summer camp. ``I hope I will make it to summer
camp, but even then I won't be able to take part in all of the
activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has offered to pay medical costs, and both hospitals
are preparing bills to submit to the soft drink giant's Atlanta
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coke dismissed as irrelevant a story in The New York
Times that said the company acknowledged to the government in May
that four adults had experienced similar symptoms after consuming
Coke products at a bar at a village outside Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergrass said the company reported the complaints to the
government, which inspected the plant in Antwerp and found nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has been thoroughly reported in the Belgian press
for a long time, but there's nothing more to it,'' Pendergrass
said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials could not be reached for comment.

 &HT;    MindSpring, Covad expand collaboration on high-speed lines
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises and Covad Communications are
expected today to announce an expansion of their deal to jointly
provide high-speed lines _ the route customers increasingly use to
reach the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement extends an alliance that the two have already
formed to deliver the rapid connections known as digital subscriber
lines or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based MindSpring last week touched off speculation about
a possible merger or major acquisition when it announced it was in
talks toward some kind of business ``combination.'' Since then,
MindSpring has kept mum.
</P>
<P>
   With today's announcement, the company reaffirmed its stated
goal to continue growing as access to Internet moves away from the
dial-up modems that the vast majority of customers now use. The
previous pact called for Santa Clara-based Covad to provide
symmetric DSL _ SDSL _ that MindSpring's new business unit could
sell to companies in Atlanta, Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two companies are poised to announce a version for
consumers in California and Texas known as ADSL _ for assymetric
DSL (digital subscriber line). In that version, the most rapid
transmission of data is in the direction of the customer. In SDSL,
the speeds of transmission are equal.
</P>
<P>
   California accounts for nearly 13 percent of MindSpring's 1.2
million subscribers, many of them having arrived with the company's
purchase of Netcom. Texas represents only about 3.8 percent of
MindSpring's customers. Georgia, where MindSpring was born,
represents its largest customer block with about 17 percent of its
total.
</P>
<P>
   DSL seems to be the turf on which much of the potentially
lucrative battle for the high-speed customer will be fought.
</P>
<P>
   Provided by various phone companies, the technology's greatest
advantage is the ability to run on copper phone lines like those
already installed to most American homes. DSL also offers a
connection that is always on, so users can avoid the sometimes
uncertain nuisance of dialing up a link. On the other hand, the
technology doesn't work on some old lines and homes that are too
far from a switching office.
</P>
<P>
   Unavailability is only a temporary obstacle, said Jim Anderson,
MindSpring director of product management for fast access. ``It
will be a damper on those who can't get it right away, but just
because you can't get it right now doesn't mean you can't get it in
six months or nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems offer their own set of strengths and weaknesses as
cable companies steadily trot them out.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, MindSpring is playing both sides of the street.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a pact with Knology, a sister company also born
with cash from ITC Holdings, to deliver Net access via cable
modems, but Knology's reach is relatively limited. Besides, many
analysts believe there is a good chance both DSL and cable modems
will have their measure of success.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Covad is a young _ albeit ambitious _ company that also
has limited reach. For MindSpring's first DSL deal, made on its
home turf in Atlanta, the company partnered with BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   None of these deals is exclusive, so BellSouth sells its DSL
service to MindSpring and other Internet service providers, as well
as marketing it to customers of BellSouth.net.
</P>
<P>
   As the incumbent phone company, BellSouth can ideally offer a
direct line to millions of customers. But the company is all too
aware of ADSL's limitations and can hear the thundering sound of
AT&AMP;T as its cable units upgrade to cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth plans to install devices that can double the reach of
ADSL. Moreover, BellSouth plans to offer a variation known as
G-Lite in 30 markets by year's end, said spokeswoman Sue Holub.
</P>
<P>
   The new version should make installation possible without a
technician's visit to a customer's home.

POLAROID TO DROP ADS LAMPOONING Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polaroid Corp., buckling under pressure from the American
Bankers Association, will pull television advertisements that poke
fun at the Y2K bug, after the ABA said it did not get the joke.
</P>
<P>
   The ads suggest that some banks may not be prepared to handle
the computer glitch, the ABA said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took their comments seriously,'' said Polaroid spokeswoman
Nancy Childs Tuesday. The commercial, she said, was meant as a
``light-hearted spoof'' geared toward a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company hoped the humorous ads would
``re-invigorate'' Polaroid's image by promoting its PopShots
product to ``hipper'' customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to add to the (Y2K) anxiety or suggest that ABA
is not ready to handle the problem,'' Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement depicts a man taking a Polaroid photo of an
ATM screen showing his bank balance just seconds before the new
year. He then takes a second photo of his balance after the clock
strikes midnight, the machine malfunctions, and his account
increases by millions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the ABA sent similar letters to Kia Motors
America concerning another ad that depicted a line of panicked
consumers waiting to withdraw cash from a financial institution.
Kia refused to pull the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The ABA is defending the letters, saying that the commercials
counteract the $10 billion and millions of man hours the banking
industry has spent to ensure it will be business as usual as the
``People are anxious about Y2K already,'' said ABA spokesman John
Hall. ``We feel people are best served with responsible information
about Y2K prepardness rather than making light of an industry's
readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug is a computer problem that could cause some
comuters, as the the new year begins, to read the digits as 1900
instead of 2000, threatening the operations of computer systems,
banks, hospitals, and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Whether public perceptions have been shaped more by science
fiction than scientific study, industry experts on both sides of
the debate agree that customer perception is just as crucial as the
eventual reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overreaction by the public is one of our greatest risks and
could create a self-fulfilling prophecy despite systems being
ready,'' said Jack Gribben, spokesman for the President's Council
on Y2K Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 200 million Americans decide to do anything at the same
time, whether it is filling their gas tanks or it is with the
banks, the systems are not going to be able to handle that,''
Gribben said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the problem turns out to be more drastic than making fun
of the bug now could turn out to be a great disservice to the
public later, said Deutsche Bank economist Edward Yardeni, who has
been an outspoken critic of the government's Y2K progress.
</P>
<P>
   Banks aren't the only ones who face pressure to avoid depicting
panic. Earlier this year Warner Bros. canceled plans for a film
titled ``Y2K,'' a move its producers believe was due to public
pressure against depicting a worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was to star Chris O'Donnell as a computer programmer
who discovered a Y2K-related glitch could leave US security systems
vulnerable to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie ``had a happy ending,'' said producer Bing
Howenstein, who said it was developed with input from Yardeni and
software consultant Peter de Jager, two industry figures well-known
for their criticism that the government isn't disclosing enough
specific information to allay fears. ``It's like they don't even
want to talk about'' dramatic Y2K scenarios, Howenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ABA critics charge that if dispersing correct information is
what the ABA is concerned about then why are federal agencies
refusing to release the specifics on just which banks are lagging
in their preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws mandate that banks and regulators not release
examination data, but many say if this data was public, Y2K fears
would disipate, allowing Polaroid and Kia ads to be taken as a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Although 98 percent of banks have received the highest grade on
examinations of their preparedness, it is not publicly know which
banks make up the 2 percent that are not quite ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just which banks are these? How many thousands of customers do
they have, and how many dollars of deposits do they control?,''
asks Richard Torrenzano, an industry consultant and former
spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange. ``I want to know now. I
do not want to gamble with my money, even though the odds are ...
in my favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators at the Federal Reserve and other agencies defend
their decision not to disclose ratings given to individual banks,
saying that could lead consumers to panic and withdraw all their
funds, assuring bank closures. Instead, regulators have only cited
a handful of the worst-performing banks and ordered a few shut down
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Torrenzano argues that if public confidence in the financial
system needs to be bolstered than regulators need to lead the
industry in communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government wants to avoid erratic behavior by the
public, it should disclose its Y2K examinations by issuing its
`seal of approval' to satisfactory banks,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After days of optimistic
pronouncements that a cease-fire was imminent in Congo, a weary
South African delegate admitted Tuesday that ``Nobody knows how
long these talks will last.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's new foreign minister, Nkosazana Zuma, who
enthused at lunch that ``there is a bright light at the end of the
tunnel,'' later canceled her public schedule for Wednesday _ when
she was supposed to be in Cape Town _ and looked as if she would be
hanging out in Lusaka, Zambia's depressed and dusty capital, for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts from South Africa and the European Union
were unsurprised. Many had been pessimistic from the beginning of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   While the world has been willing to bomb Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic into submission and to lean heavily on India and
Pakistan to stop fighting, the pressure on the warring parties in
Congo is fraternal, and relatively weak. The United Nations would
like the fighting to end, and so would regional powers from Libya
to South Africa. But nations that might contribute peacekeepers _
including South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt _ cannot offer the
legions of trained men needed to police a country 200 times the
size of Kosovo, and the rest of the world is not volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the warring sides have little incentive to quit. While
each has failed at total victory _ for the rebels, ousting
President Laurent Kabila; for Kabila, driving them back out _ each
has nonetheless got the thing it most wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, surrogates for the Tutsi-led governments of Rwanda
and Uganda, have captured a huge buffer zone in which they are free
to hunt and kill the Hutu militias that raid Rwanda, Uganda and
Burundi. Kabila, despite losing a third of his empire, has
nonetheless kept control of the diamond and cobalt mines that are
reported to fill his offshore accounts in Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Eric Silwamba, chief of staff to Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba, entreated both sides to put aside their ``petty
political differences.'' But the issues they are said to disagree
on are actually fundamental. They amount to whether or not to admit
that the former Zaire is now two countries with two governments,
which now must make peace.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that, for decades, Congo has really been three
countries. A western one from the Atlantic coast to Kisangani, run
by the national capital, Kinshasa, its goods moving in and out by
barge on the Congo River. The eastern one, with Goma its chief
city, sees its goods move overland through Rwanda, Uganda and
Kenya. The southern one, with most of the mineral riches and
Lubumbashi as its main city, sees goods move south by rail and road
through Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is the jungle. Its roads are so neglected that
trucks often sink in the mud, and the ferries across its rivers are
often broken. For 30 years under the former dictator, Mobutu Sese
Seko, central government control was lax; taxation failed; soldiers
got their pay by looting.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is by air; communication by satellite phone. With war
stifling trade, it is lucky that the soil supports bananas and
cassava and the rivers teem with fish, or the interior would
starve.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels easily conquered the eastern third and for months,
have been eating slowly into the southern part, heading for the
diamond capital, Mbuji Mayi. However, they have recently split into
three factions, which could further subdivide the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's chief backers, Zimbabwe and Angola, have thrown blood
and treasure into saving his western capital and his southern
diamond fields. Zimbabwe's generals and its president, Robert
Mugabe, are said to own shares of the mines. Angola is fighting to
hurt its internal rebel movement, Unita, which has ties with Uganda
and bases in Congo. Both countries want to leave, but Kabila is a
stubborn, egotistical client who has stalked, willy-nilly, away
from earlier talks and is reported to have faked a bout of malaria
to delay joining these.
</P>
<P>
   A draft agreement is being debated, but reports from Lusaka, all
quoting anonymous sources, say it has many sticking points. It
envisions a cease-fire with all troops freezing in place. It
proposes integrating rebel units into the national army, starting
``a dialogue,'' overseen by outside powers, over the future
government of Congo, and inviting in an international peace-keeping
force charged with disarming and arresting the Hutu militias.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila is said to object to any political talks or integration
of the army units that question his rule or that put rebels on an
equal footing with him.
</P>
<P>
   His finance minister, Mawapanga Mwana Nanga, said Tuesday that
Kabila would sign a cease-fire only if it outlined a Ugandan and
Rwandan withdrawal. Of any talks on future government, he said,
``Everyone is free to come to Kinshasa and say what they want to
say, but it's an internal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the rebel leaders suspect they could be arrested and shot
if on arrival in Kinshasa and would see their fighting units
overrun if Uganda and Rwanda withdraw, they seem unlikely to accept
such conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe, which sent in 3,000 fresh troops on the eve of the
talks, is said to be suspicious of any peacekeeping force,
wondering whether it will be controlled by the United Nations or
the more tractable but disorganized Organization for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Richard Cornwell, an analyst at the Institute for
Security Studies in Pretoria, observed, disarming the Hutu
militias, who led the killing of more than 500,000 people in Rwanda
in 1994 and are now in the jungle, is hardly light work.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the United Nations and the European Union are
attending the talks, but seem content to sit and watch Chiluba
struggle, hoping for the best. A deal was supposed to be signed
last Sunday. Now the talk is about ``something by Saturday'' with
crucial elements to be worked out later.

EFFORT TO CREATE U.S. BRANCH OF FOREIGN MEDICAL SCHOOL STALLS

<P>
   The idea seemed simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ross University, a medical school in the Caribbean island nation
of Dominica, would open a branch in the United States _ in Wyoming,
to be specific, which lacks a medical school of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Casper, the city chosen for the branch, would get 200 jobs and a
projected $10 million a year in economic development. Ross would
get a mainland campus for 600 to 1,000 students _ the first
for-profit medical school to open in the United States in nearly a
century.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was embraced by local business leaders and many
residents. Gov. Jim Geringer backed the idea, as did the state's
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   But the devil was in the details, and now the project has
stalled amid fears that permitting a foreign medical school to
operate in the United States would lead to a proliferation of
unlicensed and unregulated schools.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute provides a vivid example of the tight hold that U.S.
medical schools, their regulators and the American Medical
Association maintain on the medical education system. These groups
control not only the number of doctors practicing medicine but also
which students get an education and where they study.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, the Ross campus in Dominica has been educating
prospective doctors, many of whom were turned down by medical
schools in the United States. The students, primarily Americans,
spend about two years in the classroom in Dominica, and complete
their medical training with two years of clinical studies at U.S.
hospitals. The total cost is about $84,000, compared with $100,000
for a typical medical school education in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The school's founder and namesake is Robert Ross, an eccentric
80-year-old New Yorker who made his fortune trading commodities
like grain and petroleum with the Soviet Union in the 1970s. He
established the university in 1979 at the suggestion of an employee
whose son had been unable to win admission to a U.S. medical
school. The first class, of 11 students, attended lectures at a
motel.
</P>
<P>
   From such humble beginnings, Ross has grown to serve about 1,700
students. Nine hundred of them study basic science in Dominica; the
rest participate in clinical rotations at 40 teaching hospitals in
the United States. A separate veterinary school, established in
1983, has about 350 students.
</P>
<P>
   Like other foreign medical schools, Ross is not accredited in
the United States. Its only accreditation comes from the medical
board in Dominica; graduates must pass rigorous licensing exams to
practice medicine in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States is
made up of 69 state and regional medical boards, which license
doctors to practice medicine in each state. Most state boards
refuse to grant licenses to doctors from unaccredited schools. The
group believes that any medical school ``existing on United States
soil is a U.S. school,'' said Dale L. Austin, the group's deputy
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A school existing in the U.S. would need to come under
accreditation in the U.S. If they didn't achieve accreditation,
then graduates of a school of that sort would be hard pressed to
achieve licensure in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has 125 accredited medical schools. For more
than a decade, the number of students accepted by these schools has
remained stable at about 16,000 a year. About 20 percent of the
doctors practicing medicine in the United States were educated
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, no foreign medical school has been able to establish a
campus in this country. An effort by Kigezi University in Uganda to
establish a branch campus in the United States was recently
abandoned after the University of Washington Medical School refused
to provide the necessary space.
</P>
<P>
   The Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a regulatory agency
sponsored by the AMA and the Association of American Medical
Colleges that accredits United States medical schools, does not
accredit foreign schools.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. medical education officials, the solution to the Ross
problem is simple. The university should move its charter from
Dominica to the United States and seek accreditation as a domestic
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the existing accreditation system,'' said Wendy
Curran, executive director of the Wyoming Medical Society. ``How do
we address such medical education that plans to operate outside of
the existing quality standards?''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association concurs. ``Any medical school _
whether in Casper, Wyo., or anywhere else in the country _ needs to
provide assurances that the education of its students is comparable
to the 125 established medical schools now accredited in the
U.S.,'' the association said in a statement. Last week, at its
annual meeting in Chicago, it voted to warn state medical societies
that branch campuses of foreign medical schools could not be
accredited.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross refuses to move his school and seek domestic
accreditation on the ground that the university provides a lift for
the economy of Dominica. And despite the AMA's opposition, Ross'
administrators and its supporters in Wyoming are moving ahead with
their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ross says he is willing to put $35 million of his own money into
the venture. The Casper Area Economic Development Alliance has
bought 32 acres of land for the school; 60 additional acres have
been donated. Plans call for 600 to 1,000 students to be enrolled
for four semesters of medical education. A fifth semester, before
clinical rotations, would be spent in Dominica.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured it would be a pretty controversial process,'' said
George Howley, president of the alliance. But, he added, ``we're
all excited about bringing a medical school to Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Ross made clear in a recent interview, nothing is
certain. ``Wyoming students must have the same privileges as if
they attended the whole five semesters in Dominica,'' he said. ``If
I cannot get those assurances, I am going to abort the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fighting the establishment for 20 years,'' he went
on. ``We've come a long way, but I'm not going to fight city hall
again.''

 &HT;    Coke ruling coming in July
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal judge overseeing the race discrimination
case against Coca-Cola will decide soon after a hearing next month
whether to grant the company's motion to prevent the case from
becoming a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone conference with attorneys, U.S. District
Judge Richard Story said he will hear arguments July 15 on
Coca-Cola's motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may well rule at the hearing,'' Story said Friday, according
to a transcript of the hearing. ``If I don't, I will rule within
one or two days after it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Story rules for Coca-Cola, it will reduce the size of the
case from potentially 1,500 salaried African-American employees in
the United States to the four named plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The
plaintiffs allege companywide discrimination in pay, promotions,
performance evaluations and terminations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola strongly denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Mixson, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, expressed
confidence Story will dismiss Coca-Cola's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be very surprised if he granted the motion,'' Mixson
said. ``He would be saying it is impossible to have a class action
under any set of circumstances. I don't believe that's the law. We
don't have any discovery yet; we don't know what the facts are. How
can he decide the issue without the facts?''
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola believes the suit is inappropriate for
class-action treatment because of the wide variety of individual
circumstances that would have to be considered. The company argued
that the only common thread is the race of the potential
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Story is grappling with a request to require
Coca-Cola to produce a witness who will give pretrial testimony
about the company's employee database and records.
</P>
<P>
   In a court motion filed last week, plaintiffs' lawyers informed
Story they had received an anonymous letter accusing Coca-Cola of
destroying documents. The unsigned, June 14 letter to plaintiffs'
attorney Cyrus Mehri in Washington said that since Memorial Day,
the company had set up a document destruction room that has
``copiers, printers and shredders.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the room was located next to the company's Human
Resources Department and has a 24-hour operation, with security
surveillance. ``Good luck with your efforts,'' the letter
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion filed last week, the plaintiffs said the
``whistle-blower's allegations'' give rise to the need to obtain
testimony immediately from a Coca-Cola official who can discuss the
records maintained by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Mixson said the plaintiffs will ask the company about the
anonymous allegations when Coca-Cola officials give pretrial
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Rob Baskin said the letter's accusations are
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not maintaining a document destruction room,'' Baskin
said. ``We do have a room we use to collect data and prepare a
database that we will be sharing with the plaintiffs and using as
part of our defense. ... But it contains no shredders and no data
is being destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's hearing, Story appeared to discount the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put much stock in anything that someone hasn't seen,
first of all,'' the judge said. ``Secondly, I did receive the
response from Coke in which they have explained this room, and
what's taking place there, and it's at least consistent with what
should be happening on the defense end of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the company should be in the process of
collecting and organizing personnel records and documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke needs to keep moving and get this information together to
get it over to the plaintiffs,'' Story said.
</P>
<P>
   William Clineburg, a Coca-Cola attorney, said the company will
produce to plaintiffs by Thursday its active employee database,
which dates back to Jan. 1, 1996. The company also is trying to
activate an older database so it can provide court-ordered employee
personnel information dating back to Jan. 1, 1993, Clineburg said.

 &HT;    Music industry embraces Net
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Downloadable music files, also known as MP3 or Liquid
Audio, are the hottest Internet craze and, companies like
Amazon.com and Atlanta-based Cox Interactive Media are betting, one
of the Web's biggest revenue generators looking to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest stumbling block to date has been the recording
industry, which has maintained that Web downloads are one of the
biggest sources of music piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The set of proposed standards announced this week by a recording
industry coalition called the Secure Digital Music Initiative _
which includes record labels, hardware manufacturers and technology
companies _ should help the recording studios feel more
comfortable. That could open a profitable new channel for music
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a huge new distribution opportunity for music
artists,'' added Peter Winter, president of Cox Interactive Media,
which just bought a 10 percent stake in MP3.com. ``The recording
industry establishment seems to want to take that opportunity away.
But, like rock and roll, the Internet will never die.''
</P>
<P>
   While the standards, which will require encryption of any new
music on the Web to keep it from being played on new devices, won't
stop copyright violations of existing music, they should be able to
control piracy of future recordings that reach the Web as MP3
files.
</P>
<P>
   The record companies have realized that the past is past, said
Leonardo Chiariglione, a Telecom Italia SpA researcher who
coordinated the development of MP3 and was recruited to oversee the
development of the security standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is virtually no means to protect past content already
out on the Web. This way, future content will be screened,''
Chiariglione told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The new security guidelines the SDMI wants would make digital
music players used to download and play back digital MP3 files,
such as Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.'s Rio, incompatible with
any music pirated from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of music players will be able to tell
pirated songs from newly manufactured music recordings and refuse
playback.
</P>
<P>
   It's assumed that newly manufactured CDs will include some kind
of watermark to allow this operation.
</P>
<P>
   However, files downloaded from all CDs manufactured to date will
still play on these playback devices, whether or not they are
pirated.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have the standards in place before the holiday
shopping season. Forrester Research estimates that 1 million of the
palm-sized players will be sold this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Web sites that distribute music downloads such as
MP3.com, which has been a vocal critic of the recording industry's
position on digital music downloads, say the standards seem to be
designed to protect the record companies not artists or consumers.
(Cox Interactive Media, which owns a stake in MP3.com, is owned by
Cox Enterprises, parent company of Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting to us is that the two most important
constituencies in the music industry _ the artists and the
customers _ were not included in SDMI's development,'' said Michael
Robertson, founder and chief executive officer of MP3.com. ``The
recording industry is looking out for their own interest and
ignoring the interest of the artists and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Lucas Graves agrees with Winter
and says that the SDMI's proposal indicates the recording
industry's grudging acceptance that MP3 technology isn't going to
go away and that it is willing to work with Web sites and artists
going forward as long as interests aren't compromised by the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   As the proposal now stands, artists and record companies can
choose whether to encode their materials.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Rio players currently on the market will be able to
download and playback any MP3 files they want, legal or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record company knows the stuff is out there,'' Graves
says. ``They are trying to protect what happens on the demand side,
which is what consumers do with a download after they get it. These
standards will offer a set of tools for the supply side (sites like
MP3.com) to make sure the music is being paid for and people aren't
downloading the music and then sharing it with five, 50 or 500
friends.''

DECISION EXPANDS ROLE OF NONTRADITIONAL FAMILY IN SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a groundbreaking ruling that expands parental
rights for gay men and lesbians, the state's highest court said
Tuesday that a lesbian who helped raise her partner's biological
son had been a ``de facto'' parent, entitling her to visitation
rights after the couple split up.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, coming a week after the Supreme Judicial Court
ruled that an aunt was entitled to visit a child she had helped
raise, expands the legal notion of parenting, acknowledging the
place of nontraditional families in modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition of de facto parents is in accord with notions
of the modern family,'' Justice Ruth Abrams wrote for the
four-member majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to be expected that children of nontraditional families,
like other children, form parent relationships with both parents,
whether those parents are legal or de facto.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-page ruling was praised by gay and lesbian advocacy
groups and assailed by defenders of the traditional family as well
as a minority of the court, which warned that it could open the
door to same-sex marriages in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a watershed decision recognizing the existence
of gay and lesbian families and the importance of ensuring the
continued relationship between, in this case, the non-biological
parent and the child,'' said Jennifer Levi, an attorney for
Boston-based Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts said
the ruling threatens families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centuries of experience have taught us that the best way to
nourish and nurture a child is through a two-parent family made up
of a man and woman, husband and wife,'' said C.J. Doyle, the
group's executive director. ``Anything that weakens the traditional
family harms society.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Charles Fried, in a stinging, 14-page dissent, said the
ruling amounted to a ``denigration of parental rights'' and an
``unwarranted judicial intrusion into family relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the subject of same-sex marriages ``difficult,
controversial, and important,'' Fried _ who steps down from the
court Wednesday to return to Harvard Law School _ also wrote that
the ruling ``is a clear step in granting legal force to such
unions. But if that is what the court intends, it should say so
directly.'' Fried was joined by Justice Neil Lynch in the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The case that prompted Tuesday's ruling involves a lesbian
couple from Martha's Vineyard who had a monogamous relationship for
13 years, during which they decided to have a child through
artificial insemination. The ruling does not refer to the couple by
name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, while the couple was living in Maryland, one of the two
women became pregnant. When the child, a son, was born in February
1995, the woman's partner acted as her birthing coach.
</P>
<P>
   The couple sent out birth announcements naming both as parents,
and the child's last name consisted of both women's last names. The
boy tells people he has two mothers, one he calls ``mommy'' and one
he calls ``mama.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the child was born, and again afterward, the two women
signed a ``coparenting agreement'' that expressed their intent to
raise the boy together. The agreement also stated that, should the
women separate, both would retain parental status.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple broke up in May 1998, eight months after moving
to Massachusetts, the boy's biological mother denied her partner
access to the child. The partner then filed a complaint seeking
visitation rights, as well as the right to adopt the child and
assume joint custody.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing, a Dukes County Probate and Family Court judge
ordered temporary visitation, pending trial, between the plaintiff
and the boy, citing the so-called ``best interest of the child''
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's biological mother appealed the probate court's
decision to the SJC, which Tuesday backed the lower court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Several family law specialists and other legal experts said the
high court's ruling raises complex questions, such as whether
stepparents and foster parents are entitled to visitation rights,
and whether ``de facto parents'' have a financial obligation to
children and partners.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Epstein, one of two Boston attorneys representing the
biological mother, called Tuesday's decision ``an end-run around
the Legislature'' and warned that it could ``open a Pandora's box
of potential litigants.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Owen Todd, Epstein's law partner, agreed: ``My biggest
worry is that this could throw open the courts' doors to
boyfriends, girlfriends, day-care providers, and anyone else who
had a role in a child's life and now wants visitation.''
</P>
<P>
   But other legal analysts said similar cases are likely to come
under careful scrutiny by courts in an effort to determine whether
a person who has no blood relation to a child qualifies as that
child's ``de facto parent.''

PERSONAL COMPUTER AS PERSONAL JUKEBOX? NOT YET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Although members of the music and
electronics industries described standards announced on Monday as a
watershed for distributing music over the Internet, numerous
obstacles could very well prevent the personal computer from
becoming the jukebox and record store of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still outstanding are meaty questions about what technology will
be used to deliver and protect copyrights of music sold online. And
while the consortium that is creating the standards, the Secure
Digital Music Initiative, represents the music, consumer
electronics and computer industries, it is not at all certain that
the makers of portable music players will comply with standards
that are being dictated largely by the interests of record labels.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is likely to leave consumers bewildered in the
coming months, even as electronics companies ramp up production of
the new players _ solid-state equivalents of today's portable
cassette and CD players _ in the hopes of making the coming holiday
season the first digital-music Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that with the preliminary release of new
standards for distributing music electronically, music companies
are ramping up for online sales of their recordings, as evidenced
by two disclosures on Tuesday from Bertelsmann, the parent company
of BMG Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A Bertelsmann subsidiary, BMG Storage Media, based in
Guetersloh, Germany, which records audio CDs and video DVDs,
announced Tuesday a partnership with Intertrust and Reciprocal, two
U.S. companies that make technology for distributing music in
digital form while preserving its copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from BMG Storage Media said that starting next
quarter, the partners would test technology to print new CDs that
are compliant with the SDMI standard, which means the music cannot
be played on portable devices if the device's owner has not paid
for the music.
</P>
<P>
   This is not simple to accomplish. First, future CDs have to be
playable on existing CD players, which tend to be highly sensitive
to the way data are organized on a CD. Second, because the Home
Recording Act of 1992 allows anyone who purchases a CD to make a
copy for personal use, the protection technology will have to
distinguish between a recording device owned by the purchaser of
the CD and a device owned by someone else. As Intel and Microsoft
Corps. discovered this year, machines that attempt to identify
themselves or their owners on a network provoke angry outcries from
privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   On a different front, BMG, among the biggest of the record
companies, announced Tuesday that it would begin selling music over
the Internet in the fall. But, as is the case with other major
record labels planning online sales, BMG has yet to decide which
artists it will sell online, whether it will sell just singles or
entire albums, what prices it will charge and what technology it
will use to prevent illegal copying.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all good questions,'' said J. Scott Dinsdale, a
spokesman for BMG. ``We're going through that process right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, it remains to be seen how soon consumers will buy into
the online music revolution, given that it takes 10 minutes to
download a single song (more than 3 hours for a typical album)
using a standard dial-up modem, and the downloading process is
often fraught with technical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary SDMI standards _ set to be finalized within the
next month _ are meant to dictate the technical specifications for
portable digital players, hand-held devices that record and play
music on silicon circuitry called flash memory. The new players are
the center of a shift in musical products that many recording
industry veterans see as revolutionary because they enable people
to download music from the Net, organize it, easily erase it and
listen to it portably in CD-quality form.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the players are generating deep-seated fears
within the music industry of widespread piracy because the music
they record and play can be taken from commercial CDs or the
Internet and copied illegally. Under the standards announced on
Monday, these players eventually _ SDMI estimates about 18 months _
should not be allowed to play illegally copied music.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically what will happen is that the portable players will
read a piece of software code embedded in the digital version of
each song that tells the player whether making a copy is
permissible. Record labels have said they will start to encode each
song sold over the Internet with copyright protection information.
Within 18 months, the companies also intend to start encoding each
CD sold in a store with similar technology, known generically as a
digital watermark.
</P>
<P>
   But this technology is not yet perfected; numerous companies
have submitted proposals to the SDMI, but none has yet been chosen,
and it is unclear whether any single solution will accomplish the
task.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics assert that consumers who have already amassed a
sizeable library of digital music cannot yet be sure that in the
future digital players will be capable of playing recordings that
are not SDMI compliant. Howard Tullman, chief executive of
Tunes.com, a Chicago-based Web site that publishes thousands of
songs from unsigned artists and independent record labels, says he
worries that SDMI standards will lead to players that will play
only music that meets big record labels' stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have invested hours and hours or days taking their own
music collection and making it portable,'' he said. ``You can't
tell the person no, that's no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tara Lemmey, president of Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an online civil liberties group, said the organization
was exploring whether the SDMI standards might represent a
violation of antitrust laws or ``fair use'' policies that permit
the use of music and other media for education or aesthetic
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of SDMI said portable devices would be permitted
to play existing digital recordings _ most notably the thousands of
MP3 files now on the Net. They have said that even when portable
devices are in full compliance _when the final rules come into play
_ the devices will play all music unless the music itself contains
the protection software permitting it to be played only by a
copyright holder.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even SDMI officials _ and some of the 150 or so
technology, music and electronics companies in the consortium _ say
many of the questions cannot be answered until the final
specifications are approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specifications are evolving to some degree,'' said Kurt
Ohlfs, business development manager for Diamond Multimedia, the
maker of the portable player called the Diamond Rio. But, he added,
with SDMI, ``you'll start to see more top-end content'' for sale
online by record companies.

BUSH MEETS WITH HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVES, MOVIE STARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush used his status Tuesday
as one of the hottest summer trends since Jedi knights and Austin
Powers to do a meeting with a key Democratic financial group of
Hollywood executives and movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood likes what's cool, so you can understand why they
are looking away from (Vice President) Al Gore,'' said David
Horowitz, a Bush friend in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has got charisma. He's hot. He's got star
quality, and that's what this town relates to,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lowest-profile event of his three-day California tour,
Bush met privately with about 60 people at the Bel Air home of
Terry Semel, co-chairman of Warner Bros. and Warner Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the guests were movie executives, and many, like Semel,
have been major contributors to the Democratic Party, President
Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was not meant to raise money for Bush, but to let
him meet Hollywood people who have been turned off by the Clinton
administration's criticism and decision to study the links between
movie violence and youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer ignore the well-documented connections
between violence in the media and the effects it has on children's
behavior,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Official Hollywood, which has raised large amounts of campaign
cash for Clinton and the Democratic Party, was shocked by Clinton's
actions. Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, is
suffering for it.
</P>
<P>
   Several major executives, including Disney's Michael Eisner, are
supporting Democrat Bill Bradley. And Semel was opening the door
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush described his meeting at Semel's house as an opportunity to
get to know people in the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I meet with the movie people today, I'm not going to
single them out,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to talk in terms ... that
we are all responsible for ushering in the responsibility era.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes it is important to understand that youth
violence is not caused just by violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a correlation between violence in movies and youth
violence, but I also think there is a correlation between violence
and drug use and alcohol abuse and lack of parental love,'' Bush
said. ``There's a lot of reasons why we have violence in our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush indicated he does not like ``pure violence for violence
sake,'' but added that he also believes ``adult movies are for
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Hollywood lauds responsible behavior and responsible
decisions and responsible actions,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the industry and Republicans has been
uneasy through most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 elections, people in the entertainment industry
gave $442,075 to Clinton's re-election campaign and $166,070 to the
campaign of Republican challenger Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, a GOP presidential contender
this year, accused the entertainment industry of contributing to
the nation's moral decay through the portrayal of fictional
television character Murphy Brown's unwed motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   And during the 1996 election cycle, Dole singled out Time
Warner, of which Semel's company is a subsidiary, for promoting
violence against police in its gangsta rap recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to ask the executives of Time Warner a
question,'' Dole said in a 1995 speech. ``Is this what you intended
to accomplish with your careers? You have sold your souls, but must
you debase our nation and threaten our children as well?''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood focus on violence also has been under attack in
the courts. Time Warner faces lawsuits that claim the movies
``Natural Born Killers'' and ``The Basketball Diaries'' caused
copycat teen killings. Semel was involved in the final cuts of
``Natural Born Killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has visited with entertainment moguls before, but only the
conservative ones. In April, he spoke to Horowitz's Center for the
Study of Popular Culture, ostensibly about the Texas film industry,
but the speech was laden with talk about personal responsibility
and individual freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz said Bush has a chance to break the barriers between
Hollywood and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton-Gore have launched this attack on Hollywood,''
Horowitz said. ``They (Hollywood insiders) fear Republicans are
going to be worse. But when they discover that Bush is not their
darkest fears, they are going to come over.''
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz said Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' campaign to
bring prosperity to ``people left behind'' will appeal to
Hollywood. But Horowitz said no one should expect an immediate
stampede to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you are going to find people jumping at the
beginning of a campaign,'' Horowitz said. ``We're at the stage
where this is a look-see.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson of the Center for Responsive Politics said he was
surprised by Hollywood's courting of Bush, but added: ``It's hard
for me to imagine a single issue (such as youth violence) that
would drive a wedge between Hollywood and Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his meeting with the Hollywood executives, Bush spoke at
fund-raisers in San Diego, Irvine and Los Angeles as part of his
effort to raise $4.2 million in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also had what was promoted as a Hispanic voter outreach
event at the Plaza de Mexico at the Del Mar Fair. However, the
event was held before the fair was open to the public, and Bush's
invited crowd of about 100 people apparently contained few
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion Rights Action League also had a small
crowd of protesters outside of each of Bush's fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL Southern California Director Kelly Hayes-Raitt said the
group wants to tell Californians that Bush is ``the most
anti-choice governor in the nation.'' But Hayes-Raitt said that
Bush's relatively moderate comments on abortion rights are signs
that he is ``equivocating'' after the defeats of Republican
anti-abortion candidates in U.S. Senate and governor's races in
California last year.

   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual regulatory approach, federal
officials said Tuesday that they had tentatively agreed to approve
the $72 billion acquisition of Ameritech Corp. by SBC
Communications Inc. provided that the new company not only open its
market to competition but also offer local telephone service in 30
cities outside its region.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the conditions were intended to drive down phone
bills by encouraging competition in markets that have been
dominated by one local phone company. SBC and Ameritech executives
said Tuesday that regulators would impose stiff fines if the new
company, which will be the nation's largest local telephone
company, failed to offer residential and business telephone service
in cities including Miami, Seattle and Boston within 12 months and
New York, Washington and Phoenix within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Although SBC said soon after the merger was announced that it
intended to enter those cities, where federal officials hope it
will become a giant competitor, the regulatory agreement speeds up
its time frame. It also sets penalties as high as $2.2 billion for
the company's failure to offer local phone service outside its
existing territory or sufficiently open its markets to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reflects a fundamental shift in the approach
regulators have taken in reviewing large mergers. The Ameritech-SBC
deal will create a company with about 55 million local phone lines
in 13 states, cutting a swath from Michigan to Texas and including
Connecticut and California. Regulators have traditionally responded
to such proposed corporate behemoths by blocking the deal or
requiring divestitures, not expansions, of business units.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged they agreed to the 28 conditions in the
deal in part because of the heavy criticism of their approval of
the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex two years ago, a deal that
did not have such conditions and that consumer groups say has not
significantly increased competition or lowered prices. The
officials also said that the proposed agreement was an effort to
fix the shortcomings of a 3-year-old law that was intended to
deregulate the telecommunications industry and foster competition
but has been unable to force the regional Bells to open their
markets. Instead, the law has largely encouraged a wave of
corporate mergers and a heavy consolidation of the industry that
has raised concerns among some consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative accord is the product of three months of intensive
negotiations between lawyers for the companies and the staff of the
Federal Communications Commission, who were ordered by William
Kennard, the agency's chairman, to find ways to encourage
competition in the local telephone markets. The agency will give
competitors and the public about a month to comment on the proposal
before a final vote is taken by the commissioners. State regulators
in Indiana and Illinois must also approve the acquisition before it
can be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard applauded the work of the staff and indicated that he
would most likely approve the deal. It would be highly unusual for
a majority of the five commissioners, who were kept apprised of the
negotiations, to reject the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by SBC and Ameritech's commitment to open
their markets to competition and their agreement to suffer stiff
penalities if they do not,'' Kennard said. ``Our paramount goal
must be to hasten the day when consumers enjoy the benefits of more
competition in local and long-distance phone service.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the two companies said that they were pleased to
have resolved the issues and hoped to be able to complete the
merger soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that the merger is now in the home stretch,''
said James Ellis, senior executive vice president and general
counsel of SBC. ``The conditions are perhaps some of the most
wide-ranging that any company has ever submitted to the FCC in
order to win approval of this type of transaction. They answer
fully the concerns that Chairman Kennard first raised last April.
They are tough, they are fair and they are certainly enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer groups that had urged the FCC to block the
proposed acquisition said the accord held little hope of actually
increasing competition, particularly given the industry's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than block consolidation among monopolies and forcing
the companies in the marketplace, we have a massive expansion of
monopoly with an enormously complicated set of conditions that will
take an army to police,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of
the Washington office of Consumers Union. ``We've never had local
telephone competition, and to allow these companies to consolidate
is an enormous public policy risk, and I believe a mistaken one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman also said that to the extent that SBC actually served
new cities, it made economic sense for the company to offer service
only to the high-end of the market, mostly businesses and residents
now paying top rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defies the economic realities of the market that SBC would
sign onto this deal at any significant cost to it,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   While other regional Bell and local exchange companies did not
criticize the proposed agreement Tuesday, saying they needed time
to study it, analysts said they expected it would not face serious
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win-win for almost everybody involved,'' said Scott
Cleland, an analyst at the Legg Mason Precursor Group. ``You will
not see a lot of people trashing this because it has a little bit
for everybody. The FCC gets a host of pro-competitive commitments
and a way to enforce them with stiff penalties. The competitors get
a lot of their favorite pet rocks that they have long sought. And
SBC gets approval of its merger and it gets to control its own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Atkinson, the lead government lawyer who negotiated the
conditions, described them today as ``substantial and
unprecedented'' and said they would ``create irreversible market
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said that the agreement would be enforced by an
independent auditor approved by the FCC and paid for by SBC,
formerly Southwestern Bell. Ameritech, based in Chicago, was
originally formed by the joining of Bell companies in Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed agreement requires SBC, based in San Antonio, to
offer competitors in its territory steep promotional discounts of
up to 32 percent for reselling their services and 25 percent for
leasing the use of wires that run from SBC's switching centers to
customers' homes. It also requires that SBC establish a separate
corporate affiliate for offering high-speed Internet service on
telephone lines. The affiliate would be largely independent of SBC
and would have to be treated like any competitor of SBC.

 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass.)  (af) 
 Sarah Bayliss is an associate editor of Artnews magazine.  
 By SARAH BAYLISS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, Uncle Sam wasn't born on the Fourth
of July but on Sept. 13, 1766, in Arlington, Mass. And he had many
guises before James Montgomery Flagg painted a stern, white-haired
man proclaiming, ungrammatically, ``I want YOU for U.S. Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam's namesake was Samuel Wilson, a meat packer who
settled in Troy, N.Y., and supplied food to American troops during
the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend _ and to an eyewitness report published in
The New-York Gazette and General Advertiser in 1830 _ a workman
joked that the letters ``U.S.'' on Wilson's shipping crates stood
for ``Uncle Sam'' Wilson. The anecdote spread and led to the
patriotic symbol now reproduced in political cartoons,
advertisements, posters and fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Uncle Sam, including portrayals by Currier &AMP; Ives,
Thomas Nast, Charles Dana Gibson and Andy Warhol, can be seen in
``Uncle Sam: The Face of a Nation,'' at the New-York Historical
Society in Manhattan through Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Samuel Wilson's life had little to do with Uncle Sam,
except that he was a tall, enterprising Yankee. As he evolved into
a star-spangled icon, Uncle Sam surpassed Lady Liberty, Columbia,
Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan as the most popular
personification of America.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has endorsed American products from Liberty Bonds
to cleaning powder to Ex-Lax. Star-spangled hats can be found on
old Grateful Dead albums, and Allen Ginsberg wore one in 1966 for a
Central Park peace rally. Today, the red, white and blue top hat
pops up as a screen icon for Turbotax, the popular software used to
calculate income-tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, Uncle Sam represented rural, down-home
America _ most of the country _ in contrast to Britain's portly
mascot, John Bull. In some cartoons, Uncle Sam and his shabby
alter-ego, Brother Jonathan, were interchangeable. More often,
though, Uncle Sam represented the federal government and Brother
Jonathan the common man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncle Sam Sick with La Grippe,'' an 1836 cartoon by Edward
Williams Clay, finds him wearing a flaglike robe, weakened by a
financial crisis. A humble Brother Jonathan appears outside a
window, greeting the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Nast, the political cartoonist whose comic inventions
included the Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant, is
credited with popularizing Uncle Sam's goatee. In Nast's ``Uncle
Sam's Thanksgiving Dinner'' (1869), the avuncular host presides
over a banquet table of guests symbolizing different nations,
including stereotypes of Chinese, Spanish and Irish families.
</P>
<P>
   If some early portrayals of Uncle Sam now seem racially
insensitive _ many show the lanky patriarch attended by crude
caricatures of African- and Asian-Americans _ he carried great
authority during times of national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady Liberty came to be associated with the single topic of
immigration,'' says Grady Turner, co-curator of the New-York
Historical Society show. ``She doesn't rally you to patriotism
going into war. Uncle Sam is a warrior figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Flagg chose him for his now-famous World War
I recruitment image, created for a 1916 cover of Leslie's
Illustrated Weekly Newspaper and reprinted the next year on
posters.
</P>
<P>
   With some four million copies distributed during World War I and
more than one million during World War II, it was the most famous,
and most parodied, American poster of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Uncle Sam's severe patriotism is too old-fashioned for
the Army's ``Be all that you can be'' campaign (though he does
appear, saluting, on a new 33-cent stamp). ``Uncle Sam is a
historical keepsake,'' says Douglas Smith, a public affairs
representative for Army recruitment. ``We don't want to portray
ourselves as a World War I or World War II recruiting agency. The
modern concept of the Army is that you serve your country and your
service comes with benefits back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also likely that Uncle Sam's Yankee heritage doesn't hold
sway with current American racial demographics. ``A nation that
sees itself as diverse can't rally behind an old white man from the
Northeast,'' says Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but it can parody and adapt him for a variety of
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Uncle Sam has championed causes from the
discriminatory to the ridiculous. ``Uncle Sam has become the symbol
of radicalism and counter-culture movements,'' says Elena Millie,
the curator of the poster collection at the Library of Congress and
of a 1994 Uncle Sam poster show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see him, they say: `Oh. What's he doing for us
now?''' In spoofs of Flagg's picture, Uncle Sam has endorsed the Ku
Klux Klan, civil rights and the admission of homosexuals to the
military. A 1968 poster supporting Pope Paul VI's ban on birth
control among Roman Catholics featured Uncle Sam admonishing
Americans against taking the Pill.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and Jerry's 1994 search for a chief executive officer for
their ice cream company had him saying, ``We want you to be our
C.E.O.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam's survival probably rests on the fact that any fringe
group can claim him as a spokesman. ``Uncle Sam can mean everything
to everybody _ he can have great power,'' says Mike Darnall, the
author, with the illustrator Alex Ross, of the graphic novel
``Uncle Sam,'' published by DC Comics earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, a tattered and confused Uncle Sam wanders through
time in a dank American landscape, at one point getting into a
fistfight with his own double. ``I like to think that there was a
certain civility in a country represented by gentle old Uncle
Sam,'' says Darnall. ``But we're living in a world where senators
call the president a scumbag. If Uncle Sam existed today, he would
cover his ears in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner notes that many children arrive at the New-York
Historical Society show without knowing who Uncle Sam is. ``He led
to his own decline,'' Turner says, ``by being a stereotype and
consorting with other stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam's future is still bright in some regions. Since 1961,
Troy, N.Y., has been the official home of Uncle Sam, declared so by
a 1961 bill pushed through Congress by Sens. Jacob K. Javits and
Kenneth Keating of New York, to the consternation of some
modern-day Arlington residents who want to revive interest in
Samuel Wilson's birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 13 is Uncle Sam Day in Troy, and Fred Polnisch, a local
Uncle Sam impersonator, is busy keeping Samuel Wilson's story
alive. Crowds love to hear about Uncle Sam Wilson, he says, almost
as much as they like his star-spangled shoelaces.
</P>
<P>
   And if they don't know a lot about American history, they do
have one strong association with Uncle Sam. ``Some people ask me
why I'm taking all their money for taxes,'' says Polnisch. ``I tell
them to write to their congressmen.''

ADVOCACY GROUP FINDS NEW WAY FOR PATIENTS TO OBTAIN EXPENSIVE
DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advocates for people with hepatitis C have found a way for
patients to bypass a major drug company and purchase an expensive
medication, Ribavirin, at far below the usual price.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on July 9, when the patent on Ribavirin for use against
hepatitis C expires, patients will be able to order the drug from a
pharmacy in Pittsburgh, according to the Hepatitis C Action &AMP;
Advocacy Coalition, a patients' group based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy, which seems to have taken both the Food and
Drug Administration and the drug industry by surprise, is carefully
constructed to navigate the nation's drug approval and patent laws.
It involves an overseas manufacturer, a U.S. importer and the
drugstore in Pittsburgh known as a ``compounding pharmacy,'' where
pharmacists will hand-pack imported Ribavirin powder into capsules
to fill individual prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said on Tuesday that they were looking into the
plan, but would probably not try to stop it unless it was
determined to be unsafe. The officials said that compounding
pharmacies fall into a gray zone of regulation, an area in which
the agency is struggling to develop rules to cover a growing and
rapidly changing field.
</P>
<P>
   Like old-fashioned drugstores, the pharmacies prepare drug
mixtures and doses that differ from what is commercially available.
They are not permitted to copy commercially available products, but
may make versions of them that vary one or more ingredients
according to a doctor's prescription for a patient, who may, for
example, be sensitive or allergic to a substance that is normally
included.
</P>
<P>
   The drug now at issue, Ribavirin, is approved to treat hepatitis
C only in combination with another drug, Intron A. Alone, Ribavirin
has no effect on the disease. Although the combination appears to
eliminate the virus in only 40 percent to 45 percent of patients,
it is the best treatment developed so far for the disease, which
kills 10,000 Americans year and is the leading cause of liver
transplants. About 4 million people in the United States are
thought to be infected. The virus is spread mainly by contaminated
needles and other exposure to infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the only way that patients can buy Ribavirin is as
part of a combination product, Rebetron, sold only by the
Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J. Rebetron includes Ribavirin
and Intron A, a brand of interferon made exclusively by
Schering-Plough. Patients take it for six months or a year, with a
year of treatment costing $15,600 to $17,300, or $1,300 to $1,440
per month.
</P>
<P>
   When Rebetron was approved in June 1998, it was hailed as a
major advance, because it worked far better than the previous
treatment, interferon alone. But some patients' enthusiasm withered
when they found out that Schering-Plough had ``bundled'' the two
drugs into a kit and would not sell them separately.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since its approval, 293,000 prescriptions for
Rebetron have been filled, earning $214 million for
Schering-Plough, according to IMS Health, a health care information
company based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The bundling of Rebetron provoked bitterness because three other
companies besides Schering-Plough also make interferon, and some
patients who had trouble tolerating the side effects of Intron A
wanted to try their luck combining Ribavirin with one of the other
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Now, starting on July 9, patients will be able to buy Ribavirin
alone for $225 a month, from Fisher's Specialty Pharmacy Services,
in Pittsburgh. That price is about 80 percent less than what
Schering-Plough's version costs, based on subtracting the price of
Intron A from the price of Rebetron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a corner drugstore, basically,'' said Betty Stein, a
pharmacist and owner of the business along with two other
pharmacists, Jeff Fisher and Donald Kerrish. ``We have checked into
this. We are not doing it on a whim. Every avenue is on the up and
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein said that she and her colleagues would not manufacture
the Ribavirin themselves, but would purchase the powder from
another company and pack it into capsules by hand, according to
each patient's prescription. She declined to name the company, but
said it was a U.S. importer that bought the drug from an overseas
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Ribavirin is imported, Ms. Stein said, it is
pure and carries the USP label, which stands for U.S. Pharmacopeia
and means that the product has been approved by that agency for
dispensing in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein said it will be legal to sell Ribavirin in this manner
on July 9 because Schering-Plough's patent on using it for
hepatitis C will expire the day before. Although the company still
has an agreement that bars U.S. competitors from marketing generic
forms of the drug that agreement does not apply to pharmacies like
Fisher's, which do not manufacture the drug but merely put it into
capsules.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Schering-Plough said that the company was
investigating the matter, but that so far, it appeared to be legal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein said that her staff would be standing by at the store
on July 9, waiting to fill orders. ``We'll be up late,'' she said.

A JAZZ-ROCK FUSION WITHOUT THE GHOST OF MILES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ADAM SHATZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The German critic Walter Benjamin, in his famous essay on
Proust, observed that all distinguished works of art ``found a
genre or dissolve one.'' The Chicago Underground Trio's new record,
``Possible Cube,'' does both: it's an act of creative destruction.
</P>
<P>
   This graceful collage of free jazz and art rock has refreshingly
little in common with the electric jazz of Miles Davis, whose ghost
tends to hover over such experiments. Instead of looking to funk
for inspiration, the trio delves into the ethereal textures of
modern electronica.
</P>
<P>
   And the astonishing thing is that the record doesn't sound like
an experiment. Where most jazz-rock fusions feel awkwardly
hyphenated, this one is naturally hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Underground Trio is Rob Mazurek on cornet,
electronics and vibes; Chad Taylor on percussion and vibes, and
Noel Kupersmith on bass and vibes. The ensemble grew out of the
Windy City's fertile new music scene, which has lately given birth
to such ``post-rock'' bands as Tortoise and Sam Prekop's Sea and
the Cake.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago milieu comprises young, artistic musicians who feel
comfortable dipping into genres as various as avant-garde jazz,
electronica, mope rock, samba, lounge music and minimalism. Unlike
some of their New York peers, they recognize that genre-mixing
needn't be ostentatious, or tongue-in-cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Close enough in sensibility to constitute a movement, these
Chicagoans all seem to play in each other's bands. Mazurek, who
plays on Tortoise's ``TNT,'' leads an acid-jazz outfit called
Isotope 217 with three members of that band, one of whom, Jeff
Parker, plays guitar and organ on a few tracks of ``Possible
Cube.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Mazurek, who also record as the Chicago Underground
Duo, can be heard to lovely effect on Sam Prekop's eponymous record
and on ``Hoffman Estates,'' an evocative new recording by the
guitarists Loren Mazzacane-Connors and Alan Licht.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most jazz records today, ``Possible Cube'' is an album
rather than a grab-bag of tunes. Superbly produced by Bundy K.
Brown, formerly of Tortoise, ``Possible Cube'' moves cinematically
from long, free-form pieces to bagatelle-like interludes of 30
seconds to two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The cover art is no less striking. Fashionably blurred in the
manner of a Gerhard Richter painting, it's a photograph of the
musicians in vintage clothes, sitting in the corner of a dimly lit
room and resembling nothing so much as an indie rock band. The
genre of music is left purposely vague: there's no clue to what
kind of ``underground'' this is.
</P>
<P>
   The music on ``Possible Cube'' is quiet, understated _ and
startling. Improvising over austere ostinatos, the trio specializes
in subtle, timbral contrasts, particularly between the vibraphone
and the cornet. (Their use of vibes and marimbas owes as much to
Tortoise as it does to, say, the Modern Jazz Quartet.)
</P>
<P>
   Mazurek, who until recently was a traditional hard-bop player,
recalls Don Cherry in his spare, fragile phrasing and in his
preference for migratory structures; the track ``Nude Anthem''
seems to pay homage to ``Nu Awake,'' a composition on Cherry's 1966
recording ``Where Is Brooklyn?''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the trio's music is never frenetic: it is lapidary in
its precision. With painterly splashes of organ and electronics, it
casts a nocturnal, spectral glow. &QL;

BULLS IN CONTROL IN '99 NBA DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is what it's like in the 1999 NBA Draft. Picture some
diplomatic conference on world harmony whose outcome depended on
what North Korea was going to do. Now you have a pretty good idea
of what the rest of the NBA is dealing with because ubersleuth
Jerry Krause of the Chicago Bulls is sittin' on No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``blackmail'' and ``extortion'' have been mentioned
in conjunction with the Bulls, who, like everyone else, are
disenchanted with the talent level of this year's crop. Krause is
trying to trade the pick for players/picks and probably will keep
trying Wednesday. A couple of rumors have involved the Celtics and
Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Krause also is notorious for keeping people guessing. Most Bulls
watchers were certain that he was going to take Joe Wolf of North
Carolina with the 10th pick in 1987. Krause decided to take Horace
Grant instead. (Wolf went 13th to the Clippers.) Not a bad move,
huh?
</P>
<P>
   As of late Tuesday, most people had Duke's Elton Brand penciled
into the Bulls' slot if they keep the pick. The other possibility
is dynamic Maryland guard Steve Francis, who also could be taken as
part of a trade. (If Vancouver selects Francis, you can be certain
something's up.)
</P>
<P>
   The status of Lamar Odom also was of keen interest on the eve of
the draft. He was thought to have righted the ship a bit after
sliding out of the top spot, which, on talent alone, he probably
merits. He may not go in the top three and that would leave the
Clippers at No. 4 as one possibility. Another would be Minnesota at
No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Odom held a workout Monday night at Rhode Island for a handful
of teams, one of which was Miami. The Heat pick 25th, so their
presence indicates that Pat Riley may be working the phones trying
to get the Grizzlies' No. 2 pick, which is, as they say, available.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is No. 1. Krause may wind up alienating 28 colleagues
before this is over. He is determined to rebuild the Bulls and
equally determined to squeeze everything he can out of the pick.
The Raptors would love to trade with their eye on Francis, but are
loathe to give up Tracy McGrady, a Krause favorite. (So, too, is
Mercer, who has been mentioned in a three-way with the Bulls and
Raptors.) Cleveland also has two lottery picks (8, 11) and might
package that with a player (Derek Anderson?) to try and move up.
They want Wally Szczerbiak, however, the senior sharpshooter from
Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   There also were rumors Tuesday that Indiana was shopping Mark
Jackson and was talking to Phoenix about a deal for Tom Gugliotta
(for Jalen Rose and Antonio Davis). The Pacers draft 26th, not an
opportune spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say the draft stops at seven. Others say it stops
at 12, and some others say it stops at 18,'' said Indiana general
manager David Kahn. ``Anyway you look at it, it doesn't look good
for us guys in the 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the Rockets sent out a memo Tuesday telling
teams that their pick, 22d overall, was available for just about
anything. The Rockets and Raptors reportedly had a deal involving
the estimable Hakeem Olajuwon, but Toronto GM Glen Grunwald was
quick to shoot it down. The Raptors would have surrendered two
picks and two players for the aging Olajuwon, not a wise move.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta goes into the draft with four first rounders, but
reportedly has agreed to send two of them to the Warriors for John
Starks. Golden State would then be poised to make a run at Mitch
Richmond. Utah has three first rounders, the best of which is 19th.

HERE RIOTS RAGED, A NEIGHBORHOOD EMERGES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seven years after the Los Angeles riots shook
Southern California and the world, the words ``South-Central''
still evoke the open wounds of urban decay and social dislocation.
But here on a wide swath of once-grand Vermont Avenue at 81st
Street, seedlings of renewal are taking root this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, 36 mustard-colored, stucco town houses _ half
of them built above storefronts facing the street and the rest
around an interior court _ are filling up with first-time
homeowners, most of them single mothers. In the process, Vermont
Village Plaza is testing anew the possibilities of the New Urbanism
of its award-winning architect, Daniel Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, a 30-year veteran of the architecture faculty at the
University of California at Berkeley, has been a charter member of
the New Urbanism, a school of architects, planners and theorists
that has sought to rebuild, or replicate, the kind of
pedestrian-oriented streetscapes and manageable-size neighborhoods
that prevailed in American cities before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The group has deplored the abandonment of traditional city cores
and the rise of suburban sprawl, with its malls, office parks and
isolated tract housing.
</P>
<P>
   From his San Francisco-based firm, Solomon Inc., Solomon has
designed projects ranging from re-interpreted San Francisco row
houses to the Congregation Beth Israel Memorial Garden, a funerary
chapel in Houston, and has done ``a lot of urban infill in rough
and dangerous places,'' as he put it in a recent inteview.
</P>
<P>
   The South-Central site posed special challenges, not nearly all
of them architectural, but after more than five years, Solomon's
vision of a low-rise 1930s-style stretch of shops and apartments
has at last taken shape.
</P>
<P>
   Where a weed-strewn, vacant lot once sat like a scar, a graceful
three-story facade of pilasters and balconies now marches along the
street front, broken by palm trees. Remote-controlled security
gates protect interior courtyards and two-car garages.
</P>
<P>
   Each two- or three-bedroom unit has skylights and ample open
space, creating a remarkably uncrowded feeling on the compact,
1.75-acre site. There is even an on-site automatic teller machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built it for $77 a square foot, and it doesn't look like
that, I don't think,'' Solomon said of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tone facade in soft yellows is accented at periodic
archways with inset black and white tile, with vertical red stripes
painted in crevices. Windows stretch seamlessly up the second and
third stories, and inside the units they run ceiling-high to
capture as much daylight as possible. The effect is a sleeker,
stripped down version of a mixed-use Art Deco apartment complex
whose contours would have made Raymond Chandler feel at home 60
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to create an environment that accommodates cars,
private open space, light from two directions, making them have the
amenity and security of private houses, but at considerably higher
density,'' said Solomon. ``The basic physical idea is that housing
can sustain a little bit of scattered retail and services, when
there is not that mass of parking that would support large retail
outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   But even reaching consensus on that concept took time and hard
work. The $8 million project is a direct outgrowth of the 1992
riots and of the decades of commercial abandonment of the Vermont
corridor that preceded and helped prompt them.
</P>
<P>
   After the violence, local banks and financial institutions came
under severe criticism for their reluctance to invest in the area
and one of them, First Interstate Bank, sponsored a design contest
for a residential-commercial development, with perhaps 130
low-income apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The riots were the immediate focus, and the media hook for
this,'' Solomon said. ``But the real underlying urban decay is not
the riots. It's the abandonment of the commercial corridors of the
city, which was the motivation for new mixed commercial space
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to use the vacant Art Deco husk of the former
Hattem's Store, a 1931 supermarket and shopping arcade that later
became the administrative building of Pepperdine University, as an
anchor to draw commercial storefronts and stable housing back to
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Avenue is one of the city's longest streets, stretching
from the port at San Pedro north to the Hollywood Hills. But
beginning 40 years ago, as white residents fled to the suburbs and
were replaced by working class blacks, retail businesses began
abandoning the strip, leaving the neighborhood lacking services
from dry cleaners to shoe repair. The situation was exacerbated by
the burning and looting _ and eventually the permanent closing _ of
scores of stores in the riots.
</P>
<P>
   But First Interstate's proposed remedy immediately ran into
intense opposition from black middle-class homeowners in Vermont
Knolls, a stable neighborhood of tidy yards and well-tended
single-family homes immediately to the west, who feared the project
would draw undesirable tenants from the much poorer, largely
Hispanic area that stretches in squalor from the east side of
Vermont Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Solomon's firm won the commission from a field of more
than 60 contenders, in partnership with Caleb Development, a
company owned by Rodney Shepard, an enterprising developer of
single-family homes in nearby Watts whose first career, in the
aerospace industry, was all but undone by cocaine addiction in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   His life in tatters, Shepard, whose father was a carpenter and
whose mother owned apartments in Watts, fell back on the business
he knew: he began rehabilitating and, eventually, building
single-family homes for sale there, in the process earning a
``1-A'' rating from Dun &AMP; Bradstreet and expanding his sights.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and Shepard sought to address neighborhood concerns by
shrinking the project from 100 units to 60, to 40 and finally to 36
homes, with room for about a dozen retail outlets and more in the
former Hattem's building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought this was one time when not-in-my-backyard
resistance to low-income housing was justified and agreed that it
should be subsidized market-rate instead,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   First Interstate, which was bought by Wells Fargo during the
project, contributed $3 million of the initial construction cost
and the city council overrode Mayor Richard J. Riordan's veto to
kick in the remaining $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Units were priced from $89,000 to $118,000, and all but one have
sold, half of them to members of the nearby Crenshaw Christian
Center, a giant nondemoninational church complex on what had been
the Pepperdine campus before the school moved to Malibu. But the
project proved unable to draw enough market-rate buyers, and 21 of
the purchasers received heavy subsidies in the form of
second-mortgages backed by the city that allowed downpayments as
low as 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who qualified was Sharon Johnson, a single mother
of two and a customer relations manager for Viking Office Products
who had lived in the south Los Angeles suburb of Gardena and drove
past the project on her way to an event at the nearby Sports Arena.
She now has a spanking new three-bedroom unit, and her 10-year old
daughter even has her own bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my dream home,'' she said recently as she stood
surrounded by moving boxes and mattresses in a house whose
nine-foot ceilings make it seem larger than the roughly 1,600
square feet it is.
</P>
<P>
   Both Solomon and Shepard sigh at the long trail of complexities
involved in getting the project built and laugh ruefully at the
occasional cultural divide between the black inner-city developer
and the white academic architect. When a visitor remarked on the
flowering vines growing up galvanized chains in the inner
courtyard, Shepard just shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even go there,'' Shepard said. ``I said to Dan, `Do you
know what chains mean to a black man?' And he said, `Look at it
this way: you broke your chains and hung them on the wall.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Shepard's biggest concern is leasing out the
storefronts (tenants could range from a bakery to a private post
office like Mail Boxes Etc.) and winning city council approval for
money to finance commercial-tenant improvements, plant trees on the
median lining the street and rehabilitate the 26,000 square feet of
commercial space in the former Hattem's Store.
</P>
<P>
   It now sits empty on the corner of the site, its distinctive
faceted tower looming like those of the vintage movie palaces that
still dot Los Angeles, its sea-foam paint peeling and at odds with
the new project meant to echo it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, because you've got these beautiful town houses
and then you've got this big eyesore,'' Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the challenge is just beginning. Solomon Inc.'s official
description of the project starts with these sobering words:
``Isolated development initiatives and autonomous architectural
works will not begin to redress the problems of South-Central Los
Angeles. South-Central is confronted with the task of rebuilding
whole streets and linking separated enclaves into a larger
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the interview, Solomon said: ``The lesson is that the
housing demand is there in these neighborhoods, if the housing is
priced right and designed properly for security and space, and
quite high density housing can thrive on those corridors. It's
easier to make the housing part of it work than the commercial
part, but the commercial part is terribly important.''

CLINTON MEDICARE PLAN TARGETS PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER AND RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time slipping away for new legislative
accomplishments, President Clinton Tuesday offered a plan to shore
up the shaky finances of Medicare, imposing more cutbacks on
financially strapped hospitals and giving seniors several new
benefits, including partial coverage for the cost of prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit would be the most significant expansion of
Medicare since its inception in 1965, when pharmaceuticals were
much less costly and less central to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's drug proposal, which would start in 2002 if
approved by Congress, seniors and the disabled would be charged $24
a month, or $288 a year, for insurance to cover half of their first
$2,000 in drug costs, or up to $1,000 in annual reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   When fully in place in 2008, beneficiaries would pay $44 a
month, or $528 annually, for Medicare to cover half of their first
$5,000 in drug purchases, or up to $2,500 in annual reimbursements.
The program would be voluntary, and the government would waive or
share the premium for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also would end all existing co-payments and deductibles
for preventive care already offered by Medicare, such as screening
tests for osteoporosis and for breast, colon, cervical and prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also aims to add 12 years to the financial health of
Medicare, assuring solvency until 2027. The money would come from
lower payments to health care providers and insurers _ who
complained loudly about the plan Tuesday _ and from future federal
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare plan comes just as the White House and the
Republican-led Congress head into what could be the last major
budget negotations of Clinton's presidency. Clinton has 18 months
left to serve, but he has already noted that the 2000 elections
will make compromises on sensitive issues, such as Medicare, more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare is part of a larger debate over how to spend massive
budget surpluses that the White House believes will reach $5.9
trillion over the next 15 years, assuming there is no prolonged
economic recession and that lawmakers do not pass large, new
spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to devote $794 billion of the expected surpluses
to Medicare, an even larger amount to Social Security, and smaller
sums to favored social programs, defense and a tax incentive for
low- and moderate-income workers to save for retirement.
Republicans also talk about shoring up Medicare, Social Security
and defense, but a large tax cut is likely to be the centerpiece of
their agenda, possibly as much as $778 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a thousand ways to spend the surplus, all of them
arguably attractive, but none more important than first
guaranteeing our existing obligation to secure quality health care
for our seniors,'' Clinton said in a White House speech to unveil
his Medicare proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers said some sort of drug coverage was a good
idea, but many also said the president was less interested in
fixing Medicare than in winning votes from seniors for Democratic
candidates next year. They said Clinton was wrong to offer new
benefits to wealthier seniors, while Medicare is already stressed
by the current benefit package.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more likely a politically driven benefit structure than
a benefit structure directed at the problem,'' said Senator Judd
Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Several major sectors of the health care industry also opposed
the plan, including hospitals and health insurers. Many of them are
posting financial losses they blame on steep Medicare cutbacks
approved in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would impose ``additional devastating cuts'' on
hospitals, said Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice president of the
Massachusetts Hospital Association. ``They would hurt. They would
affect every floor in every hospital in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Outright support for the president's proposal was scarce.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy called it ``the right prescription,'' but
Senator John F. Kerry, while generally supportive, warned that it
would cut too much from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the nation's second-largest domestic program after
Social Security, offers health insurance to 34 million seniors and
5 million disabled Americans. Beneficiaries already pay a $45.50
monthly premium to cover doctor's office visits.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics said the drug proposal offered too much help to
certain seniors, and others said it offered too little to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said Clinton ignored
the fact that two-thirds of seniors already have drug coverage,
mainly through their former employers. Clinton would ``impose more
tax burden on young working families'' to pay for insurance many
people already have _ an idea that ``makes absolutely no sense
economically.''
</P>
<P>
   A relatively small proportion of elders _ only 4 percent,
according to the administration, but up to 20 percent in some
studies _ have medication costs above $2,000 a year, and several
experts said Clinton should do more for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people at the low end of the income strata, the Clinton
plan helps, but it doesn't help enough,'' said Thomas Smedden,
director of a Pennsylvania pharmacy assistance program that enrolls
250,000 low-income elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beneficiary with an income of $12,000 and pharmacy costs of
$4,900, which is not unusual, would get only $1,000 from the
Clinton plan, leaving $325 a month in out-of-pocket costs,'' said
Steven Soumerai of Harvard Medical School. ``They can't possibly
afford their medicines, which is basically unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the prescription drug benefit would cost $118
billion over 10 years. To cover these new costs, as well as to ward
off the projected insolvency of the Medicare program by 12 years,
he proposed:
</P>
<P>
   -- Directing $794 billion in future budget surpluses to Medicare
over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Requiring beneficiaries to pay 20 percent of the cost of lab
services, and raising the $100 ``Part B'' deductible for physician
and outpatient services each year to keep pace with inflation. This
would save $11 billion over 10 years, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Obtaining bulk discounts on goods and services. Instead of
paying all doctors a flat fee to treat a disease or perform
surgery, for example, Medicare would seek volume discounts from a
small number of doctors. This would save $25 billion over 10 years,
the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, Clinton's former Medicare and Medicaid chief, who
is now director of the Institute for Medicare Practice at Mount
Sinai Medical School in New York, said the cost-savings were
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it will save money,'' Vladeck said. ``There has been
demonstrated experience. With coronary bypass surgery you can save
10 to 15 percent and get better results.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Cutting payments to health care providers by $31.5 billion
over 10 years. More than half the cuts would come from payments to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Encouraging private insurers to compete with Medicare. The
White House said managed care insurers could provide plans
identical to Medicare, but at a lower cost, saving the government
$8 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignani, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, said Clinton should fix an existing system that encourages
managed care companies to offer Medicare plans. She said Clinton's
plan included too many restraints on managed care companies that
want to offer plans to seniors.

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following through on a promise to preserve Medicare
for the aging baby boom generation, President Clinton on Tuesday
proposed fundamental changes in the program to make it more like
private health insurance and to add coverage of prescription drugs,
a benefit long sought by the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal, one of the biggest domestic policy initiatives of
the last three decades, would help keep Medicare solvent until
2027, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The president who rode into office with a promise to guarantee
health insurance for all said he was hoping to close his
administration by enhancing the giant health program for the
elderly and the disabled. The number of Americans 65 and older is
expected to double in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged a potential contradiction
in their efforts to shore up Medicare while creating a costly new
benefit. The savings from structural changes in the program,
including greater competition and prudent purchasing techniques,
would be dwarfed by a huge infusion of cash from the federal
treasury: $374 billion in the next 10 years, and a total of $794
billion from 2000 to 2014.
</P>
<P>
   The economic context for Clinton's proposal could hardly be
better. A vibrant economy has generated a windfall of federal
revenue. The White House said this week that it foresaw surpluses
totaling nearly $3 trillion over the next decade. One in eight of
those dollars would go to shore up Medicare under the president's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nation bursting with prosperity, no senior should have to
choose between buying food and buying medicine,'' Clinton told a
bipartisan audience at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, drug coverage would be voluntary, but the
administration said it would be such a good bargain that almost
everybody would take it. In 2002, the first year of the proposal,
each person would pay a premium of $24 a month _ $288 a year _ for
drug coverage. Medicare would cover half of a person's drug costs,
up to a limit of $1,000 on the first $2,000 of drug expenses. The
premium would rise to $44 a month in 2008, and the government would
pay a maximum of $2,500, or half of drug expenses up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a drug benefit our seniors can afford, at a price
America can afford,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said the fast-growing budget surplus improved the
prospects for passage of a major Medicare overhaul. But beneath the
inklings of bipartisanship Tuesday, the old suspicions lingered.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress reacted cautiously. They did not reject
Clinton's proposals out of hand, saying they, too, wanted to
restructure Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for the elderly said enactment of a Medicare drug
benefit prior to next year's elections was a long shot. But they
rejoiced that Clinton had put the issue high on the nation's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton would offer drug coverage to all 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries, Republicans said Congress should start by
helping the 15.5 million who do not have such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert,
and the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, said, ``We should be
careful not to force those who already have prescription drug
coverage to accept a government-run plan that costs more and
provides fewer choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would ``bring to the traditional Medicare
program the best practices from the private sector,'' allowing the
government to use its immense purchasing power to bargain with
suppliers of medical goods and services. He also proposed changes
to encourage price competition among health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs and other forms of managed care dominate the commercial
health insurance market, but have attracted only 16 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing coverage of prescription drugs and improved
coverage of preventive health care services, Clinton said he was
trying to modernize Medicare. ``Nobody would devise a Medicare
program today, if we were starting all over, without including a
prescription drug benefit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, beneficiaries would pay extra premiums
totaling $110 billion over the next 10 years, and the government
would put up $118 billion.
</P>
<P>
   People with low incomes (under $17,000 a year for a couple)
would not have to pay premiums or the beneficiary's share of the
drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gail E. Shearer, a health policy expert at Consumers Union,
said, ``The proposed drug benefit offers consumers good value _ far
better than they can now get in the Medigap market,'' which offers
private insurance to supplement Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates that the new drug benefit would cost
the Treasury $21.8 billion a year in 2009, and it anticipates that
the costs then would be growing about 11 percent a year _ much less
than the increases in drug spending reported recently by private
health plans. This disparity will inevitably raise questions about
whether the administration has underestimated the long-term cost of
its proposal, as the government has done with other Medicare
benefits in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements of Clinton's plan had been disclosed in recent
weeks, but there were a few surprises Tuesday. For example, he
proposed to eliminate all co-payments, deductibles and other
charges that beneficiaries pay for preventive services covered by
Medicare. These services include screening for osteoporosis and for
breast, colon and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for a study to see if Medicare should cover
services to help people quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president also proposed to make beneficiaries pay
20 percent of the cost of laboratory services, for which they now
pay little or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he asked Congress to increase the deductible amount
that Medicare beneficiaries pay for doctors' services and
outpatient hospital visits. The deductible has been fixed by law at
$100 a year since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the deductible would be automatically
increased each year to reflect increases in consumer prices. In
other words, it would be indexed for inflation, as measured by the
Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are other highlights of Clinton's proposal:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs could, for the first time, compete on the prices they
charge Medicare beneficiaries. If a beneficiary chose a low-cost
HMO, he or she could keep 75 cents of every dollar saved. HMOs
would have to provide all the benefits covered by the traditional
Medicare program and could offer more.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would offer subsidies to employers as an
incentive for them to continue providing health benefits to retired
workers. Many employers have curtailed such coverage, in part
because of the high cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would continue many of the Medicare cuts that
were made by Congress in 1997 and are scheduled to expire in 2003.
However, the administration said it would provide some financial
relief for nursing homes, home health care agencies and hospitals
that serve large numbers of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the president's Medicare
proposal had ``one major flaw: New York's hospitals are given short
shrift.'' Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said the president would restore only a small fraction
of the cuts made in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Bedlin, vice president of the National Council on the
Aging, a research and advocacy group, welcomed the president's
proposal for drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful if a bipartisan consensus emerged, but
it's a long shot,'' Bedlin said. ``Prescription drug benefits are
so complex in substance, so controversial politically and so
expensive, I'd be surprised if any major reform was enacted before
2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Dillon, co-owner of Grubb's Pharmacy, a century-old store
four blocks east of the Capitol, said Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs was probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we not do it?'' Dillon asked. But he said: ``Everybody
is underestimating the cost. There's a tremendous pent-up demand.
Lots of people are not taking the drugs they should because they
can't afford the cost. I'm not talking about Viagra and Rogaine, to
grow hair. I'm talking about drugs to keep people alive and
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the coordinator of health policy at the White
House, said people on Medicare would not abuse drug benefits
because they would have to pay half the cost of any medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The government would hire private companies to manage drug
benefits for the elderly. These companies could establish lists of
preferred drugs. But, Jennings said, a doctor could still prescribe
drugs not on the list ``if it was medically appropriate to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, employers and health plans have reported sharp
increases in spending for prescription drugs. Segal Co., an
employee benefits consulting concern, told its clients last week
that they ``should expect to see 1999 prescription drug costs rise
by an average of 16 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   PCS Health Systems of Scottsdale, Ariz., said private health
plans saw drug spending increases in the range of 14 percent to 18
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Total retail drug spending in the United States has nearly
doubled in the last six years and now exceeds $90 billion a year.
New, more effective medicines often cost three or four times as
much as older drugs for the same condition.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry reacted warily. ``We agree on the need to
expand drug coverage for seniors, but we want to make sure it's
done in the right way,'' said Alan Holmer, president of
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. ``We plan to
review the president's plan with great care.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is planning a major public campaign on the issue
of Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, revolving around the
industry's aversion to anything resembling price controls, which it
asserts would stifle research.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had high praise for the president's proposal. Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, said the
proposal ``will be the single greatest improvement to the Medicare
program since its inception'' in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Clinton had found ``the
right prescription for Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Medicare proposal is, in many ways, a careful piece of
politics, reflecting some of the hard-learned lessons of previous
struggles over health care, including Clinton's campaign for
universal coverage in 1993-94 and the last big Medicare expansion
attempted in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials presented their plan Tuesday as
completely voluntary, aimed at helping the middle class as well as
the poor, and structured to run with only the lightest regulatory
hand. In other words, they said, it is far different from the vast
quasi-governmental apparatus proposed by the president six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts said, it will be difficult to pass any major
health care proposal in a Congress getting ready for the political
warfare of an election season. Robert Reischauer, former director
of the Congressional Budget Office, said, ``A prescription drug
benefit is very attractive to Republicans and Democrats in the
abstract, but when the details are laid out, they will be
controversial.''

WHEN A MAGNATE TRIED TO PLAY MOVIE CENSOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Orson Welles made his masterpiece ``Citizen Kane''
in 1941, it was no secret that the film's protagonist, Charles
Foster Kane, was a barely fictionalized version of William Randolph
Hearst, the newspaper magnate whose enormous empire was then
beginning to falter under a barrage of debts.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a drama behind the drama, as Welles _ then just 25
and swelled by the arrogance of youth and genius _ found himself up
against the full force of Hearst's fury. Hearst was desperate to
stop the film, no matter what the cost, and nearly succeeded in
having it destroyed before it had ever been released.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story of their battle is to be the subject of its own
film. ``RKO 281,'' which takes its name from ``Citizen Kane's''
working title at the RKO studio, will have its premiere on HBO in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The new film, which sets out to paint a vivid picture of prewar
Hollywood before World War II as much as to describe the personal
contest between two larger-than-life men, shows how Welles and the
Hollywood screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz conceived of and wrote
the script that became ``Citzen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   And it shows how Hearst, furious above all at the film's
devastating portrait of Marion Davies, his longtime mistress, used
every weapon in his power to try to bully and blackmail the heads
of Hollywood's major studios into buying up and destroying every
last print.
</P>
<P>
   ``RKO 281,'' whose lavish sets and starry cast _ including John
Malkovich, Melanie Griffith, Liev Schrieber and James Cromwell _
helped drive up costs to the far end of HBO's usual $6 million to
$10 million film budget, had its genesis in a PBS documentary
several years ago. When the producer and director Ridley Scott saw
the documentary, ``The Making of Citizen Kane,'' he was transfixed
by the story's dramatic potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the office like his hair was on fire and said,
`We've got to get this made into a movie,''' said Chris Zarpas,
president of Scott Free Productions, Scott's company. What
particularly excited Scott, said Zarpas, was Welles' effort to
maintain artistic freedom and creative autonomy against the
all-powerful Hollywood studio system.
</P>
<P>
   (Scott had similar problems with his futuristic epic
``Bladerunner,'' said Zarpas, in which he had to fight for his
vision ``against the studio Wonder Bread machine.'')
</P>
<P>
   But, whether by coincidence or because of a darker reason, Scott
had his own troubles when he took the idea for ``RKO 281'' to
Hollywood. None of the studios he approached would make the movie.
It's unclear exactly why they turned down the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But John Matoian, who was president of HBO Pictures and of HBO's
New York arm, HBO NYC, when ``RKO 281'' began production (he has
since been succeeded by Colin Callender), said that a film about
Welles' struggles with the studio system might have been too close
to the bone for Hollywood, even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, my guess is that it also gets to the very core of
the art-versus-commerce nature of studio decision making and hits
it very hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once HBO had taken the project on, the biggest challenge became
how to portray characters that loom so large in America's recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   To play Orson Welles, who died in 1985, as a historical figure
in the first place is a challenge, said Schreiber, lately of ``A
Walk on the Moon,'' whose glancing resemblance to the young Welles
helped him procure the part (normally lanky, he gained 20 pounds
through an all-food, all-the-time diet).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tremendous respect for him,'' said Schreiber. ``He
was a hero of mine long before I took this job, and it's difficult
in any case to play contemporary historical figures, who own a
relatively recent place in people's memories. I think it's a bad
idea to try to mimic someone; I think you want to stay away from
drawing comparisons and almost create him as a fictional
character.''
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with a scene that is pure fiction: a white-tie
banquet at San Simeon, Hearst's enormous California estate, at
which Welles is shown mingling with guests like Clark Gable and
Carole Lombard. (The scene was shot here, in the grand Guildhall,
one of many British locations that serve as San Simeon interiors.)
</P>
<P>
   After managing to alienate and insult his host, Welles comes
away from the evening with a burning desire to capture him on film,
conceiving of him as an epic bully whose story is quintessentially,
tragically American. He finds a perfect partner in the brilliant
and self-destructive Mankiewicz (John Malkovich), a friend of
Davies' who has long harbored dreams of writing about Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Hearst would never have invited Welles to San
Simeon. But, said Ben Ross, the movie's director, ``I don't think
that sort of liberty is a disgraceful one, because it doesn't go
against any fundamental truths about Welles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not supposed to be a literal interpretation,'' he added.
``Once you start making a picture, what concerns me is dramatic
integrity. We did take factual liberties, but if we got to the
spiritual core of the story and the man, if we were able to convey
a picture of Welles as a young filmmaker and what it was that made
him want to make pictures, I think we'll be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Hearst goes, ``RKO 281'' presents him as Welles
himself did in ``Citizen Kane'': as a megalomaniacal bully who
wielded his power like a blunt instrument. But it shows another,
more tender, side of him too, particularly in his relationship to
Davies, with whom he lived for years because his wife would not
grant him a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   What infuriated him more than anything about ``Citizen Kane,''
perhaps, was its callous use of a piece of gossip that probably
came from Mankiewicz: Rosebud, as it happened, wasn't just a
child's sled, but Hearst's private name for his mistress'
genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spoiled, rich and self-serving, but he was also
generous, loving and humorous,'' said James Cromwell, who plays
Hearst (he also played the farmer in ``Babe'' and the corrupt
police official in ``L.A. Confidential''). Long involved in
left-wing politics, Cromwell has always hated Hearst's awesome
political sway and his family's power, which made him a
particularly interesting choice for the part. It also sent him back
to biographies of Hearst and caused him to re-evaluate the man a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm learning not to look at things in black and
white,'' said Cromwell. ``He did a great deal of damage, but he was
also a guy trying to do the best he could.''
</P>
<P>
   As Davies, Melanie Griffith is also taking the opportunity to
rehabilitate her character's reputation, a reputation sealed by
Dorothy Comingore's devastating portrayal of Davies in ``Citizen
Kane'' as a shallow, spoiled gold digger with a voice that could
shatter glass at 100 yards. Years later, Welles himself said he
regretted what he had done to Davies in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   As ``RKO 281'' points out, Davies, a one-time showgirl,
genuinely loved Hearst, at one point selling her jewelry to help
him out when financial ruin seemed imminent. She was also a gifted
comic actress who was badly served by her lover's misguided
attempts to turn her into an opera star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had a chance to show her in another light, and maybe
change people's opinion of her,'' Ms. Griffith said. ``I don't
believe she was an idiot at all. I've tried to give her some depth
and feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Always looming in the background, of course, was the shadow of
Welles, the great filmmaker who went into a long, slow decline in
the years after ``Citizen Kane,'' beaten down by his struggles with
the studios and by the tentacles of Hearst's influence (among other
things, Hearst refused to allow even a single mention of ``Citizen
Kane'' in any of the newspapers in his considerable empire).
</P>
<P>
   In making their self-referential film about the making of a
film, producers and actors alike had to contend with their feelings
about Welles' legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welles is one of the few filmmakers I feel I've lived with for
a long time; there isn't a frame of his pictures that I don't
know,'' Ross said. ``And I think there's a parallel between him and
every filmmaker who ever tried to make an independent picture.''

PLAN GROUP WARNS OF `UNQUANTIFIABLE RISK' OF Y2K PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also Y2K-LAWSUITS) 
(mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Year 2000 computer problems are unlikely to prevent
residents of the New York region from getting water, food and
health care, from completing their commuting, or from getting rid
of their wastes, according to three studies to be issued Wednesday
by the Regional Plan Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among the good news items:
</P>
<P>
   _ New York City's Health and Hospitals Corp., which serves many
poor, inner-city residents, has one of the most aggressive Year
2000 preparation programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has completed work
on all the computers and equipment necessary to run trains and
buses with only record-keeping systems still to be updated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Water, sewer and garbage services run on equipment that can be
operated without help from computers if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the planning group warns that the studies found that there
was still an ``unquantifiable risk'' of major disruptions. Its
concerns include the complex relationships among the basic service
sectors, like the reliance of nearly everyone on power and phone
service, and the impossibility of locating and testing every
computer embedded in larger pieces of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The reports also warned that, as in the rest of the country,
small businesses, nonprofit organizations and communities in the
region appear to be lagging in preparations. The group is also
concerned that Y2K, as the computer problem is popularly known, is
widely mentioned in popular media and everyday chat but poorly
understood by most people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need a contingency plan for themselves and their
companies so that they are not caught panicking at the 11th hour,''
said Brendan Dugan, a banker who is co-chairman of the group's Y2K
Task Force with Bishop Joseph Sullivan, an executive with Catholic
Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Plan Association's effort is the first broad Year
2000 study of the three-state metropolitan area, which is home to
nearly a tenth of the nation's people.
</P>
<P>
   The reports include a variety of details to reinforce points.
The health care report, for instance, tempers the generally good
news by citing several institutions, like the financially troubled
Flushing Hospital Medical Center, that may have difficulty
finishing computer repairs by the end of this year. It also notes
that contingency planners are just beginning to turn their
attention to some issues that may be critical to some citizens,
like locating people whose lives depend on uninterrupted power for
home medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The reports should serve as a starting point for New York's
scheduled ``Community Conversation'' on July 28, organized by the
Regional Plan Association, said James Devlin, a Citibank vice
president who served on the task force. The Community Conversation
program, which was recently initiated by President Clinton's
Council on Year 2000 Conversion, asks local business and political
leaders to be hosts for an open meeting to answer public questions
about local Year 2000 readiness and contingency planning.
</P>
<P>
   New York is behind many cities in public discussion of Year 2000
work, according to Regional Plan officials and many Year 2000
experts. But Wednesday's report, the July 28 meeting and several
other initiatives, like the major expansion two weeks ago of the
city's Year 2000 Web page at www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/y2k, may begin
to close that gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the longstanding custom in
computer programming of using two digits to refer to the year in
dates, like 99 for 1999. That practice saved valuable memory space,
but it left many computers and software programs vulnerable to
breakdowns when confronted with 00 in dates.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Plan Association task force made nine
recommendations, including calling for public and private sector
leaders to make a priority of identifying individuals and groups
most likely to be hurt by any disruptions, urging more effort to
involve the public in preparations, and sharing of emergency
planning efforts with community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The group also urged churches, synagogues and volunteer groups
to get involved in preparing for disruptions and to be ready to
provide emergency services.

SENATE DEAL ON HMO DEBATE BREAKS LOGJAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a week of intense partisan feuding
that plunged the Senate into utter paralysis, Republicans and
Democrats reached an agreement Tuesday on how and when to consider
legislation to give patients new guarantees from their health
insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   The decision cleared the way for the Senate to pass several
spending bills held captive by the logjam, and it set the stage for
four full days of debate and votes in mid-July on an issue that
promises to be every bit as contentious as new restrictions on
firearms were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real fireworks are going to be  &UR; after  &LR; the Fourth of
July,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., just after the deal
was struck.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's subtly triumphant voice indicated the sense among
Democrats that they had engineered a victory like the one they
claimed on gun control _ that is, once again forcing Senate
Republicans to tackle a politically charged topic before they
necessarily wanted to, and at greater length.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans had said for days that they were willing to find
some kind of accommodation. Democrats, they insisted, were
deliberately resisting a reasonable deal because they were more
interested in staging political tirades than actually getting
anything done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a farce,'' Lott had said on the Senate floor late
Monday. ``But it's not a happy one. It's a sad one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Republicans made more concessions to Democrats than
they were initially prepared to. The compromise was forced on them
by the fact that Democrats had employed parliamentary tactics to
keep the Senate in an indefinite state of suspended animation,
beginning last Tuesday, and had vowed to continue doing so until
Republicans agreed to imminent consideration of new guarantees for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Senate,'' Lott said late Tuesday, ``you have to be
prepared to deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Senate will begin to debate and vote on
what has come to be known as the patients' bill of rights _ a set
of new regulations and requirements for health insurance plans _ on
July 12, the first day that the lawmakers return from a week-long
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Consideration of the bill would last four days, with a time
limit for each amendment. Democrats believe they will have enough
time to introduce most or all of the 20 amendments they want.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the stalemate, Democrats had been pressing for
an assurance that they would be able to do that, but Republicans
had been unwilling to provide one. The deal the parties ultimately
struck essentially creates a likelihood _ but not a guarantee _
that the Democrats will get to make all the points that they want
to.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House passed legislation defining new rights for
patients within their health insurance plans last year, Republicans
in the Senate voted not to bring it to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   What will come to the Senate floor on July 12 is a Republican
bill that was approved by a Senate committee, in a strict
party-line vote, in March.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is aimed in particular at patients enrolled in health
maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care, and it
would give them new rights like an external appeals process
whenever an insurer denies treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But significant portions of the Republican proposal affect only
about 48 million Americans in plans not regulated by the states. A
rival Democratic proposal, whose principal sponsors include Kennedy
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, affects
about triple that number of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Democratic proposal puts significantly more
control in the hands of patients and doctors _ an emphasis that
Republicans say is untenably costly _ and removes the tall hurdles
that currently prevent most patients from suing their health
insurance plans for botched treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In pressing Republicans for a sustained, wide-ranging debate,
Democrats sought the ability to offer various pieces of their
proposal as amendments to analogous portions of the Republican
plan.
</P>
<P>
   They said that while most Republicans would stick with their
party in simple, broad votes on the overall Republican vs.
Democratic plans, many Republicans would be reluctant to cast
repeated no votes on portions of the Democratic plan that seemed
more sympathetic to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great victory for 160 million Americans who today
are demanding that Congress act,'' Daschle said.

`WILD, WILD WEST' ESSENTIALLY A CARTOON, OFFERING NO INVOLVEMENT
WITH CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The one thing you can say with some certainty about
Barry Sonnenfeld's incorrigibly silly and juvenile big-screen
version of the '60s TV show, ``The Wild Wild West,'' is that it's
amazingly faithful to its source.
</P>
<P>
   As he did with his ``Addams Family'' TV-to-film translation,
Sonnenfeld has massively blown up the premise and added a layer of
sexual innuendo to every scene, but he resolutely retains the
original's style and sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   And this is something of a surprise, since the film's title has
lost the article, its main character has undergone a race change,
and its MTV spots seem to promise Hollywood's first rap western.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not, however, this fidelity will translate into the
kind of summer blockbuster the film needs to be to recoup its $100
million investment is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even in its own time, the show had very limited appeal.In our
time, it has had such limited rerun exposure that the 13-year-old
male audience at which the movie is so obviously aimed will have no
identification with it.
</P>
<P>
   Since its star, Will Smith, is the the only aspect of the movie
that links it to its target audience, the whole project is a huge
test of his stardom. If it flops, it's likely to seriously diminish
Smith's lightning career momentum. But if it works, he'll finally
emerge as the Tom Cruise-level superstar he's been threatening to
be since ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Set just after the Civil War, the film tells the story of how
U.S. Secret Service agents-to-be James West (Will Smith) and
Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) team up for the first of many times to
save the nation from some super-villain.
</P>
<P>
   This first enemy is a renegade scientist (Kenneth Branagh) who
has kidnapped the world's leading scientists, and forced them to
make him a super weapon: a tanklike military machine that looks
like a gigantic spider and moves like some ``Star Wars''
contraption.
</P>
<P>
   After several encounters back East, the action moves to Utah,
where, in what seems an hourlong climax, the boys battle the
villain in a desperate effort to save the life of kidnapped
President U.S. Grant (also played by Kline).
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   If it does, it may be because virtually every element of the
plot appeared, at one time or another, in the old series, which ran
from 1965 to 1970 and began as a deliberately campy western spoof
of the James Bond films.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of the show will enjoy the deja vu, as well as the
elaborate and imaginative design and look of the film, which uses
computer animation to take the old Rube Goldberg gadgetry of the
series to undreamed of heights of mechanical delirium.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the stars shine. Both are noticeably shaky
through the first act, but settle into the roles and develop a
workable buddy chemistry that's helped by Branagh's delightfully
hammy turn as their cackling nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's problem is that it's a cartoon, offering no
emotional involvement with its characters and no dramatic
imperative. (Seriously, folks, does anyone really care what happens
to the most corrupt president in U.S. history?)
</P>
<P>
   And since there's no real menace or threat, the endless
cliffhanger situations inevitably become tedious and boring (there
were several walk-outs in my row at the Seattle preview).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the writing and situations, of course, are witty and
clever, but never hugely so, and the six credited writers never
give Sonnenfeld the kind of distinctive comic style he managed in
the ``Addams'' movies and ``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   In a curious way, the film is reminiscent of last summer's
remake, also by Warner Bros., of a '60s television show, ``The
Avengers.'' Like that film, it's overblown and immensely loyal to a
premise that's had its day, but not much else.
</P>

A FEW TRIVIAL DRAFT PURSUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything you wanted to know about the NBA Draft, but were too
busy having a life to even consider:
</P>
<P>
   The first center expected to be selected is 7-foot-3 Serbian
Aleksandar Radojevic, who just finished his second season at Butler
County (Kan.) Junior College. Radojevic, 22, had signed a letter of
intent to play at Ohio State, but was busted by the NCAA for
accepting cash to make an on-court appearance in Yugoslavia. If you
must have a game and a name for the sake of comparison, think of
finesse-oriented center Zydrunas Ilgauskas of the Cleveland
Cavaliers. If you've never heard of Ilgauskas, it means you took a
wrong turn at the horse-racing page.
</P>
<P>
   Two prospects escaped from high school this month and waded into
the 1999 draft pool. Jonathan Bender (6-11) of Picayune Memorial
High in Picayune Miss, should be selected in the top five. Leon
Smith (6-9) of Martin Luther King High in Chicago, figures to be
second-round material.
</P>
<P>
   The alumni list of players who hopped from high school to the
NBA: Darryl ``Chocolate Thunder'' Dawkins and Bill ``Poodles''
Willoughby (1975); Kevin ``Da Kid'' Garnett (1995); Kobe ``Jumping
Bean'' Bryant and Jermaine ``Tip-Dunk'' O'Neal (1996); Tracy
``Vince Carter's Cousin'' McGrady (1997); Al ``Well-Rested''
Harrington, Rashard ``The 6-10 Guard'' Lewis and Korleone ``An
Offer I Should Have Refused'' Young (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Eight teams do not have first-round picks today. Sitting out the
first 29 selections (barring trade) will be Detroit, Milwaukee, New
Jersey, Portland, Philadelphia, Dallas, Sacramento and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California's contribution to the '99 draft includes
UCLA point guard Baron Davis, supposedly in Charlotte's crosshairs
with the third overall pick, and Utah point guard Andre Miller, the
Verbum Dei product who also will be chosen in the lottery. Stanford
point guard Arthur Lee (North Hollywood), Pepperdine's Jelani
Gardner, a 6-6 guard from St. John Bosco, and Arizona State forward
Michael Batiste (Long Beach) are candidates for second-round
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Round 2, wouldn't you like to see a list of current
NBA regulars who were chosen after Round 1? Of course you would.
The second-round honors list is as follows: Former Dominguez High
standout Cedric Ceballos, Nick Van Exel, Shandon Anderson, Ike
Austin, P.J. Brown, Howard Eisley, Matt Geiger, Steve Kerr, Toni
Kukoc, Long Beach State's Byron Russell, Bobby Phills and Grant
Long.
</P>
<P>
   Second-rounders currently starring as wrestlers: Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   No list of draft minutiae is complete without tossing the names
of a few ``sleeper'' prospects against the wall. This year's
sleepers (players who have enough talent to avoid being put to
sleep) include: Dion Glover (Georgia Tech), Antwain Smith (St.
Paul's, a Division II school in Virginia), Radojevic, 7-1 Frederic
Weis (Limoges of France) and Jason Miskiri (George Mason). Glover,
who finished the 1998 season as one of the nation's top freshmen,
injured his knee on the first day of practice last season, and
hasn't played since. He won't be cleared to begin working out until
August, but the powerful, 6-5 shooting guard still may be snapped
up in the middle of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Devean George is a sleeper with his own category. George, a 6-7
forward from Augsburg (Minn.) College, is expected to go in the
second round, and would be the first Div. III player selected since
Golden State picked Lamont Strother of Virginia's Christopher
Newman College in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Our sleeper list for the Y2K Draft may include Chinese sensation
Yao Ming, an 18-year-old who was this close to slipping into the
1999 draft. Ming turned the heads of high school bird dogs a year
ago at the Nike Camp. Another year of seasoning with the Shanghai
Sharks, and the nimble, 7-5 Ming may be good to go. DePaul's
Quentin Richardson, a 6-6 sophomore-to-be, is another goodie who's
taking at least one an extra year before cutting his NBA teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But the kid now tweaking the interest of NBA scouts is Ajou Ajou
Deng of UConn. Deng, a 190-pound lightning bolt who's almost 7-feet
tall, is described by outgoing Huskies star Richard Hamilton as
``absolutely awesome.'' UConn coach Jim Calhoun, who has coached
both players, refers to Deng as a taller version of the late Reggie
Lewis.

A NEW FOCUS FOR MUSSORGSKY WITH `BORIS' AS LENS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Joseph Horowitz is the author of ``Wagner Nights'' and ``The
Post-Classical Predicament,'' among other books.  
 By JOSEPH HOROWITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most famous image of Modest Mussorgsky _ and one of the most
gripping of all 19th-century Russian paintings _ is Ilya Repin's
portrait of 1881: with its red nose, swollen eyes and sweaty,
unkempt hair, the countenance of dissolute genius.
</P>
<P>
   And Mussorgsky is indeed remembered as a kind of inspired
dilettante, whose insufficient formal training (his musical
education was unsystematic) and undisciplined personal habits (he
drank destructively) were offset by the Tolstoyan sweep and
Dostoyevskian acuity of his musical canvases.
</P>
<P>
   For decades after Mussorgsky's death, his stark orchestral and
keyboard textures were filled in by other hands. In particular, his
opera ``Boris Godunov'' was commonly heard as revised by
Rimsky-Korsakov, with its idiosyncracies of orchestration,
structure and musical speech smoothed away.
</P>
<P>
   Repin's indelible portrait was painted in a ward of alcoholics
one day before his friend Mussorgsky died; it depicts a state of
terminal dissipation. A more representative rendering would evoke
qualities of intellectual distinction and lucid craftsmanship we
have yet to integrate into our picture of the composer.
</P>
<P>
   True, ``Boris'' is today given without Rimsky's Technicolor
``improvements.'' And ``Pictures at an Exhibition'' is played by
pianists exactly as Mussorgsky wrote it: its octaves and tremolos
seem the more truthful for being naked. To portray Mussorgsky
fully, however, would require a full reconsideration of his
signature masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Mussorgsky wrote ``Boris Godunov'' twice. The first version,
composed at white heat in 1868 and 1869 to a libretto adapted from
Pushkin, comprises seven tableaux organized into four acts and
lasts barely two hours. It was submitted to the directorate of the
Imperial Theaters in 1871. The directors were impressed but asked
for changes, including a substantial female role.
</P>
<P>
   A second ``Boris,'' completed in 1872, consists of a prologue
and four acts and lasts almost three hours. An entire Polish act
was inserted, with a love duet, a ballet and a sultry princess (all
missing before). Elsewhere, Mussorgsky made abridgments and
additions. ``Boris'' was now accepted for performance. But further
alterations, by the conductor Eduard Napravnik, ensued. Rimsky's
popular edition appeared in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere, ``Boris'' is
often performed with Mussorgsky's original vocal and instrumental
parts. But what we usually (at the Met, always) hear is a
conflation of 1869 and 1872. This results in a panoramic ``Boris''
longer than either version Mussorgsky composed: an abundance of
marvels but, arguably, not a finished product. Rarely (at the Met,
never) is the original 1869 version revisited.
</P>
<P>
   This further stage in rediscovering Mussorgsky is more than
imminent. The most memorable ``Boris'' of my experience was the
unrevised 1869 opera as presented three years ago in St. Petersburg
by the Kirov Opera under the musical direction of Valery Gergiev.
And the Kirov and Gergiev have now recorded both versions of
``Boris'' side by side in a five-CD set from Philips.
</P>
<P>
   As given without intermission in St. Petersburg in 1996, ``Boris
Godunov'' unfolded with relentless immediacy, a single fatalistic
trajectory beginning with Boris' coronation and ending with his
death. Not only was the double tragedy of the guilty, guilt-ridden
Czar and his duped and abused subjects _ a timeless statement of
Russian political culture _ agonizingly realized; Mussorgsky was
also revealed as a startlingly laconic musical dramatist.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the handling of Grigory, pretender to the throne. In
1872, he is a recurrent presence, onstage for nearly an hour in
four different scenes. As a lover, he woos the Polish Princess
Marina. As a leader of men, he rouses peasant discontent in the
Kromy Forest. In short, he is the opera's tenor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1869, Grigory is onstage for less than half an hour: only in
the two scenes of Act II (both retained in 1872). A fledgling monk,
he learns that the Czarevitch Dmitri, murdered by Boris, was
precisely his own age, and (we infer) conceives the notion of
impersonating Dmitri and seizing power. In flight to Lithuania, he
stops at an inn, from which he is chased by the police. He leaps
out a window _ and disappears from the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Is this loose and sloppy dramaturgy? In fact, at the moment of
Grigory's early exit, we already know everything we need to know
about him; his lengthy appearances in Poland and the Kromy woods
add nothing to the initial portrait Mussorgsky has drawn with a few
deft strokes. The same economy shapes the entire 1869 score.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the pivotal scene in the Czar's apartments, Boris' monologue
_ his tortured confession _ has not yet acquired an elaborate prop:
the 1872 clock with chiming tritones that dramatize his anguish.
His exchange with the devious Shuisky is not yet embellished with
rhetorical ejaculations of mistrust. The horror of it all is
unrelieved by the 1872 animal ditties sung by the Czar's son and
his nurse.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges is a series of punishing vignettes, as ruthless for
their concision as for their grim import. The usual introductions
and transitions are curtailed or omitted. No wonder the directors
asked for revisions: this was a work decades ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the revisions they obtained were exemplary _ not
an expeditious patch job but a painstaking reconsideration of shape
and structure. Mussorgsky turned his compressed musical drama into
a grandly expansive Romantic opera.
</P>
<P>
   For Grigory and Marina, he composed some of his most lyrically
impassioned music and used it to create a complex ``love'' scene
riddled with suspicion and self-interest. For the Kromy Forest
finale (which in effect took the place of the taut confrontation
outside St. Basil's Church between Boris and a clairvoyant
simpleton), he created a widescreen pageant of peasants eternally
feckless and abused. In the scenes he retained, he gave the women
fresh tunes to sing and (straying far from Pushkin) transformed
declamatory musical speeches into something closer to songs.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it is idle to deny that the scissors and paste are
sometimes visible. The leisurely dramatic rhythm of the Polish act
risks seeming sluggish in juxtaposition with the scenes altered
least. The expanded female roles _ the nurse, the Czar's children,
the Innkeeper _ add colorful padding, not vital substance.
</P>
<P>
   For all its stirring amplitude, the 1872 ``Boris'' is more
conventionally operatic. Imagine ``Pictures at an Exhibition'' _
like the 1869 ``Boris,'' a trajectory of epigrams _ cushioned and
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   From Richard Taruskin's invaluable book ``Mussorgsky: Eight
Essays and an Epilogue,'' one learns that there exists a critical
tradition favoring the 1869 ``Boris Godunov.'' Reviewing a 1928
Leningrad production of the 1869 ``Boris,'' the pre-eminent Soviet
musicologist, Boris Asayev, called it ``more integrated, more
profound, more complete and more penetrating than any of the
revisions, including those of the author himself.'' Among other
writers to follow suit was Gerald Abraham, a leading English
scholar of Russian music.
</P>
<P>
   Taruskin himself prefers the 1872 ``Boris'' as an ``authentic
masterpiece.'' Whether or not he underrates the earlier version,
one outcome of his painstaking documentation and analysis of
Mussorgsky's revisions is a fresh understanding of the composer.
The recomposition of ``Boris Godunov,'' he demonstrates, was not a
capitulation to philistine objections, leaving confusion in its
wake, but a professional job, sophisticated and thorough. As a
summary image, Taruskin's Mussorgsky is much more valid than
Repin's.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that the Met's next ``Boris,'' scheduled for 2003,
is vintage 1869. Better yet, why not boldly juxtapose both versions
in the same season, as Philips has done on CD? A single cast and
production would do.

SOUTH CAROLINA AGAIN FAILS TO REIN IN VIDEO POKER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The video poker industry here is the largest in
the country, with 34,000 gambling machines blinking and beeping in
virtually every town in South Carolina. Its growth has exploded
because of an absence of any serious regulation, but once again
Tuesday, the state Legislature failed to agree on a method of
bringing it under control.
</P>
<P>
   Twice now Gov. Jim Hodges has called the Legislature into
special session in hopes that it will approve a referendum giving
voters a choice: either ban the gambling machines, or put them
under a regulatory system that would impose steep new taxes and
curb the growth of the casino-style machine emporiums that have
become ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   But for a variety of reasons, the House failed to pass the
governor's bill, falling five votes short of a two-thirds majority.
It was the sixth time the House had voted it down, and some members
believed that attempts at regulation and taxation had finally died.
But Hodges vowed to press on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 12 years to get into this mess, and it might take more
than a day to get out of it,'' he said after Tuesday night's vote.
</P>
<P>
   The ``mess'' he referred to is the stunning growth of electronic
gambling in a state that never consciously approved it. In the
1970s, the legislature agreed to let pinball machine owners pay a
small amount of money to winners. But when electronic video games
became popular a few years later, owners exploited the pinball
loophole and began attracting gamblers to electronic versions of
poker and blackjack, with payouts in the hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of court rulings that the machines did not
violate the anti-lottery provision of the state Constitution, the
industry grew tremendously, with only minor attempts at regulation.
Owners were making so much money, and contributing so much of it to
political campaigns of legislators, that proponents of regulation
could never produce agreement on real limits.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's 34,000 machines dwarf those of any other state,
including Nevada, the closest state in terms of numbers, with
17,922 machines outside of casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The machines blare their electronic jingles from gas stations
and convenience stores throughout South Carolina, and in dark
corners of restaurants and bars in virtually every town. Although
state law forbids more than five machines per establishment,
operators have easily sidestepped that rule by declaring each room
in a building a separate corporation, with its own door and
electric meter. This has led to the proliferation of casino-like
buildings with hundreds of the machines, each with the dark and
faintly illicit atmosphere of the old adult parlors of Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   Players sit mesmerized in front of the screens, feeding $10 and
$20 bills into the slots as they bet on games of five-card stud,
blackjack, and keno. The state theoretically prohibits winning more
than $120 a day, but the law is rarely enforced, and many machines
advertise jackpots of several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The report issued last week by the National Gambling Impact
Study Commission said the machines have become so addictive they
are known as the ``crack cocaine'' of gambling. It notes
disapprovingly that there is no age limit to play the machines in
South Carolina, although winners must be 21 to collect money from
the cashier.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the industry in South Carolina took in $2.5
billion last year, and paid out $1.8 billion to winners, while
paying the state only $60 million in licensing fees. That
relatively small tax revenue, along with the moral objections of
many legislators, is one of the reasons the referendum bill has
recently gained momentum in the State House.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's bill had passed and voters chose not to ban the
machines, the industry would have had to pay the state 25 percent
of its net income, no one under age 21 would have been allowed to
play, and large casino-style operations would have been banned.
But, in a concession to the industry, the $125 daily ceiling on
payouts to winners would have been increased to $500.
</P>
<P>
   That has led many gambling opponents to charge that the bill is
only a mild form of regulation that would do little to curb the
industry or reduce the addictive nature of the game that often
drains the paychecks of lower income families. Some of those
opponents aligned with industry supporters Tuesday to vote down the
referendum bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were making billions of dollars a year, and you
suddenly had to pay a quarter of that in taxes, would you go out of
business?'' asked state Rep. Bob Sheheen, a Democrat from Camden
who was formerly House speaker and is a bitter opponent of
gambling. ``I don't think so. All this is going to do is bring more
money to the state government, which will spend it all on enough
pork to choke the state of South Carolina.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The compromise has been pushed by Hodges, a one-time opponent of
gambling who switched sides during his election campaign last year
and accepted about $3 million _ half his campaign treasury _ from
video poker interests. His predecessor, David Beasley, called video
poker a ``cancer'' on the state and sought to ban it outright;
Hodges has said the voters should decide.
</P>
<P>
   Many supporters of the referendum were clearly angered by the
bill's surprise failure, particularly after legislative leaders had
predicted it would pass. Some black legislators apparently voted
against it because they believed not enough attention had been paid
to community development bills they had favored; some Republicans
seemed to be motivated by a desire to embarrass Hodges, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Terry E. Haskins, the speaker pro tem of the House and a
Republican who strongly favored the referendum, said he was tired
of the constant attempts at voting, even though he considers the
machines ``evil.'' He questioned how many more times the governor
could call the legislature back for special sessions if it keeps
voting no.
</P>
<P>
   But some anti-gambling legislators said there may be another way
to rein in the gambling machines. A federal judge recently ordered
the state to begin enforcing the $125-a-day limit on winnings, and
industry officials have said a ceiling that low might drive away
customers who dream of many more digits.

make me nostalgic for Frank O'Hara, the legendary poet who doubled
as an art critic, a museum curator and an all-purpose symbol of
bohemia's final moments in New York.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara easily qualifies as the American poet who had the largest
number of painter friends. To hear his name is to instantly
envisage street corners in Greenwich Village, dusty book shops
along Fourth Avenue and the Cedar Tavern in its smoke-filled heyday
_ images from an era when the worlds of art and poetry were still
entwined.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say when, exactly, that era ended. But I'd put it
somewhere around the early Sunday morning in July 1966 when O'Hara,
age 40, was hit by a jeep on the beach on Fire Island, N.Y.
Speaking at the funeral a few days later, the artist Larry Rivers
told the mourners: ``Frank O'Hara was my best friend. There are at
least 60 people in New York who thought Frank O'Hara was their best
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara proved that friendship is an art form all its own, as a
new exhibition reminds us. The show, ``In Memory of My Feelings:
Frank O'Hara and American Art,'' opens next Sunday at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and remains on view through Nov.
14.
</P>
<P>
   An appealingly sentimental affair, it rounds up some 100-odd
works by 25 members of the O'Hara gang _ from canonical Abstract
Expressionists (Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Philip Guston) to
underrated figurative painters (Fairfield Porter, Alice Neel, John
Button) to celebrated Pop Art pioneers (Jasper Johns, Claes
Oldenburg) to at least one essential eccentric (Joe Brainard, who
took his cue from comic strips before giving up art to devote
himself full-time to reading Victorian novels).
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara's lasting, cultish appeal goes beyond his accomplishments
as a poet. He was no less inspired as a personality. Thin and
animated, with light blue eyes and a broken nose, he talked
nonstop, survived on six hours of sleep a night and smoked three
packs of Camels a day.
</P>
<P>
   He was famously careless with his poems, shoving them into his
coat pockets or shelving them alongside his groceries. For all his
literary distinction, he didn't carry himself like a great poet; he
was free of the bruising egotism that so often characterizes
creative personalities. Funny, generous and always interested, ``he
became your friend in about six seconds,'' as the painter Jane
Freilicher has said. ``It was instant intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain how O'Hara became an adored figure among a
group of hard-drinking, malcontented artists. Ad Reinhardt once
said of the Cedar Tavern, ``We go there to meet the people we hate
most, the other painters.'' O'Hara, by contrast, seemed to have a
crush on almost everyone. He wrote poems in tribute to his
artist-friends and reviewed their shows (favorably) for Artnews
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in New York in 1951, he took a job selling postcards at
the Museum of Modern Art, where he ended up as a high-ranked
curator. His zealous promotion of the work of his friends and
lovers today might be called a conflict of interest, but, in the
'50s, contemporary art was worth so little money, there was no
opportunity for improper gain.
</P>
<P>
   As a champion of avant-garde artists, O'Hara was admirably
eclectic (and unsexist), an anomaly in an age when other writers
were bullishly taking sides. The leading critics of the '50s tended
to behave like campaign managers determined to get their candidates
into office.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Greenberg led the Pollock camp, while Harold Rosenberg
stood squarely behind de Kooning. It did not seem to occur to them
that in art, unlike government, there can be two kings, or 20
kings.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara, however, was aware of this. He was aware that the world
is not a small place and can accommodate artists of different and
even opposing styles. Did he have perfect taste? He made the
question seem irrelevant. Instead of a good eye, he prided himself
on his welcoming heart.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean he loved every new painting he saw. His basic
allegiance was to the unslick, opulently emotive art of the '50s,
to 10th Street as opposed to Madison Avenue. Tellingly, he did not
care for Warhol, describing him as ``chi-chi'' and ``walleyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Warhol once tried to score points with O'Hara by giving him a
painting of Marilyn Monroe as a gift. O'Hara stuck it in his
closet.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, O'Hara belongs to the New York School of poetry; the
best way to sum up his style is to say that his poems provide
sustained fun. They have a casual, colloquial tone, and they
elevate the least likely subjects _ gossip, phone numbers,
wisecracks from his friends _ into the stuff of art.
</P>
<P>
   He had no interest in musing on traditional poetic themes like
nature and the sublime. ``I can't even enjoy a blade of grass
unless I know there's a subway handy,'' he noted wryly in one poem.
</P>
<P>
   His love life was busy and complicated, as we know from Brad
Gooch's engaging biography, ``City Poet: The Life and Times of
Frank O'Hara,'' which appeared in 1993. Though openly gay, O'Hara
was drawn to men who were straight, ``or almost straight,'' as the
poet John Ashbery once said. He nurtured a long, futile passion for
Larry Rivers, whom he once compared to ``a demented telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew whether they wanted it in the library, the
kitchen, or the toilet, but it was electric,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotes go on and on, and after a while they can have a
strangely alcohol-like effect, blurring our vision and inducing a
sloppy, unexamined nostalgia for the lost past. On the other hand,
if the '50s have been sentimentalized to the hilt, O'Hara deserves
the fuss; the fabled artistic camaraderie of that era was in no
small part his own creation.
</P>
<P>
   He probably spent more time in artists' studios than any writer
of his age, asking little of his friends other than the chance to
loiter by their easels. There is no explaining the quality of his
devotion to artists, but here is one theory:
</P>
<P>
   A poet's desk is a chaste place with a typewriter, a stack of
white paper and perhaps an unabridged Oxford dictionary. Poets do
not entertain at their desks. An artist's studio, by contrast, is a
social place. Visitors get to look at art, catch up on news, sip
wine, listen to music and, in O'Hara's case, anyway, take off their
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rivers painted a full-length portrait of O'Hara in which
he appears stark naked except for a pair of army boots. Then again,
in Alex Katz's five-foot-tall wood cutout (1959-60), O'Hara wears a
jacket and tie, hands stiffly at his sides, a tense, remote
presence save for his bouncy widow's peak.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara posed more often than George Washington, and the
resulting portraits can be found in ``In Memory of My Feelings,''
which was organized by Russell Ferguson and takes its title from a
poem O'Hara started on his 30th birthday, leaving a sheet rolled in
his typewriter and returning to it over four days.
</P>
<P>
   Besides portraits, the show will feature photographs of O'Hara,
illustrated volumes of his poetry, collages on which he
collaborated and, for the most part, artworks that evoke his
presence indirectly, like Jasper Johns' poignantly empty,
grayed-over masterwork, ``In Memory of My Feelings _ Frank
O'Hara.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the paintings in the show are memorable mainly for their
documentary interest, including Elaine de Kooning's clunky, quite
garish portrait of O'Hara, which reminds us, for better and worse,
that he never let esthetic standards stand in the way of
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara belongs to the tradition of the poet art critic, which
goes back to 1845, when Charles Baudelaire began reviewing the
Salon exhibitions in Paris. These days, there is very little
overlap between artists and literary people, which is distressing
to anyone who cares about art and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Our culture is beset by a division of labor. Poets write poems,
artists make art and when they meet it is likely to be at some arts
awards ceremony sponsored by the government.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that O'Hara ranks as one of the great art
critics. While Baudelaire's criticism today commands at least as
much interest as his poems, O'Hara's criticism is hardly read at
all. His reviews for Artnews and Kulchur magazine were surprisingly
unremarkable; and though he wrote the first monograph on Jackson
Pollock (in 1957), he all but buried the artist beneath a mound of
hyperbolic, rhapsodic prose.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps only an imperfect critic can be a perfect
friend to artists, as O'Hara surely was. ``I am the least difficult
of men,'' he once wrote. ``All I want is boundless love.'' He
conducted his career in a spirit of infatuation _ and that is why
he is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown scene wasn't merely a life style for him, an excuse
to have a martini for breakfast (as he was fond of doing). More
important, downtown was a creative upland, a place where people
were caught in a shared sense of artistic adventure.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara deserves to be remembered for something that is now
practically defunct: the conviction that art and life can be
joyously mixed, and that a visit from a friend can amount to its
own small masterpiece.

`SOUTHPARK: UNCUT,' REVELS IN BEING IRREVERENT, RUDE AND GROSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ OK, I admit at first I was just laughing at the sheer
gutsiness of ``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
But after 10 minutes, I was laughing at the script.
</P>
<P>
   Because these guys didn't bother to skip targeting any sacred
cows in ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut.'' It's the big screen
debut _ definitely uncut _ of the groundbreaking adult animated TV
show that chronicles the adventures of a group of scatologically
obsessed third-graders who live in a peaceful place called South
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the film is more irreverent, rude, gross and obvious
than the original, and it gloriously revels in the freedom to be
all of the above and more.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to offend every faction in the film _ no one
is excused from skewering: not Germans, Christians, Satan, Jews,
African Americans, gays, the military, Saddam Hussein, bad Andrew
Lloyd Webber-type musicals, the Baldwin brothers and especially not
our neighbor to the north, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It all begins when best buddies Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny
pay a homeless guy $10 to buy tickets for the R-rated movie,
``Asses of Fire,'' which stars the Canadian comedy team Terence and
Phillip. But the duo's fart jokes and nasty lyrics have made them
an easy target for the adults' wrath as well.
</P>
<P>
   And later, when the boys can't stop swearing, their parents,
fearing these sweet little darlings have been corrupted, start a
censorship campaign against the film. It erupts into global warfare
with the elders, the president, the military, Satan and Saddam
Hussein _ as well as Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny _ struggling for
control of the world. The boys must become resistance fighters to
save their idols, the Earth and more importantly, South Park,
against the evils of a closed mind.
</P>
<P>
   It seems weirdly prophetic that ``South Park'' should deal with
issues and concerns about censorship and taking responsibility for
one's own actions is even more bizarre in the ragings against
Hollywood movies that followed the killings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker and Stone _ joined by co-writer Pam Brady _ had the
insight to answer the questions, not just ask them. Communication
is the key, they tell us, and communication begins at home.
</P>
<P>
   And though the more politically correct will want to be
righteously offended at the on-screen antics and certifiable bad
taste slapping us in the face, there's just enough truth and bite
in the script to mollify those concerns. Besides, everyone at the
preview screening I attended was so interactive _ and vocal _ that
it might just be safer to cast off all the adult robes and revel in
an unmitigated display of third-grade toilet humor.
</P>
<P>
   South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut. Directed by Trey Parker.
Written by Parker, Matt Stone, Pam Brady. Paramount Pictures. 80
minutes. Rated R for language, adult situations.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

AMTRAK UNVEILS TRAIN OF THE FUTURE

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak unveiled its hope for the future on Tuesday,
the fastest train on the continent, which will begin running late
this year from here to New York and Boston. The railroad is
attempting to create a demand nationwide for reliable, fast and
luxurious trains among travelers who will pay a hefty ticket price
to avoid driving or flying.
</P>
<P>
   The train, called the Acela Express, (pronounced ah-SELL-ah)
will run from New York to Boston in 3 hours 8 minutes, down from 4
hours 47 minutes, giving Amtrak its first real crack at the
business-travel market between those cities. The railroad will
double the number of daily seats between those cities, to 8,000,
and almost double the number of trains, from 18 to 34, adding its
first ``premium'' trains to the route.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed train would not look out of place pulling up to a
space station, its sleek gray front topped with a bulbous black
cab.
</P>
<P>
   The Acela Express will travel between New York and Washington in
2 hours 43 minutes _ 16 minutes faster than the Metroliner's time.
The railroad is betting that that small improvement, when combined
with creature comforts, will still be enough to draw additional
passengers. The number of ``premium,'' seats, now known as
Metroliner service, will rise to 11,400 from 9,900 now.
</P>
<P>
   And the old Metroliner cars are to be refurbished to serve
travelers paying lower fares on slightly slower trains.
</P>
<P>
   The new cars will tilt by up to 4.7 degrees, leaning into the
turn as the train goes around curves, making passengers more
comfortable. And with amenities like electrical outlets for laptop
computers at each seat, modern bathrooms with diaper-changing
stations and beer on tap in the cafe cars, the railroad thinks it
can charge a one-way fare of $140 on the New York to Washington
route, about $25 dollars more than it does now for Metroliner
service but still about $60 less than the walk-up fare at the air
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-Boston fare will be about $130, according to the
railroad, for the first premium service on that route. Seats on
ordinary trains cost $69 now. Acela Express trains are all
reserved, like the Metroliner.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is acting more like an airline, discussing corporate
discounts and considering a railroad equivalent of frequent flier
plans.
</P>
<P>
   But along with revitalizing service in the Northeast, Amtrak
said it can create a national market for high-speed rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have congressmen and senators saying, `New
York's got that, why can't I have it?''' said Gov. Tommy G.
Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of Amtrak's board. ``This is the
synergism that's going to open it up.'' Thompson said the Midwest
and California were prime candidates for high-speed corridors.
</P>
<P>
   After a ceremony to show off the train, at a new repair shop
just north of Union Station here, Jolene M. Molitoris, the federal
railroad administrator, spread her arms wide and hugged the
locomotive's blunt gray snout. She said that new locomotives, using
jet engines or flywheels, could provide high-speed service in
places where electrification is not practical.
</P>
<P>
   When talk turns to high-speed trains, said Scott Leonard,
assistant director of the National Association of Railroad
Passengers, ``I always felt if we could get something like Acela up
and running in the United States, and it was seen to be attractive
and useful, that other regions in the country would notice and say
to themselves, today, why can't we have it?''
</P>
<P>
   The railroad is renaming its service ``Acela'' all over the
Northeast, and as far south as Virginia: including from Buffalo
through Albany to New York, from Harrisburg to Philadelphia, and
from Newport News, Va., to Washington. Acela is a word Amtrak
invented by combining ``acceleration'' and ``excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is also retraining on-board personnel and improving
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the cab resembles an airplane cockpit. Flat panel
computer displays have replaced traditional dials, and at the touch
of a button the engineer can call up page after page of data.
Beneath the engineer's perch, 10 feet over the rails, are giant
A.C. motors, which are more reliable and efficient than the D.C.
models that have been used in locomotives for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The cab has everything from intermittent windshield wipers to an
electronic security system. Like an automatic teller machine, the
locomotive can be operated only with a magnetically coded card and
a security code entered on a key pad. A fax machine behind the
engineer can deliver messages from dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger cars, more brightly decorated than the 30-year-old
Metroliners, have closed overhead bins. Conductors will take
payments by credit cards and print out tickets using portable
computers, like the ones at rental car lots.
</P>
<P>
   The new train's top speed is 150 miles an hour, up from 125 mph
on the Metroliner, saving 10 minutes between New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the Acela Express speeds up more quickly than the
Metroliner, especially when it exceeds 90 mph, for a savings of 5
minutes; electrifying the track beyond New Haven saves 10 minutes,
and reconfiguring the track in the New Haven area to allow higher
speeds will saves another 10 minutes, Amtrak says. Changes in the
tracks in Queens, the Bronx and New Rochelle will save another 7
minutes.

   If the second coming of Pinocchio included a tour of duty as an
NBA general manager, he'd grow a nose that could handle a dozen
loitering crows.
</P>
<P>
   But intentional misinformation is just part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. The truth is still out there, we just can't see
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hear or read about some general manager saying he
absolutely loves a certain player,'' offers one NBA executive,
``you can bet he's going to take someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   So, imperiled by the conspicuous bullets of subterfuge, we will
attempt to issue our forecast for the first round of tonight's 1999
NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   You can try this at home; just don't make any wagers.
</P>
<P>
   An example:
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bass, general manager of the Charlotte Hornets, has
announced he will use the third pick to select Baron Davis,
assuming the UCLA point guard still is available.
</P>
<P>
   That's good to know. It also may be Bass bait.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Krause, general manager of the Chicago Bulls, will author
the draft's course by making the first pick, unless his pre-draft
salesmanship leads to an offer another GM can't laugh off.

NYSE AGREES TO MONITOR FLOOR TRADERS MORE CAREFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Stock Exchange has agreed to a
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which found
that the exchange did not adequately monitor independent floor
brokers who illegally profited from trades, the commission
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is the first involving regulatory problems at the
Big Board, the nation's largest stock market, and raises questions
about the integrity of the exchange at a time when individuals have
sizable investment and retirement stakes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the exchange promised to
improve its surveillance of floor brokers by increasing its
regulatory staff, to review its rules and regulatory procedures and
to put in an electronic order tracking system to monitor trading
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange did not admit or deny any wrongdoing, and no fines
or censure will be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action underscores that self-regulatory organizations,
such as the New York Stock Exchange, must vigilantly enforce the
federal securities laws and their own rules,'' said Richard H.
Walker, the commission's director of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   While the settlement ends the commission's actions against the
exchange itself, securities regulators and federal prosecutors are
continuing to investigate the extent of illegal trading by brokers
who work on the floor of the exchange, and additional cases could
be announced soon, said Carmen J. Lawrence, the commission's
Northeast regional director.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the exchange will continue its own investigation
into the issue, said Richard A. Grasso, chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our commitment is to assure fairness and honestly in the
market,'' Grasso said. ``We have zero tolerance for any member who
does not fully comply with the NYSE and the SEC rules and
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, the SEC contended that for extended periods between
1993 and 1998, including the period of 1995 to 1997, the exchange
failed to monitor routinely independent floor brokers' activities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the exchange failed to supervise profit-sharing
plans and other performance-based compensation for independent
floor brokers, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from a federal case last year charging that
a group of rogue brokers operating from the exchange floor made
more than $11 million in illegal trading profits.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan filed
charges against eight brokers, including an official at the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Oakford Corp., a now-defunct trading firm that
was not a Big Board member firm, set up accounts for traders at the
firm, who entered orders at their own discretion and falsified
trading tickets so it appeared that the tickets came from the firm.
Then, the traders split profits from the activity with the company,
the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   That type of trading violates both federal law and New York
Stock Exchange rules.
</P>
<P>
   In May, two Oakford co-owners and four stock traders who worked
on the floor of the exchange pleaded guilty to felony charges of
illegal stock trading. Previously, five other brokers and one clerk
pleaded guilty to similar charges. Charges against another broker,
John R. D'Alession, also a floor official at the exchange, were
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the case hit a snag because prosecutors said
they could not prove how much the defendants profited from the
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Also, defendants have contended that illegal trading was
widespread on the floor of the exchange and that the exchange began
enforcing rules only after the U.S. attorney filed the case.
Because the practice is widespread, the defandants contend, they
should not be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Independent floor brokers take orders from brokerage firms whose
floor employees may be busy and from firms that may not have any of
their own people on the floor. These brokers deliver the buy or
sell orders to the specialists who function like auctioneers in
individual stocks. The brokers are supposed to try to get the best
price for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Because working at the exchange gives floor brokers an advantage
over others, they are not allowed to trade for their own accounts
unless they comply with special rules and receive especially close
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office has said that at least 64 floor
brokers may have participated in illegal transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A securities industry lawyer said the steps taken could only
improve the exchange, which has prided itself in the past on being
one of the country's best run and regulated exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the latest electronic and computing procedures
are being used in the trading areas, it brings some of those
procedures and systems into the regulatory area,'' said Lewis
Lowenfels, a prominent New York securities lawyer and former
governor of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board, relying on a task force it set up last year, has
already been working on many of the improvements that are part of
the settlement. An electronic trading system with automatic time
stamped entries will be put into effect next year. Computer
software to detect and analyze trading anomalies should be ready by
the end of the year. Several additional rules governing trading
records and member accounts await SEC approval.

   PHONE MERGER APPROVED SUBJECT TO UNUSUAL RULES
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials tentatively approved the $72 billion
acquisition of Ameritech by SBC Communications provided that the
new company not only open its market to competition but also offer
local telephone service in 30 cities outside its existing region.
Officials said the unusual regulatory approach for approving the
acquisition was intended to drive down phone bills by encouraging
competition in markets that have been dominated by one phone
company. SBC and Ameritech executives said that regulators would
impose stiff financial penalties if the new company failed to offer
residential and business telephone service.

 &HT;    George W. Bush opened his California campaign Tuesday
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Gov. George W. Bush opened his California campaign
Tuesday by mingling with the usual ballrooms full of well-heeled
Republicans and taking his campaign to Hispanic and Hollywood
crowds that don't often line up with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Day one of the three-day campaign swing included fund-raising
events in San Diego, Irvine and Los Angeles, where he is expected
to collect a total of almost $3 million. It also included a
high-profile stop at a Hispanic venue at a local fair and a private
meeting with entertainment industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-door event with Hollywood types was at the Bel Air
home of Terry Semel, co-chairman of Warner Bros. and a longtime
supporter of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Semel, who has given more than $100,000 to Democrats in recent
years, gave $1,000 to Vice President Al Gore, the frontrunner for
the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, Semel was listed as a chairman for Bush's Los
Angeles fund-raiser, a dinner expected to bring in $2 million as
Bush moves toward the end of a record-setting six-month
fund-raising period that has produced more than $20 million and
left other GOP contenders gasping for cash.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with his effort to be a candidate veering toward the
middle, Bush refused to join the Hollywood bashing rekindled by
recent school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a correlation between violence in movies and
youth violence,'' Bush said in San Diego. ``But I also think there
is a correlation between violence and drug use and alcohol abuse
and lack of parental love. There's a lot of reasons why we have
violence in our society. And when we meet with the movie people,
I'm not going to single them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Semel came to Austin recently and asked him to meet
with Hollywood executives during the California campaign swing. The
Bush-Semel connection has been a major buzz in Hollywood in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newspaper column, Susan Estrich, a former top aide
in Democrat Michael Dukakis' unsuccessful 1988 presidential
campaign, said, ``Mr. Bush is being hosted by one of Hollywood's
most respected studio heads, a Democrat, at a reception of the top
tier of the Hollywood elite, almost every one of them a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, something is going on,'' Estrich concluded.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on, according to California Democrats, is a
Republican presidential candidate attempting to make voters forget
what he stands for on some issues. Bush opposes abortion rights.
Every senator California has sent to Washington since Roe vs. Wade
has backed a woman's right to choose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Bush gets ready to visit the most pro-choice state, I
thought it would be of interest to read Bush's most recent
statements relating to his 100 percent opposition to Roe V. Wade,''
Bob Mulholland, an adviser to the California Democratic Party, said
in a memo recounting Bush's comments on the landmark case that
legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Several abortion rights protesters picketed Bush events in San
Diego and Irvine on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to collecting money, Bush took a small step toward
his strategy of luring Hispanics to the GOP column.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American dream is important for all,'' he said in Spanish
to supporters at the Plaza de Mexico at the Del Mar Fair in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, the Democratic National Committee offered up
a view of what it said is Bush's ``anti-Hispanic failure to support
recent hate-crime legislation and the fact that only 8 percent of
his appointees have been Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's Hispanic families care about a good education,
strong economy and keeping their families safe. Bush sides with the
extreme Republicans in Congress who would threaten our
prosperity,'' said U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California, a
co-chair of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After the Del Mar Fair, . Bush distanced himself from two
California ballot initiatives _ one that ended affirmative action
and another that ended welfare and education services for illegal
immigrants _ that have driven Hispanics away from the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he opposed the effort that barred illegal immigrants'
children from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like every child ought to be educated regardless of the
status of their parents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush danced a bit when asked about affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the spirit of no quotas, no preferences,'' he said,
trumpeting a Texas program aimed at ``increasing the pool of
applicants'' for state university slots by guaranteeing admission
to students who finish in the top 10 percent of their class.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Canales, a business owner in nearby Vista, said Bush's
message will sell well among California Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks Spanish better than I do,'' Canales said.
</P>

 &HT;    Reds rule the Central, but tickets abound
 &HT;    By Sam Borden
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ There are plenty of good seats still available on
the Cincinnati Reds' bandwagon _ more than you might expect.
</P>
<P>
   After the Reds capped off an improbable seven-game sweep of the
Arizona Diamondbacks and the Houston Astros on the road, many
expected the new first-place team in the National League Central
division to return home to a party. But the atmosphere at last
night's game against Arizona wasn't exactly like Fat Tuesday on
Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is a tough crowd,'' said Scott Goodridge, who
traveled to Cinergy Field from Hebron, Ky. ``People aren't used to
these guys doing so well. If they're going this good in a month
then maybe people will get swept up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   With their stirring run away from home the Reds have earned the
moniker ``The Big Road Machine,'' reminding longtime fans of the
Big Red Machine which won back-to-back World Series in 1975 and
'76. For those who have been sitting in the stands for that long
however, there are some noticeable differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Red Machine was far ahead of these players, but it was
different to be a fan then too,'' said Dayton's Dan Ekberg. ``Back
then the environment was alive. The cheering was loud and everyone
knew exactly what was going on. Now, the people just aren't backing
them like they used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fair-weather fans,'' added Ekberg's wife, Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   But even the fairest-weather supporter couldn't ask for much
sunnier skies. The Reds have won nine of their last 11 games and 27
of their last 50. They have edged percentage points in front of
Houston for first place in the Central, and will face the Astros in
a four-game series this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to come out and watch a winner,'' said Reds
managing executive John Allen. ``This team reminds me a lot of the
(World Series champion) 1990 team, with young guys who aren't as
experienced. All the national media attention lately has spiked
(the attendance) a little bit lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Allen reported that advance sales were up ``about 10
percent'' for last night's game, but walk-up purchases seemed
sparse. At 4 p.m. yesterday only about 16,000 seats had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing compared to what it used to be like,'' said
off-duty Cincinnati police officer John Brehm. Brehm was working
security near the West ticket officeTuesday, as he has been for the
Reds since the end of the 1990 season. ``It used to be a 45-minute
wait to get to the front of the line, but now there's no wait at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there might be a hint of a fever spreading through the
downtown area. Last night's attendence appeared to be in the
neighborhood of 20,000_ a respectable number for a Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winning is the reason I'm here tonight,'' said
Cincinnati's Brian Stover. ``We know they can do it on the road but
now they need to start doing it at home and we need to support
them.

PERFECTING THE ESTHETIC OF THE PAST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Going forward by looking back may be bad advice, but American
Ballet Theater has danced better and better the more it has
concentrated on the past _ a 19th-century repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the seven full-length ballets in the company's recent
season at the Metropolitan Opera House were French and Russian
classics created more than 100 years ago. The 20th century did
intrude, chiefly through the questionable transfer of Kenneth
MacMillan's ``Anastasia'' (1971) from the Royal Ballet. To see
Ballet Theater at its best, however, was to see it in ``Giselle''
and ``La Bayadere.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the arc between these two poles of 19th-century
ballet esthetics symbolized the season as a whole. ``Giselle''
embodies the Romantic era at its peak; ``La Bayadere'' introduced
high Classicism.
</P>
<P>
   To define these distinctions is to recall how differently each
work tells a similar story: A man who has betrayed his beloved
seeks her after her death in the realm of the spirits. Yet the
style of choreography is not the same, and style is often much
harder to master than steps.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, such ballets have been frequently altered,
especially when male bravura of the kind unimaginable in the 19th
century has been added by Soviet choreographers. Nonetheless, the
touchstone of classical dancing is contained within these old
works.
</P>
<P>
   Without academic form, the classical style of the Shades scene
in ``La Bayadere,'' for instance, immediately disintegrates. As
each member of the female corps steps into arabesque, repetition
multiplies the same single image.
</P>
<P>
   To depart from that image, Nikiya, the heroine, would exile
herself from her fellow ghosts. Form tells the story here. Nikiya's
arm must be as carefully curved and placed as that of the other
Shades. This season, Angel Corella, as Solor, the hero, and Amanda
McKerrow, as Nikiya, triumphed through the harmony of their style.
They had the same purity and spoke the same language. It was that
of the choreographer, Marius Petipa.
</P>
<P>
   Petipa had a hand in revising ``Giselle,'' which was
choreographed in 1841 by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot. But the
ballet dates from an era that did not aim for the spectacle of
``Bayadere'' (1877). The steps belonged to classical ballet, but
the movement, fused with gesture, was openly expressive. Giselle's
celebrated mad scene, now mostly acted, was once the embodiment of
dance and mime united.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet Theater obviously does not dance ``Giselle'' as if it
were ``Bayadere.'' It keeps to a style suitable to Romantic ballet.
But it is a tribute to the company's coaching and the dancers'
artistry that the season could also encompass a range of
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   At one end, Julio Bocca and Alessandra Ferri continued to favor
a degree of verismo as Giselle and Albrecht. At the other extreme,
Julie Kent and Vladimir Malakhov carried off an experiment in
elegant restraint, superbly bringing out the choreography's
underlying classicism.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Durante, a guest previously seen here with the Royal
Ballet, offered something different. Her Albrecht, Jose Manuel
Carreno, was a forceful repentant sinner, and Ms. Durante met him
on the same dramatic ground.
</P>
<P>
   Her drama came not from acting but from quality of movement:
technique made expressive. This was no fragile Giselle but a lively
village girl whose bold, powerful dancing made her as fierce a
ghost as her vampirish sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Within a variety of casts, these dancers suggested a new level
of accomplishment at Ballet Theater. As usual, not everyone danced
best in everything. But there is no doubt that dancing the
19th-century classics over two months produces results.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mongrelized productions of ``Don Quixote'' and ``Le
Corsaire'' gave the dancers a classical workout. Petipa's dance for
three odalisques in ``Le Corsaire'' remains a gem because it is
danced right. Technique and style conform to a codified standard.
Anyone can spot the equivalent of a wrong note on the piano if that
standard is not met in the dancing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth-century ballets were not excluded. They popped up on
two mixed bills that were a welcome respite from the run of
three-act ballets. There was a pallid revival of Twyla Tharp's
``Push Comes to Shove'' on a program shared with Paul Taylor's
``Airs'' and Jiri Kylian's ``Stepping Stones.'' Presumably, this
was the nonclassical program.
</P>
<P>
   For fun, there was a revival of Leonid Massine's ``Gaite
Parisienne'' in Christian Lacroix's still amusingly extravagant
costumes. Corella gambled and won with his over-the-top, hilarious
debut in Massine's own role as the Peruvian carpetbagger in Paris.
The strange bedfellows on the same program were George Balanchine,
Anton Dolin and MacMillan (a motley, not a mixed, bill).
</P>
<P>
   Three-act ballets, nonetheless, are what Kevin McKenzie, the
company's artistic director, believes he needs to fill the Met.
Among 20th-century choreographers, this makes for slim pickings.
MacMillan's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' a Ballet Theater staple, is now
only as good as its cast. The surprise was how much better Ben
Stevenson's ``Snow Maiden'' looked a year after its premiere,
thanks to some judicious cutting.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card was MacMillan's ``Anastasia,'' a permanent work in
progress that the Royal Ballet presented only one season in New
York (1972). It is a ballet that was created backward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, MacMillan choreographed a one-act work about Anna
Anderson, who claimed to be Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the
Russian Czar Nicholas II. MacMillan offered a sympathetic portrait
of a woman in an asylum, driven mad by a jumble of real or supposed
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Then he created a prequel in 1971. The Romanovs and the
Bolshevik troops of the hospital scene were expanded upon in two
introductory acts, whose classical style clashed with the
expressionism of the original ballet. In the three-act version,
which has now been gloomily redesigned by Bob Crowley, the real
Anastasia grows up from playful child to young princess.
</P>
<P>
   In Act I, she is surrounded by young officers (Ethan Stiefel and
Maxim Belotserkovsky were outstanding) whose straight-limbed
virtuosity shows MacMillan at his most polished. But in Act II, one
can barely keep track of the heroine in a royal court whose dances
are so dull that it almost merits the fiery end that Crowley has
thought up (a miniature Hermitage palace in flames).
</P>
<P>
   The audience, led to believe it is watching a faux-classical
ballet about royalty, danced to Tchaikovsky, is suddenly confronted
with the angular ugliness of the Anderson character, accompanied by
the dissonance of Bohuslav Martinu's music. MacMillan's attempt at
shock tactics suggest that life was rough for either a princess or
a pretender.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the break in style recalls that the third act was once a
free-standing ballet. And now that DNA tests have proved that
Anderson was not Anastasia, the ballet has become a confusing
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital room encases the set for the Romanovs at play,
suggesting that even the scenes with the real Anastasia may not be
true. Ms. Durante, Susan Jaffe and Ms. Ferri (I missed Ms. Kent)
were lively and committed in the leading role. They did not have to
cope with the impossible changes in direction and off-center
choreography that cropped up elsewhere in a ballet that does little
to enhance Ballet Theater's image.
</P>
<P>
   This is MacMillan still groping for the maturity of his later
and more successful costume dramas, ``Manon'' and ``Mayerling,'' a
gory tale about the Hapsburgs. Ballet Theater simply picked the
wrong dynasty.

 &HT;    The Border Patrol's release of suspected serial killer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Border Patrol's release of suspected serial
killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez this month has exposed a gap in the
agency's procedures: the Border Patrol, which processes roughly 1.5
million illegal immigrants on the southwest border every year, does
not routinely check the criminal backgrounds of the people it
apprehends.
</P>
<P>
   When Border Patrol agents caught Resendez-Ramirez June 2 after
he entered the United States illegally in southern New Mexico near
El Paso, his fingerprints were on file in law enforcement
databases, along with an arrest warrant issued by federal agents
who wanted to question him in connection with four slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though agents processed the Mexican citizen using high-tech
electronic fingerprint scanners and automated identification
computers installed all across the southwest border,
Resendez-Ramirez was returned to Mexico. Authorities believe he
quickly snuck back across the Rio Grande and killed four more
people in Texas and Illinois over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Immigration and Naturalization Service sources,
Resendez-Ramirez's history of repeatedly sneaking into the country
should have appeared on the agency's computer and triggered further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in Washington were not commenting on the case this
week beyond stating that Resendez-Ramirez was apprehended and
removed by Border Patrol agents. They did not immediately respond
to requests for information on Border Patrol's computers and
procedures, saying they were preparing a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   According to INS sources, the agency's computerized
identification system, known as IDENT, doesn't give agents
important information about whether an individual is wanted or has
a violent history _ unless another agency specifically passes on
that information and someone puts it into the system.
</P>
<P>
   IDENT is not linked to the FBI's National Crime Information
Center, or NCIC, a database that law enforcement officers
nationwide tap into roughly 2 million times a day to determine
whether an individual has a criminal history or is wanted for a
crime. And although Border Patrol agents in El Paso and other
offices have access to NCIC, it is not standard procedure to check
each illegal immigrant against that nationwide criminal database,
several INS sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a logistical nightmare'' to run every immigrant
through both computer systems, said one source.
</P>
<P>
   The case promises to become a political nightmare for the INS,
the Border Patrol's parent agency. One angry congressman, U.S. Rep.
Hal Rogers of Kentucky, has called the case ``deplorable'' and
demanded an explanation from U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. U.S.
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House immigration
subcommittee and a frequent INS critic, and subcommittee member
Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., have scheduled a press conference this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good is an electronic background system if it doesn't
tell you the (criminal) history, and it doesn't,'' said Allen Kay,
spokesman for Smith. ``If (agents are) sitting down with someone
who's a cop killer or something like that, they need to know that,
for their safety as well as ours.'' Resendez-Ramirez
Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old migrant worker and day laborer who
for at least two decades has drifted across the United States using
dozens of aliases _ his real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis,
the FBI announced this week after locating his Mexican birth
certificate _ is wanted in connection with at least eight slayings
in three states since 1997. Five happened in Texas, and all were
close to railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Six months before the Border Patrol captured Resendez-Ramirez,
police in West University Place, a community located within Houston
city limits, sent fingerprints from a slain doctor's abandoned
vehicle to the Texas Department of Public Safety, which matched the
prints to Resendez-Ramirez. On May 27, according to the FBI's
office in Houston, a federal warrant for his arrest was issued.
</P>
<P>
   When Border Patrol agents brought Resendez-Ramirez into their
station on June 2, he was just another Mexican immigrant caught on
the wrong side of the border. Sources say he went through routine
processing: An agent typed basic biographical information into the
computer, then Resendez-Ramirez was photographed and fingerprinted.
</P>
<P>
   Since introducing IDENT to its border offices over the last five
years, the Border Patrol has touted the system's success in helping
to catch murderers, rapists and other wanted felons. But the system
is mainly used to tell agents how many times an immigrant has been
apprehended, said William Suddeth, spokesman for Local 1613 of the
National Border Patrol Council in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   During processing, Resendez-Ramirez's immigration record _
including at least four previous deportations _ should have caused
a computer ``hit'' and triggered further investigation, Suddeth
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 99 times out of 100, that . . . hit is going to make
you do a lot more digging,'' said Suddeth, who is also a Border
Patrol agent. He also noted that the computer system is prone to
crashing.
</P>
<P>
   More digging would have revealed that, in addition to the active
federal warrant, Resendez-Ramirez had served prison time in the
United States for illegal immigration, burglary, auto theft, and
aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how much, if any, of that information came up
on the Border Patrol computer. An INS source said no ``red flag''
came up on the computer that would warrant further investigation by
the agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to prompt that Border Patrol agent to do
anything other than what he did,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez was sent back to Mexico as a ``voluntary
removal,'' meaning he avoided formal deportation by agreeing to
return to Mexico. The same process is used to quickly remove tens
of thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants each year.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: DISCOUNTS VIA INTERNET; SPECIAL SUMMER FARES; NYC
TOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `f' code)  
 (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As air fares continue their seemingly never-ending climb, more
business travelers are going to the Internet to find discounts, a
practice that is creating problems for some employers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey released Tuesday by American Express, the
average price paid in April by U.S. corporations for an airline
ticket for business travel reached a seven-year high, partly a
result of two across-the-board fare increases by major carriers in
the first quarter. As calculated by American Express, the average
round-trip fare paid by business travelers in April was $600, up 1
percent from March and up 5 percent from April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year of minimal increases, average air fare tabs are
rising faster,'' said Rusty Carpenter, vice president of American
Express Consulting Services Group. ``To minimize the damage to
travel budgets, companies are turning to a new line of defense:
Web-based booking systems. Because they display all kinds of fares,
including discounted fares negotiated by corporations, users are
more apt to book a lower air fare than when they make reservations
over the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Business travel agency giants like American Express and
Rosenbluth Travel, as well as companies like Oracle, offer
corporations customized Web-based booking systems, which allow
employees to make their own reservations using the corporation's
negotiated rates and following the parameters of the corporation's
travel policy.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of many companies are, however, increasingly working
around these systems and going online themselves to find Internet
discounts; the air fares they find are often lower than those
negotiated by their employers. In fact, in an informal survey taken
last month of members of the National Business Travel Association,
which represents 1,300 U.S. corporate travel managers, almost
three-fourths of the managers said this practice was their No. 1
problem, because it interfered with their cost-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem for travel managers is that they've
negotiated rates with one or two carriers and they have to produce
volume to maintain the fare agreements,'' said Norman Sherlock, the
association's executive director. ``At some companies, if an
individual goes to the Internet for a fare outside the negotiated
rate, the individual won't be reimbursed on his expense account.''
Sherlock declined to identify the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock also said the association was petitioning U.S. airlines
to put their Internet discounts on computerized reservation systems
to provide direct access to them for corporate travel managers and
their employees. Displaying these fares on computerized reservation
systems would, however, significantly increase demand, which
airlines would find unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this, Sherlock said the systems were developing
special software that could restrict access to Internet fares on a
computerized reservation system to specific groups like corporate
travel managers. He said Galileo, the system partly owned by United
Airlines and other carriers, already had created such a program.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Buttrick, aviation analyst for Paine Webber, suggested that
softness in U.S. airlines' domestic revenues _ up only 1 percent in
the last eight months, despite a robust economy _ could stem, in
part, from greater use by travelers of the Internet. ``The Internet
has resulted in a shift in buying power and knowledge to consumers
and corporations,'' he said. ``Consumers and businesses have much
better pricing information now, the best they've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that although in some cases it might make sense for
a company's employees to pay a negotiated rate, even if they find a
cheaper fare online, ``in most cases people are better off taking
the lowest fare.'' Web-based booking systems that give users
Internet access are a good compromise solution in situations like
this, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Special Fares
</P>
<P>
   With the two busiest travel months starting Thursday, many of
the nation's airlines are offering special e-mail fares, Fourth of
July holiday sale fares or double frequent-flier miles for
full-fare tickets in coach, business class or first class.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines started the bonus miles sweepstakes when it
offered a 70 percent premium. U S Airways countered with double
miles, and American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Trans World
Airlines and United Airlines followed.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday fares, which Delta, American and United are
offering, generally require departure this Friday through Sunday
and return by Tuesday. In each case, restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's bonus offer was intended to call attention to its 70th
anniversary as a passenger airline. On June 17, 1929, a
five-passenger Delta monoplane took off from Love Field in Dallas,
arriving in Jackson, Miss., five hours later after stops at the
Louisiana cities of Shreveport and Monroe. Today Delta averages
2,600 flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   On the Town
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 New York City cultural institutions _ including
museums, performing arts centers, botanical gardens and zoos _ are
offering special one-hour tours that can be slotted into a business
traveler's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Available through Sept. 30 and produced by the New York
Convention and Visitors Bureau, the tours include a walk through
the South Street Seaport district and a visit to WNET, the New York
area public television station.
</P>
<P>
   All tours are free, though there is an admission fee to most
attractions. &QL;

 &HT;    The NBA: Where nice guys get to be ruthless
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Wally Szczerbiak may well be the surest bet in
tonight's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   He believes it. League executives like Bob Bass of the Charlotte
Hornets, Jim Paxson of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana's Mel
Daniels think it. And Gary Wichard, the West Coast agent who
represents the 6-foot-8 Szczerbiak, has said it over and over
again:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally is the Great American Hero, a real breath of fresh air.
He's the basketball player who can help this league right itself.
He's this gorgeous, strapping young man, who's as articulate as can
be _ a guy with skill, a shot, defense, marketability and character
_ and, by the way, he can kick your butt on the basketball court.
Add that up and by far you've got the number one pick in the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you let the promotional air out of that assessment,
Szczerbiak's NBA status still doesn't sag. The former Miami
RedHawks star is a definite top five choice and that's just on the
basketball alone. Mix in everything else that comes with pro sports
and you've got an irresistible package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there's never going to be another Michael Jordan,''
Szczerbiak said. ``No one is going to fill his shoes. But maybe the
NBA is looking for a different angle. And if I can take care of
things on the court and become better and better, maybe I can
provide a little of that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past few years are any indication, Szczerbiak should have
no trouble handling himself in the pro game. In the weeks leading
up to this draft, he is the one lottery pick who has enhanced
himself. While several leading prospects hurt their stock with poor
workouts, refusals to take part in physicals and interviews or the
resurfacing of off-the-court character glitches, Szczerbiak,
literally, got a standing ovation from some 60 NBA scouts and
league officials who watched a high-energy workout he put on in
Chicago early this month. He is said to have been just as
impressive in private workouts he had with teams holding the top
seven picks in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   These last minute assurances add to a portfolio that includes a
lead role in the last NCAA Tournament, where he carried the
outmanned RedHawks into the Sweet 16 round. That capped a Miami
career where he scored in double figures in 80 of 105 games,
including the last 39 in a row, most coming in a senior season
where he was the nation's third leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's last summer, where he was the leading scorer on the
U.S. team that won gold at the Goodwill Games. And next summer _
where he's one of just two college players already added to a team
of existing NBA stars _ he will play in 2000 Olympic Games in
Australia, provided the U.S. team qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Szczerbiak is getting an even bigger build-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make Wally the most well known, out-front player
in all of sports,'' said Wichard. ``And it can happen. Wally is
easiest sell in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Already people are buying. Kellogg's already has worked a deal
with Szczerbiak to promote Eggo waffles. Mattell is negotiating to
sign him and Wichard said discussions are underway with Universal
Studies, who would make him their first team sport's athlete,
Wichard said, because ``they believe this kid will be the
cornerstone of sports, the kind of hero everyone wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of Wally World already are sprouting. Tuesday,
Szczerbiak's photo filled the back cover of the New York Post and
he was featured in USA Today. This week he's been a guest on the
Fox Network's The Last Word. Last week he was on ESPN's Up Close
and The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn. He's already filmed a
segment of HBO's Arliss to be shown in August and he's featured in
a five-page article in the current issue of ESPN The Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, New York gossip columnists gushed about him
when he showed up at a party thrown by Vanity Fair at Patroon in
Manhattan. Over the weekend he was in Los Angeles for a tribute to
Wayne Gretzky and Tuesday night he was featured at a special media
party in Washington D.C., site of tonight's draft, where he has
been contracted by a clothing manufacturer to wear its line of
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The fuss that's being made has to do with skills, his style and
_ whether it's tasteful to you or not _ his skin color.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a 6-8 white kid with talent. Home run,'' said Daniels,
the Pacers director of player personnel, who is black. ``He'll make
more money his first season off the court than on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The race issue rankles Szczerbiak, but he doesn't dodge it. ``He
decided to be pro active on this issue from the start,'' Wichard
said.,
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak believes white basketball players get forced into the
same little box that people so often pushed black quarterbacks. It
was all about stereotypes and trying to say what an athlete can't
do strictly because of pigmentation.
</P>
<P>
   While he's heard draft analysts compare him to Tom Gugliotta,
Dan Majerle or even Larry Bird, Szczerbiak likes to compare himself
to Glen Rice, who is also 6-foot-8 add a pure shooter. Rice is
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not compare me to a black guy?'' Szczerbiak asked. ``I've
got nothing to hide and if you take that approach you're not scared
of the stereotypes _ you just prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I can shoot, but I haven't liked a lot of the
questions put to me. It's all, 'But can he play defense? Can he go
to the hole. Is he athletic?' It's that whole white man myth and I
wanted to dispel it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one reason for the Chicago open workout. ``He knocked
down the stereotypes right there,'' said Walt Szczerbiak, Wally's
dad, who was courtside. ``Afterward all these people in the NBA I
know came over and congratulated me in what a complete player Wally
has become.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the credit goes to Walt, a college star himself at
George Washington, who was a decent player in the old American
Basketball Association and then caught on big in Europe. He played
for a decade in Italy, the Canary Islands, and Spain, leading Real
Madrid to three European titles.
</P>
<P>
   Wally was born in Madrid and was at his first game by the time
he was three months. As soon as he could toddle, he was on the
sidelines at his dad's practices and soon he moved to the court. He
picked up the fundamentals of the game _ how to screen, box out and
most important, face the basket _ from the crafty old-timers of his
dad's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a sponge,'' Walt said. ``He loved to hear us talk
about the game. He let it all soak in and he learned all the
nuances of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the bruises of the game, they came in pitched one-one-one
battles with his dad in the driveway of their home, once they moved
from Tenerife back to the States and a tony neighborhood in Cold
Spring Harbor, N.Y., on Long Island. Early on, Walt would handicap
himself, shooting left-handed and blocking shots only with is head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I'd always win because because he let me
win. It could be 14-14 and then he'd make sure I got the last
points,'' Szczerbiak said with a laugh. ``Now he regrets that, of
course, because now I bury him.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, it turns out, is an old-school player in a new-age
body, a sculpted physique that comes with just five percent body
fat. He's a sit-ups addict, who values fitness. Thanks to Wichard,
he has acquired a taste for sushi and, for a long time, has not
eaten fried foods. ``He's really conscious of anything that's bad
for him,'' the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't just talking about diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA needs to get away from some of the stuff it's mired in
now,'' Wichard said. ``All this no regard for anyone else stuff _
this gangster mentality _ is hurting the league. It's eroding pro
sports. Wally's the antithesis. He's the anti-Rodman. He shows that
you can be engaged to your sweetheart (he's to wed Miami girlfriend
Shannon Ward next summer), come from a good family and be sincere
and humble. And at the same time, not back down from anyone on the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   As Szczerbiak explained it: ``The thing about me is that I may
look like a nice guy, that All-American boy they keep talking
about, but when it gets down to being competitive, I am ruthless.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what the NBA teams want to hear.

SUPERMODELS, AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS GONE

<P>
   If you have been worshiping supermodels, you'd better think
about converting to another church, &LR;  because ``everyone on the
planet knows that supermodels are totally over,'' writes  &UR; Robert &LR; 
 &UR; Sullivan &LR;  in Vogue magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they ``not showing up in movies'' and ``not opening
up restaurant chains,'' but many supermodel cover girls are also
being replaced by celebrities on the fronts of fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   This really hits the models in their Prada pocketbooks. Sullivan
says it's widely accepted in the modeling biz that covers ``are the
way to lucrative cosmetics contracts. To models and their agencies,
keeping models off magazine covers is akin to taking the home runs
out of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the magazines know, fashion is about change. Sullivan's
assessment may be just behind the curve of a waning trend that's
started waxing. The very issue of Vogue that contains his comments
is emblazoned with a picture of a model named  &UR; Gisele &LR;  and the
words ``the return of the sexy model.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The New York Daily News reports that actor  &UR; Kyle
MacLachlan &LR;  has broken up with supermodel  &UR; Linda Evangelista &LR;  and

BUSINESS TRAVEL: DISCOUNTS VIA INTERNET; SPECIAL SUMMER FARES; NYC
TOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As air fares continue their seemingly never-ending climb, more
business travelers are going to the Internet to find discounts, a
practice that is creating problems for some employers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey released Tuesday by American Express, the
average price paid in April by U.S. corporations for an airline
ticket for business travel reached a seven-year high, partly a
result of two across-the-board fare increases by major carriers in
the first quarter. As calculated by American Express, the average
round-trip fare paid by business travelers in April was $600, up 1
percent from March and up 5 percent from April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year of minimal increases, average air fare tabs are
rising faster,'' said Rusty Carpenter, vice president of American
Express Consulting Services Group. ``To minimize the damage to
travel budgets, companies are turning to a new line of defense:
Web-based booking systems. Because they display all kinds of fares,
including discounted fares negotiated by corporations, users are
more apt to book a lower air fare than when they make reservations
over the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Business travel agency giants like American Express and
Rosenbluth Travel, as well as companies like Oracle, offer
corporations customized Web-based booking systems, which allow
employees to make their own reservations using the corporation's
negotiated rates and following the parameters of the corporation's
travel policy.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of many companies are, however, increasingly working
around these systems and going online themselves to find Internet
discounts; the air fares they find are often lower than those
negotiated by their employers. In fact, in an informal survey taken
last month of members of the National Business Travel Association,
which represents 1,300 U.S. corporate travel managers, almost
three-fourths of the managers said this practice was their No. 1
problem, because it interfered with their cost-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem for travel managers is that they've
negotiated rates with one or two carriers and they have to produce
volume to maintain the fare agreements,'' said Norman Sherlock, the
association's executive director. ``At some companies, if an
individual goes to the Internet for a fare outside the negotiated
rate, the individual won't be reimbursed on his expense account.''
Sherlock declined to identify the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock also said the association was petitioning U.S. airlines
to put their Internet discounts on computerized reservation systems
to provide direct access to them for corporate travel managers and
their employees. Displaying these fares on computerized reservation
systems would, however, significantly increase demand, which
airlines would find unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this, Sherlock said the systems were developing
special software that could restrict access to Internet fares on a
computerized reservation system to specific groups like corporate
travel managers. He said Galileo, the system partly owned by United
Airlines and other carriers, already had created such a program.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Buttrick, aviation analyst for Paine Webber, suggested that
softness in U.S. airlines' domestic revenues _ up only 1 percent in
the last eight months, despite a robust economy _ could stem, in
part, from greater use by travelers of the Internet. ``The Internet
has resulted in a shift in buying power and knowledge to consumers
and corporations,'' he said. ``Consumers and businesses have much
better pricing information now, the best they've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that although in some cases it might make sense for
a company's employees to pay a negotiated rate, even if they find a
cheaper fare online, ``in most cases people are better off taking
the lowest fare.'' Web-based booking systems that give users
Internet access are a good compromise solution in situations like
this, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Special Fares
</P>
<P>
   With the two busiest travel months starting Thursday, many of
the nation's airlines are offering special e-mail fares, Fourth of
July holiday sale fares or double frequent-flier miles for
full-fare tickets in coach, business class or first class.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines started the bonus miles sweepstakes when it
offered a 70 percent premium. U S Airways countered with double
miles, and American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Trans World
Airlines and United Airlines followed.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday fares, which Delta, American and United are
offering, generally require departure this Friday through Sunday
and return by Tuesday. In each case, restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's bonus offer was intended to call attention to its 70th
anniversary as a passenger airline. On June 17, 1929, a
five-passenger Delta monoplane took off from Love Field in Dallas,
arriving in Jackson, Miss., five hours later after stops at the
Louisiana cities of Shreveport and Monroe. Today Delta averages
2,600 flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   On the Town
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 New York City cultural institutions _ including
museums, performing arts centers, botanical gardens and zoos _ are
offering special one-hour tours that can be slotted into a business
traveler's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Available through Sept. 30 and produced by the New York
Convention and Visitors Bureau, the tours include a walk through
the South Street Seaport district and a visit to WNET, the New York
area public television station.
</P>
<P>
   All tours are free, though there is an admission fee to most
attractions. &QL;

CLINTON OUTLINES MEDICARE REFORMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Offering a plan he called credible and sensible,
President Clinton outlined Medicare reforms Tuesday that would
extend the life of the program until 2027 and offer prescription
drug coverage for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quibbled with some provisions of Clinton's proposal,
but key congressional leaders said they were willing to work with
the White House to find common ground on the sensitive issue of
health care coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and Congress bowed before the powerful
political bloc of senior citizens, 39 million of whom are Medicare
beneficiaries, and acknowledged the need for reform, especially
with the aging baby boom generation approaching retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is credible, sensible and fiscally responsible,''
Clinton told activists for senior citizens and the disabled as well
as lawmakers gathered in the East Room. ``It will secure the health
of Medicare while improving the health of our seniors, and we can
achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would devote 15 percent of the federal surplus
over the next 15 years _ $794 billion _ to shore up the Medicare
program. The infusion would keep Medicare solvent until 2027, 12
years longer than current estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also would create a new Part D that would provide
prescription drug coverage beginning in 2002. The initial cost
would be a $24 monthly premium paid by beneficiaries. The
government would pay half of a patient's drug costs up to $1,000 a
year without a deductible.
</P>
<P>
   The premium would increase to $44 monthly and coverage would
increase to $2,500 per year by 2008. However, individuals earning
less than $11,000 a year and couples earning less than $17,000
would be exempt from paying premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, beneficiaries pay a $45.50 monthly premium for
doctor's office visits.
</P>
<P>
   The Part D plan would cost $118 billion over 10 years, but the
administration said 60 percent of the costs would be offset by
savings contained within the Medicare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The plan contains a series of incentives to beneficiaries and to
doctors for competitive pricing, coordinated care and other
efficiencies. The plan also would encourage more preventive care by
removing the deductible for tests such as mammograms and prostate
cancer screening.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would increase patients' co-payments on laboratory
services by 20 percent and increase the deductible for the Medicare
Part B outpatient care program by indexing it to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks, the president acknowledged the presence
of several Republicans, including Sen. William Roth of Delaware,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Rep. Bill Thomas of
California, chairman of the House Medicare subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their presence here today indicates that we can all raise
concerns about each other's ideas without raising our voices,''
Clinton said. ``And that if we're really committed to putting our
people first, we can reach across party lines and other lines to
work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republicans, while chiding Clinton on some specifics,
welcomed him to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Clinton's proposal ``at least allows us to sit down
and talk about a package,'' and that Republican attendance at
Clinton's announcement is ``a clear indication we are all willing
to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was among the Republicans participating in a commission
on Medicare that made several recommendations, including the
creation of a prescription drug coverage program, but one limited
to people in financial need.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, among the lawmakers listening to
Clinton, said of Republicans, ``I think they'll give us an even
chance to get something together. Over the next few months we have
the best opportunity before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said the issue of Medicare
reform and the creation of prescription drug coverage is an
emotional one for many Americans. ``I don't think that Republicans
will be allowed to sit still on this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called on
Republican leaders to ``reject the views of naysayers'' such as
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas. He said DeLay, the House Majority Whip,
said Americans were unconcerned with Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's office did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he was raising ``issues'' with
Clinton's proposal but did not outright reject the package. Gramm
said two-thirds of the Medicare recipients already receive
prescription drug coverage through private insurance or retirement
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of having universal coverage makes sense politically,
but it makes absolutely no sense economically in terms of
displaying the private insurance and the coverage that roughly
two-thirds of the retired Americans have,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also favors limiting
prescription coverage to those senior citizens in financial need.
``We do think that it really should be targeted to people that
cannot afford prescription drugs on their own. But again, we're
certainly willing to take a look at what his proposals are, and
maybe we can find some common ground,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons defended the
administration's effort to extend drug coverage to all Medicare
beneficiaries _ an issue that was also debated among Clinton's
aides.
</P>
<P>
   AARP said Clinton's plan ``acknowledges what millions of
American families know: that even many middle-class older Americans
find that their prescription drug costs can be unaffordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton maintained that nearly 15 million Medicare beneficiaries
lack prescription drug benefits and half of them are middle class.
Because of rising drug prices, fewer retirees are getting drug
coverage from their employers health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a drug benefit our seniors can afford at a price
America can afford,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll released Tuesday indicated about 57
percent of those surveyed said they feel Medicare needs major
changes or a complete overhaul.

   If you have been worshiping supermodels, you'd better think
about converting to another church, &LR;  because ``everyone on the
planet knows that supermodels are totally over,'' writes  &UR; Robert &LR; 
 &UR; Sullivan &LR;  in Vogue magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they ``not showing up in movies'' and ``not opening
up restaurant chains,'' but many supermodel cover girls are also
being replaced by celebrities on the fronts of fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   This really hits the models in their Prada pocketbooks. Sullivan
says it's widely accepted in the modeling biz that covers ``are the
way to lucrative cosmetics contracts. To models and their agencies,
keeping models off magazine covers is akin to taking the home runs
out of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the magazines know, fashion is about change. Sullivan's
assessment may be just behind the curve of a waning trend that's
started waxing. The very issue of Vogue that contains his comments
is emblazoned with a picture of a model named  &UR; Gisele &LR;  and the
words ``the return of the sexy model.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The New York Daily News reports that actor  &UR; Kyle
MacLachlan &LR;  has broken up with supermodel  &UR; Linda Evangelista &LR;  and
is dating a ``power publicist'' empoweringly named  &UR; Desiree
Gruber &LR; .

   &UR; Monte Freidig &LR; , who teaches political science at Santa Rosa
Junior College, was surprised to learn that the 103-page Harvard
College thesis of  &UR; Al Gore &LR;  _ the man two-thirds of American voters
think is ``boring'' _ was on the importance of personality for
presidents in the age of television.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, &UR; David Cassell  &LR; was walking past the Sierra Club
bookstore in Berkeley on Saturday when he saw a monarch butterfly
``trapped in their window display, beating its wings futilely
against the window.'' He stepped inside and reported the sighting,
and two clerks sprang to the creature's rescue.

   _ The Kings Cross Steelers, a gay and bisexual rugby team, has
been granted membership in the English Rugby Football Union. ``The
only rule we have referring to sexuality is that ours is a men's

for women's rugby.'' Team spokesman Alex Standish said that about
half of the Steelers ``formerly played for straight clubs at some

``The most beautiful woman I ever saw was a man in San Francisco.''
Meanwhile, one worker at a specialty boutique near Union Square in

<P>
   Justifiably disgruntled, disgusted and disappointed by our
erroneous report that  &UR; Queen Elizabeth &LR;  had her first restaurant
meal last week, many readers remembered the queen's meal at Trader
Vic's in San Francisco in 1983. Several remembered that she had
dined in Yosemite at the Ahwahnee, too.
</P>
<P>
   We called  &UR; Jane Kerr &LR; , who covers the royals for the Mirror in
London, whence the report had come. She said it was the queen's
first restaurant meal in Great Britain; strictly speaking, her
first outside of London, because she had attended several banquets
at Claridge's hotel in London. Three years ago, said Kerr, &UR; Prince
Edward &LR; 's plans for a 70th birthday party for Her Majesty had been
``hastily canceled'' when the press found out the name of the
restaurant where the event had been planned. She also said the
queen had eaten at several restaurants in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lynn Bergeron &LR; , who was manager of Trader Vic's at the time,
recalls getting notice that morning that the royal party had come
to town a day ahead of schedule and would be coming to dinner with
 &UR; Nancy Reagan  &LR; in the evening. Bergeron remembers being surprised
that evening that the queen had only two security people with her,
one from the State Department and one from her own government (in
addition to San Francisco police officers).
</P>
<P>
   She came to the Sutter Street entrance of the restaurant and
entered unseen by other diners. Bergeron had been told that he'd be
introduced and warned not to try to shake hands in greeting, but
``she reached out to shake my hand,'' he recalls. To the best of
his recollection, Nancy Reagan didn't. ``She was kind of in the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bergeron had been informed, the queen drank martinis made
with Beefeater gin; two of them, he recalls, before she sat down to
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The Times of London reported on Sunday that  &UR; Princess &LR; 
 &UR; Beatrice &LR; , 10, and  &UR; Princess Eugenie &LR; , 9, daughters of  &UR; Prince &LR; 
 &UR; Andrew  &LR; and his former wife,  &UR; Sarah Ferguson &LR; , will be asked to
renounce their titles _ ``Princess'' and ``Her Royal Highness'' _
when they turn 18. The Times said this was part of a campaign to
streamline the monarchy. Buckingham Palace said it was unaware of
the proposal, which ``would be unusual, although it has been done
before.'' The girls are fifth and sixth in line for the throne.

and would remain secret.

A FRAGILE MIND BENT IN A PSYCHEDELIC ERA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Karen Schoemer, a former music critic for Newsweek, is writing a
book about pop singers from 1957 to 1963.  
 By KAREN SCHOEMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident or the sandbox Brian Wilson
built in his living room, Alexander (Skip) Spence's freakout is the
stuff of rock myth. In 1968, Spence, a guitarist for the San
Francisco pop-psychedelic band Moby Grape, was in New York working
on the group's second album.
</P>
<P>
   He hooked up with a woman who was known as a witch, and she gave
him bad acid. Spence disappeared for a few days, and when he turned
up again he was banging down the hotel room door of the band's
drummer with a fire ax. The drummer wasn't there, so Spence
proceeded to the recording studio in a taxi, ax still in hand.
</P>
<P>
   At the studio someone wrestled the ax away from him, but charges
were pressed and Spence went to jail. He was given a choice: prison
or a psychiatric hospital. He chose Bellevue, and he was there,
doing penance, for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Spence, who died in April at the age of 52, was well on his way
to being another '60s casualty. But before he got there, he took a
side trip. Upon his release from Bellevue, he asked his label,
Columbia, for a small advance _ under $1,000 _ and a motorcycle so
he could drive to Nashville and make a solo album.
</P>
<P>
   In just four days in December 1968, Spence recorded ``Oar,'' an
album of songs he had written in Bellevue. He produced it himself
and played all the instruments himself. When he was done, he got on
his motorcycle and headed back to California. He was 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Released on May 19, 1969, ``Oar'' showed one of the bleakest
undersides of the '60s. It was a snapshot of mental illness, a
portrait of bitter isolation in a time of communal celebration. Not
surprisingly, ``Oar'' sold only a few hundred copies.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia didn't promote it; it got no airplay, cracked no chart.
A few months later, the critic Greil Marcus wrote a prescient
review for Rolling Stone. ``This unique LP is bound to be
forgotten,'' he said. ``Get ahead of the game and buy `Oar' before
you no longer have a chance.'' It was the perfect curse to lay on
``Oar.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus knew that in rock-and-roll, nothing worthwhile is ever
truly forgotten. The harder it is to find, the more it is coveted.
``Oar'' was bound for a particular cult doom: an album so obscure
and neglected that it could eventually be embraced by a different
generation as something exceptional and brand new.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, it's finally ``Oar's'' time. On Tuesday,
Sundazed Music will reissue a remixed and remastered version of the
album with 10 bonus tracks. That same day, the independent label
Birdman will release ``More Oar,'' a lovingly compiled tribute
featuring Tom Waits, Robert Plant, Beck and Son Volt's Jay Farrar
recreating the album's songs in order.
</P>
<P>
   Tribute records are often obnoxious celebrity showcases, but
``More Oar'' is the rare case that really enhances the original.
Bill Bentley, a longtime record-company executive and the album's
producer, made sure that only performers who really cared about
``Oar'' contributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once word went out that I was doing this, people started
contacting me,'' Bentley said. ``Bands said, `We love ``Oar.'' We
have to be on this.' We'd send people $500, and a few weeks later
these DAT tapes would show up in the mail. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The two albums work well in tandem. Each brings out strengths
the other doesn't show. Because of his fragility of mind, Spence's
version is hushed and tentative. The songs are like hot, cramped
rooms, full of wandering thoughts and fragmented images. The vocals
rasp and quaver; the drums shuffle in a halting, folksy rhythm.
It's the sound of a man talking to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some songs are nearly formless psychedelic workouts; others,
like ``Cripple Creek'' and ``Diana,'' are muttered depictions of
characters at the end of their ropes. ``Oar'' also has moments of
joy: Spence relished childish singsongs and eccentric wordplay.
``An Olympic super swimmer whose belly doesn't flop,'' he sings in
``Broken Heart.` ``A honey-dripping hipster whose bee cannot be
bopped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More Oar'' sacrifices the singular, mind-bending intimacy, but
it's more confident and accessible. In the hands of accomplished
pros like Beck and Plant, the songs get room to breathe; the best
interpretations reveal elegant structures and breathtaking melodies
that Spence himself muffled.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's version of ``All Come to Meet Her'' feels like a
pretty, half-finished thought; he hums and repeats the title line
over and over, like a daydreamer musing on a place he'll never
reach. Diesel Park West's cover brings out the pop brilliance at
the song's core. The drums crash, the electric guitars ring out;
it's nothing short of celestial, a hymn of fulfilled longing. A
transcendence Spence could only imagine Diesel Park West brings to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley is one of the faithful who bought the record in 1969.
``I didn't have those kind of mental problems, but I wasn't doing
too well,'' he said. ``You listen to this and you go, well, there's
people farther out and with bigger troubles than me, and they're
still making art. Maybe there is a way to get through all this, and
not just run and give up.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bentley, ``More Oar'' was a way to make sure Spence's work
wasn't forgotten. When he began work on the project four years ago,
he found that many musicians had been moved by ``Oar'' just as he
had been. `` `Books of Moses' reminded me of a Tom Waits song
before there (italics)was(end italics) a Tom Waits,'' Bentley said.
``I thought, `I'll just ask him.' He just said, `Sure.' He cut it
in his garage, played all the instruments himself. He's a guy that
really taps into the mental space that a guy like Skip lived in. I
think that's part of Tom's allure. He always, from the start, got
inside the head of the have-nots and society's expendables.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Oar'' and ``More Oar'' so compelling is that both
records puncture many of the myths we've come to take for granted
about the '60s. No other decade in rock has been so overhyped. From
Dylan's plug-ins to Jimi Hendrix's guitar burnings, from the
Beatles at Shea to Janis Joplin at Monterey, from Eric Clapton's
solos to the Grateful Dead's endless jams, the era is stuffed way
past capacity with icons, masterminds, earth-shakers and
ground-breakers. The last thing anyone needs is another '60s
legend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Spence was the antithesis of '60s heroism. He was of the era but
apart from it. He came from the Haight-Ashbury scene, but he did
his best work in solitude. Unlike Brian Wilson, whose mental
instability became part of his mystique, Spence never parlayed his
illness into money or fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skippy was not really in shape after '68 to ever come back and
pick up where he left off,'' said Peter Lewis, a Moby Grape
guitarist. ``He couldn't be a show-business person. All that talent
wasn't something he could pull out of his hip pocket and use.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence was born in Windsor, Ontario, then moved with his parents
to the San Jose area. He migrated to San Francisco in time to spend
a year as the Jefferson Airplane's original drummer. In 1966, he
helped start Moby Grape, a slightly more garagey version of Buffalo
Springfield, with rustic three- and four-part harmonies overlaid on
snarly guitars. Moby Grape's closest thing to a hit was Spence's
``Omaha,'' an exuberant call-out to good times. ``Listen my
friends!'' the song exclaims again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to describe the way he plays guitar, and the
way his chords work,'' said Lewis. ``Him and the guitar, it was
like a whole orchestra. The way the melody moved and the chords
moved was totally unpredictable but totally cool. Nobody else could
do it. It's Skip.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Oar,'' Spence worked sporadically with Moby Grape. He
contributed to the 1971 album ``20 Granite Creek''` and to ``Live
Grape'' in 1978. But in between, Spence, a diagnosed paranoid
schizophrenic, began a cycle of living in halfway houses and state
mental institutions.
</P>
<P>
   One time in the late '70s, Spence wound up in a facility in
Santa Cruz. ``They called us three days or so after they had
committed him,'' Lewis remembered. ``They said, `You've got to take
this guy out of here because he got lost and we found him in the
women's ward with a harem.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Lewis added, he suffered a drug overdose. ``They
took him to the morgue, tag on his toe and everything. And he got
up and asked for a glass of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Spence was well enough during the late '70s to play gigs
with Moby Grape in northern California. Scott McCaughey, whose band
the Minus 5 contributed to ``More Oar,'' saw a few of them. ``Skip
would sometimes be there, sometimes play, sometimes be there and
not play,'' McCaughey recalled.
</P>
<P>
   One night after a show, McCaughey approached Spence. ``He was
kind of ambling about,'' he said. ``My friends and I said, `Do you
want to come over to our house and have a beer?' He was like,
`O.K.' So he came over and sat in the middle of our funky living
room. I said, `Skip, what do you want to listen to?' He said, `
``Rubber Soul.'' ' So I got it, and we listened to it, smoked some
pot and just kind of talked. He was friendly but not super on the
ball. You definitely got the impression he wasn't all there. After
the record was over, I said, `So, what do you want to listen to
now?' He said, ` ``Rubber Soul.'' ' It wasn't like, `Let's listen
to it again.' It was like it never happened. So we listened to
`Rubber Soul' again.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Live Grape,'' Lewis lost track of Spence until the early
'90s. Bentley said that Spence was never homeless, but that ``he
would panhandle money and drink quarts of beer all day.'' Around
1994, his life stabilized. He moved into a trailer with his
girlfriend and apparently quit drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Spence played one last gig with Moby Grape in Santa Cruz in
1996. In the spring of this year, he was diagnosed with terminal
lung cancer and hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley had spent the last few years of his life pursuing
Spence's elusive legacy. He went to see him in the hospital and
brought a copy of ``More Oar.'' But Spence was in a coma by then.
On the day he died, April 16, Spence was surrounded by loved ones:
his girlfriend, his ex-wife, his children, Lewis. They took him off
his ventilator and played ``More Oar'' as he slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lewis sees his legacy in a slightly different way. ``The
thing that made Skip suffer in the end was he knew everybody loved
him, but he couldn't come back,'' he said. ``People had
expectations for him to be well again and play music, and he just
couldn't. I admire him as an artist and a human being, even though
he was just a guy you'd pass by in the street, just another bum
with a cup in his hands. But I guarantee you, he will become the
Van Gogh of the '60s. This guy was peerless.''

SPINNING DIALOGUES ON LOVE AND TIME'S INCURSIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: No dateline with this story)  
 (af)  
 Laura Winters most recently wrote for Arts and Leisure about the
German film ``Run Lola Run.''  
 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The office of the filmmaker Olivier Assayas is in an
out-of-the-way corner of the Ninth Arrondissement in Paris, off a
courtyard with a small fountain. Inside, the rooms have the
white-washed airiness of a summer house. When the director arrives,
he steps carefully and abstractedly over his assistant's puppy,
asleep in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only one look at this office _ idyllic and intensely
busy at once _ to understand that Assayas is someone who believes
in spontaneity and openness to the world. One of the most
significant talents among the new generation of filmmakers working
in France, he is known for his mobile, often handheld, camera style
and for his probing explorations of young people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Assayas' new film, ``Late August, Early September,'' which opens
on Wednesday, is a loosely structured, evocative depiction of a
group of 30ish Parisians who are drawn together by the untimely
death of a slightly older writer friend.
</P>
<P>
   The film, shot in the spring of 1998, has proved to be Assayas'
most successful in France so far and won praise last fall at both
the Toronto and New York film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Part of its appeal lies in the warmth of its tone and the
tapestry-like layering of its storytelling. ``Late August, Early
September'' takes place over one year and explores four characters.
There is Gabriel (Mathieu Amalric), an editor breaking up with his
old girlfriend, Jenny (Jeanne Balibar), and beginning a
relationship with Anne, a volatile young clothing designer
(Virginie Ledoyen). Both Gabriel and Jenny are close to Adrien
(Francois Cluzet), the ailing writer.
</P>
<P>
   The film was born, Assayas says, out of an idea for a series of
dialogues about an individual's death: ``It came to me as the story
of one man's death and how it affects the people around him, how it
changes their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the project started with this notion, however, it soon
became something else. ``I thought I was making a film about death,
but gradually I realized how much the film is really about life,''
says Assayas, 44, speaking in almost unaccented English. Casual and
boyish, with close-cropped black hair, he laughs easily and
radiates nervous energy. As he describes the evolution of the
story, he gives an impression of both quicksilver intelligence and
of warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late August'' became, for him, a celebration of the minute
texture of everyday life _ the subtle changes in people's work,
emotions and relationships that in retrospect prove to be
significant. Though the film has autobiographical elements, Assayas
said, he also wanted to give it a certain universality, to make it
``everybody's autobiography.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has gone through what goes on in this film,'' he
said. ``Everybody has broken up with a lover and fallen in love
again. Everybody has moved from one apartment to another. Everybody
has had someone dear disappear.'' He structured the film as a
series of chapters, with scenes separated by fade-outs, partly to
allow the audience to fill in the gaps with their own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   In its development of an ensemble of actors and in its emphasis
on conversations and relationships, ``Late August'' has surface
similarities to some other contemporary French films. The venerable
filmmaker Eric Rohmer, who has done a series of seasonal tales (the
most recent of which, ``Autumn Tale,'' opens Friday) is a master of
the literate French comedy-of-manners and someone Assayas admires.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two directors present contrasts, too. ``There's a sense
of ironic observation in Rohmer's work, of a director standing back
and looking at the problems of young people,'' said Piers Handling,
director of the Toronto International Film Festival, which has
shown films by both. ``Whereas in Assayas' work there's a pretty
close identification between his sensibility and that of his
protagonists. He's very close to their predicament.''
</P>
<P>
   Another filmmaker who is often mentioned as similar to Assayas
is Arnaud Desplechin, whose 1996 film ``My Sex Life ... or How I
Got Into an Argument'' is a comedic drama about a clique of highly
self-analytic Parisian philosophy students and their assorted
loves. Both filmmakers have used the same actor ( Amalric) as their
alter ego. Both have also been described as depicting an
intellectual Parisian milieu, as opposed to the group of young
French filmmakers who portray the working class travails of the
provincial French.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a small step, however, from talking about an
intellectual milieu to calling a film ``intellectual'' or
``privileged,'' terms that make both Assayas and Amalric wince.
``Frankly, `Late August' is not intellectual,'' Amalric said over
coffee in a Paris cafe. ``It's about emotions, and themes as primal
as time passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Assayas himself sighs when asked about these classifications.
``I'm always so irritated by the description of French independent
films as being about Left Bank intellectuals and not concerned with
the real questions of life,'' he said. ``I'm sorry, but the
characters I'm dealing with are not Left Bank intellectuals. They
are people with very little money, struggling for what they believe
in. I don't know why they should be considered as privileged. Their
social problems are as serious as any other people's.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor distinguishing Assayas in the politicized arena of
French filmmaking is his insistence on approaching characters on a
personal level. ``To me, people are not defined through
sociological notions,'' he said. ``They are defined by the fact
that they are individuals, be they rich or poor.''

 UNDATED: or poor.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In that, Assayas has a lot in common with his friends and fellow
filmmakers Claire Denis and Andre Techine. Though Ms. Denis has
portrayed characters ranging from pregnant teen-agers to immigrant
workers, they are never treated as stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Techine, who is somewhat older and who has directed such
high-profile films as ``My Favorite Season,'' starring Catherine
Deneuve, is also known for his characters' psychological
complexity. Techine played a crucial role in Assayas' career,
inviting him to collaborate on two scripts before Assayas made his
first feature.
</P>
<P>
   On the telephone from Morocco, where he is beginning a new film,
Techine recalled spotting Assayas when Assayas was a journalist.
``I needed someone who could work at top speed,'' Techine said,
``and Olivier is as quick as lightning. But he also has an
audacious sense of form and a very rich critical spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   This collaboration certainly encouraged Assayas in his
aspiration to make films. He had been interested in film from an
early age, partly, he says, because his father was a screenwriter
well known in France under the name Jacques Remy.
</P>
<P>
   Assayas' mother, who is Hungarian, had arrived in France in
1946, fleeing communism. His parents were divorced when he was a
child, and he and his brother lived with his father. Olivier
studied painting and French literature before starting to make
short films and was a film critic for the French film journal
Cahiers du Cinema from 1980 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he made his first feature, ``Disorder,'' a jagged film
about an unintentional murder by the members of a young rock band.
Four other features soon followed. In them Assayas showed a special
understanding of the futile rebellion and willful opacity of the
young women whose stories he told, whether it was the drug-taking
Louise in ``Paris Awakens,'' (1991) or the desperate runaway
Christine in ``Cold Water'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   Turbulent characters have long fascinated him. ``I think Olivier
likes to structure his films around people who are at a certain
moment of crisis,'' said Richard Pena, program director of the Film
Society of Lincoln Center, which held an Assayas retrospective in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Cold Water,'' the story of two troubled teen-agers,
Assayas found himself edging toward a more spontaneous way of
filmmaking. His sixth film, ``Irma Vep'' (no relation to the
Off-Broadway play), spun him in a thoroughly new direction,
improvisational and light-hearted. ``Irma'' is a satire about a
chaotic French film shoot graced by a visiting Asian film star
(Maggie Cheung, playing herself).
</P>
<P>
   The film's enthusiastic notices and widespread release
encouraged Assayas to continue in this vein. While ``Late August''
is not a comedy, it owes its freedom of spirit to ``Irma Vep.''
``Irma Vep'' was significant for him on another level as well: he
and Ms. Cheung were married in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late August'' certainly arises from currents in Assayas'
previous work, but its emotional immediacy still feels like a
departure for him _ and not because the people he depicts are
older. ``I think `Late August' is more generous and optimistic than
Olivier's earlier films,'' said Georges Benyahoun, the film's
co-producer. ``Somehow, we get closer to his characters here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Assayas is feverishly preparing his next project, a period
drama adapted from a trilogy called ``Les Destinees
Sentimentales,'' (``Sentimental Destinies'') by the writer Jacques
Chardonne. The project, which Assayas has long been wanting to
direct, will begin filming next month.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the early 1900s, it is the story of a former clergyman
who divorces his wife, marries another woman and settles in
Switzerland. When he must return to France to take over the family
porcelain business, the move affects his marriage. The stars will
be Charles Berling, Isabelle Huppert and Emmanuelle Beart.
</P>
<P>
   The film entails a lot of firsts for Assayas: his first costume
drama, his first big production, his first work with major stars.
He seems both anxious and exhilarated at the prospect. When asked
how he plans to handle it, he replies, ``It's up to me to make this
big movie as light as I can, to try to inject into it whatever I
have learned making smaller films.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs when reminded of the new maturity people have observed
in ``Late August.'' ``I think the one thing that I've found out
about myself is that I'm absolutely not interested in maturity,''
he said. ``It means that suddenly you're going to turn into this
person who's grown up now, and there's nothing more. No, the
exciting thing is when you understand that you are the same person
but you will keep on changing, transforming yourself as you go
through different experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then resumes: ``Hopefully, you will learn something
about it and you will grow. That's the thing that should never
end.''

 &HT;    Hawks get 10th pick in Blaylock deal
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is a price to pay when a good team collapses in
the playoffs, and Tuesday night Mookie Blaylock became the first
Hawks player to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks shipped him along with the 21st pick of tonight's NBA
draft to Golden State for the No. 10 pick, point guard Bimbo Coles
and former Hawks and Georgia Tech forward Duane Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mookie gave us seven great years,'' general manager Pete
Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really did,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said, ``but when you have
an opportunity like this, you have to move on. Mookie did a fine
job for us, but we have to keep getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks will grab one of the draft's talented young point
guards tonight and allow him to learn on the job with Coles and
Anthony Johnson acting as parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the Hawks going to take?
</P>
<P>
   Figure Maryland's Steve Francis and UCLA's Baron Davis will be
among the first three players taken in the draft. That leaves
Utah's Andre Miller, Arizona's Jason Terry and Duke's William
Avery. Some scouts are predicting that Miller could be available,
especially if Cleveland decides to trade Brevin Knight, a poor
shooter, and takes Terry with the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live with any of them,'' said Babcock, who also refused
to limit himself to a point guard at No. 10, ``in the event a
player with great potential falls. We'd have to take him. The big
thing is we wanted to move up, and now we're in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But figure a point guard. If it's Miller, they get a consummate
playmaker who is mature at 23, ready-made for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Terry, they get a point who is very quick, can score and
make plays, another four-year player, who played with Mike Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Avery, an Augusta native, the Hawks get a brilliant
athlete, who spent two years at Duke, a former teammate of young
forward Roshown McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge upside,'' assistant coach Phil Hubbard said, adding that
the Hawks could rotate three points if necessary until their rookie
is comfortable early.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Hawks with picks Nos. 17, 20 and 27, pending
further dealing.
</P>
<P>
   What's more they apparently are very close to pulling off
another trade involving an established player on the team. The only
problem here: the deal cannot be consummated until Aug. 1 when new
contracts can be signed. That means a sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   More cautious than his boss, team president Stan Kasten, Babcock
rated the chance of getting this one done at 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Hawks have already made a statement, dealing a
seven-year starter who led the NBA in steals for three straight
years before dropping off last season.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with Blaylock were evident to all. He liked to walk
the ball up the floor. He liked to shoot and he did not shoot very
well. From a peak of .432 in 1996-97, he slipped to .392 and .379,
reflecting the difficulty of making three-pointers once the line
was moved back to 23 feet, 6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: Coles ($2.1 million) and Ferrell ($1.6 million)
have only one year remaining on their contracts. Blaylock has three
at $4.2 million, $4.8 million and $5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blaylock was willing to step up and take big shots in
games. He is a hard-nosed defender and with Dikembe Mutombo gave
the Hawks a lethal combination of ball thief and shot blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll still emphasize defense,'' Wilkens said. ``That will
never change. We'll play hard, but assignments could change.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said Blaylock realized that he might be traded, ending a
relationship that predated Wilkens by one year when Rumeal Robinson
was dealt to New Jersey for the sturdy Texan. ``He read the
(Journal-Constitution) this morning and he called me and then he
called Lenny. He understood what we were doing. When we completed
the deal (at 6:30 p.m.) we called him back and told him. He was
okay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock could not be reached for comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the tempo will change. The Hawks always play best
when they play fast and this trade virtually assures a more
up-tempo game when they move into Philips Arena in November.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is more to be done, even with the mystery trade.
Babcock said Tuesday night the team's needs include a backup
center, preferably one who can score, and a shooting guard who can
play behind Steve Smith. The Hawks will test the draft for that,
but there remains a possibility that they are not finished dealing
with the Warriors, especially if Golden State is successful in
bringing back free agent guard Mitch Richmond, who played with
Washington last season.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond going to Golden State would make the combustible John
Starks available and he would be the perfect antidote to offensive
lulls.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ex-Warriors who were acquired Tuesday, Coles, 31, is
a competent backup who averaged 9.5, 4.6 assists in 26.5 minutes a
game last season. He spent his first five seasons in Miami where he
played three seasons with Smith. Ferrell spent his first six NBA
seasons with the Hawks. Often an effective backup, he signed as a
free agent with Indiana and was dealt to the Warriors. At 34, his
playing time had diminished dramatically.

SPORTS COLUMN: A KISS, A HEADSTONE AND A FILLY NAMED THREE RING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There has been a death in the family. Barry and
Sheryl Schwartz are just getting through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a wake, like sitting shiva,'' the husband said, of
the Jewish mourning period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Sunday was bad,'' the wife said. ``Monday was worse.
It's a grieving process. It's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, their loss is as vivid as a thud and a scream. On
Saturday afternoon at Belmont Park, Sheryl Schwartz had just
finished giving a kiss to Three Ring when, for reasons none of them
will ever comprehend, the filly reared on her hind legs, fell over
backward and fractured her skull.
</P>
<P>
   She had to be euthanized, while jockeys cried and a track
photographer fell to the ground, moaning.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwartzes own 100 horses, and they loved Three Ring not
just because she had made them some money but because she had a way
about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my husband is around models a lot,'' the wife said,
``and she was just like models. She knew she was a star. She hammed
it up for photographers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the chief executive officer of Calvin Klein Inc., Barry
Schwartz is used to seeing long-legged models prancing up and down
the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved to strut her stuff,'' the husband said. ``She was a
prima donna.''
</P>
<P>
   They fell for her in the year they owned her, but they were not
all that unusual. Although racing has its share of abuses, most
owners (most trainers, most grooms, most exercise riders) love the
horses in a personal way that transcends the business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses are not pets like cats and dogs,'' Barry Schwartz said.
``They are 1,000 pounds of muscle, best left to professionals. But
she was something special, a chestnut filly with a great big white
face. I spoke to my trainer about her every day. I am not the kind
of owner who shows up on Saturday and people say, `She's running in
the seventh.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz has come a long way from his childhood in the Bronx,
where he cut high school to attend the track. He parlayed his
family grocery to make the first $10,000 investment in his
childhood friend, Calvin Klein, and he helped build that company
into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. Now the Schwartzes own
Stonewall Farm, 750 acres in upper Westchester, and the wife is a
regular at the barns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more touchy-feely than my husband,'' Sheryl Schwartz said
Tuesday. ``I hug the horses, but Three Ring was different. You
could go up to her and blow a kiss right into her nostrils, and she
would stick out her nose so I should do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   They ran her in the Kentucky Derby, where she finished 19th,
dead last, victimized by a slipping saddle. After that, she went
back to beating the fillies. On Saturday, she was entered in the
Mother Goose Stakes, and they converged in the paddock, along with
the trainer, Edward Plesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie said, `Come on, Sheryl, do your stuff,''' the wife
recalled. ``I gave her the usual kiss, and I turned my back, and I
heard something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the delicate beasts come back down on their front legs
after rearing up. Three Ring keeled over backward, striking her
head, flailing on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood all over,'' the husband said. ``I told Eddie later that
she missed him by inches. It could have been even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The husband rushed his wife away from the stall, knowing what
would come next. The handlers raised an oilskin screen and put the
filly out of her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran in the Derby, 125,000 people,'' the wife said. ``She
never broke a sweat. There is no explanation. I was just sick to my
stomach, to tell you the truth. I just wanted to get out of there
before the race.''
</P>
<P>
   They bolted the track, went home to Westchester, and only later
regretted not staying around to console Plesa and his wife, and the
loyal staff back at the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be alone, and then we wanted to be with people,''
the wife said.
</P>
<P>
   They had to call their son, Jon, who was at the airport, about
to fly to Italy on business. On Sunday, they stayed around the
house, with Sheryl Schwartz cooking for themselves and their
daughter, Stephanie, and her husband, Michael Ferdman. The phone
and the fax were going constantly _ messages from hundreds of
people in the fashion industry and the horse business. Schwartz
does not insure his horses, but money was not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody tells you how to deal with tragedy,'' said Barry
Schwartz, age 56, whose sister died young, whose father was
murdered at the family grocery, and who has lost horses before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was one common thread to all the messages, it was
that you never get over it, but after a while it doesn't hurt so
much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schwartz had been debating whether to fly to Milan for the
showing of next spring's line, but now he could not get on the
plane. On Monday, he had to go back to the office, while his wife
drove up to Stonewall Farm.
</P>

LATIN-EUROPEAN SUMMIT ENDS WITHOUT MAJOR AGREEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also LATIN-ECON)

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The first-ever summit of Latin American
and European nations ended here Tuesday with leaders of the world's
second- and third-largest trading blocs unable to agree on a
timetable or an agenda for negotiations for a free-trade agreement.
They opted instead for a much vaguer ``strategic partnership'' and
commitment to ``encouraging the increase and diversification of
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint communique, the 15-member European Union and
Mercosur, the South American customs union composed of Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, set this November for the start of
meetings to consider proposals ``regarding the definition of the
structure, methodology and calendar'' of future talks. But formal
negotiations on tariff issues are not scheduled to begin until at
least July 2001, and no deadline was set for their conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   That modest commitment fell far short of what advocates of
stronger commercial ties between the two blocs had sought. At a
news conference here Tuesday morning, Antonio Guterres, the prime
minister of Portugal, said he ``had hoped the process would have
moved further ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercosur group, with 200 million people and a combined
economy of more than $1 trillion, has been pushing Europe to grant
more access for its agricultural products like meat, wheat, sugar
and oil seeds, over the objections of France and a few other
countries. The Europeans, in turn, are insisting the South
Americans open up their service sectors further and reduce barriers
to imports of automobiles and car parts.
</P>
<P>
   With Mercosur and the rest of Latin America already negotiating
a free trade pact with the United States, ``it is necessary to work
with urgency,'' said Guterres, whose government will assume the
presidency of the European Union in January 2000 and has been one
of the strongest advocates of closer ties between Europe and Latin
America. At a news conference following the formal closure of the
summit, Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, speaking for the
European bloc, described the two-day meeting here, attended by
leaders of 48 countries, as a ``historical landmark.'' He expressed
confidence that both regions would act in concert on some issues
during the next round of talks at the World Trade Organization this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and the president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, along with his Mexican counterpart, Ernesto Zedillo, all
made an effort to deny that one of their goals in meeting here was
to outflank the United States or create a counterweight to it.
Though not invited to the conference, American officials have
praised the meeting here as a positive step toward freer world
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said Europe and Latin America together were seeking to
create ``a diversity of centers of decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But even on those nontrade issues, some negotiators went home
frustrated. The president of Chile, Eduardo Frei, could not
persuade Britain and Spain to halt judicial proceedings against
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile held in Britain
pending an extradition request from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro failed to get a condemnation of the Helms-Burton
Act, the American law imposing sanctions on foreign investors in
Cuba, included in the summit's final declaration. Britain's foreign
secretary, Robin Cook, who met with his Cuban counterpart in the
highest level contacts between those governments in 40 years,
lobbied unsuccessfully on behalf of four political prisoners held
by Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Latin American countries were quick to take
advantage of the opportunities offered by the summit to strengthen
trade ties among themselves. In an advance toward economic
integration within South America, for instance, the host country,
Brazil, reached an agreement with the five members of the Andean
Pact to reduce or eliminate tariffs on more than 3,000 products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brazil and Venezuela, which have been working
quietly to strengthen their electricity and transport links,
reached an agreement Tuesday to step up cooperation in the oil and
natural gas industries.

ADVERTISING: JWT HIRES EXECUTIVE TO MARKET AGENCY ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another high-profile hire, J. Walter Thompson is
naming a top executive to a new post with duties that include
marketing the agency itself.
</P>
<P>
   The executive is Mary Baglivo, who unexpectedly announced in May
that she would resign as chief executive at Euro RSCG Tatham in
Chicago for personal reasons and return with her family to the East
Coast. Ms. Baglivo, 41, will join Thompson, effective Sept. 1, as
executive vice president and chief marketing officer-U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baglivo, a specialist in advertising for packaged-goods
marketers like Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., has been one of the three top
managers at Euro RSCG Tatham, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit
of Havas Advertising. She also helped that agency land clients
including Midas International, the Red Lobster unit of Darden
Restaurants Inc. and the Sam's Clubs unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For Thompson, part of WPP Group PLC, Ms. Baglivo will work on
accounts to be determined, assist in seeking new accounts, try to
persuade clients to award the agency additional assignments and
serve broadly to promote the Thompson brand in the United States.
Her hiring and the nature of her new job are indicative of the
steps big agencies are taking to reinvent themselves and
reinvigorate their offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency is such a believer in the power of branding,'' Ms.
Baglivo said Tuesday in an interview in midtown Manhattan during a
visit to New York, ``that it believes branding is pivotal to its
own success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to market us to our new-business prospects,''
she added, ``to our current clients who can be further developed,
to prospective business partners and to prospective employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of this marketing job will be to tap the creative
brains of this agency, and to articulate in the most provocative
way what J. Walter Thompson can stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time that Thompson executives had pursued
Ms. Baglivo, who spent 18 years at Euro RSCG Tatham and its
predecessor, Tatham-Laird &AMP; Kudner. She was among the contenders
last year for the presidency of the agency's flagship New York
office, a post that eventually went to Bob Jeffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Mary three years ago, and we've talked about all kinds
of things ever since,'' said Thompson chief executive Chris Jones
in a telephone interview. ``I'm really pleased we persuaded her to
do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thinks there's something about Mary, Jones laughed
and replied: ``She's someone who excites creative people and
clients. She combines emotion and intellect. She can talk about
brands in a very human way, as well as in a very analytical way.
And she has the skills and lightness of touch to do all that
diplomatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baglivo will report to Jones and to Charlotte Beers, who was
named chairwoman at Thompson in March. The two women worked
together for many years at Euro RSCG Tatham, where Ms. Beers was a
predecessor of Ms. Baglivo as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baglivo joins a lengthening list of new managers at Thompson
who have arrived from elsewhere. Among them are Marina Hahn,
executive vice president for strategy and entertainment at the
Thompson New York office, who came from an executive post at the
William Morris Agency in New York; Jeff Chesebro, senior partner
and business development director at Thompson New York, who had
been vice president and new-business director at Partners &AMP;
Shevack/Wolf in New York, part of Wolf Group, and Patrick Corry,
executive vice president and director in charge of the Unilever
North America account, who had been executive vice president and
worldwide director for the account of the Frito-Lay unit of Pepsico
Inc. at BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson ``is passionate about bringing in new kinds of talent,
people from different backgrounds with what I call an
entrepreneurial energy,'' Ms. Baglivo said. ``The fusion should
result in some very interesting work.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arrivals are emblematic of Thompson's improving fortunes.
The agency had suffered a spate of account losses and executive
departures in 1997 and 1998. In addition to the new hires, the
agency has recently landed new accounts with billings estimated at
more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is great,'' Ms. Baglivo said of her arrival. ``What
Chris had as a vision is starting to materialize and turn
tangible.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade publications Advertising Age and Adweek had reported
that Ms. Baglivo was considering joining Thompson to reunite with
Ms. Beers, though they also said she was in talks with other
agencies like DDB Worldwide Communications Group in New York, part
of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun for me to look every week and see who I was talking
to,'' Ms. Baglivo said. ``I got a couple of ideas from what they
were writing.''

POWER STRUGGLE DISRUPTS OLDEST PUBLIC RADIO STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The trouble at radio station KPFA has come to
this: When two folk singers scheduled to perform as a duo on Sunday
afternoon arrived at the building, armed security guards would only
let one of them inside.
</P>
<P>
   Security measures taken last week after 30 people stormed the
station allow staff members to bring only one guest unless names of
guests are submitted beforehand. The duo's names were not on the
security list, so the show did not go on.
</P>
<P>
   The incident on Sunday was just one small example of how serious
the fight has become between KPFA, the nation's oldest public radio
station, and the Pacifica Foundation, which owns the station and
four others in Los Angeles, Houston, New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, KPFA, known for its leftist point of
view and reporting that ranges from East Timor in Indonesia to
People's Park a few blocks away, has been at the center of street
protests and arrests, the firing of veteran reporters and other
employees, potential lawsuits, even gunshots and death threats.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the increasingly ugly run-ins between KPFA's
staff members and supporters and its management _ a conflict that
local public radio stations across the country are following with
intense interest _ is a classic power struggle over who controls
what goes on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   KPFA, founded 50 years ago by pacifists, receives 80 percent to
85 percent of its financing from donations (the rest from grants
and bequests) and emphasizes programs with community members and
militants as guests and hosts.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first station to broadcast Allen Ginsberg reading
``Howl,'' Che Guevara trying to foment revolution just months
before his killing in Bolivia, and Patty Hearst, the kidnapped
heiress, calling her parents ``capitalist pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing protests here _ the latest was on Monday evening,
with more than 100 people holding placards and chanting ``Free
KPFA'' _ began as rumblings of discontent from staff members and
listeners, who say they started noticing a shift in the last two or
three years away from Pacifica's traditional style of
community-influenced programming and decision-making, toward a
hierarchical bureaucracy that wants to dictate its orders to a
community that, in essence, owns the station.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings grew louder when Pacifica unveiled a ``strategic
plan'' several months ago that called for more national programming
and removed local advisory board members from the central governing
board. The unrest exploded into full-scale protests and picket
lines when KPFA's general manager, Nicole Sawaya, was fired on
March 31, two weeks before the station's 50th anniversary
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Lasar, a former news reporter at the station and author
of ``Pacifica: The Rise of an Alternative Network'' (Temple
University Press, 1999), said that the firing of Ms. Sawaya _ on
the ground that she was not a team player _ made the perceptions of
top-down decision-making concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``KPFA is the closest thing that the Bay area secular left has
to a church,'' Lasar said, ``and Pacifica threw out the preacher
two weeks before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pacifica circulated a memorandum warning programmers not
to discuss the firing on the air, they promptly did. When KPFA's
veteran national news reporter and signature voice, Larry Bensky,
objected to the dismissal of the general manager, he too was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica's executive director, Lynn Chadwick, said all the
protests started because a small group of people refused to allow
KPFA to grow. She said Pacifica wanted to broaden its appeal and
reach more than 200,000 of the 6 million potential listeners in its
59,000-watt channel, and that a hard-core group of listeners and
staff members did not want the station to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people who have called me are still talking about
some of the programming changes made in the mid-'90s,'' Ms.
Chadwick said. ``Whenever there is any change, there are some
people who want things to be the way they think they were when we
started, who are going to resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chadwick, who has become the focal point of the protesters'
wrath, said that tighter security measures had to be imposed last
week after she was cornered in her office by 30 protesters who
refused to leave. In addition, the day after the general manager,
Ms. Sawaya, was let go _ Ms. Sawaya's contract was not renewed, but
she was not technically dismissed, Ms. Chadwick said _ gunshots
were fired into Pacifica's headquarters, next door to KPFA. Ms.
Chadwick said she had also been called names by protesters and
received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of heat is not good,'' she said. ``It's not good for
any of us. After all, we're all on the same side _ we want a good
community radio station.''

COMMENTARY: SENATOR VS. SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: In penultimate graf, phrase Zabar-less refers to well-known
New York City specialty food shop) 
(jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One Senate. Two Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   It is a concept so novel, so alarming, attention must be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Toobin caused a kerfuffle when he wrote in The New
Yorker this week that Bill Clinton was interested in running for
the Senate from Arkansas in 2002. If Clinton won in his home state
and Mrs. Clinton won in somebody else's home state, they would make
history as the first connubial Senate team.
</P>
<P>
   When the president called the story ``crazy,'' I knew it could
be true.
</P>
<P>
   As Hal Bruno, formerly of ABC, said of the Clinton crowd:
``You're dealing with very unpredictable and, at times, unstable
people.''
</P>
<P>
   With Larry King, Toobin evoked the image of a cool Tracy-Hepburn
pair working the cloakroom: ``I think the opportunity for them to
serve in the Senate together, doing public service, which is what
they both seem to want to do, would be a tremendous opportunity for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more public service from the Clintons and we will all
expire.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone thinks Bill Clinton would be motivated to run for the
Senate by the chance to work closely with his wife on more
allegedly urgent policy wonkery, I have a bridge to the future I'd
like to sell him.
</P>
<P>
   The man can't function unless he is causing dysfunction. He's
already driven Washington completely bananas. He can't help it.
This is what he does. And he does what he wants. The more Hillary
and Al try to get away from Bill, the more he'll croon and wiggle
his hips and make pouty lips until he gets back the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis will  &UR; never &LR;  leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   Why should President Clinton go back to Little Rock to try to
make world peace, like Jimmy Carter, or go off to Hollywood to
fetch Jeffrey Katzenberg's coffee, when he could stay here and
torment us _ not to mention his wife _ some more? Why have a legacy
when you can have ``Groundhog Day''? Why have an amicable divorce
when you can have ``War of the Roses''?
</P>
<P>
   Just picture this scary 2003 scenario: a Bush in the White
House, two Doles and a Gore lobbying on K Street, and two Clintons
battling each other on the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If both Clintons did become senators, Hillary would have
seniority. You've gotta love that.
</P>
<P>
   So if she catches him with another buxom intern in a Capitol
hideaway, used through the ages by lawmakers on the make, she could
really mess with him. No more having to cast that adoring glare
when he talks.
</P>
<P>
   Now she can refuse to yield her remaining time to the gentleman
from Arkansas. She can filibuster him, he can filibuster her, and
they can bring a couple branches of government to a screeching halt
again.
</P>
<P>
   With her seniority and her big state, she'll be on Finance and
Foreign Relations, and she could make sure he was on a loser panel
like the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. Obviously,
he is not suited for the Select Committee on Ethics or Veterans'
Affairs and would cringe from the permanent subcommittee on
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It will be wonderful to watch Hillary exact parliamentary
revenge from her perch on the Appropriations Committee. Whenever
her hubby tries to steer money to Arkadelphia, she can reroute it
to Elmira, if she can remember where it is. He may wind up feeling
lucky that he has no legacy for her to undo.
</P>
<P>
   She will arrange a rapprochement between two cagey and ruthless
New Yorkers, Harold Ickes and Dick Morris, and bring them on as her
top aides. With that triangulation of revenge, she will always out
maneuver the senator from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, having experienced her lash so often, Bill may be
reluctant to support Hillary for whip.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Clinton and Senator Clinton will have to abide by the
congressional rules of collegiality and civility in addressing one
another. You can just hear them now:
</P>
<P>
   He: ``May I ask the esteemed harridan from New York why she has
transferred funds from my Presidential Library to Project Cleanup
in Schenectady?''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Need I tell the distinguished rake from Arkansas that I
no longer have to feign interest in his tacky and Zabar-less state?
And my lecherous friend should not expect to see his face on a
postage stamp any time in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect she will see no reason to revise and amend her
remarks.

NEW RULES FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO TAKE EFFECT AS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
LAW EXPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs graphs 1 thru 5 to add details and clarify these are

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Corruption investigations of presidents and high
government officials will change significantly at midnight
Wednesday with the expiration of the law that gave the country
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr and 19 other independent
counsels during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Thursday, decisions about how and whether to launch
ethics investigations of top officials will be left to Attorney
General Janet Reno, who has sent to Congress the rules under which
her department will name special prosecutors in certain cases.The
rules give the attorney general far more discretion than the
current independent counsel law, the Ethics in Government Act.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Ms. Reno quietly dispatched a draft of the rules to
Congress for the information of its members. The new rules
dispensed with the convoluted and sometimes controversial
procedures of the independent counsel law, with its three-judge
panels to appoint the counsels and multiple preliminary inquiries
on whether the attorney general should request such an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she left to herself the authority to decide crucial
matters now strictly governed by the statute, such as when to
appoint someone from outside the Justice Department to carry out an
investigation of a high-level administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Under Reno's rules, she alone would be responsible for
appointing a special prosecutor, as such prosecutors would now be
known, only after she decided that an investigation would pose a
conflict of interest within the Justice Department and that such an
outside prosecutor was in the public interest. Under existing law,
appointments are not made by the attorney general, but by a
three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   There will be few mourners of the Ethics in Government Act and
not a chance that lawmakers will revive the statute in its present
form.
</P>
<P>
   The law, enacted in 1978, stands as a crumbling monument to
Watergate and the Saturday Night Massacre, the crisis over
President Nixon's successful effort to fire a special prosecutor.
But after 21 years, support for the law eroded in Washington's
scandal glutted culture because of accusations that both parties
had turned the law into a political weapon against incumbents. The
total cost of all independent counsel inquiries as of April was
$167 million.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general was an enthusiastic supporter of the
independent counsel law shortly after taking office in 1993. But
after years of being bludgeoned over her decisions, she announced
at a congressional appearance in March that the statute was too
``structurally flawed'' to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   A few lawmakers have offered proposals to preserve aspects of
the current law, including one offered Tuesday by a bipartisan
group including two Republicans, Arlen Specter or Pennsylvania and
Susan Collins of Maine and two Democrats, Carl Levin of Michigan
and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. Theirs would keep the law
largely intact, but tinker substantially with central provisions,
narrowing the number of officials covered, raising the threshold
for appointment, improving the quality of independent counsel
appointees. Few lawmakers give such ideas much chance of winning
much support _ at least not unless the Justice Department's new
approach fails.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the new regulations nor the expiration of the law has
any impact on existing independent counsels like Starr and the four
other currently serving prosecutors. These independent prosecutors
are investigating the activities of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, former Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros and events surrounding former Secretary Mike Espy's
tenure at the Agriculture Department. Espy was acquitted of charges
that he accepted illegal gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the sitting prosecutors, only Starr has hinted that he might
consider closing down when the law expires. He offered a possible
sign of his intentions on Monday when lawyers following the case
said that he had reached a plea bargain agreement with Webster
Hubbell, a former top Justice Department official.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deal, in which Hubbell would plead guilty to lying about the
role he and Hillary Rodham Clinton played in a failed Arkansas land
deal, would avert a trial and end the last pending prosecution in
the nearly five-year investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics law lies in ruins largely because it failed,
abysmally, in the view of almost every official who has been
scrutinized by independent counsels, in its goal of extracting
politics from inquiries into alleged abuses by top government
officials. Starr himself is a critic of the statute and testified
against its renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican and chairman of the
Governmental Affairs Committee, said after his committee held a
series of hearings to consider amending the law, that he had
abandoned any effort to fix it. He instead recommended: ``Give it a
decent burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not the first president to complain of excesses by
an independent prosecutor armed with grand jury subpoenas. But no
other president has been so seriously threatened. After Starr's
referral of alleged misdeeds involving Monica Lewinsky, Clinton was
impeached by the House but acquitted after a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's predecessors also complained that independent
prosecutors had turned political differences into criminal
offenses. During the terms of President Ronald Reagan and George
Bush, Lawrence E. Walsh, the Iran-Contra independent counsel, was
regularly attacked by Republicans for his aggressive investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh continued to investigate for six years until President
Bush delivered a death blow in the form of a Christmas Eve pardon
in 1992 _ after he had lost the election to Clinton _ absolving
former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and five other
officials who had either been charged or convicted of wrongdoing in
the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Even Walsh, however, concluded that the law should be
drastically narrowed. ``It's had its moment and that moment has
passed,'' Walsh said. ``Let's see how we get along.''

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual regulatory approach, federal
officials said Tuesday that they had tentatively agreed to approve
the $72 billion acquisition of Ameritech Corp. by SBC
Communications Inc. provided that the new company not only open its
market to competition but also offer local telephone service in 30
cities outside its region.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the conditions were intended to drive down phone
bills by encouraging competition in markets that have been
dominated by one local phone company. SBC and Ameritech executives
said Tuesday that regulators would impose stiff fines if the new
company, which will be the nation's largest local telephone
company, failed to offer residential and business telephone service
in cities including Miami, Seattle and Boston within 12 months and
New York, Washington and Phoenix within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Although SBC said soon after the merger was announced that it
intended to enter those cities, where federal officials hope it
will become a giant competitor, the regulatory agreement speeds up
its time frame. It also sets penalties as high as $2.2 billion for
the company's failure to offer local phone service outside its
existing territory or sufficiently open its markets to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reflects a fundamental shift in the approach
regulators have taken in reviewing large mergers. The Ameritech-SBC
deal will create a company with about 55 million local phone lines
in 13 states, cutting a swath from Michigan to Texas and including
Connecticut and California. Regulators have traditionally responded
to such proposed corporate behemoths by blocking the deal or
requiring divestitures, not expansions, of business units.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged they agreed to the 28 conditions in the
deal in part because of the heavy criticism of their approval of
the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex two years ago, a deal that
did not have such conditions and that consumer groups say has not
significantly increased competition or lowered prices. The
officials also said that the proposed agreement was an effort to
fix the shortcomings of a 3-year-old law that was intended to
deregulate the telecommunications industry and foster competition
but has been unable to force the regional Bells to open their
markets. Instead, the law has largely encouraged a wave of
corporate mergers and a heavy consolidation of the industry that
has raised concerns among some consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative accord is the product of three months of intensive
negotiations between lawyers for the companies and the staff of the
Federal Communications Commission, who were ordered by William
Kennard, the agency's chairman, to find ways to encourage
competition in the local telephone markets. The agency will give
competitors and the public about a month to comment on the proposal
before a final vote is taken by the commissioners. State regulators
in Indiana and Illinois must also approve the acquisition before it
can be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard applauded the work of the staff and indicated that he
would most likely approve the deal. It would be highly unusual for
a majority of the five commissioners, who were kept apprised of the
negotiations, to reject the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by SBC and Ameritech's commitment to open
their markets to competition and their agreement to suffer stiff
penalities if they do not,'' Kennard said. ``Our paramount goal
must be to hasten the day when consumers enjoy the benefits of more
competition in local and long-distance phone service.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the two companies said that they were pleased to
have resolved the issues and hoped to be able to complete the
merger soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that the merger is now in the home stretch,''
said James Ellis, senior executive vice president and general
counsel of SBC. ``The conditions are perhaps some of the most
wide-ranging that any company has ever submitted to the FCC in
order to win approval of this type of transaction. They answer
fully the concerns that Chairman Kennard first raised last April.
They are tough, they are fair and they are certainly enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer groups that had urged the FCC to block the
proposed acquisition said the accord held little hope of actually
increasing competition, particularly given the industry's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than block consolidation among monopolies and forcing
the companies into the marketplace, we have a massive expansion of
monopoly with an enormously complicated set of conditions that will
take an army to police,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of
the Washington office of Consumers Union. ``We've never had local
telephone competition, and to allow these companies to consolidate
is an enormous public policy risk, and I believe a mistaken one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman also said that to the extent that SBC actually served
new cities, it made economic sense for the company to offer service
only to the high-end of the market, mostly businesses and residents
now paying top rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defies the economic realities of the market that SBC would
sign onto this deal at any significant cost to it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While other regional Bell and local exchange companies did not
criticize the proposed agreement Tuesday, saying they needed time
to study it, analysts said they expected it would not face serious
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win-win for almost everybody involved,'' said Scott
Cleland, an analyst at the Legg Mason Precursor Group. ``You will
not see a lot of people trashing this because it has a little bit
for everybody. The FCC gets a host of pro-competitive commitments
and a way to enforce them with stiff penalties. The competitors get
a lot of their favorite pet rocks that they have long sought. And
SBC gets approval of its merger and it gets to control its own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Atkinson, the lead government lawyer who negotiated the
conditions, described them today as ``substantial and
unprecedented'' and said they would ``create irreversible market
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said that the agreement would be enforced by an
independent auditor approved by the FCC and paid for by SBC,
formerly Southwestern Bell. Ameritech, based in Chicago, was
originally formed by the joining of Bell companies in Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed agreement requires SBC, based in San Antonio, to
offer competitors in its territory steep promotional discounts of
up to 32 percent for reselling their services and 25 percent for
leasing the use of wires that run from SBC's switching centers to
customers' homes. It also requires that SBC establish a separate
corporate affiliate for offering high-speed Internet service on
telephone lines. The affiliate would be largely independent of SBC
and would have to be treated like any competitor of SBC.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The green awning outside the quaint Greenwich Village
storefront advertises ``psychic,'' but the 37-year-old
fortuneteller who calls herself Pamela Miller probably will not
answer the door anymore. Police said she was arrested June 24 for
making a woman in her 40s believe she had a curse and taking
$50,000 of her money over three years to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 13th arrest under Operation Crystal Ball, a
seven-month-old effort by the the city Police Department's Special
Frauds Squad to address the problem of illegal fortunetelling.
</P>
<P>
   They can be seen all the time across all five boroughs: women in
storefronts promising to read palms or tarot cards. Police estimate
there are about 200 of the businesses in the city. While some are
operating legitimately, police said, scores of others are preying
on vulnerable people hungry for psychic solace or metaphysical
wisdom. Victims have paid out as much as $500,000 over an extended
period, police said, including a psychologist who was taken for
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunetelling is legal for entertainment _ like hiring someone
to read tarot cards at a party. But the penal code calls it a
misdemeanor when a person ``holds himself out as being able, by
claimed or pretended use of occult powers, to answer questions or
give advice on personal matters or to exorcise, influence or affect
evil spirits or curses.'' Those who extract large sums are often
charged with larceny, a more serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the problem starts when fortunetellers _ who are not
licensed by the city _ start telling customers that they have
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunetelling isn't a crime in itself,'' said Lt. Robert
Groth, who heads the Special Frauds Squad. ``It's when they start
predicting things, putting people in fear, telling them they're
cursed or possessed.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not limited to New York City. Jeanine Giacalone,
a 26-year-old Long Island woman, was having trouble sleeping and
had consulted psychiatrists, priests and physicians. Nothing
worked. So she went to see a psychic she had driven past in Hampton
Bays, and the woman told her she had ``a lot of negativity in her
aura.''
</P>
<P>
   To cure her, Ms. Giacalone said the fortuneteller, charged for
various supplies: wax molds of her to meditate over, beeswax
candles, holy oil. She also told Ms. Giacalone to give her $2,000
for a retreat to the Middle East to get a special root.
</P>
<P>
   Six months and $3,000 later, Ms. Giacalone said she realized she
had been defrauded and went to the police. Ms. Giacalone said the
fortunteller returned the money in exchange for Ms. Giacalone's
dropping the charges. ``I wanted to believe in something,'' said
Ms. Giacalone, who owns an insurance agency. ``I'm not naive or
unintelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Operation Crystal Ball has shed new light on a
business that dates back at least 100 years and has been a source
of livelihood for immigrants through many generations. Research by
the Lower East Side Tenement Museum has found that fortunetellers
were once respected among European immigrants and considered
authorities in the community on a par with religious leaders or
doctors or other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Such days appear to be long past. While police said that
fortunetellers today are mostly Gypsies _ a people originally from
India who came to the United States via Europe _ who pass the
tradition down through their daughters, the approach that some of
them use is hardly noble.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Bob Geis, who specializes in such cases and related
crimes, said some fortunetellers work out of their own apartments _
often in upscale neighborhoods _ all over the city, drive expensive
cars and make on average about $200,000 a year. After all, they are
offering services to a society in which at least one White House
has consulted an astrologer and millions call psychic hot lines.
</P>
<P>
   A number of self-professed psychics say the criminal element is
not necessarily representative of their business. ``Some psychics
are good and some are bad, just like doctors and dentists,'' said
Destiny, a psychic on East 75th Street who sees people by
appointment only and would only be interviewed using her
professional name.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny said her kind of work can get expensive. ``People who do
intense spiritual work use very rare and sometimes hard-to-get
items to help a person reach a higher spiritual plane or to unlock
something negative either around them or in them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So how can people tell if they are being enlightened or duped?
The repertoire of illegal fortunetellers, police said, is fairly
standard: customers go in for an initial consultation at the
advertised fee of $5 to $25. The fortuneteller immediately assesses
their potential profitability. But it is not ostentatious wealth
that they see as the most promising, police said. Instead, they
look for customers with one expensive item _ like a watch or a
handbag _ indicating that they are casual about money.
</P>
<P>
   The fortuneteller then says she senses evil or a curse and wants
to explore it further, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients are told to pour a potion into their bath water and
to bring it back for analysis, police said. One woman was told to
breathe into a chicken's face, and the chicken died before her eyes
_ a trick arranged by the fortuneteller. ``You can't make up these
stories,'' Groth said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To exorcise the danger and evil, these fortunetellers prescribe
various remedies _ all at a price. If people are short of cash,
some fortunetellers have asked clients to purchase items for them
on their credit cards, the police say, including expensive watches
(to travel back in time and remove the curse placed three
generations ago) or even couches (to use the leather for effigies).
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old woman recently arrived in New York City from
Scotland was one such victim. Interviewed on the condition of
anonymity, she said she lost about $9,000 to a fortuneteller named
Sylvia Johns over a year. The fortuneteller told the woman she had
a tumor in her stomach, told her to rub $7,000 in cash over her
belly at home to draw out the evil and then told her to bring the
money in so the fortuneteller could bury it in a grave.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the woman saw a report about fortunetelling
crime on television that she went to the police. ``I was so
upset,'' she said. ``I just couldn't believe somebody I thought was
a friend _ I had believed them and trusted them _ turned out to be
a big scam.''
</P>
<P>
   If more fortunetellers have not been apprehended, police said,
it is in part because victims of such crimes are embarrassed to
report them. And when fortunetellers are arrested _ usually on
charges of grand larceny _ they are quick to plead guilty and pay
restitution rather than submit to a drawn-out prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Miller, the fortuneteller arrested last week, who also
goes by the last name Alvarez, was charged with grand larceny in
the third degree and released pending her next court date Aug. 21.
Her number was unlisted, and she was not home on a recent visit by
a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties for grand larceny range from a maximum of 4 years for
stealing $1,000 to a maximum of 25 years for stealing more than $1
million. But typically, a fortuneteller convicted of grand larceny
for the first time gets no jail time and has to pay only a small
fine, said an official in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Sachs, a lawyer for another fortuneteller facing charges,
said it was important to note that people are consulting
fortunetellers and paying them of their own free will. ``People
exercise a choice,'' he said, ``whether or not they want to go to a
psychiatrist, psychologist, astrologist, phrenologist,
graphologist.''
</P>
<P>
   The fortunetellers use pseudonyms and among the most commonly
used family names are Miller, Nicholas, Mitchell and Costello.
</P>
<P>
   They guard their turf in much the same way as do organized crime
families, police said, staking out territories around the city.
Each territory is run by a chief or, as Gypsies call him, a Rom
Baro, meaning ``big man'' in their language, Geis said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a three-block rule, meaning sidewalk storefronts _
known as ``ofisas'' _ have to be spaced out, the detective said. If
an outsider tries to violate this provision, she is ostracized, he
said, ``a fate worse than death'' in Gypsy culture.
</P>
<P>
   They are a closed, tight-knit group with an us-against-them
mentality, said Geis, who has studied Gypsies _ or Roma _
extensively. When two fortunetelling sisters were to appear in
court, about 30 members of their extended family showed up to
support them, police said.
</P>
<P>
   With up to 1 million fortunetellers operating in the United
States, police said, such scams are a nationwide problem and occur
in cities like Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles. Through a network
of law enforcement officials specializing in Gypsy crimes, the
Baltimore-based National Association of Bunko Investigators helps
track down suspects who have left any given state.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Geis said, fortunetellers are victims
themselves: women who learned fortunetelling as little girls and
know no other way to earn a living. He said he respects their
tenacity and sympathizes with their struggles as outsiders. But
when it comes to bilking people of their savings in the guise of
offering succor, the detective said, New York is no longer a place
that looks the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word is out that this is not a safe town to do business in,''
he said. ``They know the heat is on.''

   MODENA, Italy _ Flat, empty suits of clothing laid out across
the stage rise and walk as the actress Fiona Shaw reads a graphic
description by the novelist Umberto Eco of decaying corpses that
dwell in the land of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   A rampant red rooster violently tears sections from a long
scroll of paper drawn from the hands of a blue angel hanging over
the stage. A little girl, a doll figure with a Buddha-like china
head, mimes joyful wonder as she gazes at meteorites through a huge
telescope, while a snow owl undulates its feathery sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   The work, in rehearsals and previews here about 60 miles north
of Florence, is called ``The Days Before: Death, Destruction and
Detroit III.'' It was originally conceived as a piece about the
Apocalypse, and its 12 scenes are filled with bizarre imagery and
stylized movement. Each includes an excerpt read by Ms. Shaw from
Eco's novel ``The Island of the Day Before,'' the texts seemingly
unrelated to the onstage action.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wilson, who conceived, designed and directs it, calls
``The Days Before'' ``a celebration of humanity.'' Originally
commissioned by the Lincoln Center Festival, it will have its world
premiere in New York on Wednesday, the festival opening night, at
the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, ``The Days Before'' may seem less celebratory
than opaque. ``Bob's dream world,'' Ms. Shaw calls it. Ines
Somellera, a Mexican actress who plays the owl and other roles,
says, ``Bob's pieces are like underwater, the way people move.''
And Wilson himself is flexible about the definition. ``How would
you describe it?'' he asks people in the course of a rehearsal.
``It's a journey. It's a poem.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it a ``celebration of humanity''? In the United States,
Wilson is better known for the abstraction of ``Einstein on the
Beach,'' the music-theater piece he created with Philip Glass in
1976, or, more recently, for the formalism of his beautiful looking
but ill-received ``Lohengrin'' at the Metropolitan Opera last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began staging theater in the 1960s, Wilson has
developed a distinctive theatrical language involving precision,
stylization and a bypassing of intellectual logic in favor of one
that is visual or esthetic. Some people have found his work cold
and unemotional; others dismiss him as a creator of pretty
pictures; but few have discerned the ebullience that a
``celebration of humanity'' would seem to connote.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview here, Wilson said that one reason for his
attention to form and movement _ ``I do the piece silently at
first; we add the words later'' _ is that he does not want to
dictate too much to his actors. ``It has to come from them,'' he
said. ``It can't be mechanical.''
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a human element emerging from the tightly
controlled movements. ``This piece reminds me of my early work,
where people could be themselves in the context of a situation and
didn't have to assume a role,'' he told the young cast of ``The
Days Before'' prior to the last rehearsal. ``The most touching
thing about the piece are the moments when I see who you are as
individuals. Sometimes you're trying to act what's in your head,
and then I don't believe you. But if you feel something, that's
truth, it's your experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The director can appear distant and forbidding in photographs,
but in person, tall, good-looking and soft-spoken, the 57-year-old
Texan resembles a combination of the actors Larry Hagman and Kevin
Costner. Brought up in Waco, he had a distant relationship with his
father, a lawyer, and a mother who has been described as
unemotional and controlling. But the initial impression of distance
that the director himself can sometimes project is belied by the
warm embraces he exchanges with his cast as they prepare to leave
Modena.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson trained as a visual artist, graduating from the Pratt
Institute in 1965. ``If I had studied theater,'' he said, ``I would
never make the work I do.'' These days, his schedule includes
gallery and museum installations and shows of his own drawings,
paintings and furniture designs (chairs are a Wilson leitmotif).
</P>
<P>
   Images are central to his theater work, as well; he tends to
describe his plays with the aid of drawings. ``The best way to know
about my work is through the experience of seeing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But images are only part of the story. ``The pictures are the
surface,'' Wilson said. ``The audience at tonight's preview wasn't
particularly sophisticated. Many of them don't speak English, and
they're looking at the pictures. It's a universal language. That's
the skin of the piece. And you have meat under that; and you have
bones, the megastructure, like columns.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is a work by Euripides or one of his own, Wilson
said, he starts with the architecture. ``It's like an apartment
building,'' he said. ``You may like Baroque in your apartment, and
I may like Zen, but the building as an architectural whole has a
certain cohesiveness. So you create a megastructure for the whole
piece, and within that everyone has a certain freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   A model for this blending of formalism and freedom is the work
of George Balanchine, whom Wilson calls ``the Mozart of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else could line up a row of 17 dancers, and you think
they're absolutely in sync, but in fact, every one of them is doing
something slightly different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described watching Balanchine in rehearsal with Allegra Kent.
`` B. said, `Do this''' _ he mimed an elegant gesture. ``And she
did this'' _ he repeated the gesture imperfectly. ``And he just
said, `Mmm.' He didn't correct her. That was his greatness: he left
them their space.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson codifies the structure of each piece in sequences of
numbers and letters that he can summon up years later. ``The
structures aren't even perceptible after you put the piece
together,'' he said. ``The audience doesn't have to know.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The audience, however, might note the correspondences between
different scenes: a dark stage with a light-filled cave in the
lower left-hand corner may be reversed in a later scene with a very
bright stage with a dark area in the upper right. ``The Days
Before'' is set up as two columns of six scenes each: ``Scene 1
relates to 12, Scene 2 to 11, and so on,'' Wilson said, connecting
the columns with a shoelace network of crossing lines.
</P>
<P>
   In other works, like ``Einstein on the Beach,'' the acts are
separated _ or linked _ by intermediate scenes called ``knee
plays.'' ``I call them that because the piece is like a limb, and
that's the joint,'' Wilson said. ``Knee plays'' also figured in the
structure of the mammoth ``The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured
When It Is Down,'' another collaboration with Glass, which was
supposed to extend over five acts, 12 hours and six countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of its scenes were realized, the complete
epic, which had been planned to accompany the 1984 Olympics, was
canceled when financing fell through. Wilson's reaction to this
setback is reflected in his oeuvre. In work before ``The Civil
Wars,'' he often tested the boundaries of theater, including the
limits of time and geography (``Ka Mountain and Guardenia Terrace''
was staged in 1972 on a mountaintop in Iran and lasted seven days).
</P>
<P>
   Since ``The Civil Wars,'' he has (until now, at least) avoided
the plotless dreamscapes of his youth and tended to keep his work
within more conventional boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the Schaubuhne in Berlin asked Wilson to stage the
piece that became the first ``Death Destruction and Detroit.''
(``Death Destruction and Detroit II'' had its premiere at the same
theater in 1987; the title seems to have gained a comma in its most
recent incarnation.) It was Wilson's first opportunity to work in a
professional ensemble theater and other invitations followed.
</P>
<P>
   The logical next step was to take on the theater repertory.
Within a few years, he was staging Shakespeare and Brecht, Mozart
and Puccini, rather than, as before, exclusively original pieces.
Most of this work was done in the relatively well-to- do,
state-supported theaters of Europe, where Wilson is widely
venerated. In the United States, his work is generally known more
by reputation than through extensive exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding his busyness since ``The Civil Wars'' has been a
range of other, sometimes commercial, projects: mounting an
installation at the Galeries Lafayette in Paris, or creating an
original theater work in Milan to commemorate the 70th anniversary
of the magazine Domus in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In scope and ambition, these projects are markedly different
from Wilson's earlier work. With ``The Days Before,'' he said, ``I
feel I'm going back to something'' _ not least, perhaps, because
this is the first large-scale original noncommercial theater piece
he has mounted for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Where actors' movements in his earlier pieces had been unusual
or inexplicable, they took on an elegance and refinement _
perceived by some as stilted mannerism _ as the director reacted to
the conventions of Western theater and opera by turning to other
traditional genres like Noh drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I approach an opera,'' he said, ``I think, `How can I
hear it?' Usually I can hear it best when I close my eyes. Many
stagings get in the way of the music. I want to create pictures
that will let me hear the opera. It's hard to find the
counterpoint. In `Lohengrin,' I had the chorus moving downstage
very slowly; the music is fast, but I tried to have them walk
against the music. Counterpoint is the most difficult thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Days Before,'' Wilson's operatic style tempers the kind
of bizarre, tough imagery evident in the earlier versions of
``Death, Destruction and Detroit,'' creating a gentler, more
polished, fairy-tale whole. Even when the Romanov family is
assassinated onstage by a troupe of baboonlike soldiers, the
violence is graceful rather than provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the director cites the presence of ``rough edges,'' in
part because, while the piece's architecture has been in place
since the first workshop in 1996, the scenes are still being worked
on at the last minute. On the final day of rehearsal, Wilson
rejects a shining skirt, perhaps 20 feet long, that would have
reached to the floor from a figure elevated above the stage;
approves a new head for the angel; shifts blocks of text, and makes
decisions about which of the recorded works by the Japanese
composer Ryuichi Sakamoto to use.
</P>
<P>
   The show's Italian producer, Franco Laera, even had to relocate
the rehearsals here when the German city of Weimar, which was to be
a co-producer, pulled out. (The co-commissioners, with Lincoln
Center Festival, are now MC93 Bobigny, a performing arts festival
in France, and the International Istanbul Theater Festival.) And
the other readers besides Ms. Shaw _ including Isabella Rossellini
and Tony Randall _ will not be coming aboard until New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an idea about what this piece should be,'' Wilson said,
``and I kept trying to make it be that. But you have to go with
what it is; you can't make it be something else. So the work has
been a process of paring down; I've thrown so much out.'' As a
result, something that started as a vision of the Apocalypse and
developed into a sequence of individual tales has been condensed
into a flow of distinct but elliptical images, and the original
four-plus hours have been reduced to one and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Eco's texts, too, have been distilled until, freed of character
and plot, they form an abstract descant to each scene. ``This text
is difficult because it makes its own pictures,'' Wilson noted.
``It's an interesting text to set because it's not theatrical, it's
not poetic.'' The novel, in fact, is the tale of a shipwrecked
Italian, set in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eco and I are completely different,'' the director said.
``He's an intellectual and I'm not. You ask me, Do I like red wine?
I say, Yes. You ask him, and half an hour later he's still talking.
I don't know what this is, but it's fascinating. His text, his
ideas are very dense, like a rock. I put some space around them.
And the text weights down my ideas, keeps them from flying up.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece is not a collaboration with Eco in the strictest
sense; the texts did not enter the picture until the third workshop
of ``The Days Before'' last year. But, Wilson said, ``It's always a
collaboration, even with Puccini. If it was a William Burroughs
text, it would be a different piece.'' Wilson collaborated with
Burroughs on the 1990 ``Black Rider.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with an author's pre-existing text is different from the
kind of creative planning that marked Wilson's collaboration with
Glass on ``Einstein on the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Days Before,'' Eco's words and Sakamoto's music seem
more a part of the furnishings than of the structure. The composer
made some suggestions, and came to last year's workshop, but the
final decisions were Wilson's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   True collaborators in the more conventional sense include the
choreographer Suzushi Hanayagi, a dancer who began her formal
training in Noh and Kabuki at the age of 2{. She has worked with
Wilson on 15 pieces and weighs in on many aspects of the work
during rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Another collaborator is the autistic poet Christopher Knowles,
who recites his own texts. After graduating from Pratt, Wilson
worked in various institutions with handicapped children. Later,
deaf and autistic children became collaborators with him on
original theater pieces. Knowles' abstract use of language has been
a major influence on Wilson; his poetry is featured, for example,
in ``Einstein on the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Other collaborators are the young actors and production crew.
``Most of them have been involved with this project since the
beginning,'' Wilson said. ``The Days Before'' was almost entirely
developed at Watermill, the arts center that Wilson established on
Eastern Long Island in 1991 as a kind of creative laboratory in
which to develop his own and others' work _ and as an American base
for a director who works so much in Europe. Some people apply to
spend time there; some, like Ms. Somellera, wrote to Wilson about
his work and landed an invitation to Watermill in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't walk the same, after working with Bob,'' Ms.
Somellera said. ``At Watermill, he came up to me and said, `Remind
me to teach you how to walk.' I thought, `Excuse me, I've been
doing it all my life.' But afterward, you walk down the street, and
instead of just looking straight ahead, you're also aware of what's
happening on the sides, and of the back of your head.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Somellera, this awareness peaks in Scene 12 of ``The
Days Before'' when she follows Ms. Shaw across the stage. ``I'm in
many scenes, but that scene is it,'' she said proudly. ``That's my
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is working on three projects between his departure from
Modena in late June and the Lincoln Center premiere in July. With
so many things going on at once, he tends to view individual
projects in light of a greater whole, the Wilson oeuvre. ``De
Kooning once said that you reach a point where it's hard to tell
the difference between your art and your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His overextension is sometimes reflected in his work. In some of
the repertory pieces, the stylization can seem formulaic,
``Wilsonized,'' as it were. The imagination and tautness that
informed his beautiful Paris-Zurich production of ``Oedipus Rex''
had faded somewhat from his 1998 reprise of ``Dantons Tod'' in
Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
   He also doesn't always have time to monitor everything. Take
``Monsters of Grace,'' a 3-D film project with Philip Glass, shown
in America and Europe. ``I hated that!'' Wilson said. ``It was one
of the most embarrassing things in my life. They took my drawings
and animated them, but it wasn't me. I would have done it
differently: lighting, drawing. But there wasn't time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, he has the air of Marcello Mastroianni in the movie
``8{'': a weary director, plagued by a constantly ringing phone,
struggles to find peace of mind and takes characters from every
walk of life to create a work that is, ultimately, indeed a
celebration of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Fellini might be the last director one would associate
with Wilson, but there is something of his all-embracing warmth in
Wilson's approach. It does not get more Felliniesque than the
90-year-old Turkish opera singer Semiha Berksoy, who moves across
the stage in ``The Days Before'' on a velvet sofa, bellowing out
Isolde's ``Liebestod.'' ``People said I shouldn't do it,'' Wilson
confided, ``but she's been practicing, and she wants to do it, so
what the hell.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Days Before,'' there is room for both the random and
the human. The first scene opens with Dadon Dawadolma, a Tibetan
singer, chanting hauntingly in the twilight; Wilson doesn't find
out the meaning of what she is singing until she tells him after
the last preview. In the poignant final scene, under a luminescent
gray sky like dawn, a tiny, ancient man walks slowly, childlike,
around the deck of a ship peopled with frozen passengers, while Ms.
Shaw reads achingly of death.
</P>
<P>
   If images are the best conveyor of the content of a Robert
Wilson work, one reading might be that Wilson is not afraid to try
to make something beautiful. And as the stylized violence of the
work's first half is healed in the corresponding scenes of the
second _ shipwreck is answered with transcendence, an old woman's
death by a child's apotheosis _ it emerges that ``The Days
Before,'' beautiful or kitschy, impenetrable or facile, is
ultimately not only about apocalypse but also redemption.

 &HT;    Medicare Reform at a Glance
 &HT;    Eds: Changes government share in 2nd graf from $500 to $1,000.
 &HT;    289. With MEDICARE.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are highlights of President Clinton's Medicare reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   _ Establishes a voluntary plan to cover 50 percent of
prescription drug costs. The government's share would be up to
$1,000 of costs in 2002 and $2,500 in 2008. _ The prescription
benefit would cost about $24 a month in 2002 and $44 a month by
2008.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beneficiaries with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty
level (currently $11,000 for an individual, $17,000 for a couple)
would not pay any drug premium or cost sharing.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENTIVE CARE
</P>
<P>
   _ Eliminates copayments and deductibles for all preventive
services covered by Medicare, including cancer screenings,
mammographies and diabetes-management benefits.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   _ Gives Medicare new authority to seek competitive prices for
services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requires managed care organizations to offer a package of
``core benefits'' which Medicare will cover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offers beneficiaries an incentive to go into lower cost
managed care plans by reducing premiums 75-cents for each dollar
below the average amount charged by a plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extends provisions of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that reduce
payments to Medicare providers. The provisions are scheduled to
expire in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   COST SHARING
</P>
<P>
   _ Indexes the $100 deductible for Part B, which covers
physicians and related services, for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adds a 20- percent copayment for laboratory services.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE BUY-IN
</P>
<P>
   _ Allows people 62 to 65 to ``buy into'' the Medicare program
for about $300 a month. Displaced workers between 55 and 62 could
buy in for $400 a month.

NBA FINDS LEAN PICKINGS IN THE DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Krause has been in sleuth mode for a week, trying to
uncover the one clue that will return the Chicago Bulls to
respectability. If he was not administering a three-hour
psychological test to Maryland's junior all-America guard Steve
Francis, the Bulls' general manager was dispatching an assistant
coach to Rhode Island in search of the elusive Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of good it did him. Owning the No. 1 pick in Wednesday
night's National Basketball Association draft at the MCI Center,
Krause found out what most teams already knew: With no clear-cut,
impact player among the top five, the crapshoot is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's literally a bull market,'' Golden State general manager
Garry St. Jean said. ``We're dealing with junk bonds. The trading
is very volatile. These guys go up and down every day, depending on
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, who have contemplated trading the pick, are leaning
toward taking Elton Brand, the player of the year from Duke
University, said one Eastern Conference official who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very good possibility that we will not make any
decision on the draft choice until Wednesday afternoon,'' Krause
said. ``We don't feel there's an advantage to us to making it
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   If Odom isn't taken No.1, Miami is making a serious push to
acquire him at No.2. Heat president and coach Pat Riley flew the
19-year-old forward down to Miami Tuesday to work out and be
interviewed. The Heat was pitching P.J. Brown, Voshon Lenard and
its first-round pick (No.25 ) to Vancouver for the pick. If the
Grizzlies keep the pick, they appear to be interested in Francis.
The Charlotte Hornets have said they will take Baron Davis, the
UCLA point guard, with the No. 3 pick, even though Davis has said
he would like to go to the Clippers at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers may have to make a huge decision: Take the
multitalented freshman Odom or the Miami of Ohio senior
all-American Wally Szcerzbiak who lighted up the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto picks fifth but has been one of the most active teams
trying to swing a deal over the last two days. The Raptors were
said to be interested in moving up to No. 2 to acquire Francis.
</P>
<P>
   There was one major trade Tuesday and talk of a blockbuster that
never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Hawks sent Mookie Blaylock and their 21st pick to
Golden State for Bimbo Coles, Duane Ferrell and the Warriors' No.
10 pick, with which the Hawks could go after another point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto negotiated with Houston about acquiring Hakeem Olajuwon.
They were offering Kevin Willis, Doug Christie and draft picks for
the future Hall of Famer, but the Rockets said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very hard for me to pull the trigger on something
like that,'' said the Rockets' coach and general manager, Rudy
Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and Brand have emerged as the consensus choices for the
No. 1 pick. Szczerbiak, Odom and Davis are widely considered to
fill out the top 5. Minnesota, Washington, Cleveland and Phoenix
have the sixth through ninth picks. Jonathan Bender, a
6-foot-10-inch, 18-year-old from Picayune, Miss., High School, may
go as high as No. 5 and will probably not last past No. 9. The
Wizards are said to be interested in Connecticut's Richard Hamilton
at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   And then a trio of talented point guards _ Jason Terry of
Arizona, Andre Miller of Utah and William Avery of Duke _ should go
next. The Knicks, who have the 15th pick, are hoping one of those
players falls out of the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four hours before the draft, and you don't have
concrete levels where certain players will go,'' St. Jean said.
``It's a strange situation. You may get a guy at No. 5 and the team
with No. 15 might get essentially the same player or a better guy.
It's not like last year where you had Paul Pierce, Vince Carter and
Antawn Jamison all slotted. This top five, you just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time so much uncertainty clouded the draft was 10 years
ago, when the Sacramento Kings chose Pervis Ellison No. 1 over
Danny Ferry, Sean Elliott, Glen Rice and J.R. Reid. If gauging the
talent pool has been rough on team officials, it has also
confounded the draftees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nerve-racking,'' Francis said Tuesday. ``It's the last
day, and you hear so many rumors and so much that's going on. It's
a mystery to me, just like every other player is really wondering
where they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom may be the most nervous, especially after he skipped the
league-mandated physical, failed to show for scheduled workouts and
flirted with the notion of returning to school before firing his
agent and finally working out for four teams Monday in Providence,
R.I. Heralded as the most talented but troubled player in the
draft, he missed the news media availability session in Washington
Tuesday afternoon before eventually showing up an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the teams out there, there's nothing to be scared of or
harmful of,'' Odom said in an interview with an NBA public
relations employee Tuesday afternoon. ``I'm not a cancer. I'm a
great kid, a little misunderstood. The reason for me not going to
Chicago was the problems I was having with my representatives and
the people that were around me. I had to just clear the attic out
and take a step back. I just needed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great kid. I don't understand what's going on,'' said
Szczerbiak, who once played on an Amateur Athletic Union team with
Odom. ``You'd think two days before the draft there would be
something on his whereabouts, what he's doing. He probably has a
lot of people pulling him in all kinds of different directions,
like a rubber band. It's a tough situation, but at the same time,
he's a grown man now, and he's got to make these decisions and show
up for the things he's supposed to show up for.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no high school, this is no joke here, this is the NBA
draft. It doesn't get any bigger than that. You can't be playing
games with NBA general managers and NBA coaches, especially with
the lucrative career he's about to embark on.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (Nos. 1 and 16), Toronto (5 and 12), Cleveland (8 and
11) and Minnesota (6 and 14) have two picks apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, Dallas, Sacramento, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Detroit,
Orlando and Portland do not have first-round picks. Twelve players
withdrew their names from the draft last week, leaving 27
underclassmen, high school and foreign players eligible.

COMMEMORATING THE HISTORY OF FORTUNETELLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with NY-FORTUNETELLING) 
 (bl)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A curator found them while going through one of the
old tenement apartments at 97 Orchard St. in the fall of 1993:
about six business cards buried in the floorboards and behind the
kitchen wall.
</P>
<P>
   The cards, one side in English, the other in Yiddish, advertised
the services of Professor Dora Meltzer, ``The World Famous Palmist
and Mind Reader recently arrived from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the project by the Lower East Side Tenement Museum to
commemorate the history of fortune-telling in New York City, as
well as the search for Dora Meltzer, who, in her business cards,
offered ``the best advice in business, journeys, lawsuits, love,
sickness, family affairs, etc.'' _ all for 15 cents and up.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was established in 1988, the tenement museum in lower
Manhattan has restored apartments in a 19th century tenement on
Orchard Street at Broome Street, using each one to tell the story
of a particular family and a particular immigrant experience.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials said they hope the process of learning about
Ms. Meltzer will shed light on such questions as how immigrant
women adapt themselves to the United States and to what extent
middle-class Americans criminalize immigrant activities.
</P>
<P>
   In documenting the history of the families that lived in the
apartments that have been restored so far, the museum had the help
of family members in addition to extensive research. Given the
valuable firsthand information that such family connections provide
_ as well as documents, photographs and artifacts _ the priority
for the museum's fortunetelling project is finding relatives of Ms.
Meltzer or people with personal knowledge about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope by the end of the summer we'll have some answers about
who Dora Meltzer was,'' said Steve Long, the director of the
museum's resource and study center who is heading up the
fortunetelling research.
</P>
<P>
   So far the museum's researchers have only scratched the surface.
They were told by the topographer's union that the business cards
appear to date from the 1890s. The 1903-1904 City Directory lists a
Hymen Meltzer living with his wife, Bessie, at 97 Orchard St., and
museum officials suspect that this was the fortuneteller's real
identity, that Dora was simply a professional name. Both Meltzers
were listed in the directory as Russian immigrants who arrived in
the United States around 1885 and had two daughters, Ray and
Lillian, and two sons, Samuel and Bernie.
</P>
<P>
   Long said he has sent letters to every Meltzer in Manhattan,
Brooklyn and most of Queens asking for information about the
fortunetelling Meltzer family. None have produced any leads, and
Long said he planned to send another round of letters to the
suburbs and possibly to Florida, given its large population of
Jewish retirees from New York.
</P>
<P>
   From research conducted so far, the museum has determined that
the average fortuneteller in early 20th century New York was likely
to be a traditional housewife.
</P>
<P>
   In recreating the Meltzer apartment, the museum plans to include
elements typically used by fortunetellers of the day: a
palm-reading chart, tarot cards, reflective crystals and a crystal
ball. Researchers have made connections between turn-of-the-century
methods and current methods by calling up fortunetellers who
advertise in immigrant Russian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   One they recently found in Brighton Beach said her grandmother
had psychic powers, which she had inherited.

NBC REHIRES ALBERT TO CALL NBA GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Add an announcer to the list of sports figures who return to
their jobs after a criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   NBC rehired Marv Albert Tuesday, less than two years after the
network fired him when he pleaded guilty to assaulting a former
lover. NBC executives acted amid fears that Albert was about to be
hired by a competitor, Fox Television, officials of both networks
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Albert's admission of guilt in September 1997 came after court
testimony about cross-dressing and unusual sex. It transformed the
acclaimed announcer into a wanted-poster boy for some women's
groups and an easy target for comedians on late-night television. A
prosecutor agreed to drop sexual assault charges, alleging that he
had forced the woman to perform oral sex, in return for Albert's
plea to a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery _ the announcer
admitted repeatedly biting the woman in the back in a Virginia
hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very happy day for NBC Sports,'' said Dick Ebersol,
chairman of NBC Sports. ``Marv has been a great friend to all of us
here for a long time, above all to me, in particular. He is my
friend. He is a great talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always stayed in touch, in the last two years,'' Ebersol
told reporters. ``I made it clear to many of you that I always
wanted him, at some point, to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert will do play-by-play for some NBA games on NBC, beginning
in the fall, joining the existing broadcast team with a partner yet
to be determined, Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC suffered some ratings losses for NBA games this year,
especially during the recently completed playoffs, a decline
largely attributed to a strike-shortened season and Michael
Jordan's retirement. And the network's investment in the television
rights for the NBA is significant, with the number of broadcasts
jumping from 25 this year to 55 next year. The NBA and the Olympics
(which are broadcast only every two years), are NBC's major sports
holdings, having lost NFL broadcasts to network competitors two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Albert, meanwhile, is considered among the top basketball
announcers of all-time. He called New York Knicks games for 30
years, until he resigned his job with the Madison Square Garden
Network after his guilty plea. Albert earns the near universal
praise from critics for his style, knowledge and preparation, and
he has won the Curt Gowdy Media Award from the Naismith Basketball
Hall of Fame, six CableAce Awards, and 20 times being named New
York State Sportscaster of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   His trademark call of ``Yessss!'' is recognized even by people
who know little about sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walking back into the building at 30 Rock was a wonderful
feeling,'' Albert said at the news conference Tuesday, referring to
the NBC headquarters in 30 Rockefeller Plaza. ``I think it's hard
for me to make a judgment on the word redemption. I'm just glad to
be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he anticipated any negative reaction from fans,
viewers, or the media, Albert said, ``It's better to look ahead
rather than look back and get involved with any issues about how
the media handles things. Everything's gone in the right direction
the last year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert first was rehired by MSG, just 10 months after he
admitted the assault, to do radio broadcasts of Knicks games and a
30-minute sports wrapup show called ``SportsDesk.'' Seven months
later, Turner Sports hired him to call NBA games and other special
events on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he garnered almost universal support from
sportswriters in New York and fellow broadcasters, many of whom
said he had paid publicly and privately for his offense. ``Bob
Costas, in particular, has gone out of his way throughout these two
years to encourage us to bring Marv back.'' Ebersol said Tuesday,
referring to NBC's lead play-by-play announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Public relations officials in New York Tuesday credited Albert's
gradual return to national broadcasting as key to the success of
his comeback. ``There was no rushing to this point,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Albert will continue with his duties at Turner and MSG,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if, at any point, he was disturbed by NBC's original
decision to fire him, Albert said, ``Dick and most of the people at
NBC have been very, very supportive throughout the whole situation.
I understand what had to be done at that time.''

RELATIVES SAY HONDURAN TEEN EMBELLISHED STORY OF ODYSSEY TO NEW
YORK
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The doe-eyed 13-year-old boy who captivated the city
with his tale of traveling solo from Honduras to New York in search
of his father apparently manufactured much of what he told the
police and people who helped him, according to accounts offered
Tuesday by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster's story _ that his mother was killed by Hurricane
Mitch and that his only living relative was the father he had never
seen _ is not true, said family members in Honduras and in the
Miami area, where the boy had been living until being reported
missing last week.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the boy, Edwin Daniel Sabillon, said his mother was
alive and living in Honduras, as was the grandmother who raised
him. It is the boy's father, Grevis Sabillon, who is dead,
something that relatives said young Edwin never seemed to accept
fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``His problem is that he does not want to accept that his father
died,'' said Jemmy Rodriguez of Hialeah, Fla., who said she is
Edwin's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriquez said in a telephone interview that the boy ran
away from his aunt's Hialeah home, where he had lived for two
months, on June 24. Relatives reported him missing and realized
where he had gone only when they saw his picture on television
Tuesday. The police in Hialeah confirmed Tuesday night that the
family had filed a missing-person report on the boy.
</P>
<P>
   With his poignant saga of longing and gumption, Edwin was
national news on Tuesday. His tale was on the front pages of
newspapers. His adventure was recounted on television. People who
heard and read of him offered, in calls to reporters and to the
city's Administration for Children's Services, to care for him and
give him money.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi driver who had picked Edwin up on Sunday night said he
wanted to adopt the boy. Police officers in the Bronx cared for
him, fed him treats and eagerly conveyed his account of his odyssey
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani even figuratively embraced the boy as a
plucky symbol of immigrant virtues. ``He's in a city that
appreciates and values immigration, so he should feel very
comfortable here,'' the mayor said Tuesday, a few hours before the
doubts about Edwin's story began to surface at City Hall. ``All of
us came here from somewhere else at one time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night Giuliani, who was in Chicago for a fund-raiser,
confirmed that the police were investigating parts of Edwin's
account ``that turned out not to be, at least at this point,
corroborated.'' But he praised officers for responding sensitively
from the outset to a boy who apparently needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Edwin's real story, if the accounts of his relatives are
confirmed, may be nearly as poignant _ that of a resourceful but
troubled youngster whose impulsive behavior after his father's
death made him hard for relatives to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez said Edwin grew up in the care of his paternal
grandmother in the Honduran town of San Buenaventura. His mother,
who now lives in the northern Honduras town of Choloma, gave him up
when he was three months old.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin had told the police, as well as friendly strangers in
Miami and New York City, that his mother had died in a mudslide
after Hurricane Mitch plowed through their home last October.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother, Paula Vazquez Hernandez, told The Associated
Press in an interview at her home Tuesday that she has no idea why
Edwin would have concocted a story for strangers about being alone
and then run away to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him back,'' she said. ``I want him to return to me.
I'll put him in a reform school until he straightens out.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Edwin's relatives said the boy's father had left Honduras eight
years ago and worked in Miami on construction jobs, sending money
home regularly to his mother and his son. As far as they know, he
never lived in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they said, he discovered he had contracted AIDS and
returned to Honduras, where he died on Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of his father, Edwin went to Hialeah to live
with one of his father's sisters, Aurora Sabillon. Ms. Rodriguez,
who is Mrs. Sabillon's daughter, said the boy was sometimes defiant
and refused to be registered for school, saying he wanted to go to
work and support his grandmother as his father had.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Thursday, shortly after 1 p.m., his aunt went to the
Hialeah police station and reported him missing. She said she had
last seen him at 10 that morning. She did not indicate why she was
sure so soon that he had run away, said Susan Shaw, a Hialeah
police supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what Edwin did that day or the next. But on
Saturday, he showed up at a Miami restaurant, telling patrons that
his mother had died in Honduras and he was on his way to New York
City to meet his father.
</P>
<P>
   Touched by his story, they took up a collection and bought him a
bus ticket.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant Tuesday, there was disappointment at the new
revelations, especially since some of the regulars had heard a
rumor that the boy had really found his father after arriving in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed,'' said Emilio Jose Jimenez, who had
chipped in for Edwin's transportation. ``We don't care so much
about the money, but we felt a special sentimental unity with this
child.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Edwin apparently arrived by bus in New York City, alone, on
Sunday afternoon. He later told the police that he wandered around
for about six hours before telling a sympathetic taxi driver that
he had to meet his father at LaGuardia Airport. The police, who
took custody of Edwin after being notified by the taxi driver, said
he had his birth certificate and a change of clothes with him in a
paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin was placed with a Spanish-speaking foster family.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day on Monday _ and continuing Tuesday _ police
officials said that they had been able to confirm parts of Edwin's
story, contributing to the boy's general aura of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, detectives said they had talked by phone to a
family in Honduras where, according to the boy's account, he had
lived until leaving on his trek on May 22. They also indicated that
they had seen the letter that Edwin said his father had written him
earlier this year, with the instructions for meeting up at
LaGuardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The police also were kept busy following local leads, one
investigator said, after the publicity about the case generated
calls from a number of people who claimed to know the whereabouts
of Edwin's father in New York.

SOBRERO OF U.S. MADE IT IN FITS, STARTS AND TRIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ind.)  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ Kate Sobrero realized that women's soccer had
crossed a new threshold of popularity last week as she sat on the
American team bus following a 7-1 victory over Nigeria in Chicago.
A college friend from Notre Dame, Julie Maund, was tailgating in
the parking lot at Soldier Field, talking to Sobrero by cellular
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Maund held the phone up, and kids began screaming things like,
``You played great,'' and the inevitable, ``Do you know Mia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie said one man offered her money to put his daughter on
the phone with me,'' Sobrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Having sat out Sunday's 3-0 victory over North Korea in the
Women's World Cup with a wrenched ankle, Sobrero is expected to
return to the lineup in central defense Thursday night for a
quarterfinal match against Germany in Landover, Md. She has become
a tough, reliable defender with speed, agility and a ruggedness
forged by learning the game from three older brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she will develop into one of the best defenders in the
world,'' said Tony DiCicco, coach of the American team.
</P>
<P>
   This is far more than Sobrero thought she would ever achieve,
given the queasy first impression she made on the national team in
1995. Some players immediately stand out from the crowd, and so did
Sobrero, though not in the way she had hoped. Weakened by flulike
symptoms, lacking fitness, she passed out during a running drill.
Her very first practice, and she folded like a beach chair in the
Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated, Sobrero did not accept another tryout offer from the
national team for three years. When DiCicco called, Sobrero turned
him down. Embarrassed, she could not face up to such stars as Mia
Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It destroyed my confidence for a couple of years,'' said the
22-year-old Sobrero, who is from Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ``These
were people I worshipped, and I passed out in front of them. I
wasn't fit. And I wasn't mature enough emotionally to be on the
national team.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, collegiate soccer restoked her competitive fire. She
helped lead Notre Dame to four consecutive Final Fours and was
named defensive most valuable player of the tournament in 1995,
when the Fighting Irish won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Sobrero felt assured enough to play as one of the
allowed overage players on the American under-20 team that won an
important tournament in Denmark. In January 1998, she was invited
back to the national team tryouts, and this time she accepted. But
her second impression was even more painful than her first.
</P>
<P>
   While attempting to score a goal during a scrimmage, Sobrero
collided with goalkeeper Saskia Webber and suffered a broken jaw.
She lost a tooth, and her memory for about half an hour. ``I must
have been thinking I was a forward,'' she said. For six weeks,
Sobrero had her jaw wired shut, which left her with a diet of
milkshakes and mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained 15 pounds,'' she said. ``I'm the only person in
history to gain weight with their jaw wired shut.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time Sobrero had spent more time in the
emergency room than George Clooney. As a child, she learned soccer
from her three brothers _ ``I was a tomboy, and I was so mad when I
learned I couldn't play football'' _ and what they taught her were
not always the finer points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   As a 14-year-old, Sobrero was kicked by one of her brothers
during a game in the yard. ``I beat him and he got mad and kicked
me,'' she said. Sometime later, it was determined that the kick had
broken a bone in her leg. The doctors realized this while they were
treating her for a fractured ankle suffered in a high school
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder her nickname is Sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the klutz,'' Sobrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Among her teammates, she is unfailingly popular and amusingly
described as goofy or quirky. A dean's list student at Notre Dame,
Sobrero possesses an endearing absent-mindedness. Or, as midfielder
Julie Foudy puts it, ``She's a few feathers short of a duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't turn the act of getting onto an elevator into
a potential 911 call. But before the North Korea match in Foxboro,
Mass., Sobrero was squeezed between the elevator doors at the team
hotel. Had this collision occurred on the soccer field, the
elevator would have received a red card. Sobrero looked at
teammates and said, ``I think I broke my wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see her with her shoes untied and say, `Tie your laces
before you trip,''' said her fellow defender Brandi Chastain.
``She'll say, `I feel I'm in balance when my shoes are untied.'''
</P>
<P>
   This eccentricity disappears on the soccer field, replaced by
what soccer people call ``hardness,'' a grittiness in one-on-one
matchups. She ran down a Danish forward and made a sliding tackle
to save a goal in the opener against Denmark. And, even on a bad
ankle, Sobrero backpedaled for 25 yards in one nimble maneuver
against Nigeria, forcing a Nigerian forward to change direction
several times until she ran out of energy and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a marking mentality bar none,'' said Lauren Gregg, the
assistant coach of the American team. ``There's a psychological
dimension. She loves a duel.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months after her jaw was broken, Sobrero is hoping to
get a replacement tooth soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finally on the insurance plan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that paramedics can go off red alert.
After practice the other day at Babson College in suburban Boston,
a foul ball from a nearby baseball game strafed the area where
Sobrero and her teammates were speaking to reporters.
Instinctively, she ducked.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my luck,'' she said, ``I'm surprised it didn't hit me.'' &QL;

 &HT;    NCR lands Postal Service contract
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton-based NCR Corp. won a $67 million contract
to provide hardware and software to the U.S. Postal Service for
customer service counters.
</P>
<P>
   As options are exercised by the Postal Service, the contract
value could hit $176 million, NCR officials said. The contract
extends a $150 million deal that the Postal Service awarded NCR in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   For customers, it means less time in line at the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for mail services and products will become easier with
automated, online check and debit/credit card authorization, NCR
officials said. And, improved inventory management will allow the
Postal Service to keep enough special issue or commemorative stamps
on hand at post offices.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the 10-year deal, NCR will install printers,
point-of-service terminals, bar code scanners, thermal printers,
electronic signature capture devices, scales and database
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The new retail systems will replace more than 63,000 outdated
retail terminals. As part of the agreement, NCR will install 3,500
machines in this stage of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will install 73,000 such machines from NCR
and IBM Corp. in 20,000 locations during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The machines will be linked to NCR's data warehousing software
so the Postal Service can study customer buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   NCR, which employs 33,000 people worldwide, makes automatic
teller machines, computerized cash register systems, data
warehouses, software and bar code scanners.
</P>

PATIENT RIGHTS BILL DEAL FREES FARM BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After days of angry deadlock over a routine farm
bill, Senate leaders finally found a way late Tuesday to push on
with the legislative year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the deal had nothing to do with farming.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats agreed to stop blocking the annual agriculture
appropriation legislation in exchange for being allowed to debate a
health-care bill known as the ``Patients Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy led the Democrats' crusade, using
complex procedural moves to hold the farming bill hostage until he
got his health bill on the calendar. He spent nearly 20 hours in
the Senate chamber over the past week, thundering about the need
for change in the health-care system, demanding limitations on the
power of health maintenance organizations. Throughout, Kennedy
insisted his only motivation was securing patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current political climate, with each side struggling
to seize center stage in the 2000 elections, members of both
parties said the bitter wrangling was about far more than health
care, or any single bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate minority leader Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota said he
was thrilled the standoff was over because it meant a ``great
victory for the 160 million Americans who are today demanding that
Congress fix the problem in managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, several Democrats admitted they were happy
the lengthy deadlock played out the way it did. Not only did
Republicans appear paralyzed for a week, but they also will be
forced to vote on health care, a popular issue among voters and a
point of vulnerability for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the delay in the appropriations process might
force Congress to resort to a last-minute overall spending bill
this fall, a process that could cede more power to the president,
and therefore Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's an orchestrated strategy,'' said Jim Jordan,
political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
The main purpose, he said, was to bring up the health-care bill.
But, he said, ``like most good public policy, it's also good
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato
Institute, a conservative think tank, agreed, saying it was ``very
clearly in the Democrats' interest to try to throw sand in the
machinery of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Democrats have been very forthright about it. They
don't want the Republicans to have legislative victories to
campaign on in 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By working out Tuesday's agreement to dislodge the agriculture
appropriations bill, Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi
put an end to the chief accusation lodged by Democrats: that
Republicans were a ``do nothing'' party.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, meanwhile, scrambled during the last week to
show that Democrats were slowing down Senate business. The
difficulty they had drawing attention to the agriculture bill
prompted Lott and several others to use tractors at a news
conference on the Senate lawn, a reminder that the issue was
farming, not health care.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the issue was, in fact, health care. The deal was
struck late Tuesday afternoon when Republicans agreed to bring the
Patients Bill of Rights to the floor for four days of debate
beginning July 12. The Democrats' proposal would give patients a
host of benefits, including the right to sue their HMOs, and would
give doctors, not an HMO, the power to determine when a patient has
a medical need.

 &HT;    Legislation sent to governor despite charges of influence
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ Legislation designed to offer patients more leverage
with their health insurers is on its way to Gov. Bob Taft amid
charges from Democrats that he broke a campaign promise on the
issue and other Republicans caved into the ``deep pockets'' of
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio House of Representatives on Tuesday voted 83-14 in
favor of the minor changes the Senate made on a controversial new
patient protection plan. The bill would allow patients to request
an independent, external review when treatment or medicine
prescribed by a doctor is denied by their health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not offer patients the right to sue their insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The liability provision, proposed by Taft during his
gubernatorial campaign last year, was cut out of the bill in the
Ohio House after insurance companies and big business complained it
would increase the cost of health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Taft has said his support for the liability issue never wavered,
but he was fighting an uphill battle because House Speaker Jo Ann
Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg and Senate President Richard Finan,
R-Cincinnati, were against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it became dead some time ago. It was obvious neither
the House or Senate would go along with that,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor added that the ``chances are very good'' he will
sign the bill. ``I think the independent right of appeal is a very
significant improvement in the rights of patients in Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Democrats were critical of Taft and other
Republicans for not fighting harder for a patient's right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is a breech of the promise the governor and other
legislators made to protect people from their HMO's,'' said Betty
Sutton, D-Barberton.
</P>
<P>
   Under the external review process, appeals from patients would
be decided within seven days for life-threatening cases and within
30 days for other disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also require health insurers to make
information available to enrollees through a toll-free hot line;
allow women to go to a gynecologist without referral from a
primary-care physician; and provide $80 million in tax deductions
for certain medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats and a few Republicans tried to reinsert the
liability provision, but couldn't collect enough votes. One
supporter of liability, state Rep. Jeff Jacobson, R-Phillipsburg,
accused the insurance companies of swaying votes on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not dealt with the issue of unequal power of the
insurance companies and the people who are in need of the
treatments,'' Jacobson said. ``I will vote yes, but with some
sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers were concerned about the amount of campaign money
insurance companies made to some House members who opposed the
liability clause and Democrats said it would be easy to see why the
general public might believe politicians sold out to the insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has the appearance that we were bought,'' said
Sen. Robert Hagan, D-Youngstown on Monday. ``We are all
politicians, and they don't trust us because we don't keep our
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said they were against the right to sue because
patients typically gain little by spending years fighting claims in
court against insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials say the external review process is not going
to be all that beneficial for customers. ``The insurance companies
have influenced this legislation from the beginning and use their
power the same way in what's supposed to be a fair external
review,'' said Diane Lardie, director of the Universal Health Care
Action Network in Ohio.

BOY'S ODYSSEY IS FOUND TO BE FICTION-BASED

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a story that sounded too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Daniel Sabillon, a 13-year-old boy from Honduras, travels
3,200 miles to New York City to meet his long-lost father _
walking, hitchhiking, and riding buses, relying on charm, gumption,
and the kindness of strangers. But when he finally arrives, after a
37-day odyssey, his father is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his journey made a splash on the front pages of The
New York Times and the Daily News, obsessed the Spanish-language
press and radio stations, won the sympathy of the mayor, and
sparked an intensive hunt for the father by the New York Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, the boy's story was unmasked as a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he did travel here from Honduras, a remarkable fact
in itself. But the tale that the boy told everyone along the way _
the story that broke hearts and opened wallets _ was an invention,
part of an elaborate scheme to become a New Yorker, a secure
American citizen, the easy way.
</P>
<P>
   He told people that his mother and brother had died in the
mudslides of Hurricane Mitch. His father, Grevi Sabillon, wired him
$200 and instructions to come to New York, saying he would meet him
by the bridge at the entrance to LaGuardia Airport. He would be
waiting there all day on June 25, 26, and 27.
</P>
<P>
   So, on May 22, Edwin's story went on, he left Honduras, walking
and hitchhiking up through Guatemala and along the Gulf Coast of
Mexico. He befriended smugglers who got him across the Rio Grande
into Texas, then took a bus through New Orleans to Miami. There, he
told his tale to the patrons of a Cuban-American-owned cafeteria,
who were so touched by his plight that they raised enough cash on
the spot to put him on a bus to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, having arrived, he hiked up to the Bronx and
stopped a taxicab driver, who took him to the airport. When no
father showed up by the bridge, the driver brought him home,
cleaned him up, and took him to the 43d Precinct, where he charmed
every cop in the stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He was put in a Spanish-speaking foster home, and the police
launched a major investigation. But then the evidence started
tumbling in that Edwin's story did not add up.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of Edwin's named Gilma Sabillon, who lives in
Newburg, N.Y., told El Diario, New York City's leading
Spanish-language newspaper, that Edwin's father had died of AIDS in
Honduras on Oct. 11 _ and that Edwin knew this. The father had
lived in New York for a while, but went home when he got sick.
</P>
<P>
   The relative told El Diario, for a story to be published in
Wednesday's edition, that Edwin had long dreamed of living in New
York, and in fact left Honduras shortly after his father died,
before Hurricane Mitch. He returned after hearing about the
devastating storm, but could not find his mother. So he made his
way back up, this time crossing the Rio Grande into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Gilma Sabillon could not be reached Tuesday night; an operator's
recorded message said the telephone had been temporarily
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist, the Associated Press reported from Honduras
Tuesday night that Edwin's mother is still alive. Edwin's
grandmother, Paula Vazquez Hernandez, told the AP that she wants
him to come home so she can send him to reform school.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery in Edwin's story was why he turned south from New
Orleans toward Miami. News reports treated it as a result of
confusion. However, according to El Diario, Edwin has aunts who
live near Miami, with whom he stayed for a while _ and who helped
him _ before he went to the cafeteria and conned a bus ticket to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here were reeling Tuesday night from the revelations
of Edwin's deception, one of the grander scams in recent years.
Police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode said officers were questioning
Edwin Tuesday night, but declined to comment further until all the
facts were known.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, before the boy's story unraveled, Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani held a news conference, calling on Edwin's
father to come forth and, if he was an illegal resident, not to be
fearful of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since your son is here and he wants you, who cares about legal
status?'' Giuliani said with passion, adding that the city would
help ``work through any legal entanglements that might exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Basora, the cabdriver who picked Edwin up on Sunday and
brought him home, had told reporters earlier in the day that he
would like to adopt Edwin if his father could not be found.
</P>
<P>
   The police put a on full-court press to find the father the past
two days. Every precinct in the city was told to check around for
someone of his name. Bronx detectives checked the books of several
money-transfer firms, looking for a record of the $200 money order
that he supposedly sent Edwin, hoping it would link a name to an
address.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Ramirez, head of Centro Hispano Cuzcatlan, a private
immigrant-aid service in Queens, phoned hundreds of contacts to see
if anyone knew someone named Grevi Sabillon, but, he said Tuesday
morning, ``Nobody's ever heard of this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   El Diario, which is read by over 80,000 Spanish-speakers in New
York City, printed Edwin's photo on its front page and put six
reporters on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Donado, an assignment editor for El Diario, said
early Tuesday that she was surprised nobody had yet come forth with
information about the father. Earlier this month, when an
unidentified man died in a subway car, El Diario put his picture on
the front page and, Donado said, a relative called to name him just
hours after the paper hit the newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200,000 Central American immigrants live in New York
City, not counting illegal immigrants, who would probably double
the number. So, until late Tuesday afternoon, nobody had any reason
to think it strange that Edwin Sabillon's father still could not be
found.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Reynolds and Reynolds formed an e-business group
that will focus on Internet-based business and may eventually
employ as many as 1,000 people, Reynolds officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, 200 to 300 people, including some new hires, will be
assigned to the new group, said Lloyd ``Buzz'' Waterhouse,
Reynolds' new president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be cooking in three months _ that's a Web
year,'' said Waterhouse, a 26-year IBM Corp. veteran who recently
headed Big Blue's $2.7 billion e-business services unit.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds aims to expand its existing Internet-based projects,
including CarPoint, a car-buying site run in conjunction with
Microsoft Corp., and Customer Advantage, a way for Reynolds clients
to order forms and check accounts via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   New Internet-based ventures will be announced soon, Waterhouse
said. These ventures will be based in Reynolds' current areas of
expertise: document management and documents for the automotive and
general business markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed wins in e-business. We're establishing an
Internet-focused organization that will move quickly and
aggressively to leverage the Internet to provide value to our
customers,'' said Waterhouse, who joined Reynolds May 1 and is
expected to succeed Chairman and Chief Executive David Holmes
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The e-business group will be headed by Greg Collins, formerly
vice president for corporate strategy and development. The group
will tackle automotive retailing and document management projects
first. Reynolds' Chief Information Officer Frank Caccamo will
establish an e-business center to support the internal and external
Internet based business.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse said the cost of the new group is unknown and he
declined to predict how much more the effort will bring in sales.
However, he noted that Reynolds' existing Internet-based
initiatives are growing more than 100 percent annually, which is
not atypical in e-business.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds reported revenues of about $1.5 billion for the 12
months ended March 31, 1999. Reynolds stock price (NYSE:REY) closed
Tuesday at 23 1/4, up 1/8.

downgraded the county's bonds by two notches, to the lowest
investment-grade category, and delivered a scathing critique of the
county's fiscal management.
</P>
<P>
   The new rating of BBB, two notches above that given to junk
bonds, could make it much more expensive for Nassau to raise money
through bond sales, and gives it one of the worst credit ratings
among wealthy suburban counties nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Only Orange County, Calif., which declared bankruptcy in 1994
after making disastrous investments in risky securities, has a
lower rating among such counties, officials at the rating agency
said. In New York, only Erie County has a rating as low as BBB, but
Erie's battered industrial economy stands in sharp contrast with
Nassau's high per capita wealth and low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In lowering the rating on Nassau's $2.6 billion in bonds to BBB
from A-minus, S&AMP;P officials also dismissed the county's protracted
effort to eliminate its budget deficit, which now stands at more
than $200 million, as too little, too late, and too full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is a blow to Nassau's Republican machine, which
has maintained its grip on power in recent years largely by
avoiding property tax increases even as it doled out increasingly
generous wage increases to the county's civil servants, police and
patronage workers. The political cost of that fiscal imbalance
could be paid as early as this fall, when all 19 county legislative
seats, of which Republicans hold 14, are up for election.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, and imprudently, said S&AMP;P, county officials have
relied on one-time-only revenue measures like the sale of assets,
including the county medical center, which is now being spun off to
a quasi-public corporation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many problems caused by those one-shot sales,
Standard &AMP; Poor's said, is that many of them take years longer to
complete than expected by county officials. The revenues from the
hospital sale, for example, were first placed in the budget two
fiscal years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the agency said, the county has had to increase its
short-term borrowing substantially to cover current expenses like
salaries and wages.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the county expects to incur $430 million in that
costly short-term debt, or about 20 percent of its $2.2 billion
budget, said S&AMP;P analyst Diane Brosen. Since 1994, she said,
Nassau's short-term debt has jumped 70 percent, even though the
total amount of the budget is largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most damaging news in Standard &AMP; Poor's review of
Nassau's predicament was its opinion that a deficit-closing plan
the county is promoting in Albany will not be enough to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to avoid raising property taxes, County Executive
Thomas Gulotta, has sought legislative approval for a new 1 percent
tax on real estate sales, which would produce an estimated $50
million to $70 million a year in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the county were to realize the major components of its
fiscal recovery plan,'' said S&AMP;P, ``it is unlikely that the plan
would fully correct the current year's fiscal imbalance.''

GOP, RAISING THE STAKES, SAYS SURPLUS SHOULD GO TO TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Confronted with federal budget surpluses of a size
that would have defied imagination not long ago, Republicans raised
the stakes Tuesday in their standoff with President Clinton, saying
they would increase their proposed tax cut to $1 trillion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said any windfall not generated by the Social
Security system should go straight to tax cuts and not to
additional spending, a stance that amounted to a rejection of
President Clinton's call on Monday for the money to be divided
among a variety of needs.
</P>
<P>
   By the calculations released by the White House on Monday, the
budget surplus, excluding excess Social Security payroll taxes,
will amount to slightly more than $1 trillion over the next decade,
$333 billion higher than projected just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is scheduled to release its own
updated surplus estimates on Thursday. Republicans said that if, as
expected, they show a windfall as big as or bigger than the
administration's figures show, all of the new money should go to
augment the $778 billion tax-cutting proposal they will seek to
pass next month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said that meant a tax-cut bill that could well be $1
trillion or bigger, allowing his party to include many of its
long-cherished goals. They include cutting taxes for married
couples, reducing the capital gains tax, eliminating the tax on
estates, providing breaks to the self-employed and creating new
incentives for savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's approach was backed by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should say, `Oh, goodie! We have more money'
'' Lott told reporters on Capitol Hill. Rather, he said, the extra
money ``makes it a lot easier and more justifiable'' for Congress
to pass a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made clear that Clinton will veto any
sweeping Republican tax bill, and will consider some form of tax
cut only after Congress and the administration agree on plans to
shore up Social Security and Medicare, both of which will face
insolvency in coming decades as the baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton had signaled on Monday that he is open to a
compromise on tax cuts. Democrats in Congress said Tuesday that by
replying to Clinton with a demand for an even bigger tax cut,
Republicans were going to force both parties onto a confrontational
footing that would make a deal more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At this point neither the White House nor the Republican
leadership has a strategy that would lead them to negotiations over
the tangle of high-profile issues linked to the budget outlook,
from the long-term health of the retirement-security systems to the
more immediate difficulty in passing spending bills for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early to predict the next steps,'' said Jacob J.
Lew, the White House budget director. ``We've taken a very big
step. We put some ambitious ideas forward. Now we have to see what
the reaction is.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress said the most likely scenario is for both
the House and the Senate to take up the Republican tax cut bill
next month, pass it and send it to Clinton, who would promptly veto
it.
</P>
<P>
   The action would then be concentrated on an endgame negotiation
in September or October in which both parties would have to make a
choice whether to compromise or fight it out in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tough talk, some senior Republicans, including Sen.
William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, have been publicly conciliatory toward the White House
and upbeat about the prospects for cooperation. And Lew suggested
that while the White House is not ready to start dealing yet, it
sees the surplus as large enough to accommodate the needs of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is to have a balanced package, we've shown in the
framework we put out that it's possible to have a balanced
package,'' he said. ``We can take care of Social Security and
Medicare solvency, and fund a tax cut in a balanced package.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton so far is sticking to his demand that the main tax cut
be his plan for tax breaks intended to help low- and
moderate-income families save more money for retirement. The plan
would result in a tax cut of $250 billion over 10 years, or roughly
a quarter of what Republicans now want for their much more broadly
based tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said the debate now was over the size and content of a tax
cut, not over whether there should be one.

3 SLEEPERS COULD BE EYE-OPENERS

<P>
   Andy Panko slipped into Chicago early this month for the
National Basketball Association's predraft camp with little notice.
In Chicago, they were dreaming about the top pick in the draft, so
fans did not camp out outside the Moody Bible Institute for a peek
at a 6-foot-9-inch shooting guard who would not be the first pick.
The Bulls have the top pick in Wednesday's draft. But Panko is good
enough to have drawn scouts to Division III Lebanon Valley College,
an 1,100-student campus in Annville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of scouts came in this year and that was exciting for
the town,'' Panko said. ``It's just one stop light there and
everybody knows everybody. When a scout comes to town, everybody
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Panko was only one of many aspiring pros who were part of three
predraft showcases for NBA prospects. In Chicago, the last of the
three camps, 62 players went through four days of bruising
sessions, each trying to catch an eye, to change a mind and fulfill
a dream of claiming a spot in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the top players, the sure lottery picks, did not play in
those games or subject themselves to the drills, opting simply to
take a physical for the team doctors. Some well-known talents,
those on the verge of the lottery like Kenny Thomas of New Mexico
or Lee Nailon of Texas Christian University, were in Chicago,
hoping to solidify their status. But others, like Panko or Duke's
Taymon Domzalski, were in Chicago on a mission: to attract
attention. And still some others, like Leon Smith, a Chicago high
school senior whose skills are unfamiliar to the NBA scouts, stayed
away. They are a few of the draft's long shots; here are their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ANDY PANKO, 6-9, GUARD
</P>
<P>
   Panko grew nine inches between his senior year in high school
and his senior year at Lebanon Valley. In becoming the Division III
player of the year for the second straight season, he averaged 26
points a game and made 55.2 percent of his shots. Now, with the
height of a forward and the skills of a guard, as well as a
shooting touch that has been compared with Duke's Trajan Langdon,
Panko is expected to be the first player from his college to be
drafted by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Panko tries not to think about the pressure, and that he is
being mentioned in the same breath as players he was watching on
television recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get nervous,'' Panko said in Chicago. ``I just look at
this as an opportunity. If I do well, everything will fall into
place. I see Langdon on TV. I see him at Duke, but I don't look at
it like that now. You've just got to concentrate on putting the
ball in the hole. I look at him and think, `I'm 6-8, 6-9, and I can
do the same things as him. I think I'm more versatile.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally Szczerbiak is the best shooter in college basketball,
but Panko can shoot it and he can pass the ball,'' Marty Blake, the
NBA's director of scouting services, said.
</P>
<P>
   Panko knows the odds, noting, ``There are only a few Division
III players that make it to the NBA, maybe one every 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no Division III player has been drafted since 1991 when
the Golden State Warriors chose Lamont Strothers, but a few _ Terry
Porter and Greg Grant _have found a place in the league. And Devean
George, a 6-8 forward from Augsburg College in Minnesota, hopes to
join Panko as a draft pick from Division III on Wednesday. George
averaged 27.5 points and 11.3 rebounds this season.
</P>
<P>
   Panko remains the most tantalizing, to the folks in Annville
anyway. ``Because of his size, he came out of the blue even here,''
said Lou Sorrentino, the Lebanon Valley athletic director. ``Nobody
anticipated anything great, but he broke every record we had here.
By this season, the word was out.''
</P>
<P>
   TAYMON DOMZALSKI, 6-10, FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   A power forward, Domzalski started 18 games as a freshman for
Duke, finishing out the 1995-96 season with a 14-point,
seven-rebound performance against Maryland in the Atlantic Coast
Conference Tournament. But after that his finest moments came on
the practice floor, banging against Elton Brand, Shane Battier and
Chris Burgess, the blue chips of the Blue Devils' recruiting class.
Domzalski, a former McDonald's all-American, found himself coming
off the bench only 10 minutes a game. With Duke sending Brand,
Battier, William Avery, Corey Maggette and Langdon, Domzalski is
again coming off the Blue Devil bench in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a shot now,'' Domzalski said at the camp in
Chicago. ``I could have gone to a number of schools and started,
but that wasn't my sole motivation. Day in, day out, playing
against Elton, Shane and Chris, guys that are lottery picks, I feel
my game has gotten better. I believe my work on the court will
shine through. That's the great thing about the process here. It
gives you an opportunity to show your stuff no matter where you
come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in the NBA, at Duke you have to accept a role. I wasn't a
superstar, but in the NBA there are few of those. Most have to
accept a role. That's not a bad word. A role player makes stars
better. I accepted that in college. I felt like when I played, I
played well. I graduated cum laude.''
</P>
<P>
   Domzalski added: ``I can rebound and play defense. That's there
every day. I'm not coming in to be a superstar. My whole thing is
to make everybody around me better.''
</P>
<P>
   He has impressed Blake. ``He's very active and can do a lot of
things. He's different than someone like Elton Brand. He's more
versatile. I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   LEON SMITH, 6-11, CENTER
</P>
<P>
   A hardship case, Smith is also a question mark because he opted
to avoid the NBA's predraft camps. While finishing up at King High
School, he lived at a South Side group home and was a ward of the
state until he turned 18 on Nov. 2. Then, after averaging 25.5
points and 14.5 rebounds in his senior season, he backed out of a
verbal commitment to attend Fresno State on a basketball
scholarship to enter the draft, hoping to change a hard life as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jonathan Bender, another high schooler in the draft,
Smith is not ranked among the lottery picks. An athletic big man
with almost untapped physical talent, some scouts predict the
second round for him, but others believe that some team will take a
chance on his raw potential and he could go in the first round.
Still others think he is still a boy in a man's body and is not
ready for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has maintained that he will play professionally, whether
it is in the NBA or overseas.

U.S. WILL AVOID UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the United States is headed for the quarterfinals of
the 1999 Women's World Cup, what are Germany's chances of upsetting
the Americans in Thursday's elimination match in Washington, D.C.?
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good, if history means anything.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're confident of a U.S. victory and you like to look
ahead, you have to like Team USA's chances of reaching the July 10
final at the Rose Bowl. If Mia Hamm and her teammates can survive
the kind of vicious tackles that Nigeria and North Korea doled out
in Group A qualifying, they might survive anything.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how one observer sees the tournament playing out for the
Americans:
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Germany. The reigning European champions
reached the final of the 1995 Women's World Cup before losing to
Norway, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   And although they haven't played a solid game yet (except
against Mexico), the Germans have beaten the U.S. as recently as
1997. The 3-1 victory in a driving rain at Duisburg snapped the
Americans' 30-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. avenged that defeat days later during a German tour,
handing Germany a 3-0 loss in Salzgitter, with Hamm scoring two
goals.
</P>
<P>
   But back on home soil last summer, the U.S. had another hard
time with the Germans, rallying from a goal down to find the
equalizer in the 76th minute to draw, 1-1, in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Worried? Relax.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be an upset here, not with German midfield captain
Martina Voss out of the tournament with a torn muscle, and not with
the U.S. firing on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Going out on a limb, let's call it U.S. 2, Germany 0.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the quarterfinals, the picks are Brazil over
Nigeria, Norway over Sweden and China over Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterfinal victories by the U.S. and Brazil would set up one
of the most exciting games of the tournament Sunday at Stanford
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sissi, truly the MVP of the tournament so far with six goals for
Brazil, would provide the U.S. with its toughest test thus far.
</P>
<P>
   And to add to the intrigue, one might remember another Fourth of
July game at Stanford Stadium five years ago against another
Brazilian team.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the Brazilian men defeated the U.S., 1-0, in the
second round of the 1994 World Cup -- eventually winning the title
two weeks later in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way our women's team is going to go down on our
nation's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous energy will allow Brazil to score the game's first goal,
but the U.S. is going to prevail, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal, Norway will win an injury-plagued match
with China, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up the game most fans want to see in Pasadena: Norway,
the defending Women's World Cup champion, against the U.S., the
1996 Olympic gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in February about a possible U.S.-Norway match, Norwegian
captain Lina Medalen spoke of the U.S-Norway rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like them,'' she said. ``It has nothing to do with
their personalities or how they are, but we both want the same
thing. And any team that gets in our way, we just say, `Okay, lets
kick their (butts).'''
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen. Not on this day. The crowd and emotion will
favor the U.S., just as it did at the Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The final: U.S. 3, Norway 1.
</P>
<P>
   -- After last week's 2-1 victory over D.C. United, Galaxy coach
Sigi Schmid was reminded that United played without its best
players -- Marco Etcheverry, Jaime Moreno and Eddie Pope -- for
various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't bother Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, when they have those three guys, they're an easier
team to play because everybody has a more defined role,'' said
Schmid, whose team notched its fourth consecutive victory over
Tampa Bay on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they were playing, everyone was young and excited and
moving all over the place, and sometimes it's harder to play a team
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Etcheverry's there, you know he's going to be the
attacking midfielder. It makes them a little less predictable when
their big three are not there.''

KAREKIN I, ARMENIAN PATRIARCH, DIES AT 66
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catholicos Karekin I, the spiritual leader of Armenian Orthodox
Christians worldwide, who faced the enormous task of reinvigorating
his ancient church after the fall of Soviet Communism, died Tuesday
at his pontifical residence in Echmiadzin, near the Armenian
capital, Yerevan. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was throat cancer, for which he received
treatment in the last year in New York, said a spokesman for the
Diocese of the Armenian Church of America.
</P>
<P>
   An Oxford-trained theologian fluent in English, French and other
languages, he held the title Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of
All Armenians, with a flock of more than six million.
</P>
<P>
   Head of one of the world's oldest churches, he was a leading
exponent of ecumenism among Christians and was well known among
church leaders in Europe, the Middle East and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In March, returning to Armenia from New York, he stopped at the
Vatican, where he and Pope John Paul II made plans for the pope to
visit Armenia in July. As Karekin's health deteriorated during the
spring, the pope tried to schedule a private visit this month but
called it off because of his own health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Karekin became head of the Armenian Apostolic Church in April
1995; he was the first such leader elected in centuries within an
independent Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   The nation, with a population of about 3.5 million, had emerged
only four years earlier after seven decades of rule by the Soviet
Union. Even before the Soviet domination of the present republic,
Armenia was often divided up and ruled by countries including
Russia, Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Karekin was the 131st in a line of church leaders stretching
back to St. Gregory the Illuminator, who converted King Tiridates
III of Armenia in 301. Christianity became Armenia's official
religion a decade before the conversion of the Roman Emperor
Constantine.
</P>
<P>
   Along with churches in Egypt, Syria, Ethiopia and India, the
Armenian Church belongs to the branch of Orthodox Christianity that
did not accept the definition of Christ's nature as human and
divine promulgated by the Council of Chalcedon in 451.
</P>
<P>
   He visited the United States in May 1998 of last year to help
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Diocese.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview then, he said he faced three major challenges in
revitalizing the Armenian church: overcoming the negative
influences of Soviet-sponsored atheism, persuading Armenians that
Christianity is a way of life and not simply an ideology, and
persuading them that faith offers spiritual and moral sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general-secretary of the National
Council of Churches, who met several times with the catholicos,
recalled him as unaffected and considerate. During a visit to
Echmiadzin, she went to early morning prayers and saw him beckon
her to stand beside him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you don't know the language _ I'll translate for you,''
Ms. Campbell recalled him saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just amazed me,'' she said. ``He never saw himself as too
lofty to be a teacher when you needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   Karekin was born Neshan Sarkissian in Kessab, Syria, on Aug. 27,
1932. After graduating from a seminary in 1952, he was ordained a
celibate priest and took the name Karekin in honor of an earlier
church leader.
</P>
<P>
   He studied at Oxford from 1957 to 1959, served as a seminary
dean and then became an aide to Catholicos Khoren I, head of the
Catholicate of Cilicia, a self-governing see within the Armenian
church. He was also sent as an observer to the Second Vatican
Council.
</P>
<P>
   He became a bishop in 1964 and an archbishop in 1973 and later
was elected Catholicos Coadjutor of Cilicia, to succeed Khoren I.
After Catholicos Khoren died in 1983, Karekin made visits to the
Vatican, the Church of England, European Protestant churches and
the Coptic Church of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the separate Cilician see, he was seen as a long shot
to succeed the Armenian Apostolic Church's long-reigning head,
Vasken I, who died in 1994. But after favorable statements were
made by Armenia's president, opinion began to shift toward him and
he was elected in a gathering of 400 church delegates.

<P>
   An Ex-Wrestler Goes To the Mat for Reform
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura wants to reform the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   The in-your-face Minnesota governor, a former professional
wrestler whose surprise victory last November made him the most
successful candidate in the party's brief political history, has
been saying for weeks that Ross Perot, the party's founder and
all-powerful eminence, should step aside and give others a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's going after Russell Verney, the party chairman and
Perot's closest political ally since the heady days of 1992, when
the billionaire Texan first ran for president and won nearly a
fifth of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura insists that he does not want to run the party himself
and has no plans to try to parlay his successful campaign for
governor into a campaign for the presidency. His only interest, he
says, is to strengthen a party whose hierarchy has become too
dictatorial in its ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Monday to delegates who will attend the Reform
Party's annual national convention in Dearborn, Mich., in late
July, Ventura endorsed Jack Gargan, a party stalwart from Cedar
Key, Fla., to replace Verney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like me,'' the governor wrote, ``Mr. Gargan believes party
rules should vest power at the grass-roots level, empower all
members equally, hold party leaders accountable to the members and
create a fair and open playing field for any candidate who may seek
the party's nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney says he has not decided yet whether to seek re-election.
``But I welcome as many candidates to go after the job as possible
because competition is healthy,'' he said Tuesday. ``On the other
hand, Jesse's letter sounded a little dictatorial itself, too much
like an ultimatum. I prefer to think he's been badly served by his
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan says that if he is voted party chairman he will not only
work to reunify the party but will also move its headquarters from
Perot's hometown, Dallas, to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the party's presidential nomination for Election 2000
is being eyed carefully by a number of White House hopefuls,
especially some hard-right conservative Republicans who say their
own party is abandoning them. The Reform Party is not a very good
fit for a hard-right Republican, being more reformist and populist
than conservative. But the $12.5 million that its nominee will get
in Federal election money, based on the party's past election
performance, will surely be a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton as Senator? The Plot Thickens
</P>
<P>
   People in Arkansas, as in the rest of the country, seem more
amused than anything else by the rumor that President Clinton might
run for the U.S. Senate from his home state in 2002, the year after
he leaves the White House. Most of them were still trying to digest
the possibility that his wife, Hillary, might run for the Senate in
New York next year when the rumor first hit.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has officially described the rumor as ``crazy.''
But it has not gone unnoticed in Arkansas, as in the rest of the
country, that Clinton, when asked if he would run, essentially
changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas senator up for re-election in 2002 is Tim
Hutchinson, a ``family values,'' Christian-right Republican who,
before entering politics, was a Baptist minister and a college
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal political circumstances, Hutchinson would be
reasonably well-positioned to win re-election, given that in
Arkansas in recent years Republicans have had a lot of Democrats on
the run. But of course, Bill Clinton is no ordinary political
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the rumor hit, the senator gave no sign of being
cowed by the prospect of a Clinton challenge.``I would relish the
race,'' he told The Northwest Arkansas News on Monday. ``It would
be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Or would it?
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had he proclaimed what a joy a Clinton-Hutchinson
dust-up would be than he had to deal with an article in a new
magazine, Arkansas Review, that may have all but wiped out what he
was counting on for a winning edge: l'affaire Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The article said that despite all of Hutchinson's emphasis on
family values, his marriage was coming apart. And the article
asserted that he was involved in a ``growing relationship'' with a
woman who had been one of his Senate aides.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hutchinson announced that he was filing for a divorce
from his wife, Donna, after 29 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been tremendous strains on our marriage during the
past few years,'' he said. ``We sought extensive counseling prior
to taking this action.''
</P>
<P>
   A Victim of Gaffes Is Now Keeping Score
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, out on campaign trail again,
no longer mangles ideas and lines as he did in the past, at least
by all accounts. Certainly there is nothing yet to top the spelling
of potato as ``potatoe'' or proffering that a mind is a terrible
thing to ``lose,'' as opposed to ``waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, says the Republican presidential aspirant, like Rodney
Dangerfield, he don't get no respect.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech in Washington on Monday _ no verbal slips of note
_ he told reporters it seemed that no matter how well he performs
on the stump these days, his reputation for gaffes continues to
adversely affect his poll numbers and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he argued, his rivals _ especially the
front-running Texas Gov. George W. Bush _ are getting an easy ride
on gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Bush had mistakenly referred to Timorese as
``Timoreans'' and to Kosovars as ``Kosovarians,'' and then had
confused Slovakia and Slovenia, and contended that other Republican
candidates and the press had taken only the briefest notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use you wldest imagination and multiple it by a factor of
three,'' Quayle lamented, ``and then you'd come close to what would
be happening to me if I had made similar gaffes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulling Out the Stops In the Rush to Be First
</P>
<P>
   For years, New Hampshire had a law that required its
presidential primary to take place in the early spring of each
presidential election year, no fewer than seven days before any
other state's primary. That meant, usually, that sometime in late
February or early March, a week after Iowa's first-in-the-nation
caucuses, New Hampshire would hold the nation's first primary.
</P>
<P>
   The two events became a fixed part of the U.S. political scene,
and both states soon acquired outsized political importance, given
their size and political make-up.
</P>
<P>
   Then other states began to horn in to get some of the clout and
glory. Dozens advanced the dates of their caucuses and primaries,
and many others still plan to join the forward rush.
</P>
<P>
   In Election 2000, the caucus and primary calendar will be so
front-loaded that the nominating process could be over in just a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa says it is determined to remain first in caucusing, and
will set whatever date it must to do so. And Tuesday, New Hampshire
followed suit. Gov. Jeanne Shaheen signed a law that permits the
New Hampshire secretary of state to move the date of the state's
primary into 1999, if necessary, to keep New Hampshire out in
front.

U.S., STRONG ON PAPER, IS A MATCH FOR EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw was in a hotel meeting room Tuesday, watching a
video that recalled some of the great moments in Ryder Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   When the video concluded, Crenshaw stood up to speak. But for a
few moments, his voice quavered with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That video moves me quite a bit,'' said Crenshaw, who will be
captain of the U.S. team that will face Europe for the Ryder Cup at
the Country Club in Brookline, Mass., Sept. 24-26. ``Being Ryder
Cup captain is quite an honor, and it's my job to get the best out
of these guys. Quite frankly, I think we're due.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Crenshaw and the U.S. team will feel the pressure
during Ryder Cup week, as Europe will try to capture the event _
held every two years _ for the third consecutive time, something
that Europe has never done.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the American team will look extremely strong on
paper, with David Duval, Tiger Woods, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III
and Mark O'Meara having already secured positions. But the
Europeans have flourished in the role of underdog, and this year
the European team will be anchored by three of the world's best
players _ the Masters champion, Jose Maria Olazabal; Colin
Montgomerie and Lee Westwood. In the past two Ryder Cups, the
longer-hitting U.S. team has been outplayed around the greens, as
Europe has chipped and putted its way to crucial points. Crenshaw
would like to halt that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraging all our guys to work on their short games,''
said Crenshaw, who played in four Ryder Cups, two won by the United
States. ``In match play, what really helps you is to hole out a
shot at an opportune moment. Our side has not done enough of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Crenshaw will have a difficult choice to make when he
announces his two picks for captain in August.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, No. 8 in the points standing, has said he will
not play much this summer because he wants to be at home with his
wife, Amy, who delivered a baby girl last week. But if Mickelson
falls out of the top 10, don't be surprised if he is one of
Crenshaw's captain's picks.
</P>
<P>
   Tough Year for Steve Jones
</P>
<P>
   This has been a difficult year for Steve Jones, the 1996 U.S.
Open champion, who did not play between this year's Masters and the
Open because of a sore right shoulder. Jones also suffered from an
irregular heartbeat in February for the third time in his career,
but that problem was corrected, and Jones hopes to salvage his
season with a strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been rehabilitating my shoulder for nine weeks, and even
though it's not 100 percent, it's getting closer, and I'm not going
to have surgery,'' said Jones, who will defend his title at the
John Deere Classic next month.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster Takes Money Lead
</P>
<P>
   In the process of winning the Ladies Professional Golf
Association McDonald's Championship, Juli Inkster took the lead
from Karrie Webb on the LPGA Tour money list. Inkster has won
$952,994 this year, while Webb has won $941,198. Despite her many
accomplishments, including winning the modern career Grand Slam,
Inkster has never won the LPGA money title. She came closest in
1986, when she finished third on the money list, winning $99,651.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald Wins Ike by a Shot
</P>
<P>
   Ken MacDonald no longer has to be content with winning last
year's New Jersey State Open. MacDonald, 21, captured the Ike, the
stroke-play championship of the Metropolitan Golf Association,
Tuesday at Hollywood Country Club in Deal, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald won by a shot over Jeff Thomas by rallying from a
five-shot deficit going into the afternoon's second round of the
day in the 54-hole event. After a two-over-par 74 in the morning,
MacDonald shot two-under 70 in the afternoon on the 6,772-yard
course. He finished at 216, the only player to play the course at
even par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly didn't think I was in contention when I
three-putted the eighth hole,'' said MacDonald, a member at Upper
Montclair, who will be a senior at the University of Richmond this
fall. ``It's been a year since the New Jersey Open. Now, I can talk
about something else.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald rallied for his victory with birdies at the 459-yard
16th and the 230-yard 17th, where he hit a 4-iron to within three
feet to take the lead.

MACHINISTS GOAL IN BOEING TALKS: PRESERVE EXISTING JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and its biggest union opened critical
contract talks Tuesday, with both sides expressing optimism they
can avoid a repeat of 1995, when a 69-day strike crippled airplane
production.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two months, negotiators will debate a host of
proposals, including ways to control rising costs of benefits and
to preserve union jobs at Boeing, the largest airplane manufacturer
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators say they've already made progress during informal
talks held in the months leading up to Tuesday's, where the union
handed its proposed contract to the company. Those talks have
helped foster a more cooperative mood than past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned to live together differently,'' said Jerry
Calhoun, vice president of employee and union relations at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither camp offered any guarantees that union Machinists
won't strike in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are prepared to strike if the need exists,'' said
Dick Schneider, chief negotiator for the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations begin as Boeing continues trying to transform
itself into a more competitive company, an effort that includes
trimming tens of thousands of jobs from the payroll. Union leaders
say they appreciate that Boeing needs to change to cope with a
growing threat from Airbus Industrie, a consortium of
government-supported European aerospace companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the union don't live in a vacuum'' Schneider said. ``It
does us no good to negotiate ... if our members simply do not have
a job to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   The security of jobs at Boeing plants is at the heart of the
labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks get under way, Schneider said the union's top
priority is to preserve existing jobs, and if possible, regain jobs
that Boeing sent to outside firms.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, on the other hand, needs to retain some of its authority
to make business decisions, according to financial analysts
tracking the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very optimistic on this round of negotiations that we can
avoid that situation,'' IAM's Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that won't dominate the bargaining sessions is work
Boeing sends to some nations to help sell planes abroad. While the
union is unhappy about the situation, the U.S. government, not the
union, must tackle much of the problem as a trade matter, according
to Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Congress needs to address the issue through legislation,
Schneider said. ``We feel as (a) union that Airbus is trying to
steal the airline business.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the union will seek to discuss ways to lessen the
impact those decisions have on employees, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two sides plan to meet from July 6 until the start of
intensive talks on Aug. 16. The goal is to have Machinists vote to
either accept or reject a contract proposal by Sept. 1. The current
44-month contract expires at 12:01 a.m., Sept. 2.

BUSH MOVES TOWARD THE CENTER ON IMMIGRATION AND QUOTAS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: FIXES dateline to San Diego; SUBS first graf of optional trim
to clarify, reference should be to Republican presidential nominee,
sted just Republican.) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ George W. Bush plunged into the most populous state
Tuesday for the first time as a presidential candidate and
immediately cast himself as more temperate than most Republican
leaders here and in Washington on two emotionally charged ballot
measures that have roiled his party: immigration and affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   Bush distanced himself from a proposition that passed in this
state in 1994 that prohibits public services to illegal immigrants.
And he refused to endorse a proposition approved by this state's
voters in 1996 that outlawed affirmative action in the state for
hiring, employment, the education system and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by the Texas governor marked a striking departure
for a Republican presidential candidate because both measures were
championed by the last Republican who was elected governor of
California, Pete Wilson. Bush's stand is also at odds with the
dominant position of the congressional wing of the Republican
Party. And it differs from the position of most of Bush's rivals
for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   His comments in response to questions from reporters were the
most vivid demonstration thus far of how Bush is so confident of
his support that he has embarked on a general election strategy to
attract as broad a swath of voters as possible. With his more
moderate positions on affirmative action and immigration, Bush is
seeking to appeal to minorities and independent voters in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments are all the more notable because he is setting
the tone for the Republican competition. He is swamping his
opponents in the polls here and nationwide and on this trip he has
been showered with donations and greeted by packed gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have had a 187 in my state,'' Bush said of
Proposition 187, the initiative on immigration that curtailed the
rights of illegal immigrants to public services like schools.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a stop here whether he would have supported the
measure, Bush sidestepped the question but made his qualms clear:
``I said when it first came out I was against the spirit of 187 for
my state. I felt like every child ought to be educated regardless
of the status of his parents. I don't know what's happened in
California, but I do know that quotas won't work when it comes to
certain social obligations such as encouraging capitalism to be
spread all around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also sounded a moderate tone in refusing to stand behind
the measure on affirmative action, Proposition 209. ``I support the
spirit of no quotas, no preferences,'' he said, ``but what's
important to say is not what you're against _ what you're for. I'm
for increasing the pool of applicants and opening the door so that
more people are eligible to go to the university systems.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first of three days of appearances up and down this state
_ the king of electoral votes with 54 _ Bush acted like he was
already running a general election: He made no mention of his
Republican rivals. He played up his success in Texas at appealing
to Hispanic voters. And he cast himself as an inclusive candidate
who would not be tugged to the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that one of Bush's stops Tuesday was at the
Plaza de Mexico, a Hispanic area at the Del Mar Fair near here. He
worked his way through hundreds of people, many of who greeted him
with ``Viva Bush'' chants. Pointedly, Bush delivered some of his
remarks in Spanish, in which he is fluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to win California in a general election,'' Bush
repeated again and again to the Republican faithful. ``I intend to
become the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name one Republican who was a threat to Bush in
California, state Sen. Jim Brulte, a Bush supporter, was stumped.
``Expectations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's play-to-November strategy may not be risky in the primary
here because it may draw moderate Republicans, many of whom
defected and helped elect a Democrat, Gray Davis, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides putting forth more moderate positions, Bush made a play
for the Hollywood elite, who are traditionally more supportive of
Democrats and have been courted assiduously by Vice President Al
Gore. Terry Semel, the chairman of Warner Brothers and a prominent
supporter of Democrats, Tuesday held a reception for Bush at his
home in exclusive Bel Air.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to entertainment executives who believe that President
Clinton and Gore unfairly fault Hollywood for violence, Bush said:
``All of us need to work together to change the culture. One
industry alone does not bear all the brunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will again delve into Gore's territory on Thursday, when
his campaign holds fund-raising events in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bush vowed, this is only the beginning. Pledging to
concentrate his energies in this battleground state, Bush has told
supporters that he has the luxury to focus here because he is well
positioned in two other states with huge electoral prizes: In Texas
he is the favorite son and in Florida his brother, Jeb, is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At event after event in California, Bush was welcomed by
ebullient crowds _ as well as by expectations among many
Republicans that he can rescue their party in this state from
turmoil. The last time a Republican presidential nominee won
California in a general election was 1988, when Bush's father was
elected president. And with the election last year of Davis,
Republicans lost control of the governorship for the first time
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   George Gorton, who was a longtime top aide to Wilson but is
neutral in the presidential race, marveled at the outpouring for
Bush at a breakfast here Tuesday morning. ``This is the closest
thing to a legitimate draft I've ever seen in my life,'' Gorton
said. ``There are people here who are both from the right and from
the left of the party _ people you don't see in the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In random interviews at Bush's events Tuesday, many Republican
said they were not troubled by the governor's distancing himself
from the immigration and affirmative action measures that were
supported by most Republicans in California.
</P>
<P>
   John Hensley, a lawyer from Irvine, said he disagreed with Bush
on the two ballot initiatives but still expected to support him.
``It's nice to see a guy with a family and a proven track record,''
he said. ``That forgives a lot of sins. He's a good guy too, which
has a lot to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials in the state said they believed Bush
was most vulnerable for his stand against abortion and his refusal
to press for stronger gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is out of step with most Americans on gun safety, and he
is out of step with California,'' Roy Romer, the general chairman
of the Democratic Party, said in Washington on Tuesday.

 &HT;    `I am pro-union,' Gore tells textile workers
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ Singing ``look for the union label,'' Vice
President Al Gore promised labor leaders Tuesday that he will ``not
let Republicans weaken the unions.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Gore, who sang to a cheering crowd, said
he would veto any legislation that he considered to be anti-worker
and he vowed to push to increase the minimum wage by $1 over the
next two years to $6.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gains you've made in the 20th century are just the
beginning of the gains you are going to make in the 21st century,''
Gore said during a speech to the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial
and Textile. ``Let me say loud and clear, I am pro-union.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposing a plan similar to 401(k) savings plans, in which both
the employer and the employee contribute, Gore said he wants a
401(j) plan, where the money would be saved and used for job
training.
</P>
<P>
   Deductibles for preventive care under Medicare should be
eliminated, he said, because, ``no senior should have to put off
preventive care because they don't think they can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising to open trade barriers overseas, Gore said the United
States also has an obligation to make sure that goods coming into
this country meet high environmental and safety standards in the
factories where they are produced.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also held two money-raising events, a lunch in Miami Beach
and a dinner in Tampa. According to his campaign, Gore collected
about $350,000. Today marks the end of the first six months of
gathering contributions. Gore is expected to report to the Federal
Elections Commission next month that he has collected a total of
about $18.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   His only rival for the Democratic nomination, former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley is expected to have about $11 million, according
to his campaign. While that is far less than Gore, Bradley has
raised enough money to be a credible adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Among a large field of Republicans, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
has raised more money than all his GOP rivals combined. He is
expected to report at least $23 million, with most of it collected
in the past three months. Bush collected $2 million of that total
during a one-day, four city campaign trip to Florida last week.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to supporters at the luncheon here, Gore said Florida
will be crucial to his effort to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carried this state in 1996 and we can carry Florida
again,'' he said.

NOT YOUR USUAL RUNWAY WALKER  
 JUST SPELL HIS NAME RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm a fashion model now,'' the actress Camryn
Manheim declared. ``I'm fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this an over-the-top scene from a David E. Kelley script?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Ms. Manheim, who won an Emmy last fall and a
Golden Globe in February for her role on Kelley's Sunday-night
drama ``The Practice.'' ``He writes that I fall off the stage and
sue Venezia. The real-life version is, I walk down the glamorous
runway and the man of my dreams is waiting in the audience and I
pick him out. All my other dreams have come true this year, so why
not this?''
</P>
<P>
   So it went Tuesday for Ms. Manheim. Her on-screen character
brawls with partners in her law firm; off-screen her name was
mentioned in May in newspaper accounts of a barroom brawl provoked
by guests at a private party in a Manhattan pub who bothered Monica
Lewinsky as she and Ms. Manheim dined together. Tuesday, Ms.
Manheim was preparing for what was billed as her runway debut: a
fashion show for Lane Bryant's Venezia collection. Lane Bryant is a
plus-size retailer, meaning that it specializes in sizes 14 to 28.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manheim, who, a spokesman said, wears a size 22, sounded
elated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole year has been about realizing my fantasies because
they've all been coming true,'' she said, backstage at the
Hammerstein Ballrooms of the New Yorker Hotel. ``I can't tell you
how many times I've walked up and down my living room in high heels
that don't fit and pretended I'm a fashion model. Now the slipper
fits.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the clothes, which she helped design.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got on television and people wanted to put me in
beautiful clothes, I didn't even know how to wear them,'' she said.
``There's a way you strut down the runway. There's a way you walk
through your life that you have to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dropped Z Is All in the Game
</P>
<P>
   Ben Gazzara, 68, has been in a string of movies lately,
including ``Happiness,'' ``Buffalo 66'' and now Spike Lee's
``Summer of Sam,'' which opens on Friday. In that film he plays
Luigi, the center of a large and powerful Italian family determined
to help capture Son of Sam. Dignified Luigi has one of the best
lines in the film: ``What do you want me to do, arrest myself?''
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat different question was on Gazzara's mind at the
premiere party at Roseland on Monday: Was it too much to ask that
his name be spelled right in the closing credits? There it was:
Gazarra, with one z and two r's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they did that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll get into it tomorrow with my agent and my
lawyer,'' he added. ``I'll sue.'' But he was clearly joking.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to sound philosophical. ``What can I do? It could
become a legend, like a parlor game in the year 2500.''
</P>
<P>
   He jumped up to accept congratulations from Ed Bradley, a
correspondent on the CBS News magazine ``60 Minutes,'' for his
performance, credit or no.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the crowd, people doing the Hustle dominated the
dance floor while Wesley Snipes stood at the bar, waiting for his
drink.
</P>
<P>
   The male bartenders, incidentally, were wearing white sleeveless
undershirts; the female bartenders had on long blonde wigs. The
idea was to re-create the working-class ambiance of that
disco-crazed summer of 1977, a decided contrast to the equally
authentic look of the two female stars of the film. Mira Sorvino, a
brunette these days, wore an ice-blue-beaded Bob Mackie. Jennifer
Esposito wore a strapless, backless Donna Karan dress that left no
doubt about an Egyptian-looking tattoo on her left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it was the `third eye of insight,''' she said.
``I got it when I was 17 in Manhattan. I thought it sounded good _
the `third eye of insight.'''

EDITORIAL: IMPROVING MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's Medicare reform plan, if approved by
Congress, would constitute the most substantial change to Medicare
since its creation in 1965. Although no reform can instantly
improve quality and increase cost-efficiency in the enormous
program, Clinton has delivered a well-considered proposal that can
shore up Medicare without heedlessly expanding costs or creating
chaos for 39 million beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The plan takes a prudent, incremental approach in adding
benefits and changing Medicare's structure. The proposal is
premised on putting $794 billion into Medicare over the next 15
years from the projected $5.5 trillion federal surplus. But any
plan that does not greatly cut benefits or reduce eligibility
through income tests or other means would need to put more money
into Medicare in the next two decades as baby boomers reach
retirement and technology makes it possible for more people to live
longer. The Clinton plan would extend the solvency of the Medicare
trust fund to 2027.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would spend $118 billion over 10 years to
provide limited prescription drug coverage. That step is long
overdue. A third of Medicare recipients have no drug coverage, even
though drugs have become crucial to managing chronic illnesses and
can help keep patients out of the hospital. The proposed voluntary
program, beginning in 2002, would charge Medicare enrollees $24 a
month. The government would pay half the cost of prescription drugs
for those who enroll, with a maximum government payment of $1,000 a
year. The monthly premium would gradually increase to $44 in 2008,
with the maximum benefit cap rising to $2,500. Low-income people
would receive help paying the monthly premiums and co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   The drug plan, which would increase Medicare costs by about 5
percent in 2009, would not create an open-ended benefit. But it
would enable Medicare to get volume discounts from drug companies,
as large purchasers typically do, and to pass those discounts on to
the elderly. The plan may also help staunch the decline in
employer-paid retiree health benefits by covering some of the drug
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's package would also make it more attractive
for beneficiaries to join managed care plans, a shift that is
essential to future cost containment. Health plans bidding for
Medicare patients would have to offer the same benefits as
fee-for-service Medicare. If a plan could provide the same coverage
for less money, enrollees would benefit directly from those
savings, most likely through discounts off the current $45.50
monthly Medicare premium. That incentive could help pull more
people into lower-cost plans. The proposal would increase
competition and efficiency in the fee-for-service sector by
enabling qualified, cost-efficient doctors to attract Medicare
patients by offering patients lower cost-sharing than traditional
Medicare, where patients usually pay 20 percent of the costs and
the government pays 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming Medicare requires modernizing the benefits and
improving cost controls. The Clinton proposal, made feasible by the
surplus, offers some sensible ways to achieve those goals while
keeping Medicare a broad-based social insurance program.

NO EASY ANSWERS IN DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You know it's a scary draft for NBA executives
when your options include trusting Chicago Bulls general manager
Jerry Krause or 19-year-old Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Today's ceremony at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C., is
considered the most muddled draft in recent memory. There is no
franchise player, no clear-cut No. 1 pick and no centers. That's a
GM's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. Teams wanting to make deals for the top pick are
forced to deal with Krause, who is notoriously paranoid about his
draft decisions, and known for trying to hardball teams in trade
talks.
</P>
<P>
   It might be fitting that the one player Krause coveted early,
Rhode Island's Odom, has proved to be a headcase for the Bulls and
just about any other team that expressed interest. As late as
Monday night, Odom blew off a scheduled meeting with Bulls coach
Tim Floyd in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Odom did graciously agree to an unimpressive workout Monday with
the Bulls, Clippers, Toronto and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way he'll drop far,'' Floyd said. ``He's probably
made some errors in judgment, but you can't confuse that with a
person's character.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Someone else in the lottery can gamble on Odom, who
tried (and failed) to return to college after signing with an
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago will be fielding offers up until it selects first, but
if it doesn't make a deal, is expected to take Maryland's Steve
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Vancouver, which needs a power forward. Common sense
dictates the Grizzlies take Duke forward Elton Brand, especially
since he actually turned out to be 6-foot-8 when measured at a
predraft camp.
</P>
<P>
   But the Grizzlies also were the only team that Odom privately
worked out for, so that leaves him as an option at No. 2. And then
there are the 20 or so clubs wanting Vancouver's pick, so they can
claim point guard Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls do something crazy and select Brand, every team in
the league will be calling Vancouver so they can select Francis.
</P>
<P>
   A logical projected deal already confirmed by the Grizzlies had
Vancouver shipping the No. 2 pick to Minnesota, which would then
send point guard Terrell Brandon to Indiana. Vancouver would then
receive Pacers forward Antonio Davis and the Timberwolves' pick at
No. 6. Brandon would have to be signed to a new contract, but he
was not resisting a potential move to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Less discussed has been a three-way trade where the Lakers would
send Glen Rice to Miami, the Heat would ship P.J. Brown to the
Grizzlies and the Lakers would get the No. 2 pick to draft Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But Vancouver figures to get even better deals by this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, which picks third, has made no secret that it wants
Davis, even though he refused to work out for the Hornets.
Privately, they are believed to want Francis more but expect him to
be gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets also like Odom, but Charlotte GM Bob Bass said, ``At
some point, you have to say enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be a smokescreen, but the Hornets do need a point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   If Odom falls to No. 4, it presents quite a dilemma for the
Clippers. They want Davis but would gladly take forward Wally
Szczerbiak, who made 34 of 50 of his 3-pointers during a workout
for Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   His character is perfect, but won't it at least cause the
Clippers pause to pass on the potential of Odom? Not when they
consider the chances he would leave as soon as he is eligible for
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible there has been too much trade talk, and this
could be a limited-activity draft, with minor deals like the one
sending Atlanta's Mookie Blaylock to Golden State for the No. 10
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's just feeling each other out, throwing a lot of
stuff against the wall, trying to see what sticks,'' Wizards
general manager Wes Unseld said. ``For me, it's as thick as I've
seen it. I'm not getting a straight answer from anyone. Maybe
because nobody has any.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, which picks fifth, has been after the Bulls for the
past month, but refuses to part with Tracy McGrady or Doug
Christie. It's more likely the Raptors will be involved in
something small.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Washington and Toronto were tossing around a trade
that would give the Wizards the No. 5 selection (where they would
take Odom) and the Raptors would get Tracy Murray and the No. 7
(where they could take high schooler Jonathan Bender).

   Club gives boat to state to help save manatees
</P>
<P>
   By Sally D. Swartz
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   PORT SALERNO, Fla. _ Manatees from St. Lucie County to Key West
got a present on Tuesday _ a new boat biologists will use to rescue
them when they're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Save The Manatee Club, the group singer Jimmy Buffett started in
1981, gave the $17,000 boat to Department of Environmental
Protection staffers. DEP's Florida Marine Research Institute
station in Tequesta will use it to rescue manatees and to collect
dead ones to learn what killed them.
</P>
<P>
   Manatee deaths are increasing, biologist Amy Perry said. The DEP
recorded 231 last year, and so far this year has counted 147.
Collisions with boats killed the highest number _ 37 _ of 123
deaths in which cause has been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only halfway through the year,'' Perry said, ``and the
numbers are way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high numbers: 24 newborns died; 22 died of natural causes;
and 10 died from red tide on Florida's west coast. The remainder
died in floodgate or canal lock accidents, were trapped in pipes
under roads or storm drains, or became entangled in monofilament
fishing line. Cause of death was not determined in 25 animals.
</P>
<P>
   Four manatees have died in Martin County and four in Palm Beach
County so far this year, Perry said. No deaths have been reported
in St. Lucie or Okeechobee counties.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-foot Mako boat, with a 115-horsepower motor and trailer,
will help researchers find and rescue manatees, and aid in a
photo-identification project.
</P>
<P>
   Many individual manatees can be identified by scars from
previous encounters with propellers, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Club board members Ross Wilcox of Palm Beach County and Pete
Meier of Martin County said the club bought the boat with money
from its $1 million annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Save the Manatee group has more than 40,000 members
worldwide and an estimated 12,000 Florida members, Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   The group promotes education and research and lobbies for
legislation to protect manatees, Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP can't afford extras such as the boat, Perry said. Money
to support manatee programs comes from the sale of manatee license
tags, buthas dwindled as other specialty plates were introduced.
</P>
<P>

rescue programs, visit web pages: www.savethemanatee.org or

LAKERS FAR AWAY FROM DRAFT ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A drama of deception, shady deals and double crosses
will unfold tonight on the MCI Center stage in the nation's
capitol. But the Lakers will be mere spectators in this
made-for-cable NBA production.
</P>
<P>
   Franchise players will be dangled, top prospects offered and
rumors floated on NBA draft night, but when the speculation gives
way to reality, the wheeling and dealing probably won't involve the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They are set to draft at No. 23 and No. 30, far removed from the
intrigue of the top 10, and that's where they will remain unless a
can't-miss deal presents itself. Lakers executive vice president
Jerry West doesn't expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' West said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In need of a power forward and possibly a point guard, the
Lakers were believed to be dangling 3-point ace Glen Rice for a
high pick _ presumably to take UCLA point guard Baron Davis _ or
for an established power forward like Miami's P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We explored some possibilities,'' West said, ``but we really
don't want to do a lot of things here. If we could get in position
for a particular type of player, we would look at something like
that, but that never panned out and now we're looking at what's
available at 23 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a couple players we were very high on, but it never
really got to the point where anything was even on the table.
Nothing of any stature.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers have worked out a number of prospects they know
will be long gone by the time they select. Davis and Duke's Trajan
Langdon have passed through, as have Ron Artest of St. John's,
Jason Terry of Arizona and high-schooler Jonathan Bender.
</P>
<P>
   Others who worked out for the Lakers brass range from likely
mid-first-round picks _ Minnesota's Quincy Lewis, Xavier's James
Posey, Kentucky's Scott Padgett _ to project players such as Cal
Bowdler of Old Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   And in a true reflection of their expectations, the Lakers' last
workout candidate Tuesday was someone named Devean George, of
Division III Augsburg College in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   What the Lakers will find late in the first round is hard to
forecast, but it's unlikely they'll get the power forward they
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tougher down there to get a big guy that can
play,'' general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``If you look at the
draft this year, the top 10, there are not a lot of big guys there.
So if you can't get one in the top 10, what makes you think you can
get one at 23?''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, the Lakers will fill their big man need on the
free-agent market, with Charles Oakley a prime target.
</P>
<P>
   With Derek Fisher possibly leaving as a free agent, the Lakers
might again draft a point guard to go with second-year pro Tyronn
Lue and 16-year veteran Derek Harper. But again, even in this point
guard-rich draft, they won't get much of an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty Lue is as good as any of these so-called top five point
guards because he's a legitimate point guard,'' NBA scouting
director Marty Blake said, referring to the top five of Steve
Francis, Andre Miller, William Avery, Terry and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   This draft will be new coach Phil Jackson's first opportunity to
influence the roster he inherits. What's he looking for? He isn't
saying. Jackson has not given an interview since his press
conference two weeks ago and declined to take calls the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers are down to 48 hours to decide the future
of Rice. They have until Thursday afternoon to exercise a one-year,
$7.1 million option or let him become a free agent, with the hope
of re-signing him.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers mull that decision, rumors of a Rice-for-Scottie
Pippen deal have resurfaced. It's an unlikely scenario, but a
reflection of the team's quandary with the disgruntled Rice.
</P>
<P>
   West said the Lakers were not trying to trade Rice _ ``not right
now'' _ but wouldn't say what the team's intentions are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not really sure where we are there,'' West said.
``I think it's our intention to have Glen back here, that's for
sure.''

EDITORIAL: A CRUEL SCHEME TO CURB ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled by the label. The benignly titled ``Child
Custody Protection Act'' scheduled for House action Wednesday is in
fact a cold-hearted piece of legislation that would jeopardize the
health of desperate young women seeking abortions and potentially
imprison adults who help them. The bill also flouts the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the measure seeks to broaden the reach of strict
laws that are now on the books in 22 states requiring teen-agers to
notify or consult their parents before obtaining an abortion, or
else seek a judge's permission. It would do so by putting anyone
other than a parent who accompanies a minor seeking an abortion
across state lines at risk of criminal prosecution _ if the minor
has not met her home state's requirements for parental consent. The
House Judiciary Committee rejected Democratic attempts to soften
the measure, including a proposed exception for cases of incest.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, parents should be involved in medical decisions
affecting their children. But the effect of this bill would be to
further isolate children who are already afraid to consult with
their parents about abortion. It might also cause them to risk
their safety by traveling to distant states alone.
</P>
<P>
   The potential damage to the Constitution is no less serious.
Apart from undermining the constitutional right to an abortion, the
legislation violates the right of citizens to travel freely and to
be treated as ``a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien''
when entering another state _ a right recently upheld by the
Supreme Court in a California welfare case.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers can show no compelling justification for
giving different treatment to state residents and nonresidents
seeking medical services. In addition, the bill could result in
legal chaos as federal prosecutors try to figure out the
interaction between this new federal statute and and a host of
different parental notification laws in the states.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and the abortion debate
should join to defeat this misguided proposal. If not, President
Clinton must stand ready to use his veto pen in the event
election-year expediency prevails over principle in both chambers.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is set Wednesday to
approve the long-delayed nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be
chief American representative to the United Nations. Full Senate
confirmation could take place before the July 4 recess. But Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, now threatens to delay the nomination
over an unrelated civil service dispute. Holbrooke's presence is
urgently needed at the U.N. The majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., should advise Grassley to drop his obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is over Linda Shenwick, an employee of the American
U.N. mission who says she was punished for telling Congress and the
press about wasteful spending at the U.N. The validity of her claim
should be decided by the Merit System Protection Board, a civil
service panel that protects whistle-blowers. Her complaint has
nothing to do with Holbrooke. Pressing business awaits him. The
U.N. is setting up a new administration for Kosovo and Holbrooke
can help assure that mistakes made in Bosnia are not repeated. His
assistance is also needed in a new effort to rebuild Security
Council consensus on disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's wide diplomatic experience in Europe and Asia and
his Balkan peacemaking achievements well suit him for the U.N. His
nomination has been thoroughly reviewed on ethical and policy
grounds and has support from a wide range of senators, including
Jesse Helms, R-N.C. Grassley ill serves the nation by delaying
confirmation.

   HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ Marshall Wayne, who displeased Adolf
Hitler by winning gold and silver medals in diving in the 1936
Berlin Olympics and was later shot down over Italy fighting the
Nazis, died June 16. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He died at Pardee Hospital in Hendersonville after suffering a
cerebral hemorrhage while working on a book at home, said his
sister, Dever Antes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had met Ernest Hemingway and had wanted to write stories
like Hemingway's for a long time,'' said Ms. Antes, also of
Hendersonville.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antes said her brother spoke with Hitler and the Nazi leader
was very displeased with Wayne for winning the gold medal in the
platform diving competition. Wayne also won the silver medal in the
3-meter springboard diving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler wanted his man from Germany to win it, so he wasn't too
happy at all seeing my brother win,'' Ms. Antes recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She said the family lived in Miami close to a pool where Wayne
did most of his practicing. He excelled at diving in high school
and at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While serving in World War II as a colonel in the Army Air
Forces, Wayne's plane was shot down in Italy and Italians helped
Wayne get to a British Aid Station and then to England for surgery.
The fall from the plane had torn ligaments and tendons in his leg,
Ms. Antes said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Wayne became a Pan American Airways pilot, and
retired as a captain in 1972, the same year he moved to
Hendersonville.
</P>
<P>
   His love for the Olympics landed him a spot on the 1996 Atlanta
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic torch was making a run through town and Wayne was
invited to take part in the ceremony,'' Ms. Antes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was wearing a fake medal around his neck and when
he climbed out of the car downtown, someone shouted, `Hey where'd
you get that medal?' And Marshall said, `From the '36 Olympics in
Berlin.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, Wayne is survived by his daughter,
Marilyn Wayne of San Pedro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne's other daughter died a couple of years ago, Ms. Antes
said.

CLEMENS DOMINATES TIGERS AS YANKS WIN, 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is understandable that Roger Clemens has not been
elated with his first four and a half months as a Yankee. He has
not consistently pitched like a five-time Cy Young Award winner or
even like the best starter on a powerful team. He has not
repeatedly reached that level. Clemens has been decent, not
dominating.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees keep waiting for Clemens to purposefully saunter to
the mound and take over. Not just for one gaudy start here and one
glossy start there, but for that night and for the rest of the
season. That is why the Yankees jumped at the chance to snatch
Clemens from the Blue Jays, because he can dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was pretty close to dominant as the Yankees edged the
Tigers, 3-0, Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium to win their seventh
straight game. The Tigers had several scoring chances and proved
that Clemens was mortal, but Clemens actually was most dominant
when those situations arose and recorded his first shutout as a
Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Clemens took over. The Yankees hope it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter belted a two-run homer off Justin Thompson and Shane
Spencer, who dyed his hair a shocking platinum blonde, also homered
to begin the scoring and continued trying to seize control of the
unpredictable left field job. Spencer played right field while Paul
O'Neill was rested against Thompson, but he has four homers in his
last seven games and is giving the Yankees hope that he might
finally be the answer in left.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens must be the answer at the top of the rotation or the
Yankees will need a new ace for October. He was gritty enough
against the Tigers, escaping a jam in the sixth inning with runners
on second and third by striking out Tony Clark on a split-finger
fastball and retiring Damion Easley on a flyout. He also stranded
runners at second in the third and the fifth. The Tigers were 0 for
5 with men in scoring position as Clemens scattered their eight
hits over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Clemens pitched poorly in a 12-4 victory over Tampa Bay
last week, Manager Joe Torre met with him and pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre the next day. Torre wanted to ask Clemens about his
philosophy and tell him what the Yankees had observed through his
first 12 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see what was going on,'' said Torre.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation must have helped. Clemens had a fierce
fastball, a nifty split-finger fastball and precise control as he
struckout eight, walked one, won for the third time in four starts
and shaved his ERA from 5.13 to 4.52. The fans roared when Clemens
(8-2) trotted out of the dugout for the ninth and he completed the
130-pitch effort with three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and Knoblauch were in the Soho section of Manhattan
Tuesday when they both decided to pop into a salon for some hair
lightening. Knoblauch merely had blonde streaks placed in his hair,
but Spencer bleached his hair so severely that it looked white.
Spencer said that he and Knoblauch had their hair bleached
simultaneously so Knoblauch had not tricked him by being more
conservative. Both players followed Clemens, who had his hair
lightened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came out a little lighter than I thought it was going to,''
admitted Spencer. ``My head was on fire. I'll go black the next
time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   The issue of disarmament has long been the most important
obstacle to peace in Northern Ireland. The insistence of
Protestants that the Irish Republican Army turn over its weapons,
and the IRA's refusal, have wrecked previous chances at peace. The
Good Friday peace agreement postpones the problem, simply
committing all the parties _ most importantly, Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing _ to doing what they can to get their allies to give
up weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The question once again threatens the peace. David Trimble, the
Protestant who is the Northern Ireland Assembly's first minister,
has demanded that the IRA move on disarmament before Sinn Fein can
take seats in his Cabinet. Sinn Fein argues that this is not a
requirement of the peace agreement, that it would not guarantee
peace and that most of the region's political parties began as
armed groups and never disarmed. Demanding disarmament risks a
return to terror by IRA extremists, who have so far supported
peace.
</P>
<P>
   All this is true. But Trimble is also under real siege from
hard-liners in his own party. Many Protestants feel their
adversaries are trying to join the government while retaining the
option of terror.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have gone into marathon negotiating sessions. The
British and Irish prime ministers have been in Belfast this week.
Both were central to the peace agreement, and well aware that if
there is no compromise by midnight Wednesday, Northern Ireland's
self-rule will likely be postponed, which many fear could destroy
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Several compromises under discussion are still possible, even
though the issue is complicated by the start of the often violent
summer season of Protestant parades. Disarmament is an emotional
issue, and both Trimble and Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn
Fein, need something they can sell as a symbolic victory, or at
least a stalemate, to their own extremists. The IRA could pledge to
disarm by next May, which is now what Trimble demands. Or it could
make some token gesture of disarmament now. Trimble might decide
that his side can live with a token disarmament by next year, if
the IRA behaves itself otherwise. The British government might
promise a faster winding down of its military presence, or other
reforms Catholics demand.
</P>
<P>
   Those called the ``hard men'' on both sides have the power to
take Northern Ireland back to war. Let us simply take note of the
potential consequences. Terrorist acts could resume by the IRA and
Protestant paramilitaries. Hard-liners could gain power, while
those who have taken risks for peace could be politically
discredited. It would be tragic if Northern Ireland spent one year
relatively free of terror, with hope for a future of
reconciliation, jobs and prosperity _ until the hard men took it
away.

stalled amid fears that permitting a foreign medical school to
operate in the United States would lead to a proliferation of

POWER STRUGGLE DISRUPTS OLDEST PUBLIC RADIO STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite 2nd graf for clarification.)  (mk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The trouble at radio station KPFA has come to
this: When two folk singers scheduled to perform as a duo on Sunday
afternoon arrived at the building, armed security guards would only
let one of them inside.
</P>
<P>
   Security measures taken last week after 30 people stormed the
station allow staff members to bring only one guest unless names of
guests are submitted beforehand, to be placed on a list. The radio
host said she had never been told of this new rule, so the names of
the two were not on the list, and the show did not go on.
</P>
<P>
   The incident on Sunday was just one small example of how serious
the fight has become between KPFA, the nation's oldest public radio
station, and the Pacifica Foundation, which owns the station and
four others in Los Angeles, Houston, New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, KPFA, known for its leftist point of
view and reporting that ranges from East Timor in Indonesia to
People's Park a few blocks away, has been at the center of street
protests and arrests, the firing of veteran reporters and other
employees, potential lawsuits, even gunshots and death threats.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the increasingly ugly run-ins between KPFA's
staff members and supporters and its management _ a conflict that
local public radio stations across the country are following with
intense interest _ is a classic power struggle over who controls
what goes on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   KPFA, founded 50 years ago by pacifists, receives 80 percent to
85 percent of its financing from donations (the rest from grants
and bequests) and emphasizes programs with community members and
militants as guests and hosts.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first station to broadcast Allen Ginsberg reading
``Howl,'' Che Guevara trying to foment revolution just months
before his killing in Bolivia, and Patty Hearst, the kidnapped
heiress, calling her parents ``capitalist pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing protests here _ the latest was on Monday evening,
with more than 100 people holding placards and chanting ``Free
KPFA'' _ began as rumblings of discontent from staff members and
listeners, who say they started noticing a shift in the last two or
three years away from Pacifica's traditional style of
community-influenced programming and decision-making, toward a
hierarchical bureaucracy that wants to dictate its orders to a
community that, in essence, owns the station.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings grew louder when Pacifica unveiled a ``strategic
plan'' several months ago that called for more national programming
and removed local advisory board members from the central governing
board. The unrest exploded into full-scale protests and picket
lines when KPFA's general manager, Nicole Sawaya, was fired on
March 31, two weeks before the station's 50th anniversary
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Lasar, a former news reporter at the station and author
of ``Pacifica: The Rise of an Alternative Network'' (Temple
University Press, 1999), said that the firing of Ms. Sawaya _ on
the ground that she was not a team player _ made the perceptions of
top-down decision-making concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``KPFA is the closest thing that the Bay area secular left has
to a church,'' Lasar said, ``and Pacifica threw out the preacher
two weeks before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pacifica circulated a memorandum warning programmers not
to discuss the firing on the air, they promptly did. When KPFA's
veteran national news reporter and signature voice, Larry Bensky,
objected to the dismissal of the general manager, he too was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica's executive director, Lynn Chadwick, said all the
protests started because a small group of people refused to allow
KPFA to grow. She said Pacifica wanted to broaden its appeal and
reach more than 200,000 of the 6 million potential listeners in its
59,000-watt channel, and that a hard-core group of listeners and
staff members did not want the station to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people who have called me are still talking about
some of the programming changes made in the mid-'90s,'' Ms.
Chadwick said. ``Whenever there is any change, there are some
people who want things to be the way they think they were when we
started, who are going to resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chadwick, who has become the focal point of the protesters'
wrath, said that tighter security measures had to be imposed last
week after she was cornered in her office by 30 protesters who
refused to leave. In addition, the day after the general manager,
Ms. Sawaya, was let go _ Ms. Sawaya's contract was not renewed, but
she was not technically dismissed, Ms. Chadwick said _ gunshots
were fired into Pacifica's headquarters, next door to KPFA. Ms.
Chadwick said she had also been called names by protesters and
received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of heat is not good,'' she said. ``It's not good for
any of us. After all, we're all on the same side _ we want a good
community radio station.''

WOMAN FALSELY CHARGED GETS $230,000 SETTLEMENT, APOLOGY FROM
COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's been a few years since 74-year-old Laura Park
taught fifth-graders constitutional law and U.S. history, but she
still had a few lessons for King County about justice.
</P>
<P>
   Park, a former Washington state teacher of the year, has
received a record settlement from the King County Prosecutor's
Office after she was falsely charged in 1994 with theft by Deputy
Prosecutor Ivan Orton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $230,000 for violation of her constitutional
rights, Park received a formal apology from the Prosecutor's Office
June 16. Top prosecutors have also outlined administrative changes
to increase supervision of deputy prosecutors in the fraud unit to
prevent similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The theft charge grew out of a simple probate dispute with
relatives over the estate of Park's late mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is humiliating for me to have to say this, but I am not a
thief and to have been so labeled was an experience traumatic
beyond belief,'' Park said in court papers. ``When I taught fifth
grade, I instructed my pupils on American history and our
constitutional rights, and during the course of the criminal
litigation, I felt like I had none.''
</P>
<P>
   Park recalled being arrested, fingerprinted and being led to
jail with two women suspected of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Said Franklin Shoichet, Park's civil attorney:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all still shaking our heads in amazement that a
prosecutor would file this case. ... In 23 years as a lawyer, it's
the most cockeyed use of prosecutorial resources I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Satterberg, chief of staff for Prosecutor Norm Maleng,
personally issued the apology to Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we regret the action,'' Satterberg said Tuesday.
``We have apologized to her and made her whole because we have done
harm to Mrs. Park. With 20-20 hindsight, it's a case we regret
filing.''
</P>
<P>
   Satterberg said Orton filed the case and its appeal without
consulting his supervisors. His agency was unaware of it until the
Appeals Court threw it out, he said. Prosecutors have instituted a
new tracking system for the fraud division to keep supervisors
informed of all fraud cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Satterberg called Orton a highly skilled deputy prosecutor with
17 years of experience. No disciplinary action is planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that his judgment has been questioned by two
courts and his bosses,'' Satterberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Orton was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Shoichet said the settlement is a state record for a plaintiff
whose constitutional rights were violated by a prosecutor. It also
appears to be one of the top such settlements in the nation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, however, will be eaten up by taxes and legal
costs to a number of lawyers, Shoichet said. Park said she sued
King County in federal court not for the money, but because she
believed the system had failed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I paid in lost sleep, nightmares and emotional upheaval
is incalculable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case began when Park, who was the personal representative
for her mother's estate, used money from a joint account held with
a second heir to repair her mother's home and subdivide a lot for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   She never used any of the jointly held funds for personal use.
But how she used the funds angered a third relative and heir, who
believed that was an improper use of money, even though Park did
not need any court approval to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the third heir complained to both probate court and
the fraud unit of the King County Prosecutor's Office, eventually
leading Orton to file first-degree theft and attempted-theft
charges against Park.
</P>
<P>
   Orton alleged in the 1994 charges that Park committed theft by
exerting unauthorized control of the second relative's share of the
joint account, even though he conceded she had not used the money
for personal gain and had ``no intent to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of local attorneys involved with the case say they
found Park's prosecution nearly unbelievable. Such disputes over an
estate are common and best handled by a probate court, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I have never encountered or even heard of a prosecutor
attempting to end-run around the power of a probate court and
attempting to become involved in an ordinary civil dispute over
ownership of a joint bank account, as Mr. Orton did,'' Scott
Easter, a former King County prosecutor who represented Park in
probate court, said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Kolker successfully argued to have the criminal
case against Park thrown out at both the Superior Court and the
state Appeals Court levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally inappropriate for a criminal case,'' said
Kolker, who still fumes when he recalls the case. ``Ivan Orton was
out of control; that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police properly refused to investigate the case, he said
in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who was named Edmonds School District teacher of the year
in 1973 and 1975-76 state teacher of the year by the Council of
Chief State School Officers, fought the case even as she nursed her
husband through Alzheimer's disease, to which he succumbed to last
year.
</P>
<P>
   She required anti-depressants after she was charged with the
theft, which she takes to this day, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest moments came when she was arrested and taken
to the King County Jail to be fingerprinted and have her mug shot
taken, Park said. She was led from the courthouse to the jail along
with two women arrested on prostitution charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unreal experience,'' she said. ``I was taken in
handcuffs to the jail. ... The two gals who were prostitutes, well,
they were very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said in an interview this week that she was immensely
frustrated by the fact Orton refused to talk with her before or
after filing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do not understand why Mr. Orton, during the course of
his five-month investigation, could not simply (have) picked up a
telephone and asked my lawyers and me to submit to an interview,''
Park said in court papers. ``I would have been happy to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Satterberg said he regretted Park was never interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost always critical to an investigation to talk to a
suspect,'' he said. ``I don't have a good explanation for failing
to get her side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new tracking system instituted by the Prosecutor's
Office, each case is now entered onto a log, which is constantly
updated, allowing supervisors to track its program, he said. No
such system existed previously.
</P>
<P>
   Park said the changes in the fraud division was what really
mattered to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apology was greatly appreciated, but action is more
important,'' Park said. ``It's been five years of misery.''

HERSHISHER PITCHES METS PAST MARLINS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He is two and a half months shy of his 41st birthday.
But for one night, at least, Orel Hershiser demonstrated that every
now and then he can pitch as if her were still in his 20s and
dominating the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Sinker ball. Ground ball. Sinker. Grounder. The inexperienced
young hitters of the Florida Marlins kept beating the ball into the
ground, like some sort of strange highlight film straight out of
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing in the Mets' 5-1 victory Tuesday over the
free-swinging Marlins was Hershiser's old Dodgers uniform. The one
he wore in `88 when he tossed 60 consecutive scoreless innings to
end the season and break Don Drysdale's old record, before pitching
Los Angeles past the Mets in the NL Championship Series and then by
the Oakland A's in the World Series on his way to a Cy Young award.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (8-5) allowed just one run and five hits in 8 1/3
innings as he fell two outs short of the Mets' first complete game
of the season and Hershiser's first in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser also missed his first shutout in over four years when
Alex Gonzalez tripled to right to open the ninth and Bruce Aven
grounded to short to score Gonzalez. Kevin Orie then blasted a
double and Hershiser was done after 93 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' longest outing from a starter this season, and
Hershiser left to a standing ovation from the handful of fans
remaining of the announced crowd of 11,256 at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He earned the applause against the team with the worst record in
the major leagues, and after the start of the game as delayed 1
hour 12 minutes because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Hershiser's fourth in a row and the Mets' 17th
in their last 22 games. The Mets, who again pulled to within three
games of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East, have now won the last
five times Hershiser has pitched. And Tuesday night was easily the
40-year-old right-hander's strongest performance since signing with
the club during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Hershiser's 198th career victory, leaving him just
two shy of the 200-plateau he covets.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser's longest outing in 14 previous starts with the Mets
had been 6 2/3 innings. He was averaging just 5 1/3 innings a start
coming into Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But through seven shutout innings Tuesday, Hershiser had thrown
just 68 pitches, an average of 9.7 pitches per inning, nearly six
fewer than his average coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser needed just five pitches in both the third and fourth
innings to retire the side, with all six outs coming on ground
balls. After an 18-pitch fifth, it took Hershiser just five pitches
again to retire the side in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jorge Fabregas flew to center to end the fifth, only one
ball had left the infield: Aven's bloop single.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the first 14 outs Hershiser recorded were on ground
balls. Eight of them went to Rey Ordonez, who had an outside shot
at a 96-year-old record for assists in a game by a shortstop: 14 by
Tommy Corcoran of the Cincinnati Reds in 1903. Ordonez fell short,
finishing with 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser needed 17 pitches to complete the eighth, as the
Marlins put two runners on in an inning for the first time, one on
another infield hit to third, another on an error by third baseman
Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The red-hot Ventura more than atoned for himself. His two-out
bases-loaded single off Livan Hernandez (3-8) in the third inning
gave the Mets a 2-0 lead. Rickey Henderson, who had three hits,
drove in a run in the fourth with a sacrifice fly. And then Alfonzo
chased Hernandez with a prodigious two-run homer over the left
field scoreboard in the seventh to complete the scoring.

   WASHINGTON _ It is daunting enough for a presidential candidate
to have to raise $20 million to establish himself as a serious

</P>
<P>
   It's even tougher when the candidate is running, as is Sen. John
McCain, as a reform-minded alternative who has spent years pushing
to end the reliance on big money in election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated dance step, and it's most complicated for
John McCain and (Democratic candidate) Bill Bradley because both
are trying to take the money and look clean simultaneously,'' said
Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a public interest group.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who plans to speak out again on behalf of campaign
reform during a major speech today in Bedford, N.H., says he has
heard people express sentiments similar to Makinson's before, and
expects he will again in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Arizona Republican said it irks him when it is
suggested that there is something unusual, or inconsistent, about
taking special-interest money while running as a reform candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has spent years trying to prod his fellow Republicans
into supporting his proposals to reduce the impact of the
wealthiest donors during election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he finds himself having to raise about $20 million to
establish himself as a serious alternative to front-runner George
W. Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's world, like those of the other presidential candidates,
has become dominated by fund-raisers. Only the locations, and
sometimes the menus, vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so foolish and ignorant for someone to say, `Hey, well,
you're raising money, and you're for campaign-finance reform?'''
McCain said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He told ``The Arizona Republic'' that if he wins the GOP
nomination, he will instruct the Republican National Committee not
to spend ``soft money'' on his campaign. Soft money, which is
collected from corporations, wealthy individuals and labor groups,
is not supposed to be spent on behalf of candidates for federal
office. But both parties bent the rules in the 1996 election, and
may do so again.
</P>
<P>
   While he eschews soft money, McCain has been accepting
contributions from political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   He has amassed a broad array of thousands of contributors and is
reaping significant sums from businesses _ notably those in
telecommunications and transportation _ that fall under his
jurisdiction as chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's largest contributors include employees or PACs of
communications giants such as Viacom, US West, Ameritech and Bell
Atlantic. Through their PACs, transportation companies such as
Burlington Northern-Santa Fe and America West have also donated
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign staff estimates McCain will have raised some $2.5
million from all sources during the second quarter, which ends
today. That would top his first-quarter total of $1.8 million
raised. McCain also has been able to draw on $1.9 million in
leftover contributions from his 1998 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   No one is going so far as to accuse McCain of hypocrisy over the
money issue. Even McCain's rivals concede that he would foolishly
undercut his prospects if he sought to make a point by adopting
more stringent campaign-finance guidelines, in addition to his
soft-money restriction, than the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible position for him to be in, and I'm sure an
uncomfortable one,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he hasn't been influenced by the money he accepts
from executives with business before his committee. In fact, he
says he has been fighting with some of his high-powered donors such
as AT&AMP;T over regulatory matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the constitutional right that every citizen has
_ innocent until proven guilty,'' McCain said, adding that there's
``never been any connection'' between contributions and committee
policy. ``Yes, I've gotten money from the telecommunications
industry, but I've gotten money from people all over America.''
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said the scramble for cash creates, at least, the
perception that candidates are being compromised. ``The structure
of the system makes it very difficult. It's like the old biblical
thing that it's easier for a camel to go into the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to get into heaven,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's committee purview is vast. He oversees issues ranging
from cable and satellite television rules, to airline deregulation,
to access to long-distance markets. His verdicts on legislation can
affect the direction of entire industries.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said in an interview that
he didn't believe McCain enjoyed any special advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it an advantage to be Elizabeth Dole, who got 300,000 names
(of contributors) from her husband on the day she announced?''
Davis asked. ``Whether Elizabeth's 300,000 names are better than
what we've got, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, a Republican former Cabinet secretary, is
competing with McCain for the GOP nomination. Her husband, Bob, was
the Republican nominee in 1996, but lost to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, McCain has traveled around the country with
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., promoting their legislation to
minimize the influence of wealthy contributors on congressional
elections. The bill, which McCain intends to push in his speech
today, would ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Feingold, on principle, declined all soft-money
assistance from the Democratic Party, and severely limited
donations from political action committees. He just barely won
re-election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been promoting his reformist credentials. On Friday,
his campaign sent dozens of reporters a column by the ``Washington
Pos''t's E.J. Dionne saying McCain ``could once again lift himself
above his competitors'' by pushing a campaign-finance reform bill
toward passage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The column also noted that McCain was ``not pure on this issue''
because he was ``working the Washington cash circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be for trying to change the system, but play by the
rules of the games,'' Davis told the ``Republic.'' ``There is no
strategy other than to identify Republican givers and go after them
for their contributions, whether it's $20 (or more).''
</P>
<P>
   McCain began raising funds in earnest at the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Hart, managing partner of a Washington legal and
governmental-affairs firm, said he got a call on Jan. 29 inviting
him to an organizational meeting at a club in Georgetown. Hart
described the crowd as ``a cross section of friends, including sort
of the military establishment, and lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who later donated $1,000, said there was no pressure to
contribute.
</P>
<P>
   McCain subsequently held large fund-raisers, which cumulatively
raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, at the Arizona Biltmore in
Phoenix and the Red Sage restaurant in downtown Washington, among
other locations.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees at the events have included John Timmons, a lobbyist
for America West; Will Ball, president of the National Soft Drink
Association; Mary McAuliffe, vice president of external relations
for Union Pacific; and Robbie Aiken, head of the Washington office
for Pinnacle West, of which the Arizona Public Service utility is a
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe invited more than 100 people to yet another
fund-raiser for McCain on Monday night. It was a catered event,
with the menu calling for Southwestern hors d'oeuvres to be served
at her Virginia home. &QL;

NO HEROES IN CUBANS' SAGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those who believe heroes are required in all
stories, have the Dodgers got a yarn for you.
</P>
<P>
   This one is full of foreign intrigue, villainy, ingrates, greed
and comic relief. Just nobody in a white hat.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball found the Dodgers guilty for having secret
tryouts in Cuba, arranging for the defection of two players to the
Dominican Republic and then signing them without offering a tryout
to the other major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball granted the two players free agency on Friday and they
held their first press conference Tuesday at the Beverly Hills
offices of their representatives, Gus Dominguez and Steve
Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the one-hour affair was over, everyone's hands
seemed a little dirty.
</P>
<P>
   The players _ Double-A first baseman Juan Carlos Diaz and
Single-A outfielder Josue Perez _ played the innocent victim
routine, but only so well. Neither claimed they had outed the
Dodgers to sign a more lucrative deal with another club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been about money,'' Perez said. ``It's about the
truth, and getting the truth out.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said this through an interpreter, who turned out to be his
agent, Dominguez, who kept talking about the hardships the players
had been through and all the Dodgers' broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Cuban defectors, however, Diaz and Perez did not have
to risk their lives on a boat to get out of the Communist country.
They took a plane and were put up in the Dodgers academy in the
Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   The big lie that was so hard to live with? Not much of one in
the end.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Peguero, a longtime Dodgers scout who now leads the
Dominican academy, had female relatives act like they had been
befriended by the players _ supposedly helping the women get
medical treatment _ and then write an invitation letter that
enabled the players to get a visa to the Dominican. Once there, the
players never saw the women again.
</P>
<P>
   Which is essentially the story they did tell people, just
leaving out the part that they really didn't know the women and it
had all been a scam to get them out. And that they were in on it.
Yeah, that will keep you up at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we left Cuba and got to the Dominican, everything
changed,'' Perez said. ``All the promises were broken. Just because
you're grateful to somebody one day, doesn't mean you have to be a
slave to them the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   And those promises? They said the Dodgers promised to help get
their families out of Cuba and did not. Perez, however, said just
who in his family they'd get out never came up. Diaz said it was
his mother and father, but never mentioned them again once he was
in the Dominican. Diaz said he never mentioned it, either.
</P>
<P>
   They could be stuck back under the oppression of Castro with no
real chance of ever becoming major-leaguers, but gratitude only
goes so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hardly innocent here, either. They were
overeager to tap into Cuba's talent pool, messed up, got caught and
are paying a heavy price, if not in the loss of two marginal
prospects, in image and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   All this happened, though, under another watch. When the team
was owned by Peter O'Malley and Fred Claire was the president.
Which explains why these Dodgers have refused to make any public
comment on the fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, it was all business. In the end, for the
players, too.

PHOENIX SOON TO BE NO. 5 CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAUN MCKINNON AND KATHLEEN   
 Ingley  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Which may come as a bit of a surprise to those of us who thought
we were No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Census Bureau, in a report to be released today, is very
clear: Phoenix is the seventh-largest city in the country, still
trailing San Diego, which many of us thought we had passed a couple
of years back.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials can produce a set of home-grown numbers that
show otherwise. But it may not matter for much longer. Based on
Census Bureau figures, Arizona's capital city should blow by both
San Diego and Philadelphia by 2006 to become the nation's
fifth-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   That's the meat of the bureau's latest statistics: Phoenix
remains the nation's fastest-growing big city, adding more than
200,000 new residents from July 1990 to July 1998, a 21.3 percent
rate of increase that census officials say is rewriting the books
on population booms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is in a growth class of its own as far as the largest
cities go,'' Census Bureau demographer Marc Perry said Tuesday.
``It's not just that it's gaining a lot of people, it's gaining a
lot of people at a fast rate. You don't see many other places that
are continuing to grow at that clip.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Phoenix grow faster, both in numbers and
percentage, than any of the nine U.S. cities with a population of
more than 1 million, it grew at a faster clip than all 26 U.S.
cities with a population of more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fascinating to demographers is the growth of Phoenix
suburbs. In many metropolitan areas, Perry said, the big, central
cities have leveled off in growth, with most new people siphoned
off to the outer suburban rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert, Chandler and Mesa are booming on their own,'' Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, in fact, led Arizona among all cities of more than
100,000 population and nearly led the nation, adding more than
70,000 new residents from 1990 to 1998, a rate of 78.4 percent.
Only Henderson, Nev., an exploding Las Vegas suburb, grew faster,
more than doubling in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Homes for newcomers are surging into once-isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Road, a dozen miles north of downtown Phoenix, was home to
a string of horse farms as recently as a decade ago. Now, the
pastures have given way to housing tracts and apartment complexes
with such names as Equestrian Manor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sad to see them go,'' said Cindy Chavez, who works at
nearby Greenway Saddlery. But the growth has been great for her
employer, who gets new customers.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 1990s, Waterworld Safari was an oasis among
the cactus and creosote in northwest Phoenix at 43rd Avenue and
Pinnacle Peak Road.
</P>
<P>
   From the top of a slide at the water park, ``the scenery was
gorgeous, you used to see the whole desert,'' said Pam Walters,
revenue manager. ``Now you see rooftops.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Manning, president of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce,
sees the latest statistics as a point of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Growth fuels economic growth, Manning said, although the
business community is ``certainly concerned about how to manage our
growth more effectively in the future and are working on that as a
very high priority this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The galloping growth has spurred critics to look for ways to
rein it in.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is gathering signatures to put the Citizens
Growth Management Initiative on the ballot in November 2000. A
centerpiece of the initiative is a requirement for cities to set
boundaries on where growth can occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel unsettled by how fast things are growing,'' said
Sandy Bahr, lobbyist for the club's Arizona chapter. ``Our quality
of life has suffered and will continue to suffer unless we get a
handle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull has been pushing her own plan, known as Growing
Smarter, partly as a way to head off the Sierra Club's initiative.
It includes requirements for better local planning and money to buy
open space, which voters approved last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rex, research manager at the Center for Business Research at
Arizona State University, maintains that the city is past the point
of reaping many benefits from growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're big enough to have just about anything here, at least in
terms of mass size,'' Rex said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last hurdles was getting big enough for major league
sports. During the 1990s, the Phoenix area reached the critical
mass, and is now one of just 11 cities to have all four major
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the census demographer, said it's impossible to predict
if Phoenix and the rest of the Valley can sustain such a high rate
of growth for many more years. Some census watchers predicted the
current expansion would never last through the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Outside factors almost certainly will influence future growth,
Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those other outside areas is California, home to
about half the population of the 11 Western states. An improving
economy there in recent years has begun attracting people back to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   As for the discrepancy over who's No. 6, Phoenix city spokesman
Mark Hughes said the Census Bureau estimates are based on the 1990
head-count. The Maricopa Association of Governments produces its
own estimates based on a 1995 special census, which would better
adjust for growth.
</P>
<P>
   MAG estimates the population of Phoenix at 1,238,120, as of July
1, 1998, the date corresponding to the Census Bureau's report. A
MAG estimate dated Thursday will show an even-higher figure of
1,263,895, Hughes said. &QL;
