<HEADLINE> Nev. Wildfires Burn 500 Square Miles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters from across the country on  
Thursday attacked scores of lightning-sparked fires that have 
blackened nearly 500 square miles of Nevada range, threatening 
ranches and burning closer to homes. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported and only one structure -- a storage  
shed -- was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra help was especially needed in the north-central part of  
the state, where flames threatened a housing subdivision near 
Battle Mountain and historic buildings in an old mining town. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated 78 fires -- which have burned an area about a third  
the size of Rhode Island -- were sparked by more than 8,000 
lightning strikes in Nevada during a 12-hour period on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes ignited bumper crops of highly flammable cheat grass  
and sage brush that have built up over five unusually wet winters 
in the high desert east of the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had more severe fire behavior than we anticipated,'' said  
Richard Brown, a Bureau of Land Management spokesman. ``We have 
matted grass and very hot, dry conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,300 firefighters were pitching in to help battle the  
blazes. Crews were also fighting fires in Idaho, Montana and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst, Idaho's Mule Butte fire, had charred 92,500 acres and  
was 80 percent contained by late Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, an arson brush fire threatened about 100 to 150  
homes and spread across more than 250 acres of steep hills on the 
northern edge of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 450 firefighters were being aided by helicopters  
dropping fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries or burned homes were reported.

<HEADLINE> Airlines, Pentagon Agree on Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six of the nation's major airlines signed an  
agreement with the Pentagon on Thursday under which the airlines 
will check the safety of foreign partners who help them fly 
American troops overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which grew out of a 1985 charter crash in  
Newfoundland that killed 248 U.S. soldiers, should also help 
prevent commercial passengers from ending up on foreign carriers 
with substandard safety records. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. airlines plan to certify within the next year that  
their foreign partners have processes for ensuring safety and have 
trained safety inspectors and that their flight crews get training 
through manuals that meet international flight safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Future inspections will be conducted at two-year intervals, or  
as the need arises. The participating carriers are American 
Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest 
Airlines, TWA and United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is going to be a standard of safety that we are going to  
test to,'' Capt. Edmond Soliday, vice president of corporate safety 
at United, said at a news conference. ``We're trying to get, to the 
best of our ability, a seamless level of compliance with 
standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Northwest said the government will get an added  
benefit since the carriers will even check the safety of airlines 
that do not fly to the United States. The U.S. government is 
empowered to check only airlines that fly in and out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a faster way for us to bring foreign airlines up to  
Western European and United States-level standards,'' said Clayton 
Foushee, Northwest's vice president of regulatory affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of foreign carriers has become an issue for U.S.  
airlines because many of them now have partnerships with overseas 
airlines known as ``code-shares.'' There were 61 such partnerships 
in 1994; now there are now more than 160. 
</P>
<P>
	Under such an arrangement, the carriers buy tickets on each  
other's planes and then sell them to passengers on connecting 
flights as if they were their own. 
</P>
<P>
	A passenger with a United Airlines ticket, for example, may fly  
on a United plane to New York and then transfer for a flight to 
Europe with the airline's German partner, Lufthansa, even though 
the ticket still reads ``United'' and has a United flight number. 
</P>
<P>
	Both carriers have excellent safety records, and airlines favor  
such partnerships because it allows them to project the image of a 
larger route network. It also gives passengers the ability to make 
seamless connections between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, however, Delta Air Lines halted its code-sharing  
arrangement with Korean Air after the Asian carrier suffered a 
cargo plane crash in China -- the latest in a series of fatal 
accidents or aircraft losses for Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta had said previously that it would not team up with an  
airline it deemed unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has a travel budget of $1.2 billion a year and has  
used its clout to push the airlines into taking visible steps to 
ensure the safety of foreign partners who might carry U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the advent of code-sharing has changed the  
rules and changed the concept a little bit and we believe that was 
an area that really needed to be addressed from a safety 
standpoint,'' said Mary Lou McHugh, assistant deputy defense 
undersecretary for transportation policy.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Fight Douglas in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson will make his latest comeback  
against perhaps his biggest nemesis when he fights Buster Douglas 
on Oct. 2 at the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson promoter Dan Goossen denied a deal had been struck, but  
the Washington Times, CNN/SI and the New York Daily News all 
reported the news Tuesday and Wednesday and a source confirmed it 
to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's boxing adviser, Shelly Finkel, was flying from New York  
to Scottsdale, Ariz., to watch Tyson train and could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson lost his undisputed heavyweight championship to Douglas in  
one of the most shocking upsets in boxing history when he was 
knocked out in the 10th round of their fight on Feb. 11, 1990, in 
Tokyo. Douglas went off as a 42-1 underdog, but dominated the bout 
and put Tyson out with a series of punches in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas lost the title to Evander Holyfield in his first  
defense, then was out of boxing for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas launched a comeback, but has looked like a shell of  
himself in recent fights. He was knocked out in the first round by 
Lou Savarese in June 1998 and won his last two bouts by knockout 
against nondescript opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be making his third return to boxing. He will fight  
for the first time since he knocked out Frans Botha in the fifth 
round with a single punch on Jan. 16 at the MGM. Shortly after that 
fight, Tyson served time in a Maryland jail assaulting two men 
following a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, 38, will have to undergo an exhaustive series of  
medical tests by the commission before he is approved to fight 
because of his age.

<HEADLINE> Smok'n Latern Wins Haughton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) --Smok'n Lantern enjoyed a  
near-perfect trip and then held off a late bid by Credit Winner to 
win the $509,400 Peter Haughton Memorial at the Meadowlands on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haughton, a one-mile trot for two-year-old colts and  
geldings, showcases some of the nation's best juvenile trotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by Berndt Lindstedt and trained by Jan Johnson, Smok'n  
Lantern got an enviable trip taking cover behind Brad's Photo, who 
led the pack through fractions of 29 2/5, 58 3/5 and 1:28 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the stretch, Smok'n Lantern, who has been on the  
board with three wins and a second place in all three of his stakes 
starts, finally overtook the tiring Brads Photo and then held off a 
late drive by Credit Winner to win by length and a quarter in 1:58 
3/5. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Pine Chip paid $9.40, 4.60 and 2.80, while Credit  
Winner took second and Brendt Hanover overcame an early break to 
finish third. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, unheralded longshot Dream of Joy captured the  
$484,800 Merrie Annabelle trot for two-year old fillies, overtaking 
Marita's Victory with a burst of late speed down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Dream of Joy, the Swedish-owned daughter of Victory Dream, was  
driven by little-known Jim Meittinis and trained by Per Eriksson. 
Racing for just the fourth time overall and the second time in a 
stakes race, Dream of Joy went off at 17-1 and paid $36.40, 11.80 
and 6.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Dream of Joy edged Marita's Victory by a length and a quarter at  
the wire in 1:58 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $461,400 Sweetheart Pace for two-year-old fillies,  
Panything Goes came flying down the stretch from off the pace to 
win a four-horse photo finish in 1:54 3/5.

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms Holbrooke to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today confirmed veteran diplomat  
Richard Holbrooke as U.N. ambassador, filling a post that has stood 
vacant through military conflicts in the Balkans and the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-16 vote ended a 14-month odyssey for Holbrooke, 58, the  
Clinton administrator's top international troubleshooter and the 
architect of the 1995 agreement that brought peace to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the long delay, the Senate debated the nomination  
for only 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabinet-level post at the U.N. headquarters in New York has  
been vacant since Bill Richardson left in September to become 
energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, 58, currently an investment banker, is a former Peace  
Corps director, ambassador to Germany and assistant secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, told colleagues that in his on 27 
years in the chamber, no foreign policy nominee ``is more qualified 
for the job for which he was nominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called Holbrooke ``one of  
America's great natural resources. He is a person of ... enormous 
energy and talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, the only senator to speak  
against the nomination, called him a ``principled man ... I admire 
his dedication, his tenacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she blamed him for helping to frame a Balkans policy that  
she said ``is to force factions to live together in an American 
model. ... I cannot in good conscience vote for someone who has 
taken our country in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton first announced his choice of Holbrooke in June 1998.  
But the selection remained bogged down for eight months in internal 
State and Justice Department ethics investigations into Holbrooke's 
business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, the nomination was delayed by individual senators  
for unrelated reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's confirmation vote was all but assured on Wednesday when  
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the final senator blocking the 
nomination, lifted his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is in a standoff with the State Department over its  
treatment of a career employee he claims was punished for sharing 
information on U.N. financial irregularities with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grassley's tactics created new problems for other diplomatic  
nominees. Grassley said that to make his point he would block three 
other pending nominations, including that of Peter Burleigh as 
ambassador to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh has been filling in for Holbrooke at the United Nations  
since September. In New York, Burleigh said he would have no 
comment on Grassley's ``hold'' on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said he was also putting ``holds'' on Carl Spielvogel  
to be ambassador to the Slovak Republic and Richard Fredericks to 
be ambassador to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other senators had also sought to block the Holbrooke  
nomination -- Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio -- but they 
earlier abandoned the tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate tradition, any member without explanation may block  
action on legislation or a nomination for as long as the majority 
leader permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats today criticized the tradition of holds. ``We  
have lost our sense of proportion,'' Biden said. ``We held up the 
single most important foreign policy decision to be made by this 
administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley used the technique to protest the State Department's  
treatment of a whistle-blower, Linda Shenwick. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley contends that Shenwick, who worked at the U.N. mission  
in New York, was demoted and transferred to a lesser job in 
Washington in retaliation for telling members of Congress about 
waste and inefficiency at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said Shenwick was reassigned because of  
unsatisfactory job performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Richardson left the U.N. post in September, the United  
States launched airstrikes against both Iraq and Yugoslavia. 
Burleigh, the assistant U.N. ambassador, served a stint as 
presiding officer of the Security Council and had to deal with the 
issue of delinquent U.S. payments to the international body. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke had been confirmed by the Senate three times  
previously: in 1977 as assistant secretary of state in the Carter 
administration, again in 1993 as ambassador to Germany, and later 
as assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a contender for secretary of state in Clinton's  
second term before the president chose Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holbrooke, ambitious and with a forceful personality, has  
produced detractors as well as fans, both in Congress and within 
the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been at odds at times with Albright. And he is a favorite  
target for Republicans since he's widely viewed as a likely 
secretary of state if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Top Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The raging U.S. economy combined with a heat  
wave blanketing much of the country gave Americans a reason to head 
to the nation's air-conditioned stores and malls in July, boosting 
retail sales to surprisingly strong levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The better-than-expected July sales reported Thursday followed  
big gains in May and June. As a result, Wall Street analysts expect 
to see robust second-quarter profits when retailers begin to report 
earnings next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, rose 
4.5 percent in July. It rose 6.3 percent in June and 5.4 percent in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sales in July were much better than we thought they would  
be,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, managing director at Lehman Brothers 
Inc. ``That shows that the consumer feels good about the economy 
and just keeps buying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers have benefited greatly this year from the resilient  
U.S. economy with low unemployment and tame inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many merchants, however, have been worried that borrowing and  
spending would slow following the Federal Reserve's decision on 
June 30 to boost interest rates as a pre-emptive strike against 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the Fed action has unsettled investors and weighed  
down the stock market -- including retail shares -- consumers so far 
are apparently unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rising in interest rates encouraged the stock market to be  
more cautious,'' said Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst at Bank of 
America Securities in San Francisco. ``But the consumer economy is 
still roaring and we don't see a signals yet that the consumer is 
shying away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts warn that spending could slow if the stock  
market volatility continues and the Fed raises rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no cause for concern now, but if this continues, we  
could have a problem on our hands in the back end of the year'' as 
merchants move into the all-important holiday shopping season, said 
Feiner of Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in July were the discount chains, as shoppers  
turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart for a wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also faring well were specialty clothing chains the Limited and  
Ann Taylor, and Federated Department Stores, which includes the 
Bloomingdale's and Macy's chains. Stores offering consumer 
electronics and jewelry chains also reported strong sales in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Even J.C. Penney, which has been struggling in recent months,  
reported surprising sales gains last month. 
</P>
<P>
	While July is often considered a clearance month, retailers  
didn't have much merchandise to unload this year since sales have 
been strong in recent months. That means that they sold most of 
their summer inventory at full price, which bodes well for 
second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the Limited and a few other retailers have said their  
quarterly profits will top Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	One weak spot in July was the Gap, which is typically one of the  
strongest apparel merchants. Analysts cited a deliberate delay in 
the introduction of fall merchandise and noted that that weakness 
in the Gap chain offseta solid showing from its Banana Republic and 
Old Navy units. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported that sales  
from stores open at least a year rose 9.6 percent compared with 
July 1998, while total sales rose 16.3 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected figures on July's sales at leading retail chains:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears, same-store sales up 0.9 percent, total sales down 3.4  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart, same-store sales up 3.8 percent, total sales up 6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney, same-store department store sales up 4.1 percent;  
same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 8 percent; total sales up 
8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson, same-store sales up 3.3 percent, total sales up  
8.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated, same-store sales up 4.7 percent, total sales up 15.7  
percent. Federated's total sales include revenues from the Internet 
and catalog seller Fingerhut, which was acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores, same-store sales up 1.9 percent, total  
sales up 6.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited, same-store sales up 7 percent, total sales up 7  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap, same-store sales up 2 percent, total sales up 22 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor, same-store sales up 7.2 percent, total sales up  
19.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Americans Abroad on Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department today issued a blanket  
warning to U.S. citizens worldwide against possible terrorist 
action surrounding Saturday's first anniversary of two U.S. Embassy 
bombings in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should keep a low profile, vary routes and times for  
all required travel and treat mail from unfamiliar sources with 
suspicion,'' said the statement, labeled a ``worldwide caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the notice cited the Aug. 7 bombings and U.S. bombing  
raids against terrorist sites 13 days later, it said the public 
announcement was not in response to any particular threat or event 
but to emphasize a continuing concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of State continues to receive reports that  
prompt concern about the safety and security of both official U.S. 
government personnel and private American citizens,'' said the 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	The notice also cited a potential for retaliatory acts against  
U.S. citizens in response to the worldwide pursuit and apprehension 
of alleged associates of Osama bin Laden, who is charged as 
mastermind of the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 
people, including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came a day after officials said U.S. diplomats are  
safer now, even though a majority of embassies remain vulnerable to 
car bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has spent $1.5 billion rebuilding and  
enhancing security at posts around the world since the African 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	With 4,000 additional local guards and more than 200 top  
security personnel added around the world, all diplomats now have 
an adequate ``baseline level of protection,'' said Peter Bergin, 
head of the Diplomatic Security Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bergin and other top officials responsible for  
counterterrorism and diplomatic security acknowledged Wednesday 
that American outposts remain vulnerable. They said only 31 of 270 
embassies and consulates are adequately shielded and set back 
safely from potential car bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are big, big bombs that we're having to counter. It  
makes our job difficult, but it's something that we are attempting 
to, striving to deter,'' Bergin said. ``We've made improvements at 
every single post around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials briefed reporters in the heavily protected State  
Department, which has been ringed by concrete and steel barriers 
since the bombings. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to 
host ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the Aug. 7 embassy 
bombings in the building on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the bombings, department analysts estimate 2,400 threats  
or incidents have been aimed at U.S. interests overseas -- more than 
double the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 70 embassies or consulates have been closed for 24 hours  
or more in response to security concerns or specific threats since 
the bombings, said Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state 
for administration. All except the embassy in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, 
which officials say cannot be defended, were open this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Security experts cite several factors that they believe have  
helped keep terrorists at bay: Last year's U.S. missile assaults 
against camps in Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan, the posting of 
$5 million rewards, a series of charges and arrest of eight bin 
Laden associates, sanctions against countries harboring terrorists 
and a range of ``disruption tactics'' against terrorist groups by 
the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the threats and rising concern for U.S. vulnerability,  
terrorist incidents are on the decline globally and U.S. officials 
agree that state-sponsored terrorism has waned. 
</P>
<P>
	But bin Laden, who denies ordering the African bombings, isn't  
the only perceived threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Followers of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, sentenced to  
death by Turkey, blame his capture partly on help from U.S. 
intelligence. In all, the State Department lists 55 terrorist 
groups around the globe, with 40 percent of incidents last year 
targeting Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	In spreading instances of diplomatic jitters, suspicious  
surveillance of the embassy in Madagascar, a phoned threat in Chad, 
and concern over the vulnerability of other African embassies led 
to closures of at least six missions in the weeks before the 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. consulates in Istanbul and Adana, Turkey, were closed  
temporarily in June after the Ocalan death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Game of Gunplay Leads to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- It started out as a night of youthful bragging  
between two friends to see who was the quicker draw with handguns 
they thought were unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended with one teen dead and the other paralyzed from the  
neck down and charged with reckless homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a prosecutor said paralyzed 17-year-old Eduardo  
Rivera will still be tried, but as a juvenile. He said he would not 
ask for jail time because of the boy's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's very important that Mr. Rivera be held  
accountable for what he did, even if he may not be incarcerated 
because of it,'' prosecutor Steven V. Licata said. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled to continue  
Friday in children's court regarding the death in January of 
15-year-old Efrain Casas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera and Casas had known each other for just two weeks when  
they went back to Casas's house to hang out after school on Jan. 5, 
according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys spent part of the night on the phone with a girl Casas  
was dating, Jacquelyn Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point they opened an unlocked plastic box under the bed  
of Casas's father and pulled out a pair of handguns. One of them 
suggested they see ``who can draw and cock the gun the fastest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacquelyn was on the phone with Casas when she heard him say,  
``Eddie, are you ready?'' and then count ``One, two, three!'' She 
heard a loud gunshot, followed by silence. Minutes later, she heard 
Rivera's faint voice asking her to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking the boys were joking, she hung up.  
</P>
<P>
	When Casas's father returned at 2 a.m. the next morning, he  
heard Rivera in a bedroom calling, ``Hello? Hello?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He found the boy sprawled on the bed, unable to move and his son  
motionless on the floor. The elder Casas immediately called for 
help. His son died later that day at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Licata said one reason he decided to prosecute was Rivera's  
prior conviction for stealing a 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass for a joy 
ride. Rivera received probation, but because the crime would have 
been a felony for an adult, the judge told him he could never again 
possess a firearm under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we focus on Mr. Rivera in his wheelchair, there's a  
woman in the back of the room whose son is dead,'' Licata said. 
``We don't want to forget about her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Shellow, Rivera's attorney, did not return repeated  
messages Thursday from The Associated Press seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Court Weighs Taking on Gay Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, although reluctant to  
tackle disputes over gay rights, will be on familiar legal ground 
if it agrees to judge the Boy Scouts of America's exclusion of 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The court already has staked out its views on private  
organizations that ban women members and on a private sponsor's 
efforts to keep gay groups from marching in the St. Patrick's Day 
Parade in Boston. Together, however, those past decisions do not 
point to an obvious result in the Boy Scouts case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boy Scouts plan to appeal a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling,  
issued Wednesday, that said their exclusion of homosexual boys and 
leaders violates a state law banning discrimination in public 
accommodations. Boy Scouts lawyer George Davidson is confident of 
winning a Supreme Court review -- success achieved by fewer than 100 
of the approximately 7,000 appeals that reach the nation's highest 
court each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the likelihood is statistically low, but I'm confident  
our case has a high probability,'' Davidson said Thursday. ``This 
is an important issue that affects so many American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights lawyer Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and  
Education Fund, the winning lawyer in the New Jersey case, called 
Supreme Court review '' a possibility but by no means a sure 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boy Scouts have three months, until early November, to file  
their appeal. The court likely will not say until early 2000 
whether it will review the case. Review is granted if four of the 
nine justices vote to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal will argue that the New Jersey law violates the Boy  
Scouts' constitutionally protected freedoms of association and 
speech. A major hurdle may be a series of unanimous Supreme Court 
decisions dealing with state public-accommodation laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled in 1984 that states may force the Jaycees, an  
organization dedicated to developing America's future leaders, to 
admit women as full members. Three years later, the court expanded 
on that decision, ruling that states may force Rotary International 
to admit women as members. 
</P>
<P>
	In both, the justices deemed the service groups ``public  
accommodations'' -- not private clubs -- and said they must comply 
with state anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing male-only policies in private clubs in 1988, the  
court said New York City can bar discrimination against women and 
minorities by clubs with more than 400 members. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices noted in that case, however, that some clubs or  
organizations might be able to prove they were organized for 
``specific expressive purposes'' that they would be prevented from 
pursuing ``if they cannot confine ... membership to those who share 
the same sex, for example, or the same religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That notion played a role in the court's unanimous 1995 decision  
that the longtime sponsor of Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade 
never should have been forced to let a group of gays and lesbians 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said Massachusetts courts violated the parade  
sponsor's rights when they invoked the state's public 
accommodations law to force inclusion of a homosexual group in the 
1992 and 1993 parades. Parades, the court said, are ``a form of 
expression'' and their private sponsors cannot be forced ``to 
include among the marchers a group imparting a message the 
organizers do not wish to convey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson said the Boy Scouts' appeal will rely heavily on that  
1995 ruling, arguing that the group's values, which include keeping 
boys ``morally straight,'' would be compromised by opening 
membership to gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said the highest court might reject such an argument  
after concluding, as the New Jersey court did, that the Boy Scouts 
have no stated purpose of opposing homosexuality. ``They don't need 
a First Amendment license to discriminate,'' Wolfson said. ``It's 
not their purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court's most important gay-rights ruling upheld  
Georgia's anti-sodomy law in 1986, and said consenting adults have 
no constitutional right to private homosexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the court in 1996 struck down a Colorado measure it  
said would deny homosexuals constitutional protection from 
discrimination and make them ``unequal to everyone else.'' The 
state constitutional provision banned enactment of laws aimed at 
protecting homosexuals from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Such rulings are rare. The justices repeatedly have turned away  
numerous other gay-rights disputes, including challenges to 
President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	The court last November refused to hear the appeal of a  
California man ousted as a Boy Scouts leader because he is gay, the 
first such case to reach it this decade. It also turned away a 
similar case in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Corn Fall; Cocoa Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Forecasts for rain in the parched Midwest sent soybean futures  
prices plummeting Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while 
corn futures also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork belly futures also dropped and cocoa  
futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures had rallied sharply in the past week  
as hot, dry weather has hurt crops in Illinois and points east. 
</P>
<P>
	But forecasts for rain that could quench thirsty soybean and  
corn crops sent prices falling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a weather market,'' said Don Roose, a grains analyst  
and president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. ``We're trying to 
figure out, 'Does it or doesn't it rain? Will it or won't it be 
hot.''' 
</P>
<P>
	While soybean futures also got pressure from lackluster export  
sales, analysts said corn and soybeans also were down due to 
profit-taking selling as traders cashed in on the big gains of the 
past week amid fears that prices are too high for the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, wheat futures prices were up.  
</P>
<P>
	Roose said traders were, in part, anticipating an increased  
demand for winter wheat since the spring crops were relatively 
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of trading Thursday, wheat for December delivery rose  
1 3/4 cents to $2.94 1/2 a bushel; December corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.35 a 
bushel; December oats fell 3/4 cent to $1.17 1/2 a bushel; and November 
soybeans dropped 14 cents to $4.80 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of pork bellies, or uncured bacon, tumbled on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange in what analysts said was heavy profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the downward trend is likely temporary. They said  
there has been a great deal of movement in the U.S. pork belly 
market -- 5 million pounds last week, compared with half that the 
previous week -- as many grocers begin to offer bacon as a summer 
sale item. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, August pork bellies fell 3 cents to 53.72 a  
pound; August live cattle rose 0.07 cent to 64.42 cents a pound; 
August feeder cattle were up 0.35 cent to 76.42 cents a pound; and 
August lean hogs fell 0.13 cent to 50.32 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, cocoa futures rose on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York on news that Ghana had abruptly stopped selling its 
midyear crop. Analysts said there is speculation that the African 
country may wait until October to continue selling -- though others 
said the selling was halted in an attempt to curb cocoa smuggling 
to the Ivory Coast. September cocoa was up $6 to $988 a ton.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks managed their strongest rally in more  
than a week today as bargain-hunting investors stepped into a 
market driven down by fears of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed up 119.05 at 10,793.82. In morning 
trading, the Dow had fallen 108 points. Broader stock indicators 
were mixed, with any gains hard-fought in a session of rapid shifts 
between positive and negative territory. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
index gained, and the Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with 
technology stocks, eked out its first gain since last Wednesday. 
The Nasdaq composite rose 25.81 to 2,565.81.

	Workers' Productivity Growth Slows  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The productivity of U.S. workers has slowed  
its growth and unit labor costs are up, the Labor Department said 
today. Productivity, the amount of output for each hour worked, 
grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter, 
compared to 3.6 percent growth in the first three months of the 
year. Meanwhile, unit labor costs, considered a key measure of wage 
pressures, surged at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the second 
quarter, the worst showing for this measurement since the end of 
1997. Analysts had expected a rise of around 2.2 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	Retail Sales Top Expectations  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The raging U.S. economy combined with a heat  
wave blanketing much of the country gave Americans a reason to head 
to the nation's air-conditioned stores and malls in July, boosting 
retail sales to surprisingly strong levels. The 
better-than-expected July sales reported today followed big gains 
in May and June. As a result, Wall Street analysts expect to see 
robust second-quarter profits when retailers begin to report 
earnings next week. The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment 
firm's barometer of sales performance at department stores and 
discount chains, rose 4.5 percent in July. It rose 6.3 percent in 
June and 5.4 percent in May.

futures contracts for securities pegged to short-term interest 
rates for both markets on one computer screen, officials for the 
two exchanges said in a joint news conference today with 
participants in Chicago and London. The alliance is set to begin 
early next year and will provide the exchanges' customers access to 
both the Merc's Globex2 and LIFFE's CONNECT electronic trading

	Bear Stearns Settles for $38.5M

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors defrauded by a small brokerage will  
get $30 million from Bear Stearns &AMP; Cos. Inc., a big Wall Street 
firm that processed their transactions. The settlement announced 
today, which totals $38.5 million and was accompanied by the 
resignation of a top Bear Stearns executive, closes a two-year 
investigation by federal and New York City authorities into Bear 
Stearns' relationship with the smaller brokerage, A.R. Baron &AMP; Co. 
Bear Stearns neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in agreeing to 
the settlement. Bear Stearns processed trades, a lucrative 
financial function known as clearing, for A.R. Baron from mid-1995 
through mid-1996. The now-defunct A.R. Baron failed in 1997 and is 
in bankruptcy proceedings. Customers, some of whom have sued, have 
contended they lost a total of $75 million.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration presented a plan  
today to bolster the troubled steel industry against unfair trade 
practices, including a proposal to fight international loans that 
would subsidize imports. Administration officials presented the 
proposals to industry chiefs and labor leaders at a White House 
meeting as Congress sent President Clinton a $1.5 billion loan plan 
aimed in part at helping steel producers. Among the proposals were 
a pledge to block World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans 
that would further subsidize foreign steel industries and ensure 
that the next round of World Trade Organization talks maintains 
strong sanctions against unfair trade.

World War II in an effort to boost sales there. GM, the world's 
largest automaker, sold only about 53,000 cars and trucks in Japan 
last year, a small number in a market where more than 4 million 
vehicles are sold each year. Spokesman Henry Wong said today GM's 
strategy would include ``establishing a manufacturing presence'' in 
Japan, along with building its dealer base, importing models, and 
relying on its ties to Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Suzuki Motor 
Corp. Wong declined to elaborate.

	TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- Taiwan's flagship airline apparently has  
been told by the Taiwanese government to cancel an order for 12 
Boeing 777s in protest against the Clinton administration's 
mainland China policy. Boeing had been expecting the $2 billion 
deal to be formally announced at any time. Taiwan's China Airlines 
signed a letter of intent to buy the jets in 1995. Citing 
congressional and industry sources, the Tacoma News Tribune 
reported today that instead China Airlines is expected to announce 
a major purchase of A-340 planes from the European consortium 
Airbus Industrie, perhaps as early as next week. China Airlines is 
still expected to announce the purchase of 13 Boeing 747s.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Extradition of Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- An elderly Rwandan clergyman accused of  
offering refuge to people in his homeland, then taking part in 
their massacre, must be turned over to a war crimes tribunal, the 
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion released Thursday, the New Orleans-based appeals  
court upheld an earlier ruling by a federal judge stating there is 
probable cause that Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 75, committed genocide 
and crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were lodged against the pastor by the United  
Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The tribunal 
is based in Arusha, Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Ntakirutimana could be sentenced to life in  
prison. He can appeal the appeals court ruling to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Hutu extremists in Rwanda killed more than 500,000  
people, mostly minority Tutsis. Ntakirutimana was pastor of the 
Seventh-day Adventist Church in Mugonero in the Kibuye district of 
the East African country at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses say he urged a large, mostly Tutsi group of men, women  
and children to seek refuge in a church and hospital complex, then 
took part in a daylong gun and machete attack on the Tutsis that 
left hundreds of people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Ntakirutimana then continued the attacks against Tutsis who  
escaped the church massacre, the tribunal indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested in September 1996 in Laredo, where his son  
lives. He moved there legally with a permanent resident visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is no extradition treaty between the United  
States and the tribunal, Congress passed a law in 1996 that allows 
Ntakirutimana's extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark represents  
Ntakirutimana. He argued that the tribunal was formed in violation 
of the U.N. charter, and that evidence was not sufficient to 
warrant the pastor's extradition.

<HEADLINE> FBI Holds Turkish Man in Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Turkish man removed from a flight before it  
left for Istanbul was being held for an expired visa as the FBI 
investigated what it would refer to only as suspicious behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakan Caglar, 35, attracted the suspicion of law enforcement  
officials when he retrieved his luggage from a U-Haul truck on 
Tuesday and paid cash for a one-way ticket to Turkey at a Valdosta 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar, who had been in the United States since March 7, was  
being held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service because 
his visa expired June 6, said Thomas Fisher, district director for 
the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	``He overstayed and that's the primary reason that we are  
holding him right now,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said INS officials are interviewing Caglar about his  
activities in the United States. He said Caglar drove from Florida 
to Valdosta, where he caught a plane to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has not accused Caglar of committing a crime or planning  
to commit one. Agency spokeswoman Celestine Armstead said the fact 
Caglar paid for his ticket with cash was not all that called him to 
the agency's attention, but she would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	All 217 passengers on Delta Air Lines Flight 40 were asked to  
get off the plane at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport on 
Tuesday night for a security sweep that included luggage. Five 
passengers sitting near the man were questioned and released. The 
flight departed more than four hours late. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon the plane's arrival in Istanbul, Turkish authorities  
questioned the same five passengers, along with a child, the 
semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported. The six Turkish 
citizens were released.

<HEADLINE> White House Honors Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two former presidents, Gerald Ford and Jimmy  
Carter, are among 10 prominent Americans who will receive the 
nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
the White House said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, a Republican who was the 38th president, will be  
recognized for ``his honesty and integrity'' and his efforts to 
restore confidence in government after the Watergate scandal led to 
Richard M. Nixon's resignation, a tribute from the White House 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford and seven others will get their awards Wednesday at the  
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a Democrat who was the 39th president, will be  
recognized for brokering the Camp David peace accords, signing the 
Panama Canal treaty and re-establishing normal diplomatic relations 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter will be honored Monday at a ceremony in Atlanta at the  
Carter Center. His wife Rosalynn, with whom he works on low-income 
housing issues and other humanitarian causes, will receive her own 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a statesman, President Carter has been a successful

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Knocks Clinton-Gore Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bill Bradley took aim today at the Clinton-Gore  
administration, telling black activists generally loyal to the 
current White House that poor children have suffered its 
inattention. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first two-term Democratic president since Franklin  
Roosevelt the number of children in poverty in America has barely 
blipped down,'' said Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator, Vice President Al Gore's only  
competition for the Democratic presidential nomination, spoke to 
the annual convention of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition 
where President Clinton is popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Bradley sought to draw sharp distinctions between his  
vision and the Clinton-Gore administration's record, he saluted 
Clinton for addressing race issues with a genuine commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he is basing his presidential campaign on a theme  
of racial unity and, as president, would like to build a 
multiracial coalition -- similar to the force that first established 
civil rights -- to tackle economic disparities, poverty and health 
care reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm staking my presidential campaign on the belief that over  
50 to 60 percent of Americans, including white Americans, want to 
have racial unity,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he did not expect an immediate endorsement from  
Jackson, who called this stage of the presidential campaign ``the 
exhibition season.'' Gore is scheduled to address the convention 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates are tailoring appeals to Jackson and his army of  
grass-roots Democratic mobilizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the vice president said he would make the end of  
racial profiling ``the first civil rights act of the new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Bradley countered: ``I say, why wait? Why doesn't he walk  
down the hall, put the executive order in front of the president 
and ask him to sign it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minority advocates say racial profiling, the police practice of  
singling out minorities for questioning at airports, on highways 
and on streets, is racial harassment that can be fatal, such as in 
the killings of young blacks by police in New York, Pittsburgh and 
Riverside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Clinton ordered federal officers -- only a fraction  
of the nation's police -- to collect data on the race and gender of 
those they arrest and then develop a plan to stop racial profiling.

<HEADLINE> Coors Can't Use NFL Trademark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Coors Brewing Co. cannot use the NFL trademark  
in its new beer promotion, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal judge Denise L. Cote granted a temporary injunction  
Wednesday preventing the NFL Players Association from launching a 
nationwide campaign that identifies Coors as ``the official beer of 
NFL players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players Inc., the licensing arm of the union, entered into a  
deal with Coors which the league opposed as trademark infringement. 
NFL attorneys also said the promotion was inherently false because 
active players cannot promote alcohol products amd the players 
association does not represent every player. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said it would appeal the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``We respectfully disagree with Judge Cote's decision to grant  
preliminary relief in this case,'' said Gene Upshaw, executive 
director of the union, and chairman of Players Inc. ``We will 
appeal her decision, which we believe is misguided, misinterprets 
the facts and misapplies the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Gertzog, NFL senior vice president of business affairs and  
general counsel, said the injunction proves the NFL has sole rights 
to its trademark. Gertzog said the league would not have objected 
if the promotion had used the phrase ``Official Beer of Players, 
Inc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coors spokesman Dave Taylor said Coors still plans to launch the  
promotion in mid-August as planned and run it through the Labor Day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Allen, assistant executive director of the union, said  
certain elements of the words would be changed on certain of the 
pieces but that the promotion would go forth as would the appeal. 
``This is far from over,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Coors competitors, Miller Brewing and Anheuser-Busch, are  
NFL beer sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL and NFL Properties are seeking to make the injunction  
permanent. A date for a trial on that request will be set in a 
hearing in New York on Aug. 18, Gertzog said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Industrials Now Have Vacancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Speculation has begun on who will fill a vacancy  
in one of the world's most exclusive clubs -- the 30 stocks that 
make up the Dow Jones industrial average -- following the 
acquisition of Union Carbide Corp. by Dow Chemical Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The $9.3 billion deal announced Wednesday would create the  
world's second-largest chemical business behind DuPont Co. and a 
lucrative opening in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Inclusion in Wall Street's best-known indicator establishes a  
company as a leader in its own industry and in the economy at 
large. And investment funds tied to the Dow index performance are 
bound by their charter to buy shares of the components. 
</P>
<P>
	A listing in the Dow industrials can spark demand for the  
shares, making it easier to buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors will therefore try to guess which company The Wall  
Street Journal, the Dow Jones &AMP; Co. unit that publishes the index, 
will choose. 
</P>
<P>
	An obvious candidate would be Dow Chemical, which is not related  
to Dow Jones &AMP; Co. Replacing Union Carbide with Dow Chemical would 
maintain a presence for the chemical industry in the Dow index, 
which attempts to approximate the mix of industries in the economy 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
	There is precedent for replacing an acquired Dow component with  
the merged company, as was done when Travelers Group bought 
Citicorp. The combined company, Citigroup, took Travelers place in 
the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dow Jones industrial average has come under fire over  
the years for failing to accurately reflect the transition in the 
U.S. economy from industrial to service to technology. And so some 
market analysts were asking Wednesday whether the Journal might use 
this as an opportunity to add an up-and-coming technology company, 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were doing it, I would want to reflect less the  
manufacturing, industrial element, and more some of the newer 
companies, the more technologically oriented companies,'' said 
William Freund, director of the Pace University Center for the 
Study of Equity Markets. ``Pulling a name out of the air, I would 
suggest a Lucent Technologies, which is a big, well-established 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market historian Yale Hirsch, who also favors the larger  
technology companies, suggested Microsoft, Intel or Cisco. Although 
all of the Dow industrial components have been names that trade on 
the New York Stock Exchange, there is nothing to prevent the 
addition of a stock that trades in the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	John Prestbo, markets editor at the Wall Street Journal,  
suggested that all of the average's component stocks components 
could come under scrutiny as the keepers of the Dow consider a 
replacement for Union Carbide. 
</P>
<P>
	``A potential change caused by an external event is always an  
occasion to review the Dow,'' Prestbo said in an interview reported 
on Dow Jones Newswires. ``Adding a big technology company would be 
a possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A change in the Dow isn't expected overnight.  
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Union Carbide still faces a shareholders'  
vote and government review in the United States and Europe. It is 
not expected to be completed until next year.

<HEADLINE> Fox Signs Contract With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Rick Fox signed a multi-year contract  
with the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, becoming the second free 
agent this week to decide to remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	No terms were announced, but it was believed Fox agreed to a  
six-year deal worth around $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Fox averaged 9.0 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.2  
assists in 44 games for the Lakers last season, his second with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox played the previous six years with the Boston Celtics, who  
selected him 24th overall in the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made it clear the past two years how much I've wanted to  
be a part of the Lakers, and for them to make this long-term 
commitment to me is very gratifying,'' Fox said in a statement 
issued by the team. ``Both the Lakers and I are making commitments 
with one goal in mind -- to win championships. We have a lot of 
exciting things happening, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls to six championships  
in the 1990s, was hired as coach of the Lakers in June. Point guard 
Derek Fisher signed a long-term deal to remain with the team on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick is a very talented and also a very versatile player,''  
Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``Whether as a starter 
or a key player off the bench, he can help us in many different 
ways, whether it be his shooting, defense or rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox was a starter in his first season with the team and a  
reserve in his second. He earned $1.75 million last season and $1 
million in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick has also made sacrifices the past couple of years to be  
with the Lakers,'' Kupchak said. ``We appreciate that, and are very 
happy to be able to sign him to this long-term contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, 30, has career averages of 10.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and  
2.8 assists.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Goes to Phoenix Suns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway got what he wanted Thursday and  
was traded to the Phoenix Suns, ending his fading star career in 
Orlando and completing the breakup of a Magic team that went to the 
NBA Finals just four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After a final day of reconsidering their options and trying to  
talk Hardaway into staying, the Magic finally made the trade and 
acquired Danny Manning, Pat Garrity and two first-round draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, who will be paid $86 million over the next seven  
years, joins Jason Kidd in what could be one of the most formidable 
backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Danny Ainge called Hardaway ``the most skilled all-around  
player in the game. All of a sudden I really believe this puts us 
as one of the elite teams in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a major coup for the Suns, who had no room under the  
salary cap to go after free agents, let alone one the stature of 
Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic tried to work out a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers,  
Toronto Raptors and a few other teams, but all dropped out of the 
bidding by the middle of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Magic, it marked the end of an era. Just a few years  
ago, the team looked like it would be an enduring Eastern 
Conference powerhouse when its roster included Hardaway and 
Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Magic will plunge into a massive rebuilding without  
a single star left. The Magic have 10 first-round draft picks over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the goal for the franchise is to win a world  
championship, even though this might not happen next year,'' 
general manager John Gabriel said. ``The trade of Penny Hardaway 
sets us for the launch of a new era and a new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's the best thing for (Penny) to get a fresh  
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing against Orlando. I came to Phoenix and fell in  
love with Phoenix,'' Hardaway said Thursday night. ``I thank the 
Magic for going through with the deal because they didn't have to. 
They saw the same thing I saw; it's time for me to just move on and 
start a new career. I wanted to do it here in Phoenix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had made it clear to the Suns that they were his first  
choice, and when Phoenix agreed to pay him the maximum allowable 
under the collective bargaining agreement it was only a matter of 
getting Orlando to agree to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ``ranks right up there with any acquisition we've ever  
made. He's a marquee guy,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway opted out of the final three years of his contract and  
became a free agent this summer, but only Chicago, the Los Angeles 
Clippers and Toronto had anywhere near the money available to land 
him. He made it clear to Magic officials over the past few days 
that he did not want to return as Orlando -- especially new coach 
Doc Rivers -- tried in vain to get him to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was drafted by Golden State as the third pick overall  
in 1993, then was traded to Orlando, which had drafted O'Neal the 
previous year. Hardaway and O'Neal almost instantly made the Magic 
a title contender. By their second season together, 1994-95, the 
Magic made it to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the 
Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal left for Los Angeles in 1996, and Hardaway's image as one  
of the NBA's rising superstars took a beating in the ensuing years 
as he orchestrated the departure of coach Brian Hill and then sat 
out most of the 1997-98 season but still played in the All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had an uneven relationship with Magic coach Chuck Daly,  
who resigned after the 1999 season, and trade talk began as early 
as February of 1998, when he nearly was dealt to the New Jersey 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Magic were ousted by the 76ers and Hardaway complained  
about having to defend the speedy Allen Iverson, owner Rich DeVos 
made it clear that Hardaway's days in Orlando were numbered by 
saying maybe the Magic didn't need any more superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking forward to a new era of Magic basketball,''  
Gabriel said, ``one we believe will be extremely exciting with the 
young talent we have and will assemble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic have traded three starters this offseason, also  
sending Horace Grant to Seattle and Nick Anderson to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway averaged 19 points in his six seasons in Orlando, but  
nagging injuries severely cut into his playing time the last three 
seasons. Last season, he averaged a career-low 15.8 points per 
game. He averaged 19 in the playoffs, but shot just 35 percent from 
the field as Orlando was beaten by Philadelphia in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he is considered one of the top shooting guards in the  
game, and his 6-foot-7 height will be invaluable to a Suns team 
that was often overmatched with Rex Chapman at that position. 
Hardaway also could form a spectacular fast-break combination with 
Kidd, arguably the best point guard in the NBA at pushing the ball 
up the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, 33, is the only NBA player to come back from three  
major knee surgeries. He won the NBA Sixth Man award in 1998, just 
before he went down with his third major knee injury. He came back 
last season to average 9.1 points and 4.4 rebounds off the bench 
for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, the college player of the year when he led Kansas to  
the NCAA championship in 1988, has averaged of 16.6 points per game 
in 11 NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrity, from Notre Dame, averaged 5.6 points as a rookie last  
season. He has been the property of four teams in his brief 
professional career. He was drafted by Milwaukee, then traded to 
Dallas, which dealt him to Phoenix before he'd ever played a game.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Has Jewish Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like any candidate in a statewide race in New  
York, Hillary Rodham Clinton is courting Jewish voters in her bid 
for a seat in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And it turns out, her campaign says, that the Methodist Mrs.  
Clinton has Jewish members on her family tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate  
exploratory committee, said Thursday that the first lady ``has very 
fond childhood memories'' of the second husband of her grandmother, 
Max Rosenberg, a Russian-born Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said he doesn't ``expect it will have an electoral  
impact, and we don't see it in that context.'' But with Jews 
accounting for one of every eight votes in New York state in the 
last general election, it couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's maternal grandmother, Della, married Rosenberg in  
1933, seven years after she and Mrs. Clinton's grandfather, Edwin 
Howell, divorced, according to a weekly Jewish newspaper, the 
Forward. 
</P>
<P>
	They had filed a petition for Max to adopt Della's other  
children, including Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy, but the attempt 
failed. Max Rosenberg died in Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton angered potential Jewish voters last year by  
voicing support for a Palestinian state, but has recently told 
Jewish leaders she considers Jerusalem ``the eternal and 
indivisible capital'' of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	She has also said she favors moving the U.S. Embassy for Israel  
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The United States has never recognized 
Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

<HEADLINE> House Forces Action on Airport Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impatient with Senate delays, leading House  
lawmakers on transportation issues used an unusual parliamentary 
tactic Thursday to force action on legislation to boost spending 
for airport operations and improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the House requested the Senate to agree to a  
conference on Federal Aviation Administration authorization 
legislation that has passed the House but has not yet reached the 
Senate floor. The motion was made by House Transportation Committee 
Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Conferences normally are held only after a bill is passed by  
both houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed legislation in June that would direct $56  
billion over five years to operate the FAA and improve airport and 
air traffic control facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contains language opposed by the Clinton administration  
that would wall off funds in the Aviation Trust Fund, barring use 
of the money for non-aviation purposes. The trust fund takes in 
about $10 billion a year in airport user fees, more than is spent 
on airport projects. The excess spills over into the general budget 
and adds to the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Commerce Committee chaired by Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., approved an FAA bill last February that, like the House 
bill, takes steps to increase service to smaller markets, but does 
not wall off the trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill, however, has never reached the Senate floor,  
partly because several senators oppose provisions that would 
increase flights out of New York, Chicago and Washington airports. 
McCain's bill also would grant exemptions to the 1,250-mile limit 
on flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster sought to sidestep the Senate stalemate by calling up a  
Senate-passed bill that extends FAA programs for two months while 
Congress works on a more permanent bill and amending it to insert 
his five-year plan. He then offered a motion to hold a House-Senate 
conference to come up with a final bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorization for the Airport Improvement Program expired  
Thursday with the House's decision not to agree to the two-month 
extension passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brenner, a spokesman for Shuster, said some $290 million  
in funding would be frozen, but that money for most airport 
construction projects had already been distributed and the 
consequences would be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's press secretary, Pia Pialorsi, said McCain would  
welcome the conference as an opportunity to get all the issues on 
the table. Congress begins its August vacation Friday and any 
formal action could happen only when they return after Labor Day.

<HEADLINE> Geiberger Hangs Onto Momentum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- Brent Geiberger, riding the momentum  
of his first PGA Tour victory, shot a 7-under-par 65 Thursday to 
take the first-round lead in the Buick Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Kite came back from the land of golf's near-dead to post one  
of his best rounds in a dismal year, a 66 that left him a stroke 
off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiberger, whose father, Al, was the first tour player to shoot  
59 in a tournament round, said he's just trying to keep a level 
head. Given his first victory -- and a recent spate of dizzy spells 
-- that's proving difficult to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty calm and confident out there,'' Geiberger said,  
despite occasional dizziness stemming from a nerve problem in his 
left ear. ``I can be standing there and feel like I'm moving. It's 
pretty tough to putt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't so tough that Geiberger couldn't run in seven birdie  
putts, the longest from 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft greens and a course layout that includes four par-5s and  
two par-4s under 350 yards led to plenty of sub-70 scores. Ted 
Tryba racked up six birdies, an eagle, a par and a bogey on the 
back nine for a 29, tying the tournament record for lowest 9-hole 
score at the 7,105-yard Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club outside 
of Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Tryba attributed his scoring to the rub-off effect from playing  
partners who were also scoring. In Tryba's trio, Phil Blackmar shot 
67 and Chris Perry shot 69. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all playing real nice,'' Tryba said. ``We were all  
seeing putts go into the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it was a day for the walking wounded to play well. Tryba  
is recovering from having separated two ribs from his sternum when 
he tried to lift something heavy while working on his dock at his 
home in Orlando, Fla. His advice: ``Pay someone else to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kite has been suffering injuries to the ego in the past few  
years. His last victory came in 1993 when he won the Los Angeles 
Open. In 1998 he was unable to gain a top-10 finish for the first 
time in his 26-year career. This year the slide continued as Kite 
missed eight cuts in his first nine tournaments, with only one 
round in the 60s. The dismal play continued until Kite had finally 
had enough and took three weeks off in midseason. He made his 
return last week at Hartford and was 17th, his best finish of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played so poorly the last year and a half. It's been such  
a struggle,'' Kite said. ``I'm just trying to piece together some 
sort of golf game that would allow me to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slump has been the only one of serious magnitude of Kite's  
career. He said factors include the death of teacher and mentor 
Harvey Penick in 1995 and the time and energy he put into his 
captaincy of the 1997 Ryder Cup team, as well as the letdown that 
followed after the team's defeat by the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday there were flashes of the Kite of old as he  
methodically hit one fairway and green after another and took 
advantage of the chances his accurate iron play gave him. His seven 
birdies and one bogey were highlighted by four iron shots inside 
six feet, including a sand wedge from the fairway -- a shot that 
made Kite one of the most dangerous players on tour for years -- to 
within a yard of the cup on the par-5 opening hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen players were bunched within three shots of Geiberger,  
the sole leader. They included Tom Lehman and Bob Tway at 5-under 
and Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Fred Funk in a large group at 
4-under. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Booker, former teaching pro at Warwick Hills, used his  
course knowledge in shooting a 68. Last year the virtual unknown on 
the tour finished tied for fourth in the Buick. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia, the 19-year-old Spaniard, shot a disappointing  
73.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Says He Hasn't Taken Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire is hitting home runs in bunches  
again, and without androstenedione giving him a controversial 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before he hit career home run No. 499 and his 42nd of the  
season to tie Sammy Sosa for the major league lead, the St. Louis 
Cardinals' slugger disclosed Wednesday that he hasn't taken the 
over-the-counter dietary supplement for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire revealed his decision about a year after his use of  
andro became public. That disclosure prompted widespread criticism 
and some speculation that his 70-homer season was tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's reasoning: He did it for the kids.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought long and hard about it and I don't like the way it  
was portrayed like I was the endorser of the product, which I 
wasn't,'' McGwire said. ``I don't like how it's portrayed, but 
young kids take it because of me. I don't like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire knows he's a role model, and that was perhaps the  
biggest reason for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discourage young people from taking it,'' he said. ``If  
you're old enough and you have your own mind, you can do whatever 
you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman praised McGwire's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mark's focus is on contributions to society,'' Coleman said.  
``He leads by example. The youth of the world are well served by 
Mark's value structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, McGwire refused to address the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not talk about that,'' he said. ``Come on, I said what I  
said before the game and that's all I'm going to comment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa and teammates felt a sense of validation  
to McGwire's 42 homers this season and to his 70-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is such a ridiculous part of the McGwire story,'' La  
Russa said angrily. ``He's at 499 and what's andro do with it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Injured outfielder Eric Davis said McGwire's performance should  
quiet the critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know too much about it, but if he says he's off it and  
he's got 42 homers, what's that say?'' Davis said. ``He hit 49 his 
rookie year, when testosterone probably wasn't even available. Give 
the man a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres didn't want to touch the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any reaction,'' manager Bruce Bochy said.  
``That's his personal business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closer Trevor Hoffman said he didn't know anything about the  
subject, and outfielder John Vander Wal said simply: ``It's up to 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione is metabolized into testosterone, which is  
considered a steroid. It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the 
NFL, and the men's and women's tennis tours, though it is permitted 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's admission that he used andro sparked a tenfold  
increase in sales of the supplement last fall, much of it through 
the Internet, and led many steroid experts to warn of serious 
health consequences for teen-agers who take it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has commissioned a study of andro by  
Harvard scientists. No decision is expected until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in process. They're working on it,'' commissioner Bud  
Selig said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, McGwire acknowledged to The Associated Press that  
he had used andro for more than a year. Colorado's Dante Bichette 
was among a group of other players who said they took it. 
</P>
<P>
	As spring training opened this year, McGwire said andro was  
legal and that it had ``absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said then he took it to get through late-season workouts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't endorse the product and I never did,'' he said then.  
``Someone stuck their nose in my locker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's recent statistics appear to show that he's fine  
without andro. Including Wednesday's shot, he has homered 15 times 
in 20 games.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Filed Via Internet in Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado has signed an agreement that could make  
it the first state in the nation to let lawyers file lawsuits over 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The state signed a deal with a Texas company, JusticeLink, last  
week to phase in electronic filing in district courts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say that by the end of next year, if all goes well,  
lawyers will be able to push a button on their computer terminals 
to make filings from their offices, while judges will have the 
option of e-mailing orders and decisions instantaneously from their 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be frank, it's an experimental system that is not working  
anywhere in the country,'' said Bob Roper, director of integrated 
information services for the Colorado Judicial Department. ``We're 
kind of pioneering with the vendor on this one. We'll see how it 
goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic filing is available in some counties across the  
country, but not in any entire state, Roper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary system will start in November in Arapahoe County  
District Court, Denver Probate Court and the Water Court in 
Greeley, he said. The system will expand county by county, with a 
statewide system in place by December 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the system, attorneys can sign up with JusticeLink and pay  
10 cents a page to make filings over the Internet, said Henry 
Givray, president of JusticeLink. The company will process the 
filing, then notify the courthouse in Colorado through the 
Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roper said the court clerk then reviews the filing and pushes a  
button to accept it, and the system automatically assigns it a case 
number and a judge. Judges, in turn, can read the files over the 
Internet and even e-mail decisions to attorneys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has tested a similar system in Arapahoe County for the  
past nine months. Lawyers and judges embraced it, said Arapahoe 
County court administrator Greg Langham. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least the first year, the courts will make paper copies  
of files for judges, attorneys and the public, Roper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize this is going to be a pretty significant business  
change for everybody,'' he said. ``We're not going to force it on 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state has not decided how the public will have access to  
filings. The state may make files available on the Internet with or 
without a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Givray said counties using the system have placed computer  
terminals in courthouses for the public. The system comes at no 
cost to the state because the company keeps the per-page filing 
fee, he said.

<HEADLINE> Marines Probe Racial Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine Corps is investigating alleged  
racial hostility at a Marine-supported youth camp after a 
13-year-old black boy said a slur was written in his locker and his 
room was ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked,'' Mike Kessler, incoming director of the Young  
Marines camp, said Thursday. ``I was angered and embarrassed all at 
the same time. These poor kids didn't deserve this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The base said it learned of the incident when The Washington  
Post reported it Thursday and an investigation is underway. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident happened at Camp Lejeune, a Marines basic training  
camp where an encampment was held last month for members of Young 
Marines, a Marine-supported group of youngsters with units across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of children attended a Young Marines summer session  
from July 18-24. They slept in reserve barracks, ran the obstacle 
course and were shown displays of military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The racial epithet was written in toothpaste inside the locker  
of the camper, who is from the Washington, D.C., area, officials 
said. A photograph was torn up and the room he shared with three 
other black campers was ransacked twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Marines said it had sent one camper home last month for  
uttering a racial epithet. The same youth is now suspected of 
writing on the locker and being part of a group believed to have 
trashed the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard McFerson, commander of the Nation's Capitol Young  
Marines, a unit based in Washington, D.C., told the newspaper he 
never will return to Camp Lejeune. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to get (youths) out of the city and show them something  
different, and if that's what they're going to see, I might as well 
let them run around the street and be gang members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The youth group said it will add racial sensitivity sessions to  
training classes for adult leaders.

<HEADLINE> Murrah Plaza Reopens in Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The plaza adjacent to where the Alfred P.  
Murrah Federal Building once stood reopened quietly today, a serene 
space for workers and visitors to stop amid the sounds of a 
cascading fountain and reflect on their memories. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaza used to be a perfect lunchtime hangout, with workers  
eating from brown bags in the midday sun. That was before April 19, 
1995, when a bomb ripped apart the building, killing 168 people and 
injuring hundreds of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The restoration by the General Services Administration is  
respectful of the plaza's place in history, remembered as a staging 
area and triage center for the rescue effort that terrible day, but 
also as a popular spot for employee gatherings in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	Now sounds of water cascading over a semi-cylindrical Carnelian  
granite fountain will soothe workers taking a break or visitors 
observing progress of building the Oklahoma City National Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some of us there's bad memories here, but it's a lot nicer  
now,'' said John Cresswell, who was a GSA maintenance mechanic at 
the Murrah building. He was at the plaza this morning to check it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's beautiful. It adds to the healing process,'' said  
GSA employee Ron Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Another GSA worker, Robert Breaux, said he hoped coins tossed in  
the fountain would go toward the bombing memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most peaceful thing I've ever seen in an urban  
area,'' George Hozendorf, special assistant to the regional 
administrator of the GSA, said Wednesday. ``Just so calming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elevated plaza is located over the garage immediately south  
of where the federal building once stood. There are native trees 
and plants in 47 planters, selected to closely match the original 
1977 landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really nice. I loved it. I appreciated that they tried to  
put back the original,'' said Jim Denny, father of survivors 
Brandon and Rebecca, who were in the building's day-care center the 
day of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The project also has interpretive signs referring to different  
reference points and three new flagpoles put up in partnership with 
the national memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who planned to return is bombing survivor Paul  
Heath, a psychologist in the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful step forward,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not being able to bring someone back doesn't rob you from  
having the opportunity of experiencing the positive memory of those 
people when you walk around on the plaza,'' Heath said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Sues Con-Agra Over Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- The nation's largest poultry producer  
Thursday sued one of its competitors, claiming Con-Agra, Inc., has 
made a concerted effort to raid Tyson Foods of key personnel to 
obtain trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in Washington County Circuit Court here  
against Con-Agra, based in Omaha, Neb., and four former Tyson 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit says the former employees cannot perform their jobs at  
Con-Agra without the disclosure of trade secrets. The suit asks for 
a preliminary injunction to prevent the inevitable release of such 
information, 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, the four employees -- including three  
senior vice presidents -- left Tyson between May 28 and July 30 and 
immediately went to work for Con-Agra. The suit said each possesses 
confidential information that constitutes trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson said it will suffer irreparable harm unless a preliminary  
injunction is granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Con-Agra spokesman Scott Deitz said Thursday evening that the  
company had not been served notice of the lawsuit and could not 
comment.

<HEADLINE> Turk Detained in Atlanta Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A man who was yanked off a plane and detained for  
an expired visa was released Thursday after an FBI investigation 
failed to yield criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakan Caglar, 35, drew the suspicion of authorities Tuesday at  
the Valdosta airport after he retrieved his luggage from a U-Haul 
truck and paid cash for a one-way ticket to Istanbul, with a change 
of planes in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said at the time they received a tip that Caglar was ``a  
potential threat to national security.'' All 217 passengers on the 
flight were taken off the plane for a security check and five 
seated near Caglar were questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar was never charged with a crime and FBI spokeswoman  
Celestine Armstead refused Thursday to say what agents suspected he 
might have done. 
</P>
<P>
	``No federal charges are going to be filed,'' Ms. Armstead said.  
``We're not embarassed at all. We stand firmly behind what we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar, who had been in the United States since March 7, was  
detained until Thursday by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service because his visa expired June 6.

<HEADLINE> Hollinquest To Miss Four Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers linebacker Lamont  
Hollinquest will miss the team's first four games this season for 
violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy, a newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Press-Gazette said Hollinquest, who was signed by  
the Packers on Tuesday after having been waived by the Kansas City 
Chiefs, would not identify the substance for which he tested 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	But it said he confirmed he tested positive twice over a short  
span of time this spring, prompting the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``People make mistakes,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	When a player tests positive and enters the NFL's  
substance-abuse program, the team is not involved in his mandatory 
evaluation and treatment. That program is run directly by the NFL, 
as spelled out in the collective-bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollinquest said the Chiefs asked him to take additional  
treatment steps beyond the NFL's program, but he declined, in part 
on advice from the NFL, the Press-Gazette said. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the Packers the last three years. But he signed a  
two-year contract with Kansas City during the offseason and said he 
was disappointed the Chiefs did not stick with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you tell a guy, `We're not going to back you up because you  
made a mistake?' '' Hollinquest told the Press-Gazette. ``Or are 
you going to say, `Let's fix this problem, do what you have to do, 
then come back and we accept you.' That's not what we got with 
them.''

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Former Cincinnati Reds third baseman Buddy  
Bell was promoted to director of player development today. 
</P>
<P>
	The job opened up when Muzzy Jackson resigned to become an

<P>
	Bell rejoined the Reds last September as minor league field  
coordinator after three seasons managing the Detroit Tigers. He 
recently managed the United States to the silver medal in the Pan 
Am Games, earning a berth in next year's Olympic baseball 
tournament.

<HEADLINE> Atomic Museum Defends Bomb Earrings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Tiny silver replicas of the first  
atomic bombs that are being sold as earrings at the National Atomic 
Museum are stirring emotions in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very angry,'' said Naomi Kishimoto of the anti-nuclear  
group Gensuikyo in Hiroshima, one of the two Japanese cities hit 
with atomic bombs in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the sort of thing you should be hanging from your  
ears or using to decorate your desk,'' he said. ``It's unforgivable 
that (the) museum would sell through the Internet something that 
praises the unit that dropped the atomic bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Gensuikyo found the earrings and other items,  
including medallions that commemorate the bombing missions over 
Japan, on the museum's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The earrings are shaped like the ``Little Boy'' and ``Fat Man''  
atomic bombs developed during the war at Los Alamos under the 
Manhattan Project north of Albuquerque. They sell for $20 a pair at 
the Energy Department museum on Kirtland Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb dubbed ``Little Boy'' was dropped on Hiroshima on Aug.  
6, 1945. Nagasaki was leveled by Fat Man three days later. As many 
as 175,000 people were killed in the two attacks. The Japanese 
surrendered five days after the second bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Jim Walther said Thursday the museum does not  
plan to stop selling the earrings. He said items sold in the museum 
store reflect history and present the work of dedicated scientists 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This museum does not advocate war or the use of nuclear  
weapons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum store manager Tony Sparks said the shop advances the  
argument that the bombings saved the lives of U.S. troops as well 
as pointing out the immorality of war. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to a book with black and white photos of vast areas  
in the Japanese cities where buildings were flattened, but 
acknowledged that the earrings, especially a matched set with one 
of each bomb, are the most popular item in the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware that it's sensitive,'' Sparks said. ``We have such  
a high contingency of Japanese visitors, most of whom are 
interested in hearing our side. We are careful not to glorify it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors on Thursday had a wide range of reactions.  
</P>
<P>
	Lois Dove of South Fork, Colo., said she didn't blame the  
Japanese for objecting to the earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate,'' Dove said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ben Parks of Amarillo, Texas, said he understands the Japanese  
reaction, but thinks the earrings should stay on the shelf since 
the bombs ended the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes back to a few people -- their military leaders. The  
population of Japan didn't have input into what was going on. There 
were innocent casualties and victims,'' Parks said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Temple extended the contract of basketball  
coach John Chaney through the 2002 season, the school announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Chaney exhibits both on and off the court the ideals of  
Temple University. As a great teacher and someone with 
unquestionable character, he is an inspirational leader for our 
student-athletes and sports fans across the country,'' Temple 
athletic director Dave O'Brien said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney, who has coached at Temple since 1982, has a 380-160  
record with the Owls, the best in the school's history. Overall, 
Chaney has a 605-219 record in 27 years of college coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Chaney led the Owls to a 24-11 record, the Atlantic  
10 East Division championship and a trip to the NCAA tournament.

	House Voting on Tax Compromise Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The house is set to vote today on the  
Republican plan for a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut in defiance of 
repeated veto threats from President Clinton. The Senate is 
expected to follow later in the day or tomorrow. GOP leaders will 
not send the bill to the White House until September, hoping to 
build public support during the August recess. Clinton and most 
Democrats on Capitol Hill prefer that projected budget surpluses be 
used to first safeguard Social Security and Medicare.

	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Reinforcements are being sent from around the  
West today to help fight dozens of lightning-sparked fires that 
have burned more than 300 square miles of northern Nevada range 
land. The fires had charred an estimated 200,000 acres by early 
today, threatening ranches and forcing closures along Interstate 
80. Early this morning, a 10-mile stretch of the I-80 between 
Argenta and Battle Mountain was closed for several hours as flames 
came within a quarter mile of the highway.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- In a dramatic step in their 15-year war,  
Kurdish rebels agreed today to heed the call of their imprisoned 
leader to lay down their arms and withdraw to bases outside Turkey. 
Abdullah Ocalan, who was sentenced to death in June, urged his 
followers on Tuesday to give up the armed struggle and pull out of 
southeast Turkey by Sept. 1. ``Our party openly declares its full 
compliance with comrade president Ocalan's call,'' the rebel group 
said in a statement. Earlier, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said his 
government will not ``bargain'' over the Kurdish question.

be able to travel to Cairo for the Wednesday meeting, group

If Serbia rejects a draft proposal for sweeping changes, Montenegro

said. The proposal would change the name of Yugoslavia to the 
``Association of Montenegro and Serbia,'' abolish the current 
constitution and introduce separate army commands.

	TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- Taiwan's flagship airline reportedly has  
been told by the Taiwanese government to cancel an order for 12 
Boeing 777s in protest of the Clinton administration's mainland 
China policy. Boeing had been expecting the $2 billion deal to be 
formally announced at any time. Taiwan's China Airlines signed a 
letter of intent to buy the jets in 1995. Citing industry and 
congressional sources, the Tacoma News Tribune reported today that 
China Airlines is expected to announce a major purchase of A-340 
planes from the European consortium Airbus Industrie.

canonize Mother Teresa, a news agency reported. Giriraj Kishore, of 
the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, said that the 
Vatican's intention in rushing the canonization is to encourage 
Christian missionary activity in India, Mother Teresa's adopted 
home, the Press Trust of India reported. The Hindu Council has led 
a campaign against missionaries, who it argues are forcing poor 
Indians to convert.

The Green Bay Press-Gazette said Hollinquest, who was signed by the 
Packers on Tuesday after having been waived by the Kansas City 
Chiefs, would not identify the substance for which he tested 
positive. But it said he confirmed he tested positive twice over a 
short span of time this spring, prompting the suspension.

Hardscrabble Country Club did not do enough damage to cause a delay

mid-October. The Oct. 11-17 date would have attracted a great deal 
of attention because that is one week before the top 50 money 
winners get together for the Nike Tour Championship. After that 
tournament, the top 15 money winners get PGA tour cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosey said that PGA officials decided Wednesday that the  
Hardscrabble greens were acceptable for tournament play. He had 
said earlier that the greens had been hurt by recent hot weather 
and a watering system with too much silt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get all of our suppliers lined back up because  
we had put everything on hold,'' Gosey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosey said tour agronomist Tom Brown visited Hardscrabble last  
week and recommended the event be postponed. Gosey said he received 
a call Monday from Dale Antram of the PGA who said players at the 
Nike event in Omaha, Neb., would be advised of the move to October. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosey said members of the Hardscrabble Board of Directors and  
several major sponsors met Wednesday to discuss the possible 
postponement. He said he was amazed when Antram and Brown said the 
greens ``had suddenly become playable and the prime consideration 
was now the Golf Channel schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no explanation of what transpired among the PGA  
officials between my Monday telephone conversation with Mr. Antram 
and the Wednesday meeting at the Hardscrabble Country Club,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked the various sponsors and others and said officials  
would proceed with the same enthusiasm and vigor as they did last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosey said Tuesday that the Nike Tour is talking about the  
possibility of geographical realignment and that tournaments in 
this area of the country would either be earlier in the year or in 
the fall to avoid the heat and humidity.

<HEADLINE> Iowa's Hill Suspended for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Kahlil Hill, Iowa's leading receiver and  
kickoff return specialist, has been suspended for the 1999-2000 
season for violating team rules, first-year coach Kirk Ferentz said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz and university officials refused to say what Hill had  
done wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Roe, associate director of men's sports information, said  
Hill had violated a team policy, but had not done anything that 
would involve court charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team thing and it's a privacy thing,'' Roe said. ``It's  
a team rule as opposed to a criminal offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz said in a statement that ``Kahlil will remain on the  
team in an active role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be permitted to practice and will be expected to  
conduct himself as a team member in every way, other than 
participating in game competition this fall,'' Ferentz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roe said Hill will forfeit this year of eligibility even though  
he won't play, leaving him with two years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz said that when the suspension is over ``we will move on  
and we fully anticipate Kahlil being a key contributor in future 
seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, a 6-foot-3, 185-pound return specialist, redshirted the  
1997 season but started all 11 games in 1998. He had 35 receptions 
for 432 yards and two touchdowns and tied for the team scoring lead 
with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's 35 receptions are a record for an Iowa freshman, and Hill  
also became the first freshman to lead Iowa in receiving for a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, a sophomore from Iowa City, averaged 17.7 yards on 10 punt  
returns, and his 25.8-yard average on 18 kickoff returns ranked him 
18th nationally in that category. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill is not listed in the Iowa City telephone directory.  
</P>
<P>
	Hill's suspension leaves the Hawkeyes without two of their top  
players for their season opener Sept. 4 against Nebraska at Kinnick 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Randy Reiners, arrested in June on an alcohol charge  
for the second time in 18 months, has been suspended for the 
Nebraska game. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners, a senior, also is allowed to practice with the team but  
will not play against the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was the only member of the Iowa team to be mentioned on  
preseason all-Big Ten Conference teams.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Productivity Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Growth in worker productivity slowed  
considerably in the spring while a key gauge of wage pressures 
surged, two potentially troublesome developments that could prompt 
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Thursday that productivity --  
output per hour of work -- increased at an annual rate of just 1.3 
percent in the April-June quarter, far below the 3.6 percent rate 
in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, unit labor costs, considered a key measure of  
wage pressures, surged at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the worst 
showing since the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and many private  
economists believe strong productivity growth has helped to keep 
inflation low. With productivity rising sharply, employers are able 
to boost wages and pay the higher salaries through increased 
output, rather than raising prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan warned Congress two weeks ago that if productivity  
slows, wage pressures are likely to quickly surface, given that 
labor markets are the tightest in nearly three decades. He pledged 
that the Fed would act promptly to raise rates at the first signs 
of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been jittery over the prospects that the  
Fed will raise interest rates for a second time this year when 
policy-makers meet Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's productivity report gives the central bank fresh  
ammunition to do just that, some economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chairman Greenspan has most of the ducks in a row to hike  
interest rates on Aug. 24,'' said Wells Fargo economist Sung Won 
Sohn. ``These numbers are a couple of the ducks he was watching 
carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said another key report on Greenspan's radar will be  
Friday's unemployment report. If the July unemployment rate inches 
back down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent and if hourly wage costs 
show a big jump, many analysts said, that will make it even more 
likely that the Fed will raise rates. The unemployment rate in June 
stood at 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jump in unit labor costs far exceeded analysts'  
expectations. Many were looking for a gain of around 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gary Thayer, an economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.,  
said the 3.8 percent rate of increase stands out because it 
followed what he called an ``abnormally low'' 0.8 percent gain in 
the first quarter. In the fourth quarter of 1998, unit labor costs 
actually fell 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer doesn't expect another big jump in unit labor costs in  
the current third quarter and said the slowdown in productivity 
growth is consistent with slower economic growth. Given that, 
``we're not in an environment where the Fed will raise rates in 
August,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts noted that the Fed had already begun to worry  
about wage pressures following a report last Thursday that the 
Employment Cost Index, which includes both wages and benefits paid 
to workers, rose at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the second 
quarter of this year, the biggest gain in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.8 percent rate of increase in unit labor costs follows  
modest increases of 2 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3 percent increase in productivity was the slowest  
quarterly increase since the second quarter of last year when 
productivity rose at only a 0.4 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The slower productivity growth reflected a sharp downturn in the  
gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, to 
an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second quarter from 4.3 
percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But some economists said a factor contributing to slower  
productivity growth may be that employers, scrambling for workers, 
are hiring unqualified people in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, productivity rose by 2.2 percent, which was  
almost double the 1.2 percent increase of 1997. Greenspan has noted 
this sharp improvement as evidence that the nation's heavy 
investment in computers and other productivity-enhancing technology 
is beginning to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report Thursday, 279,000 Americans filed new claims  
for unemployment benefits last week, up by 4,000 from the previous 
week. Economists consider any claims level below 300,000 an 
indication of an extremely tight labor market.

<HEADLINE> Fifth Pleaded in Fundraising Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Asserting his Fifth Amendment rights, former  
White House aide Mark Middleton refused to answer questions 
Thursday for a House committee investigating Democratic fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, said the panel wanted to know whether Middleton worked 
with the Chinese government or other foreign sources to arrange 
contributions to the Democratic National Committee and the 
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, R-Ind., asked a series of questions on the subject and  
Middleton asserted his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination in each instance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Burton, Middleton attorney Robert D. Luskin wrote  
that his client concluded the inquiry ``was not a search for truth 
but a campaign to punish.'' He cited statements by Burton that 
characterized Middleton as one of the people responsible for 
foreign contributions to the Clinton campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Luskin contended: ``There is not a shred of credible evidence  
that Mr. Middleton was the source of any contributions to the DNC 
or the president's re-election campaign, much less illegal ones 
from the Chinese.''

<HEADLINE> Family: Former Player DuBose Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An autopsy of former NFL player Demetrius  
DuBose showed he was shot six times in the back during a 
confrontation with police last month, DuBose's family said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, 28, a former linebacker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and  
Notre Dame, was fatally shot July 24 by two officers who said he 
charged at them with a martial arts weapon he took from them. 
Officers said he resisted their attempts to question him as they 
investigated a burglary call in the neighborhood where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	The family launched their own investigation and paid for private  
autopsies by two doctors after witnesses reported DuBose was shot 
in the back and noted other details that appeared to be 
inconsistent with the police report, said Brian Watkins, a lawyer 
for the family. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose was shot nine times, including three times in the chest,  
Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can imagine that this was devastating, that their son took  
nine bullets and then bled to death,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police chief David Bejarano declined to comment on the findings  
of the family's autopsy until an internal investigation is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's investigators are waiting for police to complete  
their investigation so they can review ballistics tests, which will 
help them determine whether the first shot was fired in the back, 
as witnesses have reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officers were approximately seven to 10 to 12 feet away,''  
Watkins said. ``They yelled for him to drop the (weapon) or get 
down or something of that sort. Immediately after that, they shot 
DuBose nine times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary findings of the family's investigation show DuBose  
was not lunging toward officers when the first shot was fired and 
reached for the nunchukas, a martial arts weapon, after it fell 
from an officer's holder. Also, police were investigating a call of 
trespassing, not a burglary as they reported, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses also told family investigators that after shooting  
DuBose, ``police continued to stand over him for another 10 
minutes, then one officer put on a rubber glove, checked his pulse, 
and continued to wait. DuBose bled to death before he reached the 
hospital,'' Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights activists have said they believe police used  
excessive force on DuBose because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officers who shot DuBose were white and about the same  
size as DuBose, who was 6-foot-2 and weighed about 210 pounds, 
Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not identified the two officers, who have been  
placed on administrative duty. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement Wednesday, Bejarano urged people to wait  
for police to finish their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation should go to the district attorney  
shortly,'' Bejarano said in a written statement. ``The time for 
judgment is after all of the facts are in and have been reviewed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Dave Cohen said he didn't know when the  
investigation would be complete, but said the district attorney 
would be the one to determine whether the shooting was justifiable 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't recommend that the DA go either way. Our role is  
simply to gather the facts,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Starts External Review System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna U.S. Healthcare, the nation's largest  
health insurer, says its HMO members can now appeal coverage 
denials to independent doctor panels. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna is not the first health plan to offer such an external  
review process, but it is now the biggest. Congress is debating 
whether to mandate all health maintenance organizations to offer an 
external review system. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna, which in January announced its intention to start such a  
program, has agreed to be bound by the decisions of the independent 
doctor review boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna has contracted with Hayes Plus, The Center for Health  
Dispute Resolution, Island Peer Review Organization and CORE. The 
firms contract with doctors who will conduct the reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5.6 million of Aetna's 16 million members have access to  
the program. Consumers who are in Aetna's self-insured plans or 
Aetna's indemnity or preferred provider organization plans are not 
eligible for the external reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The external review will generally be available to HMO members  
who have exhausted Aetna's internal grievance or appeals procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Members may request an external review if Aetna denies coverage  
after the internal appeals panel has determined that the proposed 
service is not covered because it is unnecessary or inappropriate, 
or is experimental or investigational in nature. The cost of the 
treatment or service at issue must exceed $500.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up After Slump Vs. Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slumped against the yen and the euro  
Thursday but ended the day higher thanks to a late rally on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0756, down  
from $1.0771 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 114.30 
Japanese yen, up slightly from 114.29. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trading day, the dollar dipped against both  
currencies on renewed concerns that the Fed may raise interest 
rates when it meets on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Two economic reports Thursday increased worries about a rate  
increase. One showed a slowing of worker productivity in the 
April-June quarter, and another showed a sharp rise in a key gauge 
of labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both suggested higher rates could be on the way, which could  
hurt U.S. stock and bond markets. The dollar often suffers as 
foreign investors pull their funds out of American investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4878 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4844, and 1.4962 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4902. The British 
pound fell to $1.6129 from $1.6223. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8185 German 
marks, up from 1.8159; and 6.0976 French francs, up from 6.0901.

<HEADLINE> 30-Year Mortgages Rise to 7.89 Pct. / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose to 7.89 percent this week, reaching the 
highest level in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.70 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. This week's average rate on 30-year mortgages was the 
highest since the end of May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb. So far this year,  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low of 6.74 percent 
set at the end of January and a new high set this week. The 
previous high for this year of 7.71 percent was set the week ending 
July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.45 percent this week, up from the average of 7.29 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.09 percent this week, also up from 5.99 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market has been very volatile in the past week, not  
sure whether inflation would remain subdued or if it would increase 
slightly, thus causing the Federal Reserve to tighten credit,'' 
said Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ``That 
uncertainty pushed all interest rates higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday  
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending July 30 were 
down 20.8 percent compared to the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> FCC Adopts Station Ownership Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission adopted  
rules today that partially relax existing restrictions on the 
number of local stations a single broadcasting company can control. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted 4-1 to loosen an existing rule that forbids  
a single company from owning more than one local TV station in a 
given market. Under the changes approved today, a company could own 
two TV stations in the same market if there were at least eight 
other competitors after the deal. The top four stations cannot 
combine. Common ownership could also be permitted if one of the 
stations was failing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also voted 4-1 to alter a current rule that prohibits  
ownership of radio and TV stations in the same market. Under the 
changes, a company could own two TV stations and six radio stations 
are long as there are enough other media voices in that market. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also voted to provide some ``grandfather'' relief  
to companies that already have been granted waivers to own 
combinations of radio and TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also clamped down on local marketing agreements -- which  
currently allow one TV station to operate another TV station in the 
same market, but not actually own it. Under today's rules, a TV 
station that provides more than 15 percent of weekly programming to 
another station could be considered the owner of that second 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations that entered into such agreements before November 1996  
would also be grandfathered until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over broadcast ownership has pitted public interest  
advocates who fear that greater consolidation will mean less 
diversity of content against some industry groups who say stations 
must face certain financial realities to stay on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of media ownership has been contentious at the  
commission and around Washington. A similar FCC proposal in the 
winter drew attacks from top telecommunications lawmakers, who said 
the measures did not give broadcasters enough regulatory relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The Media Access Project, a public-interest law firm, opposes  
permitting increased broadcast consolidation, saying that it 
reduces the diversity of ownership, and therefore, of content, 
available to audiences. 
</P>

	``The fact that there are many more stations out there is  
dwarfed by the fact that over the last 15 years the number of 
entities owning the stations has reduced,'' said Andy Schwartzman, 
president of the Media Access Project. He is concerned that without 
clear definitions of what constitutes ownership, companies are able 
to skirt federal restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who want to push the limits have been able to do  
essentially whatever they wanted,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Popson Retires With Head Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVER FALLS, Wis. (AP) -- Tight end Ted Popson, who sustained  
head injuries twice last season, obeyed his doctor's orders and 
announced his retirement from the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Popson, 32, played two years for the Chiefs after three with the  
San Francisco 49ers. He totaled 103 catches for 980 yards and eight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to keep playing. I wish I could play forever,'' he said  
in a brief ceremony before teammates at the Chiefs' training camp. 
``But I'll listen to the doctors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He played the game the way it was meant to be played, with  
respect,'' said Chiefs' general manager Carl Peterson. ``I don't 
remember Ted Popson ever dropping a pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was first injured in a savage tackle against Pittsburgh on a  
Monday night game in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was about the most vicious hit I've ever seen in the  
NFL,'' said Peterson. ``But he held onto the ball.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Insurance Money Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Eagleburger, chairman of a  
Holocaust-era insurance claims commission, has resolved a key 
dispute over the current value of policies held by Jewish victims 
of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	This could clear the way for payment of claims beginning later  
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a participant, Eagleburger decided to place a  
``real value'' of about 10 times the prewar face value on policies 
issued by the German insurance company Allianz. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger, a former secretary of state, used a complex formula  
linked in part to long-term German bonds. A five-day period for 
registering objections ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An aide to the commission vice chairman, Neal Sher, said some  
responses were received, but she did not know if they were 
objecting to Eagleburger's action. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger stepped in when the commission could not agree on a  
formula that would have determined current values on policies taken 
out some six decades ago by factoring in inflation and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Some European insurers have questioned the valuation formula and  
indicated they may pull out of the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could do whatever they want,'' Elan Steinberg, executive  
director of the World Jewish Congress, said in an interview. ``But 
the consumer and state insurance regulators would not look kindly 
to insurance companies reneging on their commitments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a meeting of the commission at the end of the  
month in London to adopt a process for compiling lists of policy 
holders and communicating with the families of the victims of Nazi 
persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to begin payments at the end of October.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission has representatives from five major European  
companies, Jewish groups and American regulators. Earlier, they 
agreed on a formula for payment on policies issued in Eastern 
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Deal Cuts Use of Colo. River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After years of bickering, California's three  
biggest users of the Colorado River have agreed on a new 
distribution plan aimed at ending a decades-old practice of the 
state taking more than its share. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado is the lifeblood of booming cities and suburbs  
across the West, and California's overuse has angered other states 
sharing the water. 
</P>
<P>
	In a break with western law and tradition, the deal reached  
Wednesday allows rural water districts to transfer their surplus to 
rapidly-growing urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``As water becomes scarcer and scarcer, and growth happens, it's  
important to remove barriers to enable water to go where it need to 
goes,'' said David Hayes, an aide to Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt who helped broker the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement involves the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water  
District of Southern California, a powerful agency that indirectly 
provides water to 16 million people; the Imperial Irrigation 
District, which serves farms in the state's southeast corner; and 
the smaller Coachella Valley Water District serving farmers farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the verbal pact were not disclosed pending approval  
by governing boards of the water districts. But the long-feuding 
agencies generally agreed to accept less water, to pay more for the 
infrastructure transporting the water and to stop filing lawsuits 
over conservation squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us a framework,'' Imperial spokeswoman Susan Giller  
said. ``We've taken a very big step in helping California set a 
long-term water use strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a multistate agreement dating to 1922, California is  
allowed to draw 4.4 million acre-feet of water per year from the 
Colorado to supplement other sources, principally snowmelt from the 
Sierra Nevada. An acre-foot is about enough to supply two families 
of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has regularly allowed the nation's most  
populous state to take more than its share, sometimes up to 5.2 
million acre-feet per year. 
</P>
<P>
	That was possible partly because the other users of the river --  
Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico -- didn't 
need their full shares. Mexico and some western Indian tribes also 
use the river as a water source. 
</P>
<P>
	But a population boom in the West turned up the pressure from  
the other states on California. Babbitt instructed the state to 
start living within its allotment or face forced annual reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of this agreement, the goal of bringing California's  
take of Colorado River water under control is now more clearly in 
sight,'' said Babbitt, whose aides estimated it could take several 
years before California reached compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego County Water Authority spokesman Dennis Cushman called  
the deal a positive step, but added many steps remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our experience, it's not done until it's done,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Man Claims Big Game Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- When Randy Kerfoot saw that the winning numbers  
for the $116 million Big Game jackpot matched the numbers on his 
ticket, he did a double take. He even went online to verify the 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took it a while to really sink in, and I don't think  
anybody took their eyes off that ticket all night,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It may still take Kerfoot a while get used to being an instant  
multi-millionaire. The East Ridge, Tenn., resident was the sole 
winner of Tuesday's drawing. By selecting the lump-sum option on 
his Quik Pik ticket, Kerfoot's winnings came to about $59 million, 
or $38.9 million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Lottery Corp. officials said it was the largest payout  
to a single winner since the state lottery began in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerfoot worked as parts and service director for an Infiniti  
dealership in Chattanooga. Usually, he said goodbye to his boss 
every Friday with the words, ``I'll see you Monday unless I hit the 
lottery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he struck it big, he made good on his promise.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out of here,'' he told his boss minutes before appearing  
at a news conference Wednesday to claim his prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerfoot intends to begin enjoying his leisure now that he is a  
wealthy man. His wife, Sandy, will continue working for a Toyota 
dealership, but only until she trains someone to replace her as 
controller and office manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The first major purchase for the couple may be two new cars,  
since both drive company-provided vehicles. A new house also may be 
in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had just re-mortgaged our house so we could fix it up,''  
Mrs. Kerfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the winnings also will go to charity, including the  
Ronald McDonald House, they said. The Kerfoots met as teen-agers 
working for a McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	They have two daughters, ages 18 and 16, and a granddaughter.  
</P>
<P>
	The Big Game is played in seven states: Massachusetts, Georgia,  
Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Virginia and New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> GOP's '96 Nominee Pitching Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Drop any second thoughts about a woman  
president, former Sen. Bob Dole told voters Thursday as he scoured 
the pizzerias and Blue Bunny ice cream plant of western Iowa's 
rural reaches on his wife's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	As for front-running Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Dole quipped:  
``He might make a good vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have reservations about voting for a woman.  
But the issue is her qualifications,'' said the 1996 Republican 
presidential nominee, pitching in on his wife Elizabeth's campaign 
for the 2000 nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	With just over a week to go before the Ames, Iowa, straw poll --  
a state GOP fund-raiser that many view as the season's first test 
of candidate strength -- Bob Dole invited Iowans on a free campaign 
bus ride to the Aug. 14 event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hope you're interested enough to make the trip, not for me but  
for Elizabeth,'' Dole told about two dozen women gathered in a 
local pizza joint. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he downplayed the exercise's significance.  
</P>
<P>
	``Phil Gramm tied me in '96 and three weeks later he was out of  
the race,'' Dole said. ``It'll be forgotten in a couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturing deeper through this region's corn and soybean fields,  
he hit another pizzeria, gave workers at Wells Dairy, makers of 
Blue Bunny ice cream, a private audience, and then finished his 
evening at an old Sioux City abbey. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 60 people there contributed $10 apiece to Elizabeth Dole in  
exchange for soft drinks, chips and a Mrs. Dole favorite -- hot 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Hengeveld, of Sheldon, who will turn 18 just in time to vote  
next year, said Bob Dole's pitch left him still uncommitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his wife is a viable candidate, but I wonder if she'll  
be able to out-campaign Bush,'' Hengeveld said.

<HEADLINE> Race Car Driver Waltrip To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Darrell Waltrip said today it's true -- he is  
retiring after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotion-choked announcement at Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway, one of stock car racing's legendary drivers confirmed 
what has been widely reported for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old three-time Winston Cup champion is calling his  
final season a ``victory tour.'' Waltrip, who hasn't won since 1992 
and rarely misses a punchline, nailed this one on the nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we didn't  
get at least one victory,'' Waltrip said. ``Winning a race now 
would be just as special as winning that first one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making his announcement before qualifying for the sixth  
Brickyard 400 at Indy, Waltrip broke down in tears and summoned his 
wife to the podium for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving this sport, hanging up my helmet, that's hard to talk  
about,'' said Waltrip, the man who stormed into racing and earned 
the nickname ``Jaws'' for his loud mouth now choking back sobs. 
``I've done this for 40 years. Ever since I was 12 years old, we'd 
get up, put on our racing gear and go to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought about the future. What am I going to do  
next year? If I don't win this week, I'll get 'em next week. Well, 
I'm running out of next weeks. That's really the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a Kentucky native who lives in Franklin, Tenn., leads  
all active Winston Cup drivers with 84 career victories but has not 
won a race since Darlington in September 1992. He finished 25th in 
the most recent series race, the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono 
Raceway, and is 38th in the season points. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip sold his team last year after owning it for eight years,  
citing sponsor disputes and other financial reasons. At the time, 
he said the 1999 season would be his last. He changed his mind when 
asked by Travis Carter and Carl Haas to drive the No. 66 KMart Ford 
Taurus for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who has frequently used the former champion's  
provisional to keep his career going, vowed to qualify consistently 
in the top 25 with a new car -- trimmed with flames instead of 
Waltrip's favorite chrome look -- that was unveiled today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no excuse for me and this car to miss races,''  
Waltrip said. ``This car should not need a provisional.''

<HEADLINE> Women Managers Rare in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese women lag far behind their American  
sisters in their climb into higher corporate ranks, government 
figures out today show. But there are signs of change, however 
incremental. 
</P>
<P>
	People are marveling over Mazda Motor Corp.'s new plan to  
promote a few women and give 500 others a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The praise Mazda is winning underlines the momentous obstacles  
women face at Japanese companies -- where they are routinely put on 
a separate track from men as soon as they are hired and often 
expected to quit when they get married. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mazda looked at the performance and skills of their women  
employees, it found that 500, or about a third of their female work 
force, deserved either promotion or a better job grade, which 
determines salary. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, two or three women will be promoted by this fall to  
the lowest managerial position, called assistant manager, a title 
now held by 2,300 men and only four women at Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
	A Westerner might wonder why so many women hadn't gotten their  
proper due before. In Japan, the news was praised as proof of 
Mazda's progressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women promoted -- 500 at once,'' declared a headline in the  
liberal Asahi newspaper. A commentator on a news program praised 
the move as surprisingly drastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means more opportunities for women, so it's great news,''  
said Mazda spokeswoman Nobuko Watanabe, one of only three female 
section chiefs at the automaker. ``I think many women here are 
delighted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's study by the Labor Ministry painted a far more dismal  
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The proportion of women in management has hardly changed at all  
according to the latest figures available, a survey comparing last 
year's findings to 1995's. 
</P>
<P>
	Women made up 1.2 percent of department directors, down from 1.5  
percent, and 2.4 percent of section chiefs, up slightly from 2 
percent. Women made up 7.8 percent of lowest level management, up 
slightly from 7.3 percent. The study looked at about 6,000 
companies employing 30 or more people. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, women make up about 46 percent of  
management, although they are still a tiny minority at top levels, 
according to a U.N. study. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's recent economic troubles curtailed the promotion of  
women, said ministry official Akiko Yoshimoto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Progress is very gradual, and it's difficult to say  
advancement is coming smoothly,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that old attitudes die hard. Companies  
continued to justify assigning jobs only to men by saying that 
there were no women who could do the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why they had not promoted women to management, they said  
women lacked skills, experience and decision-making ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan, sexual equality is all talk and not at all reflected  
in actual practice,'' said feminist activist Chiyo Saito. 
</P>
<P>
	Saito said she suspected that Mazda announced what for Japan is  
a radical measure because it is 33.4 percent owned by U.S. 
automaker Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda said that erasing sexual discrimination in promotions was  
part of an overall policy of changing old-style Japanese ways to 
Western standards in order to keep up with the international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we do away with the basic thinking that women should  
stay at home and shouldn't be working, things aren't going to 
change,'' said Kazumi Suzuki, a 26-year-old temporary worker at a 
U.S. bank. She quit her job at a Japanese company after enduring 
three frustrating years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had it with Japanese companies,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Royal Caribbean Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. pleaded guilty  
Thursday to dumping oil and hazardous chemicals in U.S. waters off 
Florida and then lying about it to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea was one of several that Royal Caribbean agreed to in  
July to settle charges that it secretly polluted the coastal waters 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the national plea deal, the Miami-based cruise line agreed  
to pay a record $18 million criminal fine and plead guilty to 21 
felony counts in five U.S. cities and in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami court hearing is the third in which Royal Caribbean,  
the second-largest cruise line in the industry, pleaded guilty. The 
cruise line has already pleaded guilty in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami on Thursday, the company was ordered to pay a $3  
million criminal fine for dumping waste oil and hazardous chemicals 
that came from shipboard dry cleaning, photographic developing and 
print shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise ships used ``secret bypass pipes'' to dump materials  
overboard, often at night. Ship personnel falsified log books that 
employees referred to by a Norwegian term meaning ``fairy tale 
book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The largest part of the fine, $6.5 million, is to be paid for  
pollution violations in coastal waters off Alaska. The other fines 
are $3 million each in New York and Los Angeles; $1.5 million for 
St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and $1 million for a 
pollution violation by San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, ``the company is a much different company  
environmentally,'' company spokeswoman Lynn Mortenstein said before 
Thursday's plea hearing. ``We're confident we've got the people, 
policies and the equipment to be an environmentally responsible 
company.''

tax cut in defiance of repeated veto threats from President 
Clinton. The House plans to vote on the bill later today, with the

cascading fountain. The plaza used to be a perfect lunchtime 
hangout, with workers eating from brown bags in the midday sun. 
That was before April 19, 1995, when a bomb ripped apart the 
building, killing 168 people and injuring hundreds of others. ``For 
some of us there's bad memories here, but it's a lot nicer now,'' 
said John Cresswell, who was a GSA maintenance mechanic at the

	Report Calls Los Alamos Probe 'Flawed'

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI's espionage case against a Los Alamos  
weapons scientist was ``flawed from the outset'' because 
authorities identified a number of other suspects, but failed to 
investigate them, a congressional report revealed today. The report 
also disclosed that in a polygraph test in February when the 
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was asked if he had passed nuclear secrets 
``to any unauthorized person,'' he failed the test. The report by 
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee outlines missteps over 
three years that prevented the FBI from establishing a strong case 
against the scientist.

	U.N. Wants To Appoint Khmer Judges  
</P>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- The United Nations, concerned about  
the fairness of Cambodia's judiciary, wants to appoint a majority 
of the judges for a proposed trial of Khmer Rouge leaders, a 
government official said today. A U.N. legal team will arrive in 
Cambodia later this month with a proposal for a tribunal of five or 
seven judges, a majority to be U.N.-appointed, said an official 
close to the negotiations. The proposed tribunal will try Khmer 
Rouge leaders blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million 
Cambodians during the group's rule in the late 1970s.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at the most of nation's biggest retailers  
rose to better-than-expected levels in July, with hot weather and 
the economy's continued strength giving Americans incentive to 
shop. Warmer-than-normal weather through much of the country sent 
consumers heading to the stores both to escape the heat and buy 
seasonal items such as air conditioners, inflatable pools and 
bathing suits. The strong July sales reported today followed big 
gains the prior two months.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Denver Bronco's tight end Shannon Sharpe,  
already unhappy about traveling to Australia and dealing with its 
``rude'' people, sprained his ankle during today's practice in 
Sydney. The injury threatens to keep him out of Saturday's game in 
Sydney against the San Diego Chargers. Broncos doctors examined 
both his knee and ankle and concluded Sharpe had a sprained ankle. 
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said he didn't think the injury would 
require a magnetic resonance imaging test.

<HEADLINE> Toddler Attacked by Father's Python </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRUITLAND PARK, Fla. (AP) -- A 13-foot pet python almost killed  
an 18-month-old boy when it bit the child several times and wrapped 
itself around the child. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's father was able to pry the 80-pound reptile from  
little Nickolas Graham and was bitten several times on both hands 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	An animal control officer caught the snake shortly after the  
attack and planned to destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickolas underwent plastic surgery to repair damage to his eye.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised the snake didn't kill the child,'' said Dave  
Bailey, a Lake County animal control officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, Bill Broyles, said he didn't know his pet had  
slithered outside near the concrete patio where Nickolas was 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him dead,'' Broyles said of the snake, wringing his  
blood-covered hands. ``I don't want to see him again.''

<HEADLINE> Some Net IPOs See Turnaround </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Investors shrugged off the months-long slide  
in Internet stocks Thursday to give a warm welcome to initial 
public offerings by three Web-focused companies. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they were less enthusiastic to two other Internet  
companies, barely budging on one while sending the other below its 
opening price. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in the holding company Internet Capital Group and  
networking specialist Mission Critical Software both soared in 
their Nasdaq debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet Capital more than doubled from its offering price of  
$12 to $24.43 3/4. Houston-based Mission Critical rose 58 percent from 
its $16 offering price to $25.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered almost invincible early this year, online stocks  
appear to have reached their peak in April, when the luster began 
to wear off for investors. The 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index 
has shed more than 40 percent of its value since it hit an all-time 
high on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, the index rose 4 percent, while both the  
technology heavy Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average 
posted gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great day for Internet Capital and a validation for  
the business of e-commerce and the role it's going to play in our 
economy over the next five to 10 years,'' said Walter Buckley, 
chairman and chief executive for the Wayne, Pa.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company holds interests in 35 Web-based companies. Proceeds  
from the stock sale will be used to increase those holdings and 
invest in new ventures, Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Internet company, HomeStore.com, a Thousand Oaks,  
Calif.-based provider of online real estate listings, rose to 
$22.75 from its $20 offering price. 
</P>
<P>
	HomeStore had doubled its asking price on Wednesday, despite the  
recent bashing of Internet IPOs, on advice from chief underwriter 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raised a significant amount of capital. We're going to use  
that to keep growing,'' said HomeStores chairman and chief 
executive Stuart Wolff. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was less generous to two other companies that debuted  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Interactive Pictures Corp., a multimedia company based in Oak  
Ridge, Tenn., slid initially from its $18 asking price to $17.75 
before finishing at $19. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobalt Group opened at $9.87 1/2, below its $11 asking price.  
Shares closed at $8.31 1/4 for the Seattle-based company that designed 
and maintains Web sites for more than 3,000 auto dealerships 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet Capital's success may have resulted more from investor  
uncertainty than resurging confidence in the Web sector, said Brian 
G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. 
Because the company invests in a wide range of Internet stocks, 
investors don't face the risk of trying to pick a winner 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like buying a basket or a mini-mutual fund.  
They're diversifying their risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixed response to Thursday's five IPOs also suggests that  
investors have become more sophisticated in choosing Web stocks. 
That sophistication means the volatility is likely to continue in 
the near term as investors try to sort out winners from losers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a certain amount of bottom fishing that takes place  
in groups or sectors like this when they become oversold. The 
Internet sector is probably one that stands out this week as one 
that's been truly oversold,'' said Internet Capital's Buckley. 
``There's a certain constituency that's going to own these Internet 
stocks for the long haul. I think in stocks in general have proved 
their noteworthiness and their viability.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats reached agreement with a group  
of breakaway Republicans today on legislation to strengthen the 
rights of patients dealing with HMOs, officials said. The measure 
is designed to lower barriers to medical care -- at emergency rooms, 
from specialists and elsewhere -- that are imposed by insurance 
companies. Patients would have the right to a review by an 
independent panel if they believed they were wrongly denied 
treatment. They would also be permitted to sue.

families if they agree not to pursue punitive damages. An attorney 
for Swissair told a judge that the airline would accept liability,

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 10-year, $792 billion Republican tax cut,  
sure to be vetoed by President Clinton but embraced by the GOP as a 
bedrock political issue, hurtled toward final congressional passage 
today. The House passed the bill 221-206, and final Senate approval 
was expected by early evening. With little chance of becoming law, 
the bill will serve mainly as a defining issue between Republicans 
and Democrats in the 2000 struggle for control of Congress and the 
race for the White House. The bill would be the largest tax cut 
since 1981.

alleged theft of nuclear secrets by China. The report said the 
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, had signed a waiver three years ago allowing 
his computer to be searched, but the FBI and government lawyers did 
not learn of it until this year. When the computer was finally 
examined, it was found that Lee had shifted thousands of 
super-secret weapons codes into an unsecured computer system.

deliberate with his shots -- at times he fired from point-blank 
range. Detective Steve Walden said it wasn't clear whether Barton 
had specific people in mind when he entered two brokerages last 
week and killed nine people and wounded 13, hours before killing 
himself. But Barton was able to shoot people at close range, 
including some under desks or at their chairs in the small offices, 
Walden said.

southeast Turkey by Sept. 1 to open the way for dialogue with the

Bros. van is the first part of a four-year marketing partnership

Yugoslav federation in favor of a loose partnership with Serbia 
that would allow the two republics to go their own ways. The 
proposal is a direct challenge to Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, who moved federal troops into Montenegro in an attempt 
to stifle its autonomy ambitions during the recent Kosovo crisis. 
Milosevic is believed to be almost certain to reject the proposal,

<HEADLINE> FBI Director Admits Agency Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The head of the FBI has admitted the agency's  
Boston operation made ``significant mistakes'' in its past dealings 
with organized crime informants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of mistakes to account for,'' FBI Director Louis  
Freeh said Wednesday. ``We are not an agency that makes excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for alleged mobsters including Francis ``Cadillac  
Frank'' Salemme and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi have asked a 
federal judge to dismiss racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Cardinale, Salemme's attorney, said Freeh's admission  
sounded like an attempt to ward off bad publicity if the judge 
throws out the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to put a shine on a sneaker,'' he said. ``It  
isn't going to be pretty for the FBI. I think they know they're 
about to get croaked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinale said a grand jury is investigating the roles played by  
at least two FBI agents. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's 
office, Samantha Martin, said she could not comment on grand jury 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh also said the bureau would consider adding James  
``Whitey'' Bulger's name to the 10 Most Wanted List. Bulger, an 
alleged crime boss from Boston, has been on the lam since his 
indictment in January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinale and other defense attorneys have argued that the  
charges should be dismissed because Bulger and Flemmi were given 
permission to commit crimes in exchange for information they gave 
the FBI on the mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf has not yet ruled on the requests.  
</P>
<P>
	Freeh said the improper behavior was largely in the 1970s and  
'80s and said the FBI has since revamped its informant policies.

<HEADLINE> BASF Reports Drop in Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany (AP) -- BASF AG, the world's second-largest  
chemicals concern after DuPont Co., suffered worse-than-expected 
declines in first-half profits and sales despite an upturn in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits slid 30 percent to 992 million euros, or about $1  
billion, compared with the same period last year, while group sales 
dropped 4.7 percent to 14 billion euros, or about $15 billion, the 
German company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures failed to meet analyst forecasts. In Thursday's  
trading in Frankfurt, BASF's shares fell more than 4 percent after 
rising 5.3 percent Wednesday amid merger speculation sparked by Dow 
Chemical's agreement to acquire Union Carbide. The overall Xetra 
DAX stock index was down 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	BASF said an upturn in second-quarter sales volumes meant  
revenues only declined 1.1 percent in that quarter compared with an 
8.2 percent decline in the first three months of the year. BASF's 
European operations bore the brunt of the overall sales decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings also were hurt by a fine of 210 million euros, or $225  
million, levied by the U.S. Justice Department for BASF's role in a 
vitamins price-fixing case. Further charges could arise from civil 
class-action lawsuits under way in the United States, BASF said. 
</P>
<P>
	BASF said it sees full-year group sales matching last year's  
27.6 billion euros, but said lower first-half profit margins will 
hurt full-year earnings.

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease, Stroke Deaths Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Deaths from heart disease and stroke continue to  
decline because of greater awareness of causes and preventive 
measures, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, heart disease and stroke remain leading causes of  
disability and death, and estimated costs including health 
expenditures and lost productivity are expected to be $286 billion 
in 1999, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health care professionals have long observed a decline in  
fatality due to cardiovascular diseases in the United States. Death 
rates from coronary and hypertensive heart disease and rheumatic 
heart disease have decreased from a peak of 307.4 per 100,000 in 
1950 to 134.6 in 1996, a decline of 56 percent, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke deaths have decreased 70 percent in that time, from 88.8  
per 100,000 in 1950 to 26.5 in 1996, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause for the decline is attributed to many factors,  
including a drop in cigarette smoking among adults, an increase in 
medication for those with high blood pressure, improvements in 
medical care and diagnosis, and a greater awareness of proper diet 
as a preventive measure, such as lower fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the CDC said the overall reduction in deaths from heart  
disease and stroke masks differences in rates broken down by 
race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status and geographic region. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1985-1996, for example, heart disease mortality declined  
29 percent among white men but only 10 percent among American 
Indian men and native Alaskan women. People of lower socioeconomic 
status have higher risks levels, and geographic areas with higher 
levels of those groups have higher incidence of the diseases and 
deaths.

	Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer. About 1 million  
cases of basal cell or squamous cell cancer are diagnosed annually 
in the United States. The most serious form of skin cancer, 
melanoma, is diagnosed in about 44,200 Americans annually. Skin 
cancer can be easily treated if detected early, but the disease 
kills about 9,200 Americans a year. About 7,300 of these deaths are 
from melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is thought to be  
the most common cause of the genetic changes that lead to skin 
cancer. Studies have shown that UV radiation can disable certain 
genes, such as P53, that normally keep cancer in check. 
</P>
<P>
	In the M.D. Anderson study, researchers exposed mice to UV  
radiation and found that sunburned skin cells created the Fas 
protein. The job of this protein is to inventory the genes in a 
cell and initiate a process of cell suicide if the cell's genes are 
mutated. 
</P>
<P>
	Two types of mice were used. One mouse strain had the normal Fas  
protein while the other mouse type lacked the protein. 
</P>
<P>
	When both groups of mice were exposed to UV radiation for up to  
two weeks, the researchers found, only one in 20 of the mice with 
the Fas protein had skin cells that had been genetically altered by 
the simulated sunlight. This showed, said Owen-Schaub, that the Fas 
protein had detected genetically flawed cells and caused them to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mice without the Fas protein, however, 70 percent, or  
14 out of 20, had skin cells with UV-damaged genes. Such cells are 
the precursors to skin cancer.

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. Gets Three-Year Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Robert Downey Jr. ran out of second  
chances Thursday when a judge ignored his pleas for more drug 
rehabilitation and sentenced him to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth, with my finger on  
the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal,'' the 
``Chaplin'' actor told Municipal Judge Lawrence Mira. 
</P>
<P>
	Downey had been jailed since June, after he acknowledged during  
his regular half-yearly visit to the judge that he had been missing 
scheduled drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mira said Downey has manipulated doctors and psychiatrists  
during seven court-ordered drug rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any alternative,'' the judge said. ``We  
have used them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downey, 34, will likely serve a year behind bars, lawyers said.  
The judge credited him 201 days for time served and ordered him to 
pay $600 restitution for violating probation on a 1996 drug 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a question that if this defendant continues to use  
drugs that we're going to read his name in an obituary?'' Mira 
said. ``Or see his name in some story about a horrible accident?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Robert Shapiro, one of O.J. Simpson's lawyers,  
had argued that Downey should again receive probation and be 
allowed to continue treatment at a rehab center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a person who is suffering from a disease he can't  
control,'' he said. ``Even the dire threat of jail or prison is not 
enough of a deterrent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Shapiro told reporters: ``I am shocked and  
saddened by the sentence today ... It is wrong, it does not serve 
justice. Mr. Downey was on the road to recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro said he would appeal, but acknowledged ``appealing  
sentences in cases like this, in all candor, is very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A clean-shaven Downey, who walked into court wearing an orange  
jail jumpsuit with slicked-back hair, told the judge he understood 
why the court's patience had run out. But he pleaded to be given 
another chance at rehabilitation at a center called Impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been the right program at the right time for me,'' he  
said haltingly. ``I feel whatever decision you make will be the 
right one. ... But I feel a transition has happened to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downey's legal troubles date to June 1996 when he was stopped  
for speeding on Pacific Coast Highway and authorities found 
cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his car. A month later, he was 
found passed out on a child's bed in a neighbor's home. Three days 
later, he was arrested for leaving a recovery center. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to three years' probation after pleading no  
contest to drug and weapons charges. Despite stints in recovery, 
probation was revoked because of his drug use, and he was sentenced 
to six months in jail. He was released in March 1998 after serving 
almost four months. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of film director Robert Downey won an Oscar nomination  
for his work in the title role in ``Chaplin,'' the 1992 biography 
of the comedian. His other films include ``Less Than Zero,'' 
``Natural Born Killers,'' ``One Night Stand,'' ``Two Girls and a 
Guy'' and ``U.S. Marshals.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Bodies Returned From Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remains of three U.S. Air Force officers  
killed in the Vietnam War have been identified and will be given to 
their families for burial in the United States, the Defense 
Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are Maj. Charles F. Morley of Warrensburg, Mo., Capt.  
Thomas C. Daffron of Pinckneyville, Ill., and a third officer whose 
name was not released by the Pentagon at the request of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Morley and Daffron were flying a night strike mission over  
Khammouan Province in Laos on Feb. 18, 1970, when their F-4C 
Phantom jet was struck by enemy anti-aircraft fire and crashed. 
Teams of U.S. and Laotians investigating the crash site in 1995 
recovered human remains and items related to the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii  
confirmed the identification of the two men. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon released no details on the loss or recovery of the  
third officer, whose name was withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now 2,057 Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam  
War.

<HEADLINE> Captain Faces Charge in Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) -- An Air Force captain is being  
court-martialed for his relationship with his wife -- whom he met 
when she was a married airman and he was her commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Douglas Bass, 33, is charged with violating military law  
for his relationship with Krystal Carr, 21, an enlisted woman he 
married last month. He could face up to 28 years in prison if 
convicted of all nine counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of having sex with Ms. Carr -- as well as a second  
enlisted woman under his supervision -- and asking others to help 
hide his romance with Ms. Carr and disobeying orders to end the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew it was wrong to date and have sexual relations with  
any enlisted people, especially those he supervised,'' said Larry 
Clavette, a spokesman for Offutt Air Force Base, south of Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass' lawyers are attempting to negotiate a settlement or plea  
bargain, said Lt. Michael Braibish, a spokesman for the 12th Air 
Force, which commands the 55th Wing at Offutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass, who has waited eight months for his court-martial, has  
accused the Air Force of needlessly dragging out his case. He has 
admitted his actions were wrong and said he believes his military 
career is over. He has declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass was in command of Ms. Carr and her first husband, also an  
airman, when their affair started -- soon after Ms. Carr's husband 
was deployed overseas last August. Bass was divorced at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials ordered Bass to end the relationship in  
February when they learned about the affair. They also found out 
that Bass had a sexual relationship with a staff sergeant, whose 
name was not disclosed, from October 1997 to June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carr served 50 days of a 60-day sentence at the base's jail  
for lying about her relationship with Bass and disobeying orders to 
stay away from him. 
</P>
<P>
	She was released early for good behavior, demoted to the lowest  
enlisted rank and is expected to be released with a general 
discharge after Bass' court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternization among the ranks has remained an issue for the  
military since Lt. Kelly Flinn, the first female B-52 bomber pilot, 
was charged with adultery for having an affair with the husband of 
a female airman in North Dakota. She was allowed to resign in 1997 
and did not face prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Air Force Capt. Joseph Belli, 35, pleaded guilty to  
obstruction of justice and other charges stemming from an affair 
with an enlisted woman at Travis Air Force Base in California. He 
was dismissed from the service and ordered to serve 15 days in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli divorced his wife and mother of their five children and  
married the airman.

<HEADLINE> Russia's JFK Documents Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nine days after President Kennedy was  
assassinated, his widow wrote to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev 
that while the two leaders were adversaries, both were committed to 
peace, according to long-secret Russian documents released today by 
the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and he were enemies, but you were also allies in your  
determination not to let the world be blown up,'' the late 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis wrote Dec. 1, 1963, on White House 
stationery. ``The danger troubling my husband was that war could be 
started not so much by major figures as by minor ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of the letter was included in more than 80 pages of  
KGB and Soviet diplomatic documents that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin gave to President Clinton in June when the two were in 
Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``You respected each other and could have dealings with each  
other,'' Mrs. Kennedy wrote in her letter to Khrushchev. ``I know 
that President Johnson will make ever effort to establish the same 
relations with you. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sending you this letter because I am so deeply mindful of  
the importance of the relations that existed between you and my 
husband and also because you and Mrs. Khrushchev were so kind in 
Vienna. I read that she had tears in her eyes as she was coming out 
of the American embassy in Moscow after signing the book of 
condolences. Please tell her `thank you' for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other documents released offer a previously unopened window into  
high-level discussions in the former Soviet Union following the 
president's murder Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas. They also contain 
material that Soviet officials gathered on Lee Harvey Oswald, 
Kennedy's assassin, when he lived in the Soviet Union from 1959 to 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the documents, the Soviets drafted a statement  
three days after the assassination complaining that U.S. media 
reports about Oswald's communist connections were part of a 
disinformation campaign crafted by the ``real masterminds'' of the 
assassination to put the investigation on a ``false trail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, drafted for publication in the  
government-controlled Soviet press, was written after Oswald was 
killed by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby, two days after the 
assassination. It is uncertain whether the statement was actually 
published. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that Lee Harvey Oswald, accused of murdering the  
president, has himself been killed under mysterious circumstances, 
one can see even more clearly the absurdity and malice of the 
slanderous fabrications in certain organs of the American press, 
which are trying to establish Oswald's `connection' with either the 
Soviet Union or Cuba, using the fact that he spent some time in the 
Soviet Union as the basis for their insinuations,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who does not realize that the physical destruction of Oswald  
is an additional link in the chain of crimes leading to the real 
masterminds of President Kennedy's assassination, who stop at 
nothing in their efforts to mislead the investigation and put it on 
a false trail?'' the statement read.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Verdict Vs. Dow Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a $22.7 million  
libel verdict against Dow Jones &AMP; Co. over a 1993 Wall Street 
Journal article and scheduled a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 22-page ruling last April, U.S. District Judge Ewing  
Werlein Jr. notified the parties in the case that he would dismiss 
the remainder of an original $222.7 million verdict won by Money 
Management Analytical Research Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He formalized that decision Monday and also set a Nov. 5 trial  
date to hear claims that the now-defunct Houston investment firm 
was libeled. MMAR contends that, in an article chronicling the 
company's relationship with a pension fund, reporter Laura Jereski 
published false and defamatory statements that forced it out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	In the earlier ruling, Werlein said MMAR failed to disclose  
audiotapes that would have supported Dow Jones' defense at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, a federal jury returned the $222.7 million  
judgment, the largest libel verdict ever delivered by a jury. Two 
months later, the judge cut the verdict to $22.7 million after he 
heard arguments that MMAR routinely recorded clients' phone calls 
but could not produce one conversation that showed it lost a client 
because of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones attorney David Donaldson has acknowledged inaccuracies  
in the story. But he said the punitive damages would be 
inappropriate unless Ms. Jereski and her editors knew they were 
false. He said they believed the story was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Dow Jones responded to Werlein's dismissal with a  
motion seeking sanctions against the defendant for failing to make 
the information about the tapes available during discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones is seeking an estimated $3.5 million in court costs as  
a result of the plaintiff's omission about the taped information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that motion will be granted,'' Richard Tofel, a Dow  
Jones spokesman, said today. ``We think it's meritorious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to MMAR attorney Kenneth Morris was not immediately  
returned. He has said the firm intends to retry the case.

<HEADLINE>  Suns Trade for Hardaway Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway is on the verge of joining the  
Phoenix Suns, a major acquisition for a team that has almost no 
money under the salary cap and not a lot to offer in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the Orlando Magic had little choice but to  
accept the Suns' offer of Pat Garrity, Danny Manning and two 
first-round draft picks. It was the only offer that remained on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement that the trade was completed was likely to come  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a done deal until we get the league office on the  
phone and we have the transaction take place,'' Suns president 
Jerry Colangelo said Wednesday night. ``And we have not had that 
take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Colangelo gave every indication that the Magic were prepared  
to go through with the trade. Hardaway has told Colangelo that he 
wants to go to the Suns, and the Magic apparently have reluctantly 
gone along. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us that we had a deal in that we've agreed to what  
we're going to give them in terms of compensation,'' Colangelo 
said. ``We took care of our end of the business. That's why I keep 
saying we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been indications that Orlando's management was trying  
mightily to salvage more out of the deal than the Suns were 
offering, either by persuading Hardaway to stay and play for new 
Magic coach Doc Rivers or by finding another interested trading 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic general manager John Gabriel went home Wednesday evening  
without publicly giving his approval to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge decision for us, obviously,'' Gabriel said. ``I  
was in here until midnight trying to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make the trade happen, Hardaway would sign a seven-year, $86  
million contract with Orlando, the largest allowed for a player 
with his experience under the NBA's collective bargaining 
agreement. Then he would be traded to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a major boost to the Suns, who endured a lackluster  
season this year and are handicapped in any efforts to improve by 
the new salary cap. The team used its new $2 million exception 
Wednesday to sign free-agent forward Rodney Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hardaway joins the Suns, he would team with Jason Kidd as one  
of the most formidable backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, 28, has averaged 19 points in six NBA seasons, making  
the All-Star game four times. Nagging injuries have plagued him the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic might be tempted to thwart Hardaway by refusing to  
sign him and allowing him to enter the free-agent market, where he 
could only sign a six-year deal for significantly less money. Only 
Chicago, the Los Angeles Clippers and Toronto appear to have the 
salary cap room to meet his demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gabriel said such a scenario probably won't happen,  
leaving as the only alternatives the nearly impossible task of 
persuading Hardaway to stay in Orlando, or letting him go to 
Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Reach Agreement With Curry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- In a move that angered the Milwaukee Bucks, Dell  
Curry signed a three-year contract Thursday with the Toronto 
Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, who got a three-year, $6 million contract, told the Bucks  
on Sunday that he'd accept their two-year offer worth $1.1 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave his word two times, than changed his mind,'' Bucks'  
general manager Bob Weinhauer said. ``I don't want to talk about 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curry led the NBA in 3-point accuracy last season, shooting 47.6  
percent from behind the arc. With Toronto, he'll be teamed with Dee 
Brown, who led the NBA with 135 3-pointers and 349 3-point attempts 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Raptors' general manager Glen Grunwald acknowledged he offered  
more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was close to a deal with Milwaukee last weekend. We  
made contact with him on the first day of the free agent season. We 
had a very good discussion with his agent and things progressed 
where we jumped at the chance to sign him,'' Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a player of great character,'' Grunwald said.  
``He'll provide firepower off the bench, we're looking forward to 
having his veteran presence and his shooting ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Curry, 35, averaged 10.1 points with the Bucks, his  
first in Milwaukee after 10 seasons with the Charlotte Hornets and 
one each with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, whose career high is 38 points in a game against Toronto  
in 1996, has averaged 12.8 points in his career. He is a career 
40.4 percent 3-point shooter and an 84 percent free-throw shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Grunwald said free agent forward John Wallace is  
about to sign elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``His agent advised me this morning that he's doing something  
else. I assume that's going to happen, with that decision made, we 
decided to go in an another direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunwald also said he's ``still somewhat optimistic'' he can  
resign free agent forward Charles Oakley, who visited with the 
Lakers earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> GM May Build Cars in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will consider becoming the  
first American automaker to build vehicles in Japan since before 
World War II in an effort to boost sales there. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, the world's largest automaker, sold only about 53,000 cars  
and trucks in Japan last year, a small number in a market where 
more than 4 million vehicles are sold each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be successful in Asia without being successful in  
Japan,'' GM spokesman Henry Wong said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong said GM's strategy would include ``establishing a  
manufacturing presence'' in Japan, along with building its dealer 
base, importing models, and relying on its ties to Japan's Isuzu 
Motors Ltd. and Suzuki Motor Corp. Wong declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	GM owns 49 percent of Isuzu and 10 percent of Suzuki. Isuzu has  
been working on truck designs for GM, while Suzuki is known as a 
small-car specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Anya Hayes, an industry analyst with AutoPacific, said Japanese  
consumers might find GM cars more appealing if they were made in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese consumers look on American cars as somewhat lesser in  
quality, and producing in Japan would change that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes also said it would make sense for GM to use an Isuzu or  
Suzuki plant as a base, rather than building a new plant in a 
country that already has too much auto-building capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the cars they import are cost-effective there,  
they would still save more by producing them in Japan,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Japanese companies have built several assembly plants in  
the United States and other countries, no foreign company assembles 
vehicles in Japan. Ford Motor Co. built cars in Japan before World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	That's likely to change now that GM and other foreign companies  
own large stakes of Japanese automakers, Hayes said. Ford owns 33 
percent of Mazda Motor Corp., while French automaker Renault SA 
owns 36.8 percent of Nissan Motor Co.

<HEADLINE>  Suns Trade for Hardaway Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway is on the verge of joining the  
Phoenix Suns, a major acquisition for a team that has almost no 
money under the salary cap and not a lot to offer in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the Orlando Magic had little choice but to  
accept the Suns' offer of Pat Garrity, Danny Manning and two 
first-round draft picks. It was the only offer that remained on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement that the trade was completed was likely to come  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a done deal until we get the league office on the  
phone and we have the transaction take place,'' Suns president 
Jerry Colangelo said Wednesday night. ``And we have not had that 
take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Colangelo gave every indication that the Magic were prepared  
to go through with the trade. Hardaway has told Colangelo that he 
wants to go to the Suns, and the Magic apparently have reluctantly 
gone along. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us that we had a deal in that we've agreed to what  
we're going to give them in terms of compensation,'' Colangelo 
said. ``We took care of our end of the business. That's why I keep 
saying we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been indications that Orlando's management was trying  
mightily to salvage more out of the deal than the Suns were 
offering, either by persuading Hardaway to stay and play for new 
Magic coach Doc Rivers or by finding another interested trading 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic general manager John Gabriel went home Wednesday evening  
without publicly giving his approval to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge decision for us, obviously,'' Gabriel said. ``I  
was in here until midnight trying to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make the trade happen, Hardaway would sign a seven-year, $86  
million contract with Orlando, the largest allowed for a player 
with his experience under the NBA's collective bargaining 
agreement. Then he would be traded to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a major boost to the Suns, who endured a lackluster  
season this year and are handicapped in any efforts to improve by 
the new salary cap. The team used its new $2 million exception 
Wednesday to sign free-agent forward Rodney Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hardaway joins the Suns, he would team with Jason Kidd as one  
of the most formidable backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, 28, has averaged 19 points in six NBA seasons, making  
the All-Star game four times. Nagging injuries have plagued him the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic might be tempted to thwart Hardaway by refusing to  
sign him and allowing him to enter the free-agent market, where he 
could only sign a six-year deal for significantly less money. Only 
Chicago, the Los Angeles Clippers and Toronto appear to have the 
salary cap room to meet his demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gabriel said such a scenario probably won't happen,  
leaving as the only alternatives the nearly impossible task of 
persuading Hardaway to stay in Orlando, or letting him go to 
Arizona.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Fed Needs To Raise Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should consider further  
increases in interest rates to keep its economic expansion from 
falling victim to rising inflation, the International Monetary Fund 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, releasing for the first time a summary of the  
discussions its 24-member executive board as part of its annual 
review of the U.S. economy, said directors were worried that unless 
the Federal Reserve acted soon, it could require even larger rate 
hikes down the road to combat inflation, raising the risks of a 
sharp stock market correction and possible recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Directors cautioned that the economy still faced resource  
constraints, and the recent very strong growth in domestic demand 
could not be sustained for much longer without having inflationary 
consequences,'' the IMF summary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF report noted that the Federal Reserve had raised a key  
interest rate by a quarter point on June 30. That was the first 
increase in two years in the federal funds rate, the interest that 
banks charge each other. There is growing concern in U.S. financial 
markets that the Fed will boost rates a second time when officials 
meet Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF summary said that members of its executive board were  
worried that a single rate rise would not be enough to slow the 
U.S. economy to a more sustainable pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many directors considered that, unless there was evidence soon  
that the strength of demand was abating, the authorities should 
tighten monetary policy further to ensure that the expansion 
remained on a sustainable noninflationary path,'' the IMF summary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They emphasized that waiting too long to act would risk having  
to raise interest rates more sharply later to stem a pickup in 
inflation, which would increase the likelihood of a sharp stock 
market correction,'' the IMF said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation IMF, which took the lead in handling the global  
currency crisis, noted its executive board was not unanimous about 
the need for further U.S. rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some other directors, however, were less inclined to think  
that an increase in interest rates would be called for in the near 
future,'' the summary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the summary of the board's discussions on the  
U.S. economy was part of a pilot program adopted in April under 
which the agency will release greater detail on its annual economic 
reviews if authorized to do so by the member country. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics charged that IMF secrecy was one of the contributing  
factors that triggered the Asian currency crisis because it allowed 
investors to be caught by surprise at the severity of economic 
conditions in a number of crisis countries.

<HEADLINE> Captain Faces Charge in Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) -- An Air Force captain is being  
court-martialed for his relationship with his wife -- whom he met 
when she was a married airman and he was her commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Douglas Bass, 33, is charged with violating military law  
for his relationship with Krystal Carr, 21, an enlisted woman he 
married last month. He could face up to 28 years in prison if 
convicted of all nine counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of having sex with Ms. Carr -- as well as a second  
enlisted woman under his supervision -- and asking others to help 
hide his romance with Ms. Carr and disobeying orders to end the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew it was wrong to date and have sexual relations with  
any enlisted people, especially those he supervised,'' said Larry 
Clavette, a spokesman for Offutt Air Force Base, south of Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass' lawyers are attempting to negotiate a settlement or plea  
bargain, said Lt. Michael Braibish, a spokesman for the 12th Air 
Force, which commands the 55th Wing at Offutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass, who has waited eight months for his court-martial, has  
accused the Air Force of needlessly dragging out his case. He has 
admitted his actions were wrong and said he has believes his 
military career is over. He has declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass was in command of Ms. Carr and her first husband, also an  
airman, when their affair started -- soon after Ms. Carr's husband 
was deployed overseas last August. Bass was divorced at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials ordered Bass to end the relationship in  
February when they learned about the affair. They also found out 
that Bass had a sexual relationship with a staff sergeant, whose 
name was not disclosed, from October 1997 to June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carr served 50 days of a 60-day sentence at the base's jail  
for lying about her relationship with Bass and disobeying orders to 
stay away from him. 
</P>
<P>
	She was released early for good behavior, demoted to the lowest  
enlisted rank and is expected to be released with a general 
discharge after Bass' court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternization among the ranks has remained an issue for the  
military since Lt. Kelly Flinn, the first female B-52 bomber pilot, 
was charged with adultery for having an affair with the husband of 
a female airman in North Dakota. She was allowed to resign in 1997 
and did not face prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Air Force Capt. Joseph Belli, 35, pleaded guilty to  
obstruction of justice and other charges stemming from an affair 
with an enlisted woman at Travis Air Force Base in California. He 
was dismissed from the service and ordered to serve 15 days in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli divorced his wife and mother of their five children and  
married the airman.

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Urges Gore on Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bill Bradley said Thursday that if Vice President  
Al Gore is serious about stopping police departments from using 
racial profiling he should act now, rather than wait for the next 
millennium. ``I say, Why wait?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Gore said he would make the end of racial profiling,  
the police practice of singling out minorities for questioning at 
airports, on highways and on streets, ``the first civil rights act 
of the new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the annual convention of Jesse Jackson's  
Rainbow-PUSH Coalition, Bradley responded, ``Why doesn't he walk 
down the hall, put the executive order in front of the president 
and ask him to sign it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, Gore's only opponent for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, took pains to draw distinctions between his vision and 
the Clinton-Gore administration's civil rights record. But even as 
he did, he saluted the administration for its commitment to race 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech and one by Gore on Saturday amount to separate  
auditions for an endorsement by Jackson and his army of grass-roots 
Democratic mobilizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's the man who's gotten millions and millions of votes for  
president himself. He's also probably registered more Democratic 
voters than anyone in history. It would be foolhardy to ignore 
him,'' said Paul Begala, Clinton's former political strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said no endorsement would be coming soon, calling this  
stage of the presidential campaign ``the exhibition season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, said he is basing his  
presidential campaign on a theme of racial unity and, as president, 
would like to build a multiracial coalition to tackle economic 
disparities, poverty, gun control and health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm staking my presidential campaign on the belief that over  
50 to 60 percent of Americans, including white Americans, want to 
have racial unity,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said the administration had not done enough to end  
poverty, especially among children. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first two-term Democratic president since Franklin  
Roosevelt, the number of children in poverty in America has barely 
blipped down,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reducing the number of children in poverty in America should  
be the North Star for our society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said the administration had created  
``unprecedented'' prosperity, but that more remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past 6 1/2 years have been just a start,'' Salazar said.  
</P>
<P>
	Minority advocates say racial profiling can prove fatal, citing  
the killings of young blacks by police in New York, Pittsburgh and 
Riverside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ordered federal officers -- only a fraction of  
the nation's police -- to collect data on the race and gender of 
those they arrest and then develop a plan to stop racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bositis, a policy analyst at the Joint Center for  
Political and Economic Studies who has studied Jackson's popularity 
and the racial dynamic of national politics, said Bradley can 
barely hope to overcome Gore's popularity with black voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a dime's worth of difference between Al Gore and  
Bill Bradley,'' said Bositis. ``But I've got news for Bill Bradley: 
Bill Clinton is the most popular person among black America and Al 
Gore is right there next to him.''

</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Linda Alma, a high-kicking dancer who  
worked with leading Greek and French artists during her 30-year 
career, died Monday of cancer. She was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alma was born Eleni Malioufa in Athens in 1926. She assumed  
a stage name and rose to fame as the partner of dancer Yannis 
Flery, with whom she moved to Paris in the late 1940s to work with 
French singing legends Edith Piaf, Yves Montand and Charles 
Aznavour. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alma was best known to Greek audiences for her appearances  
in dance sequences in Greek movies, styled on 1950s Hollywood 
musicals, and her 1979 marriage to actor Manos Katrakis, who died 
in 1984.

	SEARSMONT, Maine (AP) -- Rudy Burckhardt, a photographer,  
filmmaker and writer known for his portrayals of city life in New 
York, died Sunday at his summer home in Maine. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss-born Burckhardt, who emigrated to New York in 1935 and  
lived the rest of his life in Manhattan, drowned Sunday in a pond 
near his home. The death was ruled a suicide by Maine's chief 
medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II veteran earned a reputation for his photographs  
of street subjects from the late 1930s to the 1950s. His camera 
captured people on subways and images of the city's vast skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	His photographs are in permanent collections of the Museum of  
Modern Art and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. A film retrospective 
at the Museum of Modern Art honored him in 1987 for his 90-odd 
films using 16-millimeter film. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were comedies, but many were what his widow, Yvonne  
Jacquette, calls ``film poems,'' with poems used as subtitles. Some 
featured New York dancers mixed in with shots of Maine, where he 
spent his summers painting. 
</P>
<P>
	His memoirs include ``Mobile Homes'' in 1979 and ``Talking  
Pictures: The Photography of Rudy Burckhardt'' in 1994.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mohammed Hadid, an economist and politician who  
devoted his life to advocating democracy in Iraq, died in London on 
Tuesday. He was 92 and was admitted to a London hospital four days 
ago after an asthma attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadid, a graduate of the London School of Economics in the  
1920s, became Iraq's finance minister in 1949 when the country was 
ruled by the monarchy. He resigned after less than two months when 
the government failed to hold free elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadid was one of the founders of the opposition National  
Democratic Party in the early 1930s. He was instrumental in the 
July 14, 1958 revolution that toppled the monarchy and established 
the first republic in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadid served as the republic's first finance minister in the  
government of Abdel Karim Qassem. He resigned from the government 
and the National Democratic Party in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Hadid established the National Progressive Party. He  
led it until 1963, when the Arab Baath Socialist Party pulled off a 
bloody coup and ruled Iraq for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baathists killed Qassem and detained Hadid without trial for  
a year until 1964, when he was acquitted by a military tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadid later quit political life and went back into business. His  
negotiations with British oil companies led to the nationalization 
of most of Iraq's oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Saddam Hussein barred him from leaving Iraq  
until four years ago, when he went to London to join his family.

have perfected their taste. 
</P>

stage of the presidential campaign ``the exhibition season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, said he is basing his  
presidential campaign on a theme of racial unity and, as president, 
would like to build a multiracial coalition to tackle economic 
disparities, poverty, gun control and health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm staking my presidential campaign on the belief that over  
50 to 60 percent of Americans, including white Americans, want to 
have racial unity,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said the administration had not done enough to end  
poverty, especially among children. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first two-term Democratic president since Franklin  
Roosevelt, the number of children in poverty in America has barely 
blipped down,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reducing the number of children in poverty in America should  
be the North Star for our society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said the administration had created  
``unprecedented'' prosperity, but that more remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past 6 1/2 years have been just a start,'' Salazar said.  
</P>
<P>
	Minority advocates say racial profiling can prove fatal, citing  
the killings of young blacks by police in New York, Pittsburgh and 
Riverside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ordered federal officers -- only a fraction of  
the nation's police -- to collect data on the race and gender of 
those they arrest and then develop a plan to stop racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bositis, a policy analyst at the Joint Center for  
Political and Economic Studies who has studied Jackson's popularity 
and the racial dynamic of national politics, said Bradley can 
barely hope to overcome Gore's popularity with black voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a dime's worth of difference between Al Gore and  
Bill Bradley,'' said Bositis. ``But I've got news for Bill Bradley: 
Bill Clinton is the most popular person among black America and Al 
Gore is right there next to him.''

<HEADLINE> HUD Won't Sue Gun Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal housing officials could end up  
supporting or joining one of a string of lawsuits filed against gun 
manufacturers over the damages firearms cause, a government lawyer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Department of Housing and Urban Development has no plans  
to file such a suit on its own, HUD General Counsel Gail W. Laster 
told a House subcommittee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laster's remarks before the House Government Reform Committee's  
panel on criminal justice drew angry responses from House 
Republicans who said it was preposterous to blame the gun industry 
for the acts of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I am baffled by the idea that the makers of  
guns are seen by anyone as being somehow legally responsible for 
those who acquire the weapons and misuse them,'' said subcommittee 
Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., who called the meeting after a Wall 
Street Journal article last week reported on HUD's exploration of 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they didn't understand what all the fuss was  
about. It's perfectly appropriate for HUD to explore any idea that 
improves the safety of public housing residents and reduces the 
money the federal government must spend on security, Rep. Henry 
Waxman, D-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be in a fury over the fact that HUD may be thinking of  
something some of them don't like is certainly a strange notion,'' 
Waxman said. ``The Republican leadership is willing to jump to 
defend their friends ... even though some of their friends make 
products that kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago  
and New Orleans, have filed suits accusing gunmakers of failing to 
equip weapons with adequate safety devices and marketing them in 
ways that allow them to fall into the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the NAACP filed suit against nearly 100 handgun makers  
in federal court, seeking injunctions that would place sweeping 
restrictions on handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Laster said department officials have responded to questions  
from public housing authorities contemplating or involved in the 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
	And the department has conferred with private attorneys to  
increase its understanding of the issue, Laster said. A HUD lawyer 
traveled to a New York law firm last week for discussions, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun manufactures testifying at the hearing called the suits  
fundamentally unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make a lawful product,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel for  
Beretta USA Corp. ``We do not want our products to go into criminal 
hands.''

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- No nerve-fraying penalty kicks or  
shirt-ripping celebrations this time. This was another women's 
soccer team from the United States, doing things its own way and 
enjoying it just as much. 
</P>
<P>
	And now the U.S. 18-and-under team has something in common with  
its sisters from the World Cup: a championship. In fact, a gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Reddick went solo, scoring after a series of  
magnificent moves in the first half, and goalie Hope Solo had an 
act of her own Thursday as the United States edged Mexico 1-0 in 
the Pan American Games final. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World Cup team was pressing on for the gold and they got  
it. You set your standards so high to be like them,'' Reddick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the World Cup is in my future. It's my goal right  
now. The Pan Ams is the biggest game of all of our lives right now. 
It's so special, right after the World Cup to live up to what they 
did. It's such a great experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reddick, a 17-year-old high school senior from Birmingham, Ala.,  
chest-trapped the ball near midfield, dribbled about 40 yards, 
juked two defenders in front of the penalty area and then drove a 
right-footed shot high over Mexican goalie Linny Quinones in the 
26th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw I had a shot and said, `Please go in.' And it went in,''  
Reddick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solo and the Americans' defense made it last. Solo, who plays at  
the University of Washington, was unscored upon in the three 
matches she started. Her fully extended block of a shot by Iris 
Mora in the 53rd minute and her diving stop of a shot in the 
penalty area by Fatima Leyva in the 87th preserved the U.S. lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our own expectations, because we are a different  
team,'' Solo said. ``We are not the USA team, not the World Cup 
team. So we had to establish our own expectations and distinguish 
ourselves. And it wasn't just because they won. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they intrigued us and they inspired us.''  
</P>
<P>
	Two American boxers put on inspired efforts, with mixed results  
</P>
<P>
	Super heavyweight Davin King moved into the final against Cuba's  
Alexis Rubalcaba by shutting out Argentina's Manuel Azar 4-0, 
staying outside and fighting defensively after building an early 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnell Wilson of Chicago lost 9-8 to Cuban star Jorge  
Gutierrez. The bout was tied 7-7, then Wilson took a one-point 
lead. Gutierrez tied it and scored a winning punch in the final 20 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows me how far I have come,'' said Wilson, who gets a  
bronze medal. ``There are a lot of boxers leaving here with 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's basketball team played Cuba in the semifinals.  
Americans Paul Goldstein and Cecil Mamiit played for the men's 
singles title in tennis, while teammate Tara Snyder took on Maria 
Vento of Venezuela for the women's crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The American soccer team bowed in a chorus line after its  
victory and took a lap around the field after getting the gold 
medals. The United States, tied by Mexico 1-1 in the preliminary 
round for its only blemish, outscored its opponents 22-2 in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's best first-half scoring chance was foiled as Solo came  
to the front of the goal area to block a shot. The Mexicans got the 
rebound, but defender Karyn Hall cleared a shot off the goal line, 
giving Solo time to regain her feet. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. defender Nandy Pryce left in the first half when she took a  
rebound of her own clearing attempt in the face. And Becky Myers 
was forced out in the 80th minute after suffering a probable broken 
nose as she tried to head the ball and collided with Solo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to show we belonged in this game,'' Mexican coach  
Leonardo Cuellar said. ``I feel we have a long way to go. We had a 
group here who came to give a good show. We have to respect the 
U.S. They are still 20 years ahead of us.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Amid Turmoil / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds rose for a second straight session  
Thursday, as turmoil in other fixed- rate investments led investors 
to seek the security of U.S. Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32  
point, or $7.18 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, a key 
influence on long-term borrowing costs, fell to 6.04 percent from 
6.09 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sought the safety of government debt in uneven trading  
on an abrupt drop in the value of derivatives known as swaps and 
corporate bonds relative to the value of Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	The nongovernment debt markets declined amid vague rumors of  
financial problems at swap dealers, investment banks and other 
financial institutions. As a result, investors closed out positions 
involving those products and bought back Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	Derivatives are securities whose value is tied to, or derived  
from, an underlying asset, such as bonds. In the case of swaps, 
corporate treasurers try to protect their businesses from rising 
interest costs by trading in sophisticated securities that provide 
one party with a fixed return and the other with an interest rate 
that floats. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, when interest rates were rising rapidly, bad bets on  
interest rate derivatives caused significant losses for some 
companies and led to the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the appeal of the safety of Treasurys were fears  
of building tensions between China and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market's advance came despite a report that U.S.  
productivity growth decelerated in the second quarter to a 1.3 
percent annual rate -- its smallest increase since the second 
quarter of 1998. Productivity growth has been viewed as a major 
reason that the strong the U.S. economy has not resulted in a 
rebound in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising inflation reduces the value of fixed-income investments  
like bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 1/8 point to 5/32 point, while intermediate-term Treasurys rose 
5/16 to 15/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
fell to 4.71 percent while the discount fell to 4.59 percent, down 
0.04 percentage point from Wednesday's levels. Yields on six-month 
Treasurys fell to 4.93 percent as the discount fell to 4.74 
percent, down 0.04 percentage point. One-year yields fell to 5.01 
percent as the discount fell to 4.77 percent, down 0.05 percentage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.06 1/4 percent from Wednesday's 4.87 1/2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/16 point to 117 1/16. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.61 percent from 5.60 percent on 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hike Has Shoe for Car Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Athletic apparel giant Nike is hoping to  
shift sales into high gear with a new line of shoes aimed at the 
fast-paced world of auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beaverton-based sneaker-maker announced plans Thursday for  
flame-retardant shoes with sticky traction treads specially 
designed for race car drivers and their pit crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're creating footwear for a whole different set of  
athlete,'' Nike Inc. spokesman Scott Reames said. ``Our whole 
premise is to make the driver and the team perform a little better, 
a little faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the shoes target NASCAR and CART racers, they will also be  
marketed to their millions of fans, Reames added. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for the four different shoes will range from less than  
$100 for the Air Pit Demon to more than $200 for the Air Zoom Drive 
Pro. Dubbed Nike Racing, the line will make its debut in February 
2000 to coincide with the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup at the Daytona 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts question whether such a niche market is worth  
pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``By itself, it's just not going to have much of an impact,''  
said Mike Shea, an analyst with D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in Portland. 
``I don't think the product category is big enough to move the 
needle much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nike is betting a new line of shoes will help fuel the company's  
turnaround from a 1999 fiscal year that saw sales drop by nearly 
$800 million, or 8 percent, from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR sponsors have reported a series of record attendance and  
TV audience figures this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Nike has line up some big name drivers to wear its  
shoes, including Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte, Tony Stewart, Adam 
Petty and two-time Indy 500 and CART series champion Al Unser Jr.

<HEADLINE> Swissair Offers To Settle in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Swissair said Thursday it will compensate  
the financial losses of the 229 people killed in a 1998 crash off 
the coast of Nova Scotia, provided the victims' families agree not 
to pursue punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree to share liability for the accident and pay full  
compensatory damages for each passenger and crew member,'' Swissair 
attorney Desmond Barry told a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Swissair and two of the three other co-defendants --  
Boeing, which owns the company that built the MD-11 jetliner, and 
Delta Airlines, which had a ticket-sharing deal with Swissair -- 
would not contest whether they were to blame for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair said the move does not represent an admission of guilt.  
</P>
<P>
	As part of the proposed deal, plaintiffs in 167 cases would  
agree to waive punitive damages. Barry also requested that about 
120 of the cases be dismissed from U.S. court for litigation in 
France or Switzerland because many of the passengers on the plane 
were from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair is facing claims totaling $16 billion from families of  
U.S. victims suing on grounds of gross negligence, although 
attorneys expected a jury award would be far short of that figure. 
The company said it has reached settlements with relatives of five 
victims in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer was revealed Thursday at a pretrial conference that  
had been planned to sort out procedural technicalities. It came as 
a surprise to the plaintiffs' attorneys, who weren't told about the 
offer beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is extraordinary,'' said Lee Kreindler, the lead counsel  
for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the deal would be accepted. Kreindler  
predicted many of the cases will be settled in the coming month, 
although some of the 30 plaintiffs' attorneys said they weren't so 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially what the defense contends is that they're willing  
to pay economic damages only and avoid pain and suffering damages 
for the U.S. plaintiffs and essentially ignore the foreign 
plaintiffs,'' said plaintiffs' attorney Arthur Wolk of 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 111, en route from New York to Geneva, crashed in  
September after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit. All 229 
people on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still have not identified the cause of the fire  
that sent the smoke into the cockpit. But Canadian investigators 
found heat-damaged wiring aboard the crashed MD-11, prompting U.S. 
air safety officials in January to recommend that airlines inspect 
all MD-11 jetliners for electrical wiring problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair said Tuesday that a flight attendant on the MD-11 had  
reported strange smells in the cabin less than a month before the 
fatal crash. No problems were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth defendant, Inflight Technologies, which provided the  
plane's electronic entertainment system, was not involved in 
Thursday's offer. The company is defending its case in California 
courts, but an attorney said its client would consider joining the 
deal.

<HEADLINE> L.L. Bean Wrestles With Wrong No. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEPORT, Maine (AP) -- L.L. Bean is scrambling to minimize  
damage after putting the wrong phone number in a catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	The outdoors outfitter's L.L. Bean Kids' Back-to-School '99  
catalog features the number 1-800-LLB-KIDS. But the toll-free 
number should have been 1-877-LLB-KIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, an unsuspecting company was clobbered by a flood of  
phone calls from Bean customers hoping to buy teddy-bear backpacks, 
children's cargo vests and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	The error was detected almost immediately when the catalogs  
arrived in customer's mailboxes last week, said Rich Donaldson, 
L.L. Bean's public relations manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson declined to identify the company other than to say it  
was located in Virginia and that it was a child-oriented business. 
</P>
<P>
	L.L. Bean has assumed the incorrect phone number listed in its  
catalog to ensure that callers reach Maine. The Boston Globe 
reported today that financial settlement is being worked out.

	Tech Stocks Keep Sinking  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The big selloff in Internet stocks that began  
quietly during the spring is suddenly accelerating, decimating the 
phenomenal gains achieved this year by many high-profile online 
companies. Considered almost invincible early this year, online 
stocks dragged down the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index for 
a fifth straight day yesterday, leaving it a painful 11.3 percent 
lower than the all-time high it reached July 16. The 40-stock Dow 
Jones Internet Index has shed more than 40 percent of its value 
since it hit an all-time high on April 13. Amazon.com is at 88 7/16 
after hitting a high of 221 1/4 in April. America Online is at 87 7/16 
compared to a 52-week high of 175 1/2. eBay's 52-week high was 234. 
It's now at 75 3/4. Marketwatch.com is off from 129 to 27 5/16. 

</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq Down 11 Percent Since Peak  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The sell-off of tech stocks continues. The  
Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen 11.3 percent since its July 16 
record high close of 2,864.48. Traditionally, Wall Street considers 
a drop of at least 10 percent a correction, a milestone symbolizing 
weakness in markets. Yesterday, Internet bookseller Amazon.com fell 
6 7/16 to 88 7/16, while online auctioneer eBay dropped 8 5/8 to 75 3/4. 

</P>
<P>
	Dow Loses 2.54; Nasdaq Falls 47.99  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks collapsed in the final  
half-hour of trading yesterday, deflating a rally fueled by a $9.3 
billion merger of Dow Chemical and Union Carbide. The broader 
market, plagued by fears of inflation, declined much more steeply. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.54 points to close at 
10,674.77. The Dow, following what is becoming a familiar pattern, 
gave up nearly all its gains late in the day and wiped out what had 
been a 152-point gain. Other market indicators fared worse. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 16.85 to 1,305.33, and the Nasdaq 
composite index fell 47.99 to 2,540.00. 

</P>
<P>
	Dow Industrials Now Have Vacancy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Speculation has begun on who will fill a vacancy  
in one of the world's most exclusive clubs -- the 30 stocks that 
make up the Dow Jones industrial average -- following the 
acquisition of Union Carbide Corp. by Dow Chemical Co. The $9.3 
billion deal announced yesterday would create the world's 
second-largest chemical business behind DuPont Co. and a lucrative 
opening in the Dow. Inclusion in Wall Street's best-known indicator 
establishes a company as a leader in its own industry and in the 
economy at large. And investment funds tied to the Dow index 
performance are bound by their charter to buy shares of the 
components. 

</P>
<P>
	Most Asian Markets Decline  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stocks closed sharply lower today,  
following a sharp overnight fall on Wall Street. In Tokyo, the 
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 327.19 points, or 1.85 percent, 
to 17,358.19. On Wednesday, the average fell 1.58 percent. In Hong 
Kong, shares plunged 2.5 percent after four straight sessions of 
gains. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 336.68 points to close at 
13,254.34. The Taiwan Weighted Price Index fell 151.07 points, or 
2.1 percent, to 6,959.73. 

</P>

	Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits inched up last week after hitting their 
lowest level in two years the week before. The Labor Department 
reported today that 279,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless 
benefits for the week ending July 31, up by 4,000 from the previous 
week. Last week's level was the highest since July 17, when claims 
were at 315,000. Jobless claims had plunged by 40,000 to 275,000, 
the lowest level in two years, for the week ending July 24. The 
Labor Department will announce second-quarter productivity numbers 
at 10 a.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Probe: Dog Chewed Plane's Wires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dog bites man is commonplace. Man bites dog, a  
little weird. But dog bites plane? 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities at Logan Airport said an Irish wolfhound freed  
itself from a kennel during a United Airlines flight to San 
Francisco and chewed up the cargo area. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog, whose name was not released, managed to gnaw into wires  
for the Boeing 767's landing gear, its cockpit warning lights and 
others that slowed the plane upon landing by extending its wing 
flaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials said the pilot was able to land the plane  
safely in San Francisco, albeit at a slightly faster speed than 
normal because of the impaired flaps. The July 24 flight was 
carrying 159 passengers and a crew of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Aviation Administration officials say dogs have damaged  
airplanes before, but this is the first time a dog is believed to 
have caused service difficulties for a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline is still investigating how the dog got loose.  
Luggage handlers reported that when they opened the cargo door, 
they found the dog wagging his tail, apparently eager to disembark.

<HEADLINE> Bill Protects Rights of Unborn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unborn children would be protected by federal  
criminal law for the first time under a bill a House subcommittee 
has approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law does not now treat unborn children the same as the  
living. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the bill was overdue. Opponents claimed it was  
an attempt to undermine Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision 
that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Life Committee, which supports the measure  
and helped draft it, said the legislation was the first of its kind 
at the federal level. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee's constitution subcommittee voted  
5-2 for the bill Wednesday, sending it to the full committee for 
consideration. The full House and Senate also must act on it before 
it can go to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, anyone who intentionally or unintentionally  
injured or killed an unborn child while committing a federal crime, 
such as a kidnapping or bank robbery, would be charged with an 
additional federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would amend federal criminal law and the Uniform  
Code of Military Justice. It would not apply to an abortion that a 
pregnant woman agreed to have, or to acts by such a woman that 
could affect her unborn. 
</P>
<P>
	It defines an unborn child as a ``member of the species homo  
sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven states already have similar laws.  
</P>
<P>
	``What this bill seeks to do is face up to the reality that an  
unborn child is not a nothing,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a 
staunch abortion opponent who is chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents criticized the effort to distinguish between a woman  
and her fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such separation is merely the first step toward eroding a  
woman's right to determine the fate of her own pregnancy and to 
direct the course of her own health care,'' the American Civil 
Liberties Union said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a prime sponsor of the bill,  
said it would not prohibit abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're focusing on criminal misconduct directed toward a  
pregnant woman and her unborn child,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other prime sponsors are Republican Reps. Charles Canady of  
Florida and Christopher Smith of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2436.

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease, Stroke Deaths Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Deaths from heart disease and stroke continue to  
decline because of greater awareness of causes and preventive 
measures, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, heart disease and stroke remain leading causes of  
disability and death, and estimated costs including health 
expenditures and lost productivity are expected to be $286 billion 
in 1999, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health care professionals have long observed a decline in  
fatality due to cardiovascular diseases in the United States. Death 
rates from coronary and hypertensive heart disease and rheumatic 
heart disease have decreased from a peak of 307.4 per 100,000 in 
1950 to 134.6 in 1996, a decline of 56 percent, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke deaths have decreased 70 percent in that time, from 88.8  
per 100,000 in 1950 to 26.5 in 1996, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause for the decline is attributed to many factors,  
including a drop in cigarette smoking among adults, an increase in 
medication for those with high blood pressure, improvements in 
medical care and diagnosis, and a greater awareness of proper diet 
as a preventive measure, such as lower fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the CDC said the overall reduction in deaths from heart  
disease and stroke masks differences in rates broken down by 
race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status and geographic region. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1985-1996, for example, heart disease mortality declined  
29 percent among white men but only 10 percent among American 
Indian men and native Alaskan women. People of lower socioeconomic 
status have higher risks levels, and geographic areas with higher 
levels of those groups have higher incidence of the diseases and 
deaths.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Joins 500 Club, Hits No.501 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire became the 16th member of the  
500-home run club Thursday night, beating Tony Gwynn to his 
3,000-hit milestone with a third-inning shot to dead center field. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire became the fastest player ever to reach 500 homers,  
doing it in his 5,487th at-bat. Babe Ruth held the previous mark, 
having done it in 5,801 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, McGwire also hit No. 501, with both home runs coming off  
San Diego's Andy Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	The sellout crowd had come to Busch Stadium hoping to see  
history, and the St. Louis star did not make his fans wait long. 
McGwire hit a hanging, 1-1 breaking ball an estimated 451 feet over 
the wall for No. 500. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth, McGwire launched a 479-foot shot off the  
scoreboard in left-center field, his longest of the season at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The solo shots gave McGwire 44 homers this year, moving him two  
ahead of Sammy Sosa for the major league lead. McGwire tops the NL 
with 101 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Every player with 500 home runs eligible for the Hall of Fame  
has been elected to the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire connected in the same ballpark where he broke Roger  
Maris' 37-year-old homer record last Sept. 8 when he hit No. 62. 
McGwire went on to hit 70 homers, finishing ahead of Sosa in a race 
that captivated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting a fly ball that was caught on the center-field  
warning track in the first inning, McGwire came back to hit his 
16th home run in 21 games -- and his fourth-longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, however, remains slightly behind last year's pace. His  
44th homer this season came in the Cardinals' 109th game; last 
year, he hit 44 in the first 104 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500th ball cleared the wall and deflected off the base of an  
advertisement, then landed in an area of shrubbery beyond the wall 
as fans scrambled to come up with the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Shearer, a 28-year-old architect from St. Louis, wound up  
with the souvenir and was whisked away by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of joked about it before,'' said his wife, Jennifer.  
``He said if it comes this way, get out of here, and so I did. I 
said he should give it back. He said he's going to sell out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who needed two hits to reach the vaunted 3,000 mark, took  
off his glove in right field and applauded as McGwire rounded the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire jumped on home plate with both feet before being greeted  
by teammates, who exchanged his signature fake gut punches along 
with high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire then made his second curtain call in as many nights as  
Ashby stood off the mound, looking out towards center field. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit his 400th home run last season, couldn't have  
had a much better foil for his 500th. That homer made him 7-for-14 
against Ashby with three homers and four doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, St. Louis manager Tony La Russa compared the  
atmosphere to the Cubs-Cardinals series last September. That's 
when, with Sosa standing in right field, McGwire surpassed Maris' 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something happens, everybody will go nuts,'' he said. ``If  
it doesn't happen, it's going to be an event just to be here with 
the possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has reached his last four big milestones, starting with  
Nos. 61, 62 and 70 last year, in front of the home fans. He wanted 
to hit No. 500 in St. Louis, too, and did it just in time -- the 
Cardinals begin a road trip Friday with a doubleheader at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to reach 500 homers was Eddie Murray on Sept. 6,  
1996, at Baltimore against Detroit's Felipe Lira. Murray is 15th on 
the career list with 504. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has already passed five players on the list this season  
-- Lou Gehrig (493), Stan Musial and Willie Stargell (475) and Dave 
Winfield (465). 
</P>
<P>
	Musial was at Busch Stadium for the big night and sat next to  
fellow Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock, the last NL player to 
reach 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, McGwire is a year older than Ruth was when he reached  
500. He's had to make up for lost time after totaling 18 home runs 
in injury-plagued 1993 and '94 seasons for Oakland, and the homer 
put him on pace to hit 64 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn began the night close to his milestone, and was on edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared to death,'' he said before the game. ``I'm nervous.  
I've never been this nervous before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the national anthem singer seemed jittery, forgetting the  
words midway through the song.

<HEADLINE> Assets of Mutual Funds Increase / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds shot up by $12.83 billion in the latest week to $885 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $10.87 billion to $733.35 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets rose by $1.96 billion to $151.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $7.94 billion  
to $593.47 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $7.29 billion to $544.46 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $650.6 million to 
$49.01 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.478 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.458 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.50 percent from 4.47 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.46 percent from 4.44 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.60 percent from 4.57  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.56 percent from 4.53 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, down from 58 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.04 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held steady at 0.85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.25 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.23 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.57 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.56 
percent; 4.85 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.83 percent; and 
5.04 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.00 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ralph Lauren Wins Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Polo Ralph Lauren has won a trademark  
infringement lawsuit against Westchester Media Co., publisher of 
Polo Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Wednesday gave Westchester 90 days to stop  
using the Polo name, saying the magazine would cause consumer 
confusion with the clothing, fragrance and home furnishings 
designer. The ruling was issued in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Polo Ralph Lauren asked Westchester to give up the name after  
its overhaul from a small specialty publication into a slick, 
broader-focused magazine that launched with about 1 million issues. 
Westchester responded by suing to protect the name secured by 
founder and former publisher Ami Shinitski in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the magazine had argued that it is the official  
publication of the U.S. Polo Association despite its transformation 
into a glossy lifestyles journal.

<HEADLINE> TV Calls In the Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- My patience is wearing thin. How come nobody  
calls? 
</P>
<P>
	Listen up, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel, ``Dateline,''  
``Nightline'' and ``Today'': I want my shot at stardom! I want my 
15 minutes as an on-air expert! 
</P>
<P>
	After all, what I've got, TV news can't get enough of: opinions  
and verbosity. EXPERT opinions and verbosity, that is, from people 
cast by TV news in guest-starring roles as experts in whatever they 
do in real life. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual breaking news can carry TV only so far in covering a  
story, especially a big one. Solid information comes in fits and 
starts. Relevant video may be limited. How's a big story without a 
commensurate bounty of show-and-tell supposed to span endless hours 
of airtime? 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder experts are needed. They're as important to TV news as  
a snowmaking machine is to a ski resort. You can't count on Nature 
for favorable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, I stand ready to join TV's know-it-alls. I'm  
happy to weigh in on pennies, sun block, Kosovo, Woodstock, women's 
soccer, potty training or Talk magazine. And I can do it with crisp 
authority or indignant bluster -- you make the call. Put me on the 
left. Put me on the right. Just put me on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, I'd even go on MSNBC's ``Watch It! With Laura Ingraham,''  
and she scares me to death. Anything is better than being ignored 
by TV time after time, news event after news event. 
</P>
<P>
	And anything is better than living with my father's reproach:  
``When are ya gonna get on TV like that Jonathan Alter character (a 
Newsweek editor who lately has popped up more often than those 
'Power for Living' commercials)? Why do you think your mother and I 
made so many sacrifices?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What can I say? ``Gosh, Dad, the news channels take people in  
alphabetical order''? 
</P>
<P>
	I'm not getting any younger! I want to log some face time before  
I need a facelift. I want to establish myself as a brand that I can 
leverage into a franchise, then use to launch my own talk show, Web 
site, self-help books and chain of theme restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way being an on-air expert works, as New York Times  
columnist Frank Rich suggested a few days ago. Rich wrote of the 
``fast friends'' of John F. Kennedy Jr. who, after his fatal plane 
crash, came on TV to prattle self-servingly about the man they 
claimed to know. 
</P>
<P>
	After checking around, Rich labeled as impostors or  
grandstanders ``almost all of those who passed themselves off as 
Kennedy chums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, it's never too late to forge a friendship,  
even posthumously -- especially if it certifies one's status as a 
TV-worthy expert. 
</P>
<P>
	So what do I have to do to certify mine? That's what I was  
wondering last month, sitting by the phone, watching nonstop 
coverage of the Kennedy-Bessette tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Didn't you know? I was a friend of John's!  
</P>
<P>
	I used to party with him.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, I went to a party with him.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, it was more like a reception. Last winter. I was there. So  
was he. I didn't talk to him. He was busy talking with Tom Brokaw 
and Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	But while I stood in line for the finger food, I remember  
concluding, ``John's a simple man. Yet complicated.'' I definitely 
think he would have run for office. Unless he chose not to. I 
remember thinking that, too. 
</P>
<P>
	And don't forget, my expertise extends beyond the Kennedys.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, TV coverage of last week's tragic shootings in  
Atlanta could have used my expert input. 
</P>
<P>
	I know almost as much about day trading as I do about crazed  
killers, and years ago I lived less than a mile down Piedmont Road 
from the Buckhead brokerages where the massacre took place. I could 
have told a TV audience about Atlanta's dogwoods in spring and all 
the nights I spent in a nearby bar playing Pac-Man. I could have 
even explained where the name ``Buckhead'' came from. 
</P>
<P>
	And while I'm on the subject of Atlanta, I'd like to mention  
that I went to the same Atlanta high school that President Carter's 
daughter Amy later attended. After graduation, she went to Brown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, of course, is the alma mater of JFK Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	Did I mention that John and I used to be friends?  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Plant Evolution Theories Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The plant and animal kingdoms actually  
represent five distinct groups, according to scientists who 
announced discoveries that fundamentally alter long-standing 
theories about the evolution of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers presented data showing that green plants, red plants  
and brown plants (mostly algae and seaweeds), evolved from three 
different one-celled plants, and so deserve to be considered 
individual kingdoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers are among 200 scientists from 12 countries  
involved in the ``Deep Green'' project, a five-year effort to 
reconstruct the evolutionary tree of life for green plants. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that the many families of green plants living on land  
today descended from a single, green freshwater ``Eve,'' a relative 
of which still lives in pristine lakes as it did more than a 
billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	New data indicate that the ``Eve'' was something similar to  
today's coleochaetes, tiny green plants about the size of a pinhead 
and just one cell thick, which require fresh water that is 
completely free of pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This overturns traditional thinking among scientists and what  
is taught in every textbook in America,'' said Brent Mishler, a 
biologist at the University of California at Berkeley and one of 
the team leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Current texts say land plants evolved from saltwater plants.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists involved in the study presented their work Wednesday  
in St. Louis at the 16th International Botanical Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has produced the most complete tree of life of any  
group of living things on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings are important because evolutionary relationships  
among plants are crucial in knowing how plants work. Understanding 
this allows researchers to examine chemicals in plants for their 
medicinal value. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Deep Green's other key findings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The members of what has traditionally been called the plant  
kingdom should actually be divided into four separate kingdoms. 
</P>
<P>
	-- One of those kingdoms, fungi, is more closely related to  
animals than to plants. That means a mushroom is more closely 
related to a human being than the tree it grows on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't really think of life on Earth in terms of only the  
`animal kingdom' and the `plant kingdom' anymore,'' Mishler said. 
``In fact, there are five kingdoms of complex organisms on Earth 
today.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Phone Plan Targets Reservations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the agency's first focused study of the  
problem, the Federal Communications Commission is looking at ways 
to encourage phone and wireless carriers to expand their services 
to underserved areas, particularly American Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's proposal could result in additional federal  
funds being set aside as incentives for carriers to extend their 
services to reservations. It also could help low-income consumers 
pay for those services, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shameful that we enter the 21st century when the basic  
telecommunications services of the 20th century are not enjoyed by 
the nation's oldest people,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While nearly 95 percent of American homes have telephones, only  
about one half of American Indian homes do, Kennard said. A report 
issued in April by the Benton Foundation, a nonprofit public policy 
group, revealed the problem was much worse on some reservations 
where 80 percent of homes do not have telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC held hearings on the matter earlier this year on Indian  
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think for a moment what it's like not to have a  
telephone in 1999, you can understand why we need to have a sense 
of urgency,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because some reservations lack basic infrastructures, such as  
phone lines, wireless and satellite services offer other ways to 
get telecommunication services to reservations, Kennard said. The 
commission is looking at incentives, such as discounted licenses, 
to encourage wireless carriers to expand their services. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials may also relax certain limits on the height and power  
of wireless transmission towers -- specifications that were designed 
for an urban environment, but may not provide effective service on 
a reservation or rural land. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the public, industry and others would be able to  
comment on the proposals, which are subject to revision, before any 
final order is made. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also wants to look at the factors impeding efforts to  
improve phone service on reservations. Lack of financial incentives 
for carriers to serve sparsely populated or remote areas and even 
cultural issues may account for limited service and low numbers of 
subscribers, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, chairman of the Senate  
Indian Affairs Committee, urged the FCC to expedite action to bring 
services to American Indian communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless your agency acts quickly, I am concerned that our  
country's national policy of guaranteeing every citizen -- no matter 
where they live -- affordable basic phone service will be 
threatened,'' wrote Campbell, R-Colo.

<HEADLINE> EPA Reports Dangers in Eating Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Marshaling more evidence about the scope of  
PCB contamination in the Hudson River, federal authorities said 
that eating fish from a northern section of the river increases the 
risk of cancer to unacceptable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, released Wednesday by the Environmental Protection  
Agency, said the risk of cancer and other health problems would 
continue above acceptable levels for decades unless the river is 
cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA is deciding whether to order a dredging of the upper  
Hudson, a 40-mile stretch of water from Troy, near Albany, to 
Hudson Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric, which could be forced to spend billions of  
dollars to clean up PCBs it released into the river decades ago, 
has questioned the need for dredging. The EPA's proposal is due in 
December 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Based upon their own computer models, EPA researchers calculated  
an increased risk of one additional case of cancer for every 
thousand people eating one meal a week of fish from the upper 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	``This increased cancer risk is 1,000 times higher than the  
EPA's goal for protection and 10 times the highest risk level 
generally allowed under the federal Superfund law,'' according to 
the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials already have standing advisories warning  
people not to eat fish from the upper Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric spokesman Mark Behan said the company will  
analyze the EPA reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no credible evidence that PCBs in the Hudson River  
pose a risk to people or wildlife,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a companion report, the EPA said animals higher in the food  
chain than PCB-contaminated fish may also face health and 
reproductive risks. Largemouth bass, striped bass, bald eagles, 
belted kingfishers, great blue herons, mink and river otter were 
among the animals listed. 
</P>
<P>
	PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used as an insulating  
material in electric equipment. They were banned by the federal 
government in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Newsome To Be Inducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ozzie Newsome was destined for stardom the  
first time he touched a football in an NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the handoff on a reverse in his first pro game, Newsome,  
a rookie from Alabama, sprinted 33 yards into the end zone as the 
Cleveland Browns beat the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, more than two decades later, Newsome will cross  
football's ultimate goal line when he's inducted into the Hall of 
Fame in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 13-year career, Newsome helped redefine the tight end  
position while earning the nickname ``Wizard of Oz'' for making 
improbable catches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew if I threw the ball anywhere near Ozzie, he was  
probably going to catch it,'' Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome will become the fifth tight end to be inducted into the  
Hall when he's enshrined with the rest of the Class of '99: 
linebacker Lawrence Taylor, running back Eric Dickerson, and guards 
Tom Mack and Billy Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	As tight ends go, Newsome, who played his entire career with the  
Browns, was in a class by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome's 662 career catches are the most ever at the position.  
He scored 47 TDs and racked up 7,980 receiving yards. He played in 
197 consecutive games and had a streak of catching at least one 
pass in 150 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the emergence of Newsome and San Diego's Kellen Winslow  
in the late 1970s, tight ends were predominantly blockers who only 
got a chance to catch the ball when quarterbacks couldn't find 
anyone else open. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, a wide receiver at 'Bama, was moved to tight end by  
Browns coach Sam Rutigliano, who wanted to take advantage of 
Newsome's size -- 6-foot-2, 225 pounds -- and speed in matchups 
against linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sam said, `We're going to throw you the football,''' Newsome  
said. ``So I told him, `If you throw it, I'll catch it.' He kept 
his end of the bargain and I kept mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome had made a similar promise to his college coach, Bear  
Bryant, who preached to his players about respecting their 
opponent, and taught them never to showboat on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Alabama, we were always taught to show our class,'' Newsome  
said. ``And when you got into the end zone, act like you'd been 
there before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome momentarily forgot one of the Bear's credos when he  
scored that first TD for the Browns. He spiked the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never did that again, and Monday morning I called coach  
Bryant and apologized,'' he said. ``He hadn't realized I had done 
it. He just appreciated that I was thoughtful enough to call him 
and let him know I had come out of character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A truer testament of Newsome's character came in 1989 when he  
was forced to the sideline with a minor injury against Houston. His 
consecutive game reception streak was at 150, and needing another 
catch to keep it alive, Newsome instead decided to stay out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stopped it (the streak) on my own,'' he said. ``I probably  
could have went back in and played, but I think that would have 
cheapened it. I think 150 was a good stopping point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, who will be presented by former teammate Calvin Hill in  
Canton, is being enshrined the same weekend the Browns are making 
their NFL return. 
</P>
<P>
	For Newsome, the timing couldn't be better.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was worth the wait,'' he said. ``There were disappointments  
in the first year, the second year, and the third year when I got 
into the final six and didn't make it. But to be going in at the 
same time those guys are going back out on the field, those orange 
helmets and football back on the lakefront. It was worth the 
wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, now Baltimore's vice president of player personnel, is  
regarded by some Cleveland fans as a traitor for leaving with Art 
Modell when he took his team away in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, however, said he had no choice. To wait three years, he  
said, could have cost him a chance at advancing his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is entitled to their own opinions,'' Newsome said.  
``If anything, I guess I'm guilty by association. With me, it was 
an opportunity as a minority to get one of the highest-ranking jobs 
in professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have stayed here for three years and done nothing  
and waited until the next team. I probably would have called 
(former coach) Marty Schottenheimer and got a tight end job in 
Kansas City or called Bill Cowher in Pittsburgh. But I think it 
would have been worse for me if I came back as a Steeler.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Slave Suit Urged Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- On behalf of Ford Motor Co., former  
Secretary of State Warren Christopher argued Thursday that a 
class-action lawsuit against the auto maker by slave laborers at 
its German plant during the Nazi era should be dismissed because 
courts cannot decide questions of war reparations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reparations have been, and must be handled, by the political  
branches of government,'' Christopher told a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined by another Clinton administration veteran, Walter  
Dellinger, once acting solicitor general, who said the lawsuit, 
filed in March 1998, should also be dismissed because postwar 
treaties decided that claims by individuals would be handled by 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers, assisted by lawyers who helped reach a $1.25  
billion settlement between Holocaust victims and Swiss banks, are 
seeking whatever profits Ford and its German subsidiary, Ford Werke 
AG, made from their unpaid labor, and compensation for brutal 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 10,000 people -- men, women and children -- were pressed  
into laboring at Ford Werke during the war years. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing for the workers, New York University law professor Burt  
Neuborne asserted that later postwar treaties anticipated 
individual reparations claims. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joseph A. Greenaway Jr. said he could rule  
on the dismissal request in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford maintains that its plant in Cologne was seized, along with  
other American interests, after Germany declared war on the United 
States, and that Ford lost contact with the plant until the war 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nazi government's exploitation of civilians during World  
War II was abhorrent and inexcusable,'' Ford spokesman Jim Vella 
said in a statement issued Thursday from company headquarters in 
Dearborn, Mich. ``But whatever occurred at the Cologne plant during 
WWII was and is the responsibility of the German government, as 
successor to the Nazi regime.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Mateo Sidelined 6-8 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas center fielder Ruben Mateo was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday because of a broken 
left wrist, perhaps ending the rookie's season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mateo was injured while taking a swing in the eighth inning of  
Wednesday night's 3-1 win over Minnesota. Although preliminary 
X-rays appeared negative, further tests by a hand specialist 
revealed a fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mateo will undergo surgery to remove the broken bone Friday and  
is expected to be sidelined 6-8 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers will activate center fielder Tom Goodwin in time for  
Friday night's game against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Mateo, one of the Rangers' most highly touted prospects, is  
batting .238 with five homers and 18 RBIs in 32 games since his 
recall on June 12. He previously was on the disabled list from June 
23 to July 9 with a pulled groin muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin is batting .241 with one homer, 12 RBIs and 27 stolen  
bases in 56 games this season. He has appeared in just one game 
since straining his left hip flexor muscle on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin came off the disabled list June 27, then returned to the  
DL the next day after aggravating the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently completed a three-day medical rehabilitation  
assignment at Port Charlotte in the Florida State League, going 
4-for-10 in three starts in center.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Starts Thai Field Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The U.S. oil company Chevron announced  
that oil and gas production has begun in an offshore Thai field it 
acquired earlier this year from Rutherford Moran Oil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release posted Thursday on the Internet, the company  
said its Benchamas field 125 miles offshore in the Gulf of Thailand 
had initial production of 35 million cubic feet of natural gas and 
2,200 barrels of oil per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Production is expected to increase to 75 million cubic feet of  
gas and 25,000 barrels of oil a day by October, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas is sold under contract to the Petroleum Authority of  
Thailand, the country's state oil company, and the oil is exported 
via a nearby floating terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Benchamas is the second of three known fields in the B8/32 block  
to enter production, Chevron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron holds a 51.66 percent interest in the block and will  
become, pending government approval, operator of the concession on 
Oct. 1. Chevron's partners in the block include Thaipo, a 
subsidiary of Pogo Producing Co., with a 46.34 percent share, and 
Palang Sophon, with 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> GM Markets Warner Bros. Minivan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- General Motors is not changing its name  
to the Acme Car Co., after the fictional firm in Warner Bros. 
cartoons, but it is using the Looney Tunes brand to pitch a new 
line of minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Warner on Thursday introduced the Chevy Venture Warner  
Bros. van, which bears labels featuring Bugs Bunny and the studio 
logo as a marketing carrot to lure family buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest instance of cross-marketing between Hollywood and  
manufacturing, GM plans to build 20,000 of the vans. It's believed 
to be the first big-ticket consumer item labeled with an 
entertainment logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel so strongly about the viability of this vehicle, we  
placed our most important asset, our corporate logo, on it,'' said 
Dan Romanelli, president of Warner consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
	GM unveiled the van at the Warner studio, with actors in Bugs  
Bunny, Daffy Duck and other Looney Tunes costumes on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle is the first step in a four-year marketing  
partnership that will give GM access to Warner's studio identity 
along with its films, TV shows and other productions. The companies 
said they have not settled on details of future marketing plans. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will pay royalties to Warner for use of the studio logo on  
its vans. The vehicle's list price will be just under $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The minivan, a variation of GM's Chevy Venture model, has two  
small Warner logos on each front door and the rear door. The logo 
also appears on a videocassette screen over the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The van, expected to be on dealer lots by late August or early  
September, also carries bonuses for buyers, such as free Warner 
videos and compact discs, discounts at the studio's retail stores 
and passes to sneak previews of movies. 
</P>
<P>
	GM executives said they hope the long family identity of Warner  
-- with its movies and cartoons -- will attract car-buyers who have 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment has an increasing emotional connection with our  
customers,'' said Phil Guarascio, GM vice president for advertising 
and corporate marketing. ``We're here to have Warner Bros. leverage 
that and help us understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the videocassette player, the van has other special  
features that include a built-in child-safety seat and a sound 
system that allows passengers to listen to different audio sources. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has used Looney Tunes characters such as Wile E. Coyote and  
the Tasmanian Devil in car ads before. The marketing deal also will 
give the automaker first rights to place its vehicles in Warner 
productions, as it did with cars in the studio's ``Lethal Weapon'' 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Product placement in films and television shows is common, as is  
marketing of movies on small items such as ``Star Wars'' and 
``Inspector Gadget'' toys at fast-food restaurants. BMW has been 
introducing new sports-car models in James Bond movies. 
</P>
<P>
	But branding something as big as a vehicle with a studio logo is  
new. 
</P>
<P>
	A Warner-branded minivan might appeal to hard-core Looney Tunes  
fans, but the main benefit to the companies will be simple 
advertising, said Mike Kamins, a marketing professor at the 
University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like those big billboards that drive around all  
day, only this is a little billboard,'' Kamins said.

<HEADLINE> Coors May Not Use 'NFL' in Promo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coors Brewing Co. cannot use the National Football League's  
trademark initials in its new beer promotion, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden, Colo.-based brewer had worked out a deal with  
Players Inc., the licensing arm of the NFL Players Association, to 
call their product the ``Official Beer of NFL Players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the NFL and NFL Properties fought the plan and U.S. District  
Court Judge Denise L. Cote on Wednesday granted a preliminary 
injunction against the planned promotion. The ruling was issued in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Coors spokesman Dave Taylor said the real conflict is between  
the NFL and Players Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Coors still plans to launch the promotion in mid-August as  
planned and run it through the Labor Day weekend, Taylor said. But 
he was not sure if the promotion would use the phrase ``Official 
Beer of Players, Inc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Gertzog, NFL senior vice president of business affairs and  
general counsel, said the injunction proves the NFL has sole rights 
to its trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL and NFL Properties are seeking to make the injunction  
permanent. A date for a trial on that request will be set in a 
hearing in New York on Aug. 18, Gertzog said. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Players Inc. could not be reached immediately  
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Robert Downey Jr. Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Robert Downey Jr. was sentenced to  
three years in prison today for violating probation from a 1996 
drug conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Lawrence Mira, who presided over Downey's  
original case in 1996, said he had given the Oscar-nominated actor 
many chances to rehabilitate himself. But, he said, the actor has 
manipulated doctors and psychiatrists who have examined his 
progress.

<HEADLINE> GM To Offer New Pickup Truck Bed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will offer a  
composite plastic cargo bed as an option on its 2001 Chevrolet 
Silverado full-size pickup, which the automaker said is more 
durable than conventional pressed steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Burns, GM's vice president of research and development,  
told an industry conference Thursday that the plastic bed also will 
improve fuel economy, reduce maintenance and repair costs, increase 
resale value and is recyclable. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 6 1/2-foot cargo bed, also called a box in the industry,  
will be offered starting in fall 2000 on the extended-cab version 
of the 1500-series Fleetside Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers offer plastic bed liners to protect their steel cargo  
beds, but GM said this is the first that's made completely of 
composite plastics. The bed also features a stronger, 
easier-to-open tailgate, will not rust or dent and is highly 
scratch-resistant, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bed will reduce the truck's weight by 50 pounds, which will  
help boost fuel economy and increase load capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been a leader in the use of plastics for vehicle bodies  
for decades. Its Saturn line of cars, the Chevrolet Corvette, 
Camaro and Pontiac Firebird use composite body panels.

<HEADLINE> AOL To Feature After-Hours Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online will feature a new section  
devoted to after-hours stock trading, inviting the Web's biggest 
mainstream audience into a market dominated by elite investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service, scheduled for a November launch, will provide  
AOL's 17 million subscribers with stock quotes and related 
information on the often volatile dealings that take place outside 
the regular hours on traditional markets like the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL members will also be able to use participating Internet  
brokers to connect to an electronic trading system operated by Wit 
Capital, a pioneering online investment firm that's part-owned by 
Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wit, which also will provide the stock quotes and other  
information for the service, has an exclusive six-month arrangement 
with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by AOL follows the recent introduction of  
limited after-hours trading for regular investors by discount 
brokerages Datek and Muriel Siebert. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the after-hours market had been an exclusive  
affair, off-limits to anyone but major institutional players 
managing huge sums of money. Most of the trading is conducted on 
the Instinet electronic market, which is owned by Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
	Several rival systems have sprouted up recently with the  
intention of providing off-hours access for the common investor. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek's after-hours session runs only for about an hour after  
the regular close of trading, but most of the new systems plan to 
offer an evening session lasting two or three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The privilege of joining the after-hours club may come with  
pitfalls, however, since most of these new markets will be thinly 
traded at first. Without sufficient demand from buyers and sellers, 
only the most popular stocks will usually be available for trading, 
and even then, share prices may swing wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	As protection, most of the new after-hours systems require  
people to name a specific price they're willing to pay or receive 
for a given stock. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's announcement on Thursday could serve as a big first step  
toward helping resolve the problem of thin trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing nearly 10 million visitors per month, AOL's ``Personal  
Finance Channel'' is not only one of the most popular destinations 
within the AOL network, but possibly the most popular financial 
site on the entire Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL has this significant pool of people who are involved in  
personal finance and investing online,'' said Frank Lallos, an 
industry analyst at Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass., adding that 
``AOL consumers spend a lot of time transacting business,'' 
including online shopping and online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he cautioned, ``it's not clear that after hours trading is  
the panacea that everyone expects it to be. There are a lot of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a limited number of stocks that we're really talking  
about. And even companies like Intel, Microsoft and Dell that trade 
tens of millions of shares a day aren't likely to have same 
liquidity after hours. As a result, you're likely to see large 
price swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also may not get the best prices quoted on bigger  
markets like Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Wit Capital, several of the new after-hours systems boast  
major partners, all of them trying to get in on the ground floor of 
a new market they hope will be as explosive as online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman also owns a stake in a trading network named  
Archipelago, along with J.P. Morgan and ETrade. Last month, 
brokerages Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, and Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette formed a joint venture with Spear, Leeds &AMP; 
Kellogg to create a new electronic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek's after-hours trading is conducted by its Island ECN  
subsidiary, which is partly owned by Waterhouse Investor Services.	   All the impending competition has prompted the NYSE and the 
Nasdaq Stock Market to announce that they'll introduce their 
after-hours trading sessions sometime next year.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Forms Business Strategy Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. promoted Jesse J.  
Greene Jr. to a new post charged with shaping the photography 
company's business strategy, but didn't name him chief financial 
officer as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, currently the acting chief financial officer, will be  
the highest-ranking black executive in Kodak's 118-year history in 
his role as senior vice president of business strategy and 
information technology. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 54-year-old executive had been widely expected to  
succeed Harry Kavetas as CFO after Kavetas died of a heart attack 
in May at age 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene will develop Kodak's overall strategic direction --  
handling mergers, acquisitions, partnerships and new investments -- 
while the new chief financial officer will handle operational 
finance, Kodak said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene will act as CFO until that post is filled, and his new  
job includes some of the CFO's duties, Kodak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can be every bit as effective and maybe even more  
effective toward the future direction of the company from this 
position as I would be from the CFO (post),'' Greene said. ``I view 
it as a great opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only complaint now,'' he added with a chuckle, ``is I have  
to continue to do the acting CFO role for another few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Greene and the eventual CFO will report to Dan Carp, who is  
replacing George Fisher in January as chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., suspects Carp  
``felt the functions that Kavetas was performing were sufficiently 
important and wide-ranging that one guy couldn't do them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One's cynical inference is Greene's been kicked upstairs. That  
thought did flicker across my mind but I think that's the wrong 
call. It's really a function of a new guy coming in, having a 
somewhat different view of the manpower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene downplayed the significance of becoming one of corporate  
America's highest-ranking minority executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view it as important for me to contribute to the performance  
of this company,'' he said, adding that it's ``obviously important 
for Eastman Kodak Co. to continue its diversity efforts as it is 
for most American companies today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene joined Kodak in 1994 as treasurer following 23 years at  
International Business Machines. Kodak credits him with leading the 
effort to reduce debt and improve the company's balance sheet. 
Kodak promoted him in 1998 to vice president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of New York City, Greene earned a law degree and  
master's degree in business administration at Columbia University 
and a master's in mechanical engineering at New York University. He 
is married and has two grown sons.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stocks closed sharply lower  
Thursday, following a sharp overnight fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell  
327.19 points, or 1.85 percent, to 17,358.19. On Wednesday, the 
average fell 1.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares were dragged down by sharp losses in U.S. Internet  
and high technology stocks, which pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index 
in New York down 1.85 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks also fell on the stronger Japanese yen, which  
rose against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.62 yen in late trading, down 0.48 yen from  
its level of 115.10 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late 
New York level of 114.29 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the yen rose after comments by U.S. Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers late Wednesday failed to indicate that 
the two countries would intervene in currency markets to prop up 
the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen makes the products of Japanese exporters more  
expensive and therefore less competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares plunged 2.5 percent after four straight  
sessions of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 336.68 points to close at  
13,254.34. On Wednesday, the index rose 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Hong Kong shares, which are technically weak on  
fundamentals, have become overpriced as liquidity rushed into the 
market in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a time for the liquidity-driven rally to come to an  
end,'' said Joseph Yu of Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, shares also fell amid heightened tensions with China.  
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Price Index fell 151.07 points, or 2.1 percent, to  
6,959.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued media reports of increased sorties over the Taiwan  
Strait by both mainland and Taiwanese fighter jets eroded investor 
confidence and pressured share prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares fell on losses in banking and finance  
shares. The SET index fell 4.34 points, or 0.9 percent, to 447.09. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell amid renewed fears over a  
possible U.S. interest rates hike. The JSX Composite index fell 
8.125 points, or 1.3 percent, to 606.270. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell on continued selling by  
foreign funds. The KLSE Composite Index fell 13.54 points, or 1.9 
percent, to 705.98. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares fell on renewed fears over the  
stability of the peso and the direction of domestic interest rates. 
The PSE Index fell 23.81 points, or 1 percent, to 2,348.24. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares rose on buying in mineral resources  
and gold shares. The All Ordinaries Index rose 13.2 points, or 0.4 
percent, to 3,018.9. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares plunged 3.7 percent on continued  
worries over financial troubles of Daewoo Group, one of the 
country's largest conglomerates. The Kospi fell 36.38 points to 
939.07. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Singapore shares fell on lingering concerns of a

<HEADLINE> Slaying Evidence Parked for 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Every month for eight years, Dennis  
Field scraped together $40 to keep a 1978 Lincoln Continental in 
storage in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wasn't trying to protect a classic. He was trying to  
protect himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the part-time telemarketer, who bounced from one  
$4-a-day hotel room to another, stole the car from his landlady in 
1991 -- just after he shot her to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He placed it in storage and never touched it again,'' Palm  
Beach County Sheriff's Detective Wayne Robinson said Wednesday. 
``It was a really good way to keep it out of circulation -- a little 
expensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into the death of Barbara McConnell, 58, of  
Palm Beach Gardens went cold shortly after she was shot in January 
1991. Police issued a warrant for Field for the theft of her car, 
but there wasn't enough evidence to charge him with her death. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, there was no sign of either Field or the car.  
</P>
<P>
	That was until last month, when Field, who had lung cancer, was  
hospitalized in San Diego. He was registered under the name William 
Mahan, the identity he apparently had been using since he moved to 
California shortly after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	While in the hospital, he called his boss, Brian Mitchell, and  
asked Mitchell to get a briefcase, gun and money from his hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Curiosity apparently got the best of Mitchell, and he rifled  
through the briefcase. In it, he found papers and photographs 
indicating the man he knew as William Mahan actually was Dennis 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Mitchell's friends turned to the Internet for answers and  
found that Field's name was listed on the FBI Web site, from the 
1991 warrant for the stolen car. Mitchell called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson flew to California, where he and other detectives found  
that Field had kept the .38-caliber gun believed to have been used 
in McConnell's shooting and a box of bullets with two missing. The 
bullets, bought in Sarasota, Fla., appeared to have corroded with 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson also found a business card from a nearby storage area,  
where surprisingly, Field had parked McConnell's 1978 Continental, 
its windows open, its seats full of mud and rainwater. It had been 
spray-painted red. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of him having the weapon and the box of  
bullets and the victim's car -- I was a bit dumbfounded by that,'' 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	When police questioned Field, he admitted his true identity but  
said nothing about the slaying. Robinson told Field that police had 
discovered the gun, the bullets and the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never one time denied anything. He just shook his head  
`yes,''' Robinson said. ``I really believe he wanted to resolve 
everything, but he was afraid to say anything without an attorney, 
and I had to respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 25, Field was brought before a judge and was told he  
would be sent back to Florida to face a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	But he'll never stand trial.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reno Asks for Help on Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite highly publicized school shootings,  
youth violence has declined and Congress now has the opportunity to 
encourage the reduction, Attorney General Janet Reno said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress has a major task in the days ahead. The conferees  
on the juvenile justice bill, who begin meeting this afternoon, 
have an opportunity to finalize legislation, which can 
significantly contribute to the reduction in youth violence,'' Reno 
said at her weekly news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened the session by noting the decline in youth violence  
reported Tuesday by the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC researchers reported that in 1991, 42.5 percent of high  
school students said they had been in a fight in the previous year, 
but the figure fell to 36.6 percent in 1997. And in 1991, 26.1 
percent said they had carried a weapon in the previous month, but 
the rate dropped to 18.3 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	These figures show ``we're on the right track, we can make a  
difference with respect to youth violence and a balanced approach 
of enforcement and prevention,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate have approved differing versions of the  
juvenile justice bill and the conference committee must work out a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno urged that the final bill include a significant investment  
in prevention and in mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever I go, people are talking about the need for mental  
health services to provide assistance and support for youngsters 
who are grappling with the issues so many teen-agers face today,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it had initially rejected tougher gun-control  
restrictions supported by the Senate, the House last week approved 
a nonbinding measure endorsing background checks on all firearms 
sales at gun shows. Under current law, background checks are 
required only on sales by licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also calls for including measures to prevent  
violence in schools and ensuring that the legislation does not 
weaken existing gun regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, in addition to requiring background checks on  
all firearms buyers at gun shows, would require dealers to provide 
safety devices with all handguns, ban importation of certain 
high-capacity firearms clips and impose a lifetime prohibition of 
gun ownership on anyone convicted as a juvenile of a serious 
felony.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Joins 500 Homers Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire became the 16th member of the  
500-home run club Thursday night, beating Tony Gwynn to his 
3,000-hit milestone with a third-inning shot to dead center field. 
</P>
<P>
	The sellout crowd had come to Busch Stadium hoping to see  
history, and McGwire did not make his fans wait long. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis star hit a hanging, 1-1 breaking ball from San  
Diego's Andy Ashby an estimated 451 feet over the center-field 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The solo shot was McGwire's 43rd of the season, moving him one  
past Sammy Sosa for the major league lead. McGwire tops the NL with 
100 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire became the fastest player ever to reach 500 homers,  
doing it in his 5,487th at-bat. Babe Ruth held the previous mark, 
having done it in 5,801 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire connected in the same ballpark where he broke Roger  
Maris' 37-year-old homer record last Sept. 8 when he hit No. 62. 
McGwire went on to hit 70 homers, finishing ahead of Sosa in a race 
that captivated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting a fly ball that was caught on the center-field  
warning track in the first inning, McGwire came back to hit his 
16th home run in 21 games -- and his fourth-longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, however, remains behind last year's pace. His 43rd  
homer this season came in the Cardinals' 109th game; last year, he 
hit 43 in the first 98 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball cleared the wall and deflected off the base of an  
advertisement, then landed in an area of shrubbery beyond the wall 
as fans scrambled to come up with the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Shearer, a 28-year-old architect from St. Louis, wound up  
with the souvenir and was whisked away by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of joked about it before,'' said his wife, Jennifer.  
``He said if it comes this way, get out of here, and so I did. I 
said he should give it back. He said he's going to sell out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who needed two hits to reach the vaunted 3,000 mark, took  
off his glove in right field and applauded as McGwire rounded the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire jumped on home plate with both feet before being greeted  
by teammates, who exchanged his signature fake gut punches along 
with high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire then made his second curtain call in as many nights as  
Ashby stood off the mound, looking out towards center field.

<HEADLINE> Ralph Lauren Wins Trademark Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Polo Ralph Lauren has won a trademark  
infringement lawsuit against Westchester Media Co., publisher of 
Polo Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Dallas on Wednesday gave Westchester 90 days  
to stop using the Polo Magazine name. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge Mary Milloy said it was ``inescapable''  
that the magazine would cause consumer confusion with the clothing, 
fragrance and home furnishings designer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that the court has recognized the need to  
protect our customers from the confusion intentionally caused by 
the new Polo Magazine,'' said Victor Cohen, a lawyer for Polo Ralph 
Lauren, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Polo Ralph Lauren asked Westchester to give up the name after  
its overhaul from a small specialty publication into a slick, 
broader-focused magazine that launched with about 1 million issues. 
Westchester responded by suing to protect the name secured by 
founder and former publisher Ami Shinitski in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the magazine had argued that it is the official  
publication of the U.S. Polo Association despite its transformation 
into a glossy lifestyles journal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge said the change in format clearly shows ``an  
intent to trade on the reputation and goodwill established by Polo 
Ralph Lauren over the last 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at the magazine's Houston headquarters late  
Wednesday was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Fox Baseball Ratings Up 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Halfway through its Saturday ``Game of the  
Week'' telecasts, Fox's ratings are up 11 percent this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is averaging a 3.0 rating and 10 share for nine broadcasts,  
up 11 percent from its 2.7 rating for its first nine telecasts last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday's regional telecasts averaged a 4.2 rating and 13  
share, Fox said Thursday. That was its second-highest Saturday 
since it began televising baseball in 1996, trailing only a 4.5 
rating and 14 share last Sept. 5, when Mark McGwire hit his 60th 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a  
broadcast, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The share is 
the percentage watching a program among those televisions in use at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net's ratings for 16 Thursday night broadcasts are  
averaging an 0.91, up 18 percent from an 0.77 average in a similar 
period last season. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Parent Award Returned Amid Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) -- This year's winner of the Parent of the  
Year Award has returned the prize because of his alleged links to a 
cult accused of child abuse and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Prendergast won the award because of the home and life he  
and wife, Naomi, have built for their 12 children. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also has been a leader of the Children of God cult, a  
group started in California in the 1960s by the late David Berg, 
according to former acquaintances interviewed by the Houston 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult has run into legal trouble around the world. Among  
other things, it has been accused of having female members work as 
``happy hookers for Jesus,'' and has been linked to child 
pornography in South America and physical abuse of members' 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Former members of the cult identified Prendergast as the leader  
of an indoctrination camp for children in Italy in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, authorized by Congress in 1994, is issued by the  
National Parents Day Foundation in connection with National Parents 
Day, the fourth Sunday of each July. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about Prendergast's ties to the Children of God led  
him to return the award, said Gary Jarmin, spokesman for the 
National Parents Day Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarmin said the foundation was unaware of the Prendergasts'  
affiliation with the Children of God when it issued the award. 
``There's nothing in the information we received on them to 
indicate that they were involved in anything like that,'' Jarmin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer at the Prendergasts' home Thursday in  
Longmont.

<HEADLINE> Diet Supplement Crackdown Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators dealt a blow to  
the Food and Drug Administration's planned crackdown on 
ephedrine-laced dietary supplements Wednesday, saying the agency 
used sloppy science to justify some of the proposed rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA in 1997 proposed mandating warning labels and a dramatic  
slashing of the dose of ephedrine in herbal supplements, citing 
reports of 17 deaths and 800 illnesses linked to products that 
promise to help people lose weight, build muscle and heighten 
sexual awareness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ephedrine, an amphetamine-like stimulant, has long been  
controversial. Florida and New York banned ephedrine supplements 
after pills with such names as Herbal Ecstacy and Ultimate Xphoria 
promised a ``natural high.'' The bans came when a 20-year-old 
college student died after taking Ultimate Xphoria during spring 
break in 1996; the manufacturer ultimately settled with the 
student's parents for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA's proposal sparked a storm of protest, and Congress'  
General Accounting Office investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the GAO concluded that while health officials were  
right to probe ephedrine, they used sloppy science in deciding 
supplements should contain no more than 8 milligrams of ephedrine 
per serving. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies suggest 20 milligrams may be the dose at which certain  
people suffer side effects, the GAO said, while the FDA focused on 
a mere 13 reports of injured patients -- some that were inaccurate -- 
to propose the much lower dose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The available scientific information suggests that the use of  
products containing synthetic ephedrine alkaloids can result in 
adverse experiences for some individuals,'' says the GAO report. 
However, the report adds, studies ``did not provide information 
relating to adverse events below the 20 mg level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For the FDA -- one of the most important regulatory agencies in  
government -- to use such poor science for a dietary supplement 
raises warning flags for other products the agency regulates,'' 
said House Science Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis., who requested the GAO probe. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA officials told the GAO they were looking for additional data  
before making a final decision on ephedrine regulation.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Beats US Women Basketball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The U.S. women's basketball team made  
a big turnaround against Cuba in the Pan American Games. It just 
wasn't big enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba dominated the inside play in the second half and beat the  
Americans 87-78 Thursday night to advance to the gold medal game 
against Canada, which upset Brazil 56-54. 
</P>
<P>
	The best the United States can hope for Saturday night is the  
bronze. But the Americans responded well after losing to Cuba 95-64 
last Saturday, the worst loss ever for a U.S. women's team in the 
Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've come a million miles,'' U.S. coach Nell Fortner said  
of her team, which was put together just two weeks before the 
games. ``I just wish we could have hit a few more shots against 
that zone defense and maybe it's a different outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Edwina Brown's 15 points and four steals, the United  
States led 36-34 at halftime and went ahead 49-48 with 13:22 
remaining when Brown's fifth steal produced a layup for Michelle 
Marciniak. 
</P>
<P>
	But long-armed center Yamilet Martinez, who gave the United  
States problems all night, scored on a strong spin move inside to 
start a 7-0 run and the Cubans never trailed again, though the 
Americans stayed within striking distance the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we all reached down individually within ourselves and  
we brought to the table everything we had,'' said Brown, who 
finished with 18 points. ``Maybe we were holding back in the 
beginning. Maybe we just didn't quite understand the capability we 
had. But it came out tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which still has most of the players from its 1996 Olympic  
team, opened a 77-64 lead with four minutes left and another 
blowout was looming. Except the United States didn't let it happen 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Cunningham hit a 3-pointer and the Americans followed with  
six more points to cut the lead to 77-73 with 1:59 to play. But 
that's as close as it got. Cuba continued attacking inside and held 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew Cuba's great at making good, hard runs at you,''  
Fortner said. ``When they do, you cannot panic. You've got to stop 
it and then you've got to turn around and get one of your own. And 
that's what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Pride had 15 points for the United States, while Marciniak  
and Sylvia Crawley each scored 10. Martinez had 22 points on 
9-for-12 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first meeting, Cuba jumped to a 14-3 lead and led by 20 a  
little more than 13 minutes into the game. But fired up by 
Crawley's pregame dunks, the Americans started strong and matched 
the Cubans run for run until the very end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was willing to do whatever it took to get my teammates  
excited,'' Crawley said. ``Slam dunking got the crowd into it, the 
crowd on our side. We were really intense at the beginning of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said she was certain the team would take that intensity  
into the bronze medal game as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disappointment to me individually because I hate  
losing,'' she said. ``But then for the USA, they don't deserve a 
bronze medal, they deserve a gold. We were unable to give it to 
them and get it for ourselves. So we've got to go out and get 
something.''

<HEADLINE> Daewoo May Talk Investment With GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's troubled Daewoo Group  
may soon hold serious investment talks with General Motors Corp. of 
the United States, company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate for cash, Daewoo has publicly said it wanted General  
Motors to buy part of Daewoo Motors Co., its main subsidiary and 
South Korea's second largest car maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Local news media, quoting unidentified Daewoo officials,  
reported that a memorandum of understanding will be signed as early 
as Friday, committing both sides to discussing details of possible 
GM investment in Daewoo Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any comment to make now, but we can say that we  
have made progress,'' said Daewoo Motors spokesman Kim Seung-hee. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Daewoo and GM discussed partnership.  
General Motors owned half of Daewoo Motors from 1978 to 1992 in a 
deal that allowed Daewoo to sell cars overseas using GM brand 
names. Their rocky marriage ended with Daewoo buying out GM's 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, narrowly  
escaped becoming South Korea's largest-ever bankruptcy in July when 
domestic creditors, mostly under government control, agreed to 
delay repayment of $5.8 billion in short-term debt for six months 
and extend $3.3 billion in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo promised to cut its debt drastically by  
selling or spinning off most of its 40 subsidiaries and attracting 
foreign investment.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Ridicules GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton staged a unity rally with  
Democrats on Capitol Hill today to poke fun at Republican tax cuts 
and boast that his economic program has brought America prosperity. 
``We should not abandon it,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton gathered with House and Senate Democrats a day before  
Congress leaves town for a monthlong summer recess. He challenged 
Republicans to keep House and Senate negotiators at work to produce 
gun-control legislation that ``keeps guns out of the hands of 
criminals and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a wish list of legislation, he also urged Congress to  
increase the minimum wage, strengthen the rights of patients in 
managed-care health plans and enact long-stalled campaign finance 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The president attacked the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut,  
saying the money from huge projected budget surpluses should be 
used first to solve the nation's social needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now what they have said is, `Let's pass this big tax cut  
first, make everybody happy tomorrow and then we'll talk about 
these long-term challenges.' And normally that's better politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton said, ``We should not be doing this until we  
figure out how we're going to save Medicare, save Social Security 
and pay the debt off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to figure out: What is it we have to spend to educate  
these kids here, to provide for the national defense, to invest in 
medical research, to do the basic thing,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we ought to ask ourselves how much is left, and whatever  
it is, we ought to give it back to the American people in a tax 
cut,'' the president said. ``That's the way we ought to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his economic strategy -- rather than the  
Republicans' -- has been a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to debate this anymore,'' Clinton said. ``Now we  
have 6 1/2 years of evidence. We have the longest peacetime expansion 
in history, we've turned the biggest deficit into the biggest 
surplus, we've got 19 million new jobs, the highest home ownership 
in history, the lowest minority unemployment in history, a 30-year 
low in the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing more to argue about,'' he said. ``This  
economic strategy works and we should not abandon it in this 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warming up the crowd for the president, House Minority Leader  
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``This Congress should not be measured 
on how many billions of dollars in tax cuts it provides to the 
wealthiest, most secure members of our society. It should be 
measured by its attempts to stop violence against the most 
vulnerable people in our society ... our children. Let's pass gun 
safety now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the Republican  
plan ``doesn't devote one dime of the surplus to Medicare and it 
doesn't include one nickel for prescription drug benefits. The 
truth about their plan is it doesn't protect Social Security. It 
raids the trust fund to pay for more tax breaks for wealthiest 
Americans.''

figure out how we're going to save Medicare, save Social Security 
and pay the debt off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to figure out: What is it we have to spend to educate  
these kids here, to provide for the national defense, to invest in 
medical research, to do the basic thing,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we ought to ask ourselves how much is left, and whatever  
it is, we ought to give it back to the American people in a tax 
cut,'' the president said. ``That's the way we ought to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his economic strategy -- rather than the  
Republicans' -- has been a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to debate this anymore,'' Clinton said. ``Now we  
have 6 1/2 years of evidence. We have the longest peacetime expansion 
in history, we've turned the biggest deficit into the biggest 
surplus, we've got 19 million new jobs, the highest home ownership 
in history, the lowest minority unemployment in history, a 30-year 
low in the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing more to argue about,'' he said. ``This  
economic strategy works and we should not abandon it in this 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warming up the crowd for the president, House Minority Leader  
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``This Congress should not be measured 
on how many billions of dollars in tax cuts it provides to the 
wealthiest, most secure members of our society. It should be 
measured by its attempts to stop violence against the most 
vulnerable people in our society ... our children. Let's pass gun 
safety now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the Republican  
plan ``doesn't devote one dime of the surplus to Medicare and it 
doesn't include one nickel for prescription drug benefits. The 
truth about their plan is it doesn't protect Social Security. It 
raids the trust fund to pay for more tax breaks for wealthiest 
Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Assignments of Clinton Judges Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman has  
asked Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to consider 
investigating why two cases involving President Clinton's friends 
were assigned to Clinton-appointed judges. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter written Tuesday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and a  
Republican presidential hopeful, said he was concerned that the 
incident ``may have repercussions on the public's confidence in the 
impartial administration of justice by the federal courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported last weekend that U.S. District  
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson bypassed a traditional random 
assignment system and sent a criminal case against presidential 
friend Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie to U.S. District Judge Paul L. 
Friedman and similarly sent a separate tax case against 
presidential friend Webster Hubbell to U.S. District Judge James 
Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie's case was the first major prosecution from the Justice  
Department investigation of Democratic fund raising in the 1996 
election. Friedman, appointed to the bench by Clinton two years 
earlier, also was assigned by Johnson to two related cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other judges have expressed concern that the assignments  
had the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman dismissed various charges against Trie. One of  
Friedman's rulings was reversed on appeal, and Trie is to be 
sentenced in two weeks, probably to probation, on a plea-bargained 
guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson dismissed the tax case against Hubbell, a former  
associate attorney general, who eventually pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor when an appeals court reinstated the case. Robertson 
was later chosen, at random, to handle a felony case against 
Hubbell that charged him with lying to federal regulators. 
Robertson threw out the central felony count in that case, but 
again an appeals court reversed him, and Hubbell eventually pleaded 
guilty to one felony count. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the editor published in The Washington Times  
earlier this week, Johnson said, ``Politics was not and is never a 
factor in our case assignments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hatch asked Rehnquist to look into the matter using the  
Judicial Conference of the United States, a panel of judges that 
includes chief justices from each judicial circuit. As chief 
justice, Rehnquist is presiding officer of the conference, which 
makes policy concerning the administration of U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish to ask you ... to consider whether an examination by  
the Judicial Conference might be warranted,'' Hatch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an inquiry should examine whether other cases involving the  
Clinton administration have been assigned in a manner that deviated 
from normal procedure, whether the facts justify any deviations and 
the propriety of any deviations, Hatch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a conservative group, Judicial Watch, wrote to  
Johnson on Thursday saying her letter published this week had not 
really addressed the allegations. The group wants the U.S. Court of 
Appeals to investigate.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offering a multitude of tax breaks for average  
taxpayers and special interests, the Republican-controlled Congress 
opened debate today on the final version of a 10-year, $792 billion 
tax cut in defiance of repeated veto threats from President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good deal for the American people,'' Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., said at a Capitol Hill rally. ``It's fair, 
responsible and balanced tax-relief bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, addressing a Democratic rally at the Capitol,  
responded: ``We say first things first,'' urging any budget surplus 
go first for preserving Social Security and Medicare and reducing 
government debt. ``Figure out what it costs and give the rest back 
to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As highly partisan floor debate began, Rep. Charles Rangel,  
D-N.Y., accused Republicans of bending to business lobbyists and 
producing a tax bill intended mainly for political consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got your Christmas list and you know it will never,  
never, never become law,'' Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House planned to vote on the bill later today, with the  
Senate expected to follow later today or Friday. GOP leaders gained 
key support from a handful of Republican Senate moderates by 
inserting new items aimed at low-income workers, affordable housing 
and people paying for dependent care, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders will not send the bill to the White House until  
September, hoping to build public support during the August recess 
and avoid an immediate veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, listen,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``Listen to the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and most Democrats don't believe people are  
clamoring for tax cuts and prefer that projected budget surpluses 
be used to first safeguard Social Security and Medicare, pay down 
public debt and ensure adequate levels of government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has said he would sign a modest tax cut of  
perhaps $300 billion, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said in an 
interview that he saw no signs of compromise with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any indication that he's serious at all,'' said  
Lott, R-Miss. ``I'm hopeful, because I want it very badly. But the 
president has shown no inclination to engage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a signal that the GOP doesn't expect the bill to ever  
become law, many of the major provisions would expire after 2008. 
That means current law would return into force unless the cuts were 
renewed by a future Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans said the projected $2.9 trillion surplus over  
the next decade was enough to meet Clinton's priorities and still 
enact the largest tax cut since 1981, mainly by delaying full 
impact of the breaks until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the big-ticket item in the 10-year package would  
trim all income tax rates by 1 percentage point: First, the bottom 
15 percent rate would drop to 14 percent by 2003, followed by all 
the others in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, repeal of the estate tax would take place in small  
increments beginning in 2003, with the full impact delayed until 
2009. Relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that hits many 
two-income couples would phase in beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the tax cut for 2000 would total only $5.2 billion and  
only $156.2 billion over its first five years, said Lindy Paull, 
staff director for the Joint Committee on Taxation, which makes 
official tax estimates for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the partisan gridlock, Republicans made sure their tax  
bill was chock full of items that would please many GOP 
constituencies, ranging from pro-family conservative groups to 
international and domestic business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Family Research Council, for example, joined GOP lawmakers  
at a Capitol Hill news conference to hail the marriage penalty 
provisions, which have been beefed up from an original House 
measure that caused some grumbling among conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide tax breaks for education, long-term  
health care and health insurance premiums, repeal the alternative 
minimum tax for individuals and cut top capital gains tax rates for 
most taxpayers from 20 percent to 18 percent retroactive to Jan. 1, 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contained some special targets: a repeal of a 10 percent  
excise tax on certain kinds of fishing tackle boxes; an increase in 
tax breaks for reforestation expenses incurred by timber companies; 
breaks for purchasers of nuclear plants aimed at the costs of 
cleaning up reactor sites; and a credit for electricity produced 
from poultry waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would extend the research and development tax  
credit sought by high-tech businesses by five years, instead of the 
permanent extension they want. That brought a retort from 
Democrats, who are competing fiercely for support from those same 
companies and sought a permanent extension in their tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We listened and we delivered in our plan,'' said Sen. Harry  
Reid, D-Nev. ``The Republicans have done nothing more than talk.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Ready To Move Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry is back in pinstripes.  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, attempting to come back from his latest drug  
suspension while still recovering from colon cancer, is getting 
another chance from Yankees management to return to The Bronx if he 
can turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the starting lineup for Triple-A Columbus on Wednesday  
night, playing for the first time since learning last Oct. 1 that 
he had colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 2-for-4, failed to drive in the tying run in the ninth,  
then said afterward he had no timetable for returning to New York 
and would not pressure manager Joe Torre for playing time if he 
gets there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking to go up there to say I'm the left fielder and  
I should play,'' he said. ``If I have to go sit on the bench, 
that's what I have to do. If I don't get back there this year, I 
just don't get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of fans along the third base line gave Strawberry a  
standing ovation when he left the on-deck circle for his first 
at-bat in the second inning. They cheered even louder when he 
singled sharply to center on Jose Bautista's second pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	A smattering of boos was also heard. Columbus, after all, is  
home to many Cleveland Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry added a single and stolen base in the fifth, but  
popped out to third for the final out with the tying run at second 
as the Clippers lost to Norfolk 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	He got jammed on the pitch and said he was overanxious.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a matter of time, a matter of getting back,''  
Strawberry said. ``You know that's the first time I've faced game 
situation pitches. All I did down in Tampa was just hit, run and 
shag balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be in a live situation and seeing breaking balls, I felt a  
little rusty. ... You need to get at least 15 to 20 at-bats before 
you really start feeling good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was suspended 120 days by commissioner Bud Selig  
after his arrest on solicitation and drug charges April 14. Selig 
reduced the suspension by one week on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was going through a tough time when he was  
arrested, depressed about not making the Yankees' Opening Day 
roster, and he had stopped going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he became overwhelmed with trying to get in shape to  
play baseball, finish up chemotherapy and stay on top of his rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone that suffers through cancer and has to take  
chemotherapy for six months, somewhere down the line there's going 
to be a wall hit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wish I would have paid more attention to my health  
than concerning myself with getting back on the baseball field. My 
life is more important than getting back on the baseball field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he has moved his recovery program to Columbus  
and has made that his No. 1 priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``That comes first. There's no question about it. Baseball comes  
after my recovery and my family,'' he said. ``If I put baseball in 
a place where I can enjoy myself and not pressure myself to play 
the game anymore, I think I'll do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Strawberry admitted that this will be his final  
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you right now, if I have to go through this again,  
I'll never return to baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers manager Trey Hillman had Strawberry batting cleanup at  
designated hitter, but said he could play left field tonight, 
depending on how he feels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to do something that will set him back two or  
three days,'' Hillman said. ``He hasn't done this since April. 
There's going to be a little doubt how his body will recover. We're 
not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where Strawberry plays once he gets back to New York remains  
undecided. An injured left knee will make it tough for him to play 
left field regularly, and Chili Davis is firmly entrenched at DH. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no doubt the Yankees could use his bat. Strawberry  
hit 24 homers in 295 at-bats last year before being diagnosed with 
colon cancer. The Yankees' current left-field platoon of Shane 
Spencer, Ricky Ledee and Chad Curtis has 14 homers in 388 at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Marine Camp Investigating Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine Corps has begun  
investigating a Young Marines camp after Washington-area black 
youths said they were the targets of racial hostility. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. James Rich, a spokesman for the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps  
base, said today that the base inspector has begun investigating a 
Washington Post report that racial epithets were scrawled on the 
lockers of youths attending the Young Marines camp here. Their 
belongings also were vandalized, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp ended two weeks ago, Rich said, but Camp Lejeune  
officials learned of the alleged incidents only through the 
newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one brought this up with the leadership at Camp Lejeune  
when they left,'' Rich said today. ``That's why we're only looking 
at the matter now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the perpetrators apparently were other youths attending  
the camp, but he had no details. The Young Marines is an 
organization for youths between the ages of 8 and 18 supported by 
but not part of the Marine Corps, Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nation's Capitol Young Marines group said one member's  
mattress was ripped, his military boots stolen and his wooden 
locker covered with racial epithets scribbled in toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
	Another camper returned to his barracks to find a picture of his  
dead parents torn and scattered on the floor, money and uniforms 
missing and the smell of stale urine, the youths said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I saw wasn't teasing, and that bothers me a lot,'' said  
Michael Kessler, the incoming national executive director of Young 
Marines. Kessler has launched an investigation to find those 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Incidents like that are certainly contrary to everything we  
believe in,'' Maj. Dave Lapan, a Marine Corps spokesman, told the 
Post. ``We support the Young Marines' taking disciplinary action 
against those found accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the black youths attending, 15-year-old Joseph Hall from  
Oxon Hill, Md., said he couldn't believe the incidents happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It left me feeling so violated,'' Hall said.

	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers traded reserve  
offensive lineman Jamie Wilson to the Green Bay Packers today for 
an undisclosed draft choice. 
</P>

	Used as both a guard and tackle, the 6-foot-6, 300-pound Wilson  
played at Marshall before joining the Panthers as a free-agent 
rookie in 1997. He made Carolina's 53-man roster but didn't play in 
any games.

the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he still thinks he's a great driver, the 52-year-old  
Waltrip announced Thursday that, yes, it's true, he's retiring 
after next season. With a finale that he's calling ``Victory Tour 
2000,'' Waltrip will finish up one of the most remarkable, 
outspoken, fun-loving careers motorsports has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into this sport in 1972, and I've been a headliner ever  
since,'' Waltrip said in an emotional announcement at Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway before qualifying for the sixth Brickyard 400. 
``When I'd go to town, people would say, `Are you here with the 
show?' And I'd say, `No, I am the show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a glimpse of the arrogance that earned Waltrip the  
nickname ``Jaws'' in the early days, when he was viewed as stock 
car racing's outlaw. It's been quite a turnabout, because he will 
go out as the beloved ``old DW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting that the end is near left Waltrip momentarily  
speechless -- probably for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving this sport, hanging up my helmet, that's hard to talk  
about,'' Waltrip said, choking back sobs. ``I've done this for 40 
years. Ever since I was 12 years old, we'd get up, put on our 
racing gear and go to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought about the future. ... Well, I'm running  
out of next weeks. That's really the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who ran out of former champion's provisionals two weeks  
ago at Pocono, unveiled a new car he'll use for the rest of the 
season. He made the bold prediction that he'll qualify consistently 
in the top 25 from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Victory Tour got off to an ignominious start Thursday when  
Waltrip stalled just before attempting his qualifying run. With 
less than a minute before time would run out on the session, 
Waltrip fired up the car and was 32nd fastest on the first day of 
qualifying at 176.478 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sheepish grin, Waltrip explained the mishap.  
</P>
<P>
	``The battery cable was off the battery,'' Waltrip said. ``It's  
a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off during my run, 
I'd be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip has won three Winston Cup championships and leads active  
drivers with 84 victories, tied for third all-time with Bobby 
Allison. But ol' DW has been running on fumes for the past few 
years; he hasn't won a race since Darlington in September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who rarely misses a punchline, nailed the one  
pertaining to the name of his victory tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we call it  
a victory tour and we don't produce a victory,'' Waltrip said. 
``Winning a race now would be just as special as winning that first 
one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a native of Owensboro, Ky., who lives in Franklin,  
Tenn., sold his race team last year after owning it for eight 
years, citing sponsor disputes and financial reasons. At the time, 
he said 1999 would be his last season. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed when Travis Carter and Carl Haas approached him  
about driving the No. 66 KMart Ford Taurus, signing him to a 
two-year contract. But Waltrip has continued to struggle, finishing 
25th in the most recent race at Pocono Raceway and placing 38th in 
the season points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess in every sport your legs give our, your arm gives out,  
something gives out,'' Waltrip said. ``I think every athlete that's 
been successful like I have, one thing never gives out. Your heart 
never gives out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother, who also is a Winston Cup competitor, can  
attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the book is written about NASCAR racing, he will  
certainly have a chapter in it,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``One of 
the things that I most admire about him is that he's been able to 
do it on his own terms, and that hasn't always made everybody 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip got his first victory at his home track in Nashville,  
Tenn., in 1975. He won 22 races from 1975-79, then captured the 
Winston Cup championship in 1981, '82 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity soared once he learned to use his gift for gab  
wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in the 1980s, Waltrip was asked what he thought of  
Chevrolet's new Lumina. Without hesitation, Waltrip said he'd 
received letters from fans who wanted to know, ``Why are they 
switching to those 'luminum cars? What's wrong with steel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a future TV commentator who says he also might go into  
politics after racing, still has plenty of one-liners left in the 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just haven't decided what state I want to be governor of  
yet,'' Waltrip said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like racing, politics probably would never be the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``DW ain't told all the stories he knows,'' Waltrip said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wants Subpoena Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush asked a judge Thursday  
to dismiss a subpoena for his testimony in a whistle-blower lawsuit 
by the fired executive director of the Texas Funeral Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, said he knows  
nothing about the February firing of Eliza May. She had been 
leading the agency's investigation into the embalming practices of 
Houston's Service Corporation International, owner of 3,700 funeral 
homes worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no personal knowledge of relevant facts of the  
investigation nor do I have any personal knowledge of relevant 
facts concerning any dispute arising from this investigation,'' 
Bush said in an affidavit. He also said he had no conversations 
with commission officials or the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May's suit alleges that SCI, whose political action  
committee gave Bush $35,000 in 1996 and 1997, worked with Bush's 
staff to interfere with the investigation. The defendants are the 
funeral commission, SCI and Robert Waltrip, the company's founder 
and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said the fight is between Ms. May and the state,  
and believes its inclusion in the suit is a ``publicity stunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney filed the motion to throw out the subpoena. A  
hearing is set for Aug. 30 in Travis County district court, Bush 
spokeswoman Linda Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Ms. May, Derek Howard, said he expects the judge to  
allow him to question Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's investigation led to a recommended fine of  
$445,000, which SCI is fighting. The company contends the funeral 
agency misinterpreted state embalming law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May was hired in 1996 by the nine-member funeral commission,  
which included six Bush appointees. She also was treasurer of the 
Texas Democratic Party until last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit says Ms. May was dismissed nine months after she was  
called into the office of Joe Allbaugh, Bush's executive assistant, 
and asked to explain inspections on April 10, 1998, at SCI 
affiliates in Dallas and Hurst. Among those present during the 
meeting were Waltrip and an SCI attorney, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's office has said Allbaugh's role was simply that of  
listener and that his presence had nothing to do with SCI 
contributing to Bush's gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Allbaugh now is managing Bush's presidential campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	The fines were assessed against SCI for allegedly using  
unlicensed embalming companies, allowing unsupervised apprentices 
to embalm bodies, failing to inform families how much SCI paid 
third-party embalmers and refusing to comply with funeral 
commission subpoenas.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 21; Nasdaq Loses 40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower in early trading today as the  
investors awaited the latest indications of whether inflationary 
pressures will encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 21.21 at 10,653.56. On Wednesday, the blue-chip index gave up 
a gain of 152 points to finish 2.54 lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 9.03 at 1,296.30, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was down 40.37 at 2,499.63, continuing its string of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell as traders awaited and then received the Labor  
Department's 10 a.m. report on productivity and labor costs. The 
department said American workers' productivity slowed significantly 
in the spring, rising at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent, while 
labor costs surged at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the worst 
showing for this measurement since the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, increased productivity has enabled U.S.  
businesses to counteract rising labor costs. But Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan has cautioned that investors have been too confident that 
strong gains in productivity would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	If productivity levels off and labor costs rise, that could  
persuade the Fed to raise rates, hoping to slow down economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The market remained nervous as it also anticipated Friday's  
unemployment report, another widely watched barometer of U.S. 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online was among the biggest decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, falling 7 15/16 to 79 1/2. While the entire Internet 
sector has been suffering in recent sessions, AOL is also being 
hampered by battles over its instant-messaging technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 97.97 million shares, ahead of 
Wednesday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.56 at 611.90, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.16 at 774.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower, held down by the weakness in  
U.S. markets. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.85 percent. In 
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.1 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> White House Honors Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife  
Rosalynn and former President Gerald Ford will receive the nation's 
highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
White House announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter and his wife will be honored Monday at a ceremony in  
Atlanta at the Carter Center. Ford and seven other people will 
receive their awards Wednesday at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, the nation's 38th president, will be recognized for ``his  
honesty and integrity'' and his efforts to restore confidence in 
government and the presidency after the Watergate scandal that 
forced the resignation of Richard M. Nixon. ``As president, he 
brought the Vietnam war to a close,'' a White House tribute said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the 39th president, will be recognized for brokering the  
Camp David peace accords, signing the Panama Canal treaty and 
re-establishing normal diplomatic relations with China. With his 
wife, he created the Carter Center to promote peace, democracy and 
improved health throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a statesman, President Carter has been a successful  
diplomat in hot spots around the world,'' the White House said. 
``Mrs. Carter is a longtime advocate of improved mental health 
care, widespread childhood immunization, women's equality and 
enhanced care for seniors. Each year, the Carters help to build 
homes for the needy through Habitat for Humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other recipients will be:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lloyd M. Bentsen, Clinton's first Treasury secretary and a  
22-year veteran of the Senate and six years in the House. He was 
the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	--Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., president of the World Jewish Congress.  
He has ``worked to insure basic rights for Jews around the world 
and to fight anti-Semitism and has spearheaded the effort to 
retrieve the assets of Holocaust victims and their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Evy Dubrow, an advocate for more than 50 years of laws to  
improve domestic labor conditions. ``A representative for the 
International Ladies Garment Workers Union and for the Union of 
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employes, she has been 
influential in numerous causes, including broadening laws against 
discrimination and protecting American industry from unfair foreign 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Sister M. Isolina Ferre, founder of community service centers,  
clinics and programs to empower the poor in Puerto Rico, New York 
and Appalachia. She gained international recognition in the late 
1950s and 1960s for her mediation efforts with youth gangs in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	--Oliver White Hill, civil rights lawer. He is best known for  
litigating one of the school desegregation cases that became the 
landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Max Kampelman, lawyer, diplomat and negotiator in Democratic  
and Republican administrations. ``In those roles, he emphasized 
human rights in East-West diplomacy and prepared the foundation for 
long-term arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet

<HEADLINE> Aikman Still Hungry for Super Bowls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Troy Aikman feels is helpless  
against the pull of perfection. No matter how much he tries to ease 
up, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback continues to demand it from 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I try to back off a little bit and not be quite be  
as competitive,'' Aikman said. ``But that's just my makeup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That makeup has helped the Dallas Cowboys win three Super Bowls  
this decade. It's also helped Aikman become the highest-paid player 
in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	And as he prepares for his 11th season, it keeps him from being  
satisfied with a career that will one day earn him a spot in the 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the Super Bowl as badly today as I did before I  
won the first one,'' Aikman said. ``I'd be highly disappointed if I 
left the game and didn't win another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman, who turns 33 in November, said Wednesday he plans to  
play 3-5 more seasons. That's quite a change from earlier in his 
career when he talked about retiring by 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel like my best years are ahead of me,'' Aikman  
said. ``I still feel like I can go out and play at a high level, 
compete and do the things I need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Cowboys have won only one playoff game in the three  
seasons since their last championship, Aikman said he believes they 
have the talent to win it all this year. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't, it would be the longest championship drought of  
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't think we were willing to do everything we could as  
a team and as an organization, I would not have redone my 
contract,'' said Aikman, who will receive $85.5 million through 
2007 under an extension signed in April. ``I'd like our football 
team to get back to the respectability we once had, and I think 
we're on track for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Aikman hopes to leave the NFL on top like John Elway, he  
added that he wouldn't retire if Dallas won the Super Bowl this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still healthy and my arm still feels good,'' Aikman said.  
``Barring an injury, I think I can play three to five more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long ago that Aikman thought about retiring because  
the game wasn't fun. He was rejuvenated by the departure of coach 
Barry Switzer and the arrival of offense-minded Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys were 10-6 last year in Gailey's debut season and won  
the NFC East, only to be knocked out of the playoffs in the first 
round with a 20-7 loss to Arizona that Aikman called embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss completed a five-game slide caused mainly by a  
struggling offense. The bad ending overshadowed the team's 
turnaround from 6-10 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to be critical over the last four, five  
games, but we finished eighth in offense and at one time we were 
third,'' Aikman said. ``If I hadn't missed five games due to 
injury, it statistically could very well have been my best year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman expects the offense to improve this year because players  
are more comfortable with Gailey's system. He's also encouraged by 
upgraded talent on the offensive line and at receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to have one of the better offenses  
since I've been here,'' Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey has talked about trying to rest Michael Irvin early in  
the season in hopes of having him fresher for the playoffs. Aikman 
said he's not sure that plan will work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be awfully hard to say `Hey, we need to rest  
you.' He's too valuable to the team and too competitive,'' Aikman 
said. ``I think when the game's on the line, he's still the guy I'm 
going to try to get the ball to.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cautions on Travel Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans should remain especially vigilant  
about their personal safety in the coming days because of possible 
terrorist activity on the anniversary of the bombings at the U.S. 
embassies in East Africa, the State Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The department updated a ``worldwide caution'' issued June 10  
with a reminder that terrorists may take action around significant 
dates such as the anniversary of the Aug. 7, 1998, car bombings 
that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, in Kenya and 
Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Another day to watch is Aug. 20, the one-year anniversary of  
U.S. retaliatory airstrikes against targets in Afghanistan and 
Sudan, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the concern about possible terrorist acts on the  
anniversaries, the department reminded American citizens worldwide 
of the need to remain vigilant to possible attacks.

<HEADLINE> Web Investors Still Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A reversal of fortunes for formerly high-flying  
Internet stocks that began as a gradual drip last spring has turned 
into a flood, as a huge selloff in the sector continued to drag 
down broader markets today. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround has helped plunge the technology-laden Nasdaq  
Stock Market into a so-called correction, generally defined as a 10 
percent decline from a market's high point. On Wednesday, the 
Nasdaq closed down 11.3 percent from the all-time high reached July 
16 of 2,864.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued weakness among Internet stocks today pulled the Nasdaq  
composite index down another 49.19 points to 2,490.90 in midday 
trading. Internet company Yahoo! Inc. fell $5.50 to $115.50 while 
services provider America Online Inc. fell $6.75 to $88.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered almost invincible early this year, online stocks  
appear to have reached their peak in April, when the luster began 
to wear off for investors. The 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index 
has shed more than 40 percent of its value since it hit an all-time 
high on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pain, investors are snubbing new stock offerings  
from Internet firms. The market for initial public offerings, or 
IPOs, of Internet stocks had seemed virtually bulletproof through 
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the jitters that the declines have spread across  
Wall Street, there are some investors who are welcoming the slump 
as an opportunity to buy these stocks at levels far below the 
astronomical prices of this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like this had to happen, given the large number of  
Internet companies that have filed for IPOs recently. It's 
healthy,'' said Ken Fleming, an analyst with Renaissance Capital 
Corp., a financial research firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying sentiment remains 'come back, come back'  
because people love to believe in the potential of the future, 
especially Americans,'' said Steve Harmon, a San Francisco-based 
Internet analyst and money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, sharp declines are scary for investors who bought  
when stocks were peaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer Amazon.com, for example, hit an all-time high of  
$221.25 April 27. Its price today hovered around $89, a 60 percent 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Henceforth, investors may have to be more choosy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the Internet is here to stay and there will be  
significant survivors. We just don't know who those survivors will 
be,'' said Edmund Cashman, co-head of capital markets for Legg 
Mason Wood Walker, a Baltimore investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding those survivors won't be easy. Cashman noted that the  
stocks of most Internet companies continue to trade at prices that 
have no historical precedence. Traditional methods of placing a 
value on a company's stock have been thrown out the window as 
investors have increasingly gambled solely on an online company's 
potential to earn money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp., which has a  
big online business, have traded recently at a price that's 100 
times the company's annual earnings per share. By comparison, the 
shares of conventional brokerage firms such as Lehman Brothers and 
PaineWebber generally trade at prices that are 15 times the 
company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is even more surreal for the vast majority of  
Internet companies that have recently made their first public 
offering of stock because most of those companies are at high 
levels even though most have never earned a profit, Cashman noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in recent IPOs indicates that investors are  
starting to get selective. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the stocks of four Internet companies sank in their  
debuts on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Prior to Tuesday, of the dozens 
of Internet companies that have completed initial public offerings 
in the last year, just three failed to make gains in their first 
day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this has deterred investors such as Daniel Wang, 44, of  
Basking Ridge, N.J. Wang said he first began investing in the 
sector earlier this year, when many of the stocks were already 
approaching their highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have jumped in earlier,'' he said. ``I believe a few  
years from now, these stocks will be a good investment. There's 
definitely a future in these companies.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Workplace Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A man allegedly shot two co-workers to death  
at their office Thursday, then killed a third person at a company 
where he used to work, a burst of workplace violence just one week 
after the Atlanta office massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Eugene Miller, 34, was arrested shortly after the shootings  
when police spotted him on nearby Interstate 65 and forced him to 
pull over. He briefly scuffled with officers, and a gun was found 
in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was charged with three counts of capital murder. The  
motive was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Johnson, a lawyer appointed to represent Miller, said he  
had not discussed the crime in any detail with his client. He 
described Miller as ``confused'' when he spoke with him at the 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelham, a suburb of about 10,000 people in the wooded hills  
south of Birmingham, is a mix of upscale subdivisions, commercial 
districts and rural farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Allan Wade said Miller worked at Ferguson  
Enterprises, a heating and air conditioning company where the first 
two victims were shot to death. They were identified as Lee 
Holdbrooks, 32, and Christopher Yancy, 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived at Ferguson at 7:04 a.m. Officers were still  
securing the crime scene 13 minutes later when dispatchers got a 
second emergency call -- this time about a shooting at Post Airgas 
Inc., a company that sells helium, oxygen and other gases several 
miles from Ferguson Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The third victim, Terry Jarvis, 39, was found at Post Airgas.  
</P>
<P>
	Wade said the gunman at Post Airgas matched the description of  
the suspect who fled Ferguson Enterprises and whose car was seen 
entering I-65. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody around here is just regular working people,'' said  
Cathy McKay, owner of a carpet store across the street from Post 
Airgas. ``You feel safe coming out here at night. The shooting, she 
said, ``is just beyond my comprehension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is from Billingsley, a rural town 50 miles south of  
Pelham, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
	At his Billingsley home, Miller's mother, Barbara Miller, said  
he ``went off to work just as he always does this morning. He left 
here like he always does, with a 7-Up and a couple of things of 
biscuits and sausage. Alan didn't bother anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors had differing views of Miller; some said he was  
friendly, while others thought he was argumentative. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't strike you as a fellow who would do something like  
they say he has done,'' Ricky Williams said. Allen Shaffer said 
he'd had arguments with Miller about property lines. ``We didn't 
get along,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings came one week after frustrated investor Mark O.  
Barton killed nine people and wounded 13 others at two brokerage 
firms in Atlanta in one of the worst office massacres in United 
States history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Herder, a day trader who had worked with Barton and was  
wounded in his rampage, was released from the hospital Wednesday 
and found the Pelham shootings a troubling repeat of the Atlanta 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really frightening that all of a sudden that someone is  
copying this,'' he said. ``I can't believe some idiot has started 
to copy it.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Consider Playing Japan Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa, instead of Mark McGwire, might be the  
slugger who starts the 2000 season in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	With McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals rejecting the trip, the  
Chicago Cubs said Thursday they will consider traveling to Tokyo to 
play the New York Mets in next year's major league opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who has 42 home runs and trails McGwire by two for the  
major league lead, is one of the main reasons baseball sought the 
Cubs. Sosa is popular in Japan and will go there this November 
because of commercial endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team decision and I'll definitely go with the team,''  
Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs player representative Steve Trachsel asked his teammates to  
think about the trip, which would include two exhibition games -- 
possibly against Japanese teams -- and then two regular-season games 
against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Jet lag) seemed to be the biggest worry,'' Trachsel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trachsel said he expected a decision within two weeks. But Cubs  
first baseman Mark Grace, MVP of the 1992 major league All-Star 
tour to Japan, said he thought there would be a vote Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not too crazy about the idea,'' Cubs pitcher Rod Beck  
said. ``But if they want us to go, I'll go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North American part of the 2000 season is set to start on  
Sunday night, April 2, or Monday, April 3. The games at the Tokyo 
Dome probably would be the previous Tuesday and Wednesday, or on 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams involved in the Japanese trip wouldn't resume  
regular-season games until the following Tuesday or Wednesday to 
give them time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire wanted no part of the trip when it first came to light  
last month that the Cardinals had been asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely against it,'' McGwire said at the time. ``Major  
league baseball belongs in the United States. The Japanese have 
Japanese baseball, so there's no reason for us to go over there. I 
have nothing against the way they play baseball. It's not the 
travel. As a player, I just don't like it. The game belongs here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regular-season major league games have never been played outside  
North America. In 1997, the New York Mets and San Diego Padres met 
for three games in Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first season opener outside the United States and Canada,  
the Padres played the Colorado Rockies this year at Monterrey.

	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Hidalberto Aranda of Cuba set the  
world record in the clean and jerk for the 77 kilogram (division at

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Orlando Magic have a choice: Pull the trigger on a trade  
sending Penny Hardaway to Phoenix or pull the plug on the whole 
affair and let the one-time superstar fend for himself on a 
less-than-open market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge decision for us, obviously,'' said general manager  
John Gabriel, who was spending nearly all his waking hours in his 
office, talking with team personnel and representatives for 
Hardaway. ``I was in here until midnight with the coach (Doc 
Rivers) trying to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the teams that made bids for Hardaway dropped out  
of the picture by Wednesday, leaving Phoenix's offer of Danny 
Manning, Pat Garrity and draft picks the only decent option on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's told us he wants to be here. We've finalized the  
contract, and now we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger,'' 
Suns president Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk that Orlando might, out of spite, throw a wrench  
into Hardaway's plans -- and Phoenix's -- by refusing to sign and 
trade him, thereby forcing Hardaway to sign with Chicago, the 
Clippers or Toronto if he wanted anything approaching the 
seven-year, $86 million deal he would get from Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel, however, said such a scenario would ``probably not''  
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hardaway trade would send Orlando deep into a rebuilding mode,  
with three starters from last season gone via trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic will have three first-round picks in next year's draft  
-- their own, Denver's and Golden State's -- all of which could be 
lottery picks. The Magic also would be about $10 million under the 
salary cap entering the 2001-02 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around the league:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Toronto Raptors signed Dell Curry today, luring last  
season's leading 3-point shooter away from Milwaukee with a 
three-year deal believed to be worth $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Boston Celtics signed free agent guard Calbert Cheaney, who  
played his first five seasons in Washington, to a three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Los Angeles Clippers and Cleveland Cavaliers pulled  
Wednesday's only trade, a sign-and-trade deal that sent Lamond 
Murray to Cleveland for Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Sacramento Kings stayed busy, signing Clippers free-agent  
point guard Darrick Martin and re-signing free agent forward 
Lawrence Funderburke. 
</P>
<P>
	--Indiana Pacers general manager Donnie Walsh told the  
Indianapolis News that the Boston Celtics approached him offering 
Antoine Walker. The Pacers also were known to be pursuing a 
sign-and-trade deal with the Clippers for Lorenzen Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	--Miami signed free-agent forward Otis Thorpe, who played for  
Washington last season, averaging 11.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	--Terry Porter, who played for the Heat last season, was  
reportedly close to signing with San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	--Miami was reportedly trying to find a third team with  
salary-cap space to facilitate a three-way trade that would bring 
Wizards free agent Mitch Richmond to the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Lakers were near agreement with Rick Fox on a reported  
six-year, $24 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Associated Press learned that Chicago Bulls were the team  
that offered Jermaine O'Neal a one-year contract worth at least $9 
million. O'Neal turned the offer down and re-signed with Portland 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers general manager Jim Paxson said Anderson's contract  
status was one factor behind his trade to the Clippers. Anderson, 
entering the final year of his three-year rookie contract, was 
seeking a seven-year, $60 million extension from the Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor said his team would not  
immediately offer Anderson an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get to know Derek, see how he plays and how well he  
fits in. That's something we need to see, and then we can talk 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, who lost his starting job with the Clippers last season  
after 13 games, agreed to a seven-year, $25 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said it's hard to judge anyone based on last year's  
strike-shortened season, and he sees Murray as someone who adds 
depth to the roster and keep defenses from collapsing on Cleveland 
big men Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Shawn Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he's excited to play for Cleveland after five losing  
seasons with the Clippers. He averaged 12.2 points last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was roller-coaster ride throughout the five years I was  
there,'' he said. ``I never knew where I stood in terms of the 
organization. It was a difficult time for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have now lost free agents Murray, Martin and Rodney  
Rogers. They stand to lose a fourth, Wright, but were expected to 
pull off another sign-and-trade deal for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's narrowing down now, but there are still quite a few teams  
that have called with an interest in Lorenzen,'' Baylor said. 
``There isn't anything that has come up thus far that would be 
acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Nesby and Eric Piatkowski are the Clippers' other free  
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Funderburke, 28, averaged 9.2 points and 4.6 rebounds for two  
seasons with the Kings. Last season, the 6-foot-9 forward shot a 
team-leading 55.9 percent from the field while averaging 8.9 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-year NBA veteran, Martin averaged 8.0 points and 3.9  
assists for the Clippers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darrick provides us with an experienced point guard who has  
started a number of games over his NBA career,'' Sacramento general 
manager Geoff Petrie said. ``Along with Jason Williams, Darrick 
solidifies our situation at point guard, which was a position this 
offseason we wanted to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, who acquired Nick Anderson from Orlando on Tuesday,  
are expected to re-sign forward Corliss Williamson later this week.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Race Car Driver Mahoney Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Chuck Mahoney, a driver who excelled  
in the early years of NASCAR four decades ago, has died at the age 
of 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney, who ranked seventh in total points on the Grand  
National circuit in 1959, the second year of what would become 
Winston Cup racing, died July 20 after a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney, whose hard-driving style earned him the nicknames  
``Three Wheels'' and ``Wild Man,'' finished fifth in the first 
Darlington 500. He made a name for himself while competing against 
the likes of Lee Petty and Fireball Roberts, and was named NASCAR 
driver of the month in November 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no one better than Chuck,'' said 79-year-old Cliff  
Kotary, who raced against Mahoney. ``I think a lot of people may 
have forgotten about him, but when racing first got started he was 
the big name. If you could beat Chuck Mahoney, that was something 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney, who introduced stock car racing on ice on Oneida Lake,  
also promoted racing at two tracks in upstate New York.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Soldiers Kidnap African Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Former junta soldiers demanding  
humanitarian aid kidnapped 13 U.N. military observers, four 
journalists and a group of regional intervention soldiers, a U.N. 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers abducted their captives Wednesday when the fighters  
were supposed to hand over 150 women and children taken prisoner 
during the West African country's bloody civil war, which ended 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	After releasing a few prisoners, the soldiers began to complain  
that they needed food and medicine and wanted to talk to the United 
Nations about their plight. Later, they turned their weapons on the 
group and marched the people into the forest, said Jacqueline 
Chenard, a spokeswoman for the U.N. military observer mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred at Okra Hill, a forested, hilly area about  
40 miles east of the coastal capital, Freetown. 
</P>
<P>
	The abductees were being held by former soldiers of the Armed  
Force Revolutionary Council, the junta that seized power in a 1997 
coup and was ousted in 1998 by the West African intervention force, 
known as ECOMOG. 
</P>
<P>
	The junta later allied itself with Sierra Leone's brutal rebel  
movement, though many former junta soldiers now act independently 
and have become outlaws, terrorizing parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers took 13 unarmed U.N. observers and an unknown  
number of soldiers from the West African intervention force known 
as ECOMOG. 
</P>
<P>
	They also seized Christo Johnson, a local reporter for Reuters,  
Pasco Temple of Liberia's Star radio and two people from Sierra 
Leonean television. The journalists were covering the prisoner 
handover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions are going on, and we hope the situation will be  
resolved by today and that the abductees will be released,'' said 
Chenard, who was at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the Revolutionary United Front on July 7  
signed a peace agreement in Lome, the capital of Africa's Togo, to 
end the eight-year civil war. Tens of thousands of people were 
killed in the war, and many more were maimed by the rebels in a 
brutal campaign of terror. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unknown where the soldiers ares keeping the women and  
children who were to have been released Wednesday. Abductees are 
believed to be held across Sierra Leone, though there are no 
reliable estimates on how many. 
</P>
<P>
	Covering Sierra Leone has been particularly dangerous for  
journalists in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	At least nine have been killed there this year, including Myles  
Tierney, a Kenya-based producer for Associated Press Television 
News, who was shot by gunmen in January. Ian Stewart, the former 
West Africa bureau chief, was seriously injured in the attack.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Pacers Sign Bender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers signed rookie forward  
Jonathan Bender to a multiyear contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the NBA's collective  
bargaining agreement assigns a sum of nearly $7 million over the 
next three seasons to the player selected fifth in the June draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to doing whatever I can to help the  
Pacers. This is something I've dreamed about,'' Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender, 18, a high school star from Mississippi, was the Toronto  
Raptors' top draft pick. The Pacers acquired him in a draft-day 
trade that sent veteran power forward Antonio Davis to the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11, 200-pound Bender averaged 23.1 points in his  
senior year at Picayune High School. He broke Michael Jordan's 
record of 30 points in the 1999 McDonald's High School All-American 
Game with a 31-point effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to be surprised at the level of his play. He  
has an awful lot of work and growing up to do, but I think he has a 
chance to be a terrific NBA player,'' Pacers president Donnie Walsh 
said.

<HEADLINE> Web Investors Still Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A reversal of fortunes for formerly high-flying  
Internet stocks that began as a gradual drip last spring has turned 
into a flood, as a huge selloff in the sector has dragged down 
broader markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround has helped plunge the technology-laden Nasdaq  
Stock Market into a so-called correction, generally defined as a 10 
percent decline from a market's high point. On Wednesday, the 
Nasdaq closed down 11.3 percent from the all-time high reached July 
16 of 2,864.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite early declines, both the Dow Jones industrial average  
and the Nasdaq composite index closed today's session with gains. 
The Dow closed up 119.05 to 10,793.82 -- still well off its high of 
11,209.84 set on July 18 -- while the Nasdaq rose 25.81 to 2,565.81 
to end a five day slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet company Yahoo! Inc., down as low as $110 at one point,  
soared back into positive territory, closing up $7 at $128. Service 
provider America Online Inc. continued to slide, however, losing 
$5.06 1/4 to close at $82.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered almost invincible early this year, online stocks  
appear to have reached their peak in April, when the luster began 
to wear off for investors. The 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index 
has shed more than 40 percent of its value since it hit an all-time 
high on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pain, investors are snubbing new stock offerings  
from Internet firms. The market for initial public offerings, or 
IPOs, of Internet stocks had seemed virtually bulletproof through 
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the jitters that the declines have spread across  
Wall Street, there are some investors who are welcoming the slump 
as an opportunity to buy these stocks at levels far below the 
astronomical prices of this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like this had to happen, given the large number of  
Internet companies that have filed for IPOs recently. It's 
healthy,'' said Ken Fleming, an analyst with Renaissance Capital 
Corp., a financial research firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying sentiment remains 'come back, come back'  
because people love to believe in the potential of the future, 
especially Americans,'' said Steve Harmon, a San Francisco-based 
Internet analyst and money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, sharp declines are scary for investors who bought  
when stocks were peaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer Amazon.com, for example, hit an all-time high of  
$221.25 April 27. It closed today at $97.25, a 56 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Henceforth, investors may have to be more choosy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the Internet is here to stay and there will be  
significant survivors. We just don't know who those survivors will 
be,'' said Edmund Cashman, co-head of capital markets for Legg 
Mason Wood Walker, a Baltimore investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding those survivors won't be easy. Cashman noted that the  
stocks of most Internet companies continue to trade at prices that 
have no historical precedence. Traditional methods of placing a 
value on a company's stock have been thrown out the window as 
investors have increasingly gambled solely on an online company's 
potential to earn money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp., which has a  
big online business, have traded recently at a price that's 100 
times the company's annual earnings per share. By comparison, the 
shares of conventional brokerage firms such as Lehman Brothers and 
PaineWebber generally trade at prices that are 15 times the 
company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is even more surreal for the vast majority of  
Internet companies that have recently made their first public 
offering of stock because most of those companies are at high 
levels even though most have never earned a profit, Cashman noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in recent IPOs indicates that investors are  
starting to get selective. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the stocks of four Internet companies sank in their  
debuts on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Prior to Tuesday, of the dozens 
of Internet companies that have completed initial public offerings 
in the last year, just three failed to make gains in their first 
day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this has deterred investors such as Daniel Wang, 44, of  
Basking Ridge, N.J. Wang said he first began investing in the 
sector earlier this year, when many of the stocks were already 
approaching their highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have jumped in earlier,'' he said. ``I believe a few  
years from now, these stocks will be a good investment. There's 
definitely a future in these companies.''

<HEADLINE> Running Backs Reunited With Raiders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- Running backs Napoleon Kaufman, Rashaan  
Salaam and Tyrone Wheatley were drafted within a span of five picks 
in the 1995 NFL draft. Now they're competing for playing time in 
the Oakland Raiders backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman, drafted 18th by Oakland in 1995, is the incumbent at  
halfback. Salaam, picked 21st by Chicago, is attempting a comeback 
with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, the 17th pick of the New York Giants, was signed  
Wednesday by Oakland after being cut by Miami. The Raiders made the 
move after fullback Zack Crockett broke his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at the combine together with the other two guys,''  
Kaufman said. ``It's awesome, just to see how those guys have grown 
and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley remembers going on a college recruiting visit with  
Kaufman to Colorado, the school where Salaam became a Heisman 
Trophy winner. And he still remembers the 5-foot-9, 180-pound 
Kaufman putting on a display of strength during the NFL scouting 
combine. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really, really impressed me was when we went to the  
combine. His bench press, his reps, were just incredible,'' 
Wheatley said. ``I love talent, regardless as to what sport it is. 
And he is definitely a super talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman, who has gained 3,579 yards in four seasons with the  
Raiders, has had considerably more success in the NFL than either 
of his peers. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam gained 1,682 yards in little more than two seasons with  
the Bears, but broke his leg during the 1997 season and hasn't 
played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley gained 1,280 yards in four often contentious seasons in  
New York. He was traded to Miami during the offseason and cut by 
the Dolphins on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is football. At any given moment you have to be ready for  
a move,'' Wheatley said Thursday after his second practice with the 
Raiders. ``There are always uncertainties and I'm ready for them. 
I'm just trying to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley and Ray Zellars, another member of that 1995 draft  
class, were signed by the Raiders a day after Crockett was injured. 
Crockett, who was competing for the starting fullback job with 
incumbent Jon Ritchie, is expected to be out 4-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Zellars, a second-round pick in 1995, gained 1,351 yards in four  
seasons with New Orleans and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave them a couple of plays last night and today we let  
them run them,'' Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. ``We have a long 
ways to go as far as bringing them up to speed, but they have a lot 
of talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Wheatley means there are seven players who went  
to Michigan on the Raiders' roster, including rookies Scott 
Dreisbach, Marcus Ray and Sam Sword. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hiring Bo Schembechler as a consultant today,'' Gruden  
joked, referring to the former Michigan coach.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Rise; Dow Ends Up 119.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks managed their strongest gains in more  
than a week Thursday as investors sought out bargains or safe bets 
a day before a key government report on unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended a turbulent session with  
a gain of 119.05, closing at 10,793.82. The Dow had tumbled 108 
points in morning trading before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher, but any gains were  
hard-fought and potentially fragile, analysts said. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 rose 8.38 to 1,313.71, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 25.83 to 2,565.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, heavily weighted with technology stocks, eked out  
its first gain since last Wednesday. The index is now 10.5 percent 
below its July 16 record high of 2,864.48, a level that many 
analysts believe will lure cautious buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the selling pressure has been relieved, but you  
certainly can't call it a rally,'' said Robert Stovall, president 
of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors remained off-balance in advance of Friday  
morning's Labor Department report on unemployment. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last week any further decline 
in the low U.S. jobless rate could suggest that inflation is 
beginning to threaten the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has already signaled the Fed's willingness to raise  
interest rates in a pre-emptive strike against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, however, the markets were able to shrug off two  
possible harbingers of accelerating inflation. The Labor 
Department's report on productivity and labor costs showed American 
workers' productivity slowed significantly in the spring, rising at 
an annual rate of just 1.3 percent. Labor costs surged at an annual 
rate of 3.8 percent, the worst showing since the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, increased productivity has enabled U.S.  
businesses to counteract rising labor costs. But Greenspan has 
cautioned that investors have been too confident that strong 
productivity gains would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertain economic news sent some investors heading for  
conservative consumer stocks that are considered safe under most 
circumstances. Among the Dow components, Union Carbide rose for a 
second straight day, gaining 3 9/16 to 62 15/16, and 3M rose 2 
11/16 to 94 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM shot up 4 11/16 to 123 3/16 amid reports it will soon unveil  
a new, faster way to store information. 
</P>
<P>
	And American Express picked up 3 5/8, closing at 127 1/8 after the  
company's chief executive detailed the company's Internet strategy 
to investors and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the promise of big online spending by a major  
financial-services firm lent support to a rally by Internet stocks, 
most of which have been pummeled in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent slump has left many stocks ripe for purchase at their  
new, lower prices. Yahoo!, which traded at 244 on April 6, sank 
over the next few months. Thursday, it rebounded 7 3/8 to 128 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay rose 17 1/8 to 92 7/8, and retailer  
drugstore.com gained 10 1/4 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
	But America Online was one of the biggest decliners in the S&AMP;P  
500, losing 3 1/2 to 83 15/16. AOL is battling competitors over its 
instant-messaging technology, and Thursday, the Wall Street Journal 
reported Microsoft is working to develop an inexpensive or free 
dial-up Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, many analysts were unimpressed by the market's  
modest rally, pointing out that three stocks fell for every two 
that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are going to want to study this market carefully,''  
said Tom Madden, chief investment officer for domestic equities at 
Federated Investors of Pittsburgh. ``If we're going to 
authoritatively proceed, breadth will have to improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Composite volume totaled 1.04 billion shares, compared with  
946.60 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 2.93 to 617.39, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.86 to 776.09. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.05 to 429.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
fell 1.85 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 2.8 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was down 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 2.0 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Gets Help To Fight Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Reinforcements were being sent from around the  
West today to help fight dozens of lightning-sparked fires that 
have burned more than 300 square miles of northern Nevada range 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires had charred an estimated 200,000 acres by early today,  
threatening ranches and forcing closures along Interstate 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this morning, a 10-mile stretch of the I-80 between  
Argenta and Battle Mountain was closed as flames came within a 
quarter mile of the highway, a Nevada Highway Patrol dispatcher 
said. A 15-mile section of I-80 near Winnemucca had been closed 
intermittently since noon Wednesday. By 4:30 a.m. I-80 was 
re-opened in those areas, and there were no further road closures. 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of more lightning-packed storms moving into the  
area again today, officials were calling in at least 35 additional 
fire engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were forced to let some fires go unattended while  
they protected inhabited areas. No injuries were reported and only 
one structure -- a railroad storage shed west of Winnemucca -- had 
been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	More storms were expected today and fire officials feared the  
return of lightning, blamed for Wednesday's fires. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as 100,000 acres had burned near I-80 west of  
Winnemucca. Another 32,000 acres was charred north of Battle 
Mountain, said John Noneman, a Bureau of Land Management spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	One fire was burning toward the town of Unionville, 125 miles  
northeast of Reno, Noneman said. The blaze ``is a ways away, but 
there are some ranches in the valley there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Reno, a fire northeast of Sparks quickly grew from 500  
acres Wednesday afternoon to about 3,000 acres and was still 
burning out of control by nightfall, sending a giant plume of smoke 
in the sky east of Reno.

<HEADLINE> INS Looking at IOC Member's Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- American immigration officials are  
examining whether John Kim, the son of a South Korean International 
Olympic Committee member, set up a sham job with a Utah company to 
get United States residency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the process of looking at the information that's  
developed and surfaced ... with relationship to the allegations of 
fraud in obtaining a green card,'' Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations surfaced in court Tuesday, when David E.  
Simmons, head of the now-defunct Keystone Communications, pleaded 
guilty to misdemeanor tax evasion, the first criminal case in the 
investigations of vote-buying to help Salt Lake City win the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons admitted he had hired the son of IOC vice president Kim  
Un-yong at the request of the Salt Lake bid committee, then claimed 
as a business expense the money funneled to him to pay the younger 
Kim's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents say that in 1990, a bid committee official  
Simmons later identified as Tom Welch ``told Simmons that he wanted 
Simmons to assist (Kim) in attaining lawful permanent resident 
status in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who had been laid off from NBC's sports marketing division,  
had a temporary work permit but needed full-time salaried work to 
get residency. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said he hired Kim as a marketing manager for Asia with a  
salary that started at $50,000, based on Welch's pledge to 
reimburse Keystone if Kim didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Welch funneled more than $130,000 in bid  
committee money to the company through bogus consulting contracts 
and other means. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kim family spokesman Bill Schechter insists neither Kim  
Un-yong nor his son knew about the Salt Lake deal and John Kim had 
other job prospects while living in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't have to take the job with Keystone,'' Schechter said  
Thursday. ``It was just kind of unfortunate that they were doing 
some back-room deals. He was totally unaware of what may have been 
going on back in Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schechter also said the Kim family had not been contacted by the  
INS or the FBI, despite news reports to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergeron said he wouldn't discuss such particulars as long as an  
inquiry was under way. He also wouldn't say whether Welch or 
Simmons is under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons' federal plea agreement stipulates he can only be  
prosecuted for the tax evasion charge, as long as it holds firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as federal officials spread the net of their  
investigation, U.S. Olympic Committee leaders feared the Simmons 
case could scare off even more skittish sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this won't refuel it,'' USOC Executive Director  
Dick Schultz said. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee is about $187 
million behind in fundraising needed to meet its budget.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in 4 Murders Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNETT SQUARE, Pa. (AP) -- There are jangled nerves in the  
hometown of Norman Johnston, a convicted murderer who opened the 
window of his cell this week and slipped away from a 
maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised to see him on my doorstep,'' said  
Janice Slicer, who manages the apartment complex where Johnston 
last lived. ``It's a weird feeling that he's out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 48, escaped early Monday from a state prison in  
Huntingdon, a western Pennsylvania community some 200 miles from 
Kennett Square, just outside Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	State police have received a handful of possible sightings since  
then. While authorities say they have no solid information that 
Johnston is back in town, his former wife reportedly left the area 
when she heard of the escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1980, Johnston and his two older brothers, Bruce Sr. and  
David, have been serving life terms for killing four teen-age boys 
in the late 1970s to cover up a family burglary ring. The film ``At 
Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was based on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Johnston Sr. also was convicted of killing his son's  
girlfriend and trying to kill his son, Bruce Jr., who later gave 
incriminating testimony against his father and uncles. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Chester County have alerted dozens of residents  
about the escape. Some of Norman Johnston's relatives still live in 
the area, including Bruce Jr., who left the federal witness 
protection program years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Johnston has ``shown in the past that he's willing to  
kill to protect himself and his family,'' said Joe Carroll, the 
Chester County prosecutor who won convictions against the brothers. 
``It just depends on what he has planned -- whether he's out for 
retaliation, or just wants to stay free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The burglary ring included more than 40 people and operated for  
nearly 20 years. The gang was responsible for stealing hundreds of

<HEADLINE> Barbie Turns 40 With Figure Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- She debuted in 1959 as a classic pin-up girl:  
spiked heels, black and white strapless bathing suit, bee-stung 
lips, powder blue eye shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, after 40 years of various incarnations --  
businesswoman, teacher, rock band member and World Cup soccer jock 
-- Barbie dazzled fans again in a glamorous gown inspired by her 
first outfit. Accents included black gloves, rhinestone jewelry and 
a bouquet of 40 miniature pink roses. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just so beautiful,'' said Linda Costello, a 46-year-old  
accountant who was one of hundreds at the 40th Anniversary Barbie's 
unveiling at the Pittsburgh Hilton and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was the highlight of a three-day National Barbie  
Convention, a mecca for collectors of the 11 1/2-inch plastic icon 
that has enraptured millions of young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many different kinds of Barbie that there's one  
that appeals to everyone,'' Costello said. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	There's the Erica Kane Barbie modeled after Susan Lucci, the  
``All My Children'' star who finally won an Emmy this year with her 
19th nomination. Like ``The X-Files?'' Go for the Scully and Mulder 
-- aka Ken, Barbie's long time boyfriend -- duo. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also Los Angeles Dodgers Barbie, Horse Lovin' Barbie,  
U.S. Marine Barbie, NASCAR Barbie, Baywatch Barbie and Snow White 
Barbie, all priced between $20 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of ``The Wizard of Oz'' can snag a Dorothy Barbie for a  
mere $280, and a Madame du Barbie sporting a silver ballgown 
designed by Bob Mackie for $225. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother lode is a pristine copy of the first Barbie that has  
never, ever been removed from her original box. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could go for $5,000 or more,'' said Stacy Morris, 36, a  
collector from Spokane, Wash. ``But something like that is 
extremely rare. Most have been taken out of the box at least 
once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbie, a product of the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel, was  
``born'' when Dwight Eisenhower was president, ``Ben-Hur'' won Best 
Picture and Fabian and Frankie Avalon made teen-age girls swoon. 
</P>
<P>
	She evolved with the times -- a mini-skirted college graduate in  
the 1960s, a sun worshipper and disco dancer in the 1970s, a 
briefcase-carrying executive in the 1980s and finally, a 
professional women's basketball, soccer and NASCAR driver in the 
1990s.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Rise; Dow Ends Up 119.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks managed their strongest gains in more  
than a week Thursday as investors sought out bargains or safe bets 
a day before a key government report on unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended a turbulent session with  
a gain of 119.05, closing at 10,793.82. The Dow had tumbled 108 
points in morning trading before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher, but any gains were  
hard-fought and potentially fragile, analysts said. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 rose 8.38 to 1,313.71, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 25.83 to 2,565.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, heavily weighted with technology stocks, eked out  
its first gain since last Wednesday. The index is now 10.5 percent 
below its July 16 record high of 2,864.48, a level that many 
analysts believe will lure cautious buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the selling pressure has been relieved, but you  
certainly can't call it a rally,'' said Robert Stovall, president 
of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors remained off-balance in advance of Friday  
morning's Labor Department report on unemployment. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last week any further decline 
in the low U.S. jobless rate could suggest that inflation is 
beginning to threaten the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has already signaled the Fed's willingness to raise  
interest rates in a pre-emptive strike against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, however, the markets were able to shrug off two  
possible harbingers of accelerating inflation. The Labor 
Department's report on productivity and labor costs showed American 
workers' productivity slowed significantly in the spring, rising at 
an annual rate of just 1.3 percent. Labor costs surged at an annual 
rate of 3.8 percent, the worst showing since the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, increased productivity has enabled U.S.  
businesses to counteract rising labor costs. But Greenspan has 
cautioned that investors have been too confident that strong 
productivity gains would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertain economic news sent some investors heading for  
conservative consumer stocks that are considered safe under most 
circumstances. Among the Dow components, Union Carbide rose for a 
second straight day, gaining 3 9/16 to 62 15/16, and 3M rose 2 
11/16 to 94 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM shot up 4 11/16 to 123 3/16 amid reports it will soon unveil  
a new, faster way to store information. 
</P>
<P>
	And American Express picked up 3 5/8, closing at 127 1/8 after the  
company's chief executive detailed the company's Internet strategy 
to investors and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the promise of big online spending by a major  
financial-services firm lent support to a rally by Internet stocks, 
most of which have been pummeled in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent slump has left many stocks ripe for purchase at their  
new, lower prices. Yahoo!, which traded at 244 on April 6, sank 
over the next few months. Thursday, it rebounded 7 3/8 to 128 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay rose 17 1/8 to 92 7/8, and retailer  
drugstore.com gained 10 1/4 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
	But America Online was one of the biggest decliners in the S&AMP;P  
500, losing 3 1/2 to 83 15/16. AOL is battling competitors over its 
instant-messaging technology, and Thursday, the Wall Street Journal 
reported Microsoft is working to develop an inexpensive or free 
dial-up Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, many analysts were unimpressed by the market's  
modest rally, pointing out that three stocks fell for every two 
that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are going to want to study this market carefully,''  
said Tom Madden, chief investment officer for domestic equities at 
Federated Investors of Pittsburgh. ``If we're going to 
authoritatively proceed, breadth will have to improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Composite volume totaled 1.04 billion shares, compared with  
946.60 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 2.93 to 617.39, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.86 to 776.09. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.05 to 429.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
fell 1.85 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 2.8 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was down 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 2.0 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Urges Parents on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TONAWANDA, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton urged parents  
Thursday to consider boycotting sponsors of violent television 
shows and to refuse to buy violent video games ``no matter how much 
your child begs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an opportunity for more parents to act as  
consumers,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Let people know you're not going 
to buy products that support shows and things you don't believe 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, eyeing a run for the Senate from New York, said  
parents must take more control over their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may sound hopelessly old-fashioned, but I believe  
children want limits,'' she said during a discussion with more than 
75 Buffalo-area residents on school violence and youth problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't buy those video games, no matter how much your child  
begs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Television came in for its share of criticism from the first  
lady. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just no doubt that our children are exposed to an  
overwhelming amount of violence and mayhem -- not only violent acts, 
but violent language -- from the moment they are put in front of a 
television set,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most parents would never allow a screaming, violent person into  
their homes and would probably call the police if such a person 
showed up at their door, Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we invite those people into our living rooms and even  
worse than that, we put televisions into the bedrooms of our 
children so they're all alone when they're watching that,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Clinton, who has been characterized by some Republican  
critics as being too liberal, the event allowed her to strike a 
conservative note when it came to parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate reported released Thursday also called for parents to  
do more to shield their children from media violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, requested by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and prepared  
by the Republican staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he 
chairs, concluded that the media dominate children's lives, that 
they are exceedingly violent and that the images lead to real world 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	It called for a ban on advertising for adult programming at  
times when children are most likely to be watching television or 
listening to the radio, and said the television, motion picture, 
music and video game industries should be encouraged to rate their 
products using a similar rating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at an elementary school for the latest stop of her  
``listening tour'' of New York, Mrs. Clinton was greeted by more 
than 100 fans and a handful of placard-carrying critics. One sign 
read: ``Hillary, go back to Arkansas on the jackass you rode in 
on.'' A small picture of President Clinton appeared next to the 
word ``jackass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, the first lady blasted Congress for considering taking a  
vacation without having completed work on tough gun-control 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should get back to work before our children go back  
to school ... This is too important an issue to be put on the back 
burner,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day came word of another fatal shooting with three  
people reported dead in Alabama and a suspect taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's criticism came as she continued her summer-long  
``listening tour'' across New York. The first lady, who has never 
lived or worked in New York, is eyeing the Senate seat being 
vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. On the 
Republican side, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and two Long 
Island congressmen, Rick Lazio and Peter King, are considering the 
race.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Angry About Loss of Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban high jump great Javier Sotomayor, angry over  
being stripped of his Pan American gold medal when cocaine was 
detected in his urine, said he never knowingly took the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have only seen that substance in the movies,'' Sotomayor  
told the Communist Party daily Granma in an interview published 
today. ``I don't need any kind of trick to jump 2.30'' meters (7 
feet, 6 1/2 inches). 
</P>
<P>
	He said he doesn't even take vitamins.  
</P>
<P>
	In the interview granted in his home in Havana's fashionable  
Miramar neighborhood, Sotomayor said he had undergone countless 
drug tests both for various athletic competitions and by doctors 
who work for Cuba's sports program and no traces had ever been 
found before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a victim,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, Sotomayor has talked only to Cuba's  
government-controlled media, which stands behind his claims of 
innocence and insists that he was the victim of a ``manipulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign reporters arriving at his light blue stucco one-story  
home have been turned away by his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He was spotted by reporters briefly Wednesday night when he  
drove into his garage in his red Mercedes before someone closed the 
garage door behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Recreational drug use remains rare in Cuba, and is frowned upon  
by Fidel Castro's government, which considers it just another 
negative byproduct of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Such use has grown in recent years, however, with an increase of  
tourism to the island nation. Worried about narcotics use among 
youth who befriend visiting tourists, the government shut down many 
of Havana's nightclubs for several weeks early this year.

<HEADLINE> Cuba To Fight Sotomayor Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuba's Olympic committee president  
accused ``enemies of Cuba'' with trying to discredit high jumper 
Javier Sotomayor, a national hero who tested positive for cocaine 
at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ramon Fernandez, a vice president of the Cuban Council of  
Ministers, made some veiled references Thursday to the United 
States during a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``My conviction is that there are foreign interests set out to  
harm us,'' Fernandez said. ``They denied before the plots to 
assassinate, to sabotage ... What is the hairy, ugly, powerful hand 
behind this? We do not know yet. ... With technology and power, 
certain agencies can do anything, even things we can't think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba will fight Sotomayor's expected two-year suspension from  
international competition that will force him out of this month's 
world championships and next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports minister Humberto Rodriguez couldn't say on what grounds  
they might appeal or offer any explanation for the presence of 
cocaine in two urine samples taken from the world champion and 
four-time Pan Ams gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something I do not have to explain,'' he said while  
offering a lecture on the value of sport to Cuba and the honor and 
unimpeachable integrity of Cuban athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our athletes have had to compete under an atmosphere of  
hostility, exaggerated provocation and unlimited intolerance. We 
have been subject to such pressure in training centers . . . phone 
calls, personal messages in direct and indirect provocations,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Roriguez singled out Joe Cubas, a sports agent who has arranged  
for the defection of many Cuban athletes, including, last week, 
pitcher Danys Baez. 
</P>
<P>
	``That mercenary was walking the streets at night, enticing and  
provoking not only our athletes, but also our journalists,'' 
Rodriguez said. ``But of course our country, our land, our people 
are beyond anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez emphasized he was not accusing games doctors of  
anything. Instead, he claimed ``this is a maneuver against Cuba 
through Sotomayor by enemies of Cuba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials said Sotomayor never took cocaine and charged  
the substance was planted in something he ate or drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible he  
would take this substance,'' said professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, 
director of the orthopedic complex of Cuba. ``He has told us he has 
not taken this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Featuring After-Hours Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The light breeze that's blowing after-hours  
stock trading into the mainstream may reach gale force with a gust 
from America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in November, a new electronic trading system will  
enable AOL's 17 million members to participate in the volatile 
dealings that take place when traditional markets like the New York 
Stock Exchange are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's decision to link with Wit Capital's trading network,  
announced Thursday, comes just days after the broker Datek launched 
a short after-hours session. 
</P>
<P>
	Wit, a pioneering online investment firm that's part-owned by  
Goldman Sachs, will also provide stock quotes and other information 
for the new AOL service under an exclusive six-month deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the after-hours market had been an exclusive  
affair, off-limits to anyone but major institutional players 
managing huge sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the trading is conducted on the Instinet electronic  
market, which is owned by Reuters. But now, several rival systems 
have sprouted up with the intention of providing off-hours access 
for the common investor. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek's after-hours session runs only for about an hour after  
the regular close of trading, but most of the new systems plan to 
offer an evening session lasting two or three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The privilege of joining the after-hours club may come with  
pitfalls, however, since most of these new markets will be thinly 
traded at first. Without sufficient demand from buyers and sellers, 
only the most popular stocks will usually be available for trading, 
and even then, share prices may swing wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	As protection, most of the new after-hours systems require  
people to name a specific price they're willing to pay or receive 
for a given stock. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's announcement on Thursday could serve as a big first step  
toward helping resolve the problem of thin trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing nearly 10 million visitors per month, AOL's ``Personal  
Finance Channel'' is not only one of the most popular destinations 
within the AOL network, but possibly the most popular financial 
site on the entire Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL has this significant pool of people who are involved in  
personal finance and investing online,'' said Frank Lallos, an 
industry analyst at Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass., adding that 
``AOL consumers spend a lot of time transacting business,'' 
including online shopping and online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he cautioned, ``it's not clear that after hours trading is  
the panacea that everyone expects it to be. There are a lot of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a limited number of stocks that we're really talking  
about. And even companies like Intel, Microsoft and Dell that trade 
tens of millions of shares a day aren't likely to have same 
liquidity after hours. As a result, you're likely to see large 
price swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also may not get the best prices quoted on bigger  
markets like Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Wit Capital, several of the new after-hours systems boast  
major partners, all of them trying to get in on the ground floor of 
a new market they hope will be as explosive as online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman also owns a stake in a trading network named  
Archipelago, along with J.P. Morgan and ETrade. Last month, 
brokerages Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, and Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette formed a joint venture with Spear, Leeds &AMP; 
Kellogg to create a new electronic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek's after-hours trading is conducted by its Island ECN  
subsidiary, which is partly owned by Waterhouse Investor Services. 
</P>
<P>
	All the impending competition has prompted the NYSE and the  
Nasdaq Stock Market to announce that they'll introduce their 
after-hours trading sessions sometime next year.

<HEADLINE> Reno Defends Campaign Finance Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno denied Thursday  
that investigations of alleged Democratic campaign finance abuses 
have been kept alive to block Republicans in Congress from pursuing 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is certainly not true'' that investigations appearing to be  
dormant are kept on an active list to thwart congressional 
investigators, who are unable to question people targeted by the 
Justice Department, Reno said at her weekly briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of any basis for concluding that at all,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the investigations are more than a year old. Reno said  
she could not comment on any pending matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general was responding to questions about a column  
by Robert Novak of the Chicago Sun-Times. He reported earlier this 
week that an internal status report of the Justice Department's 
campaign finance task force listed as ``ongoing'' several 
investigations of Democratic fund raisers and donors that appear to 
have made little progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government and Reform Committee has pursued its own  
investigation of the donors. Its chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., 
has complained bitterly that the committee's work has been stymied 
by the Justice Department and accused Reno of protecting President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's committee has been wanting to question Democratic fund  
raiser John Huang, who is accused of making illegal campaign 
contributions. As a chief fund raiser for the Asian-American 
community in 1996, Huang brought in $1.6 million in questionable 
donations that later were returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang cooperated with the Justice Department's task force and  
arranged a plea bargain. Last month Burton asked the judge in the 
case to postpone Huang's sentencing hearing until Huang agrees to 
testify before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday the Justice Department's task force filed court  
papers saying that under the plea agreement Huang does not have to 
testify before his hearing, scheduled for Aug. 12. Huang will go 
before the committee after he has been sentenced and assert his 
Fifth Amendment rights, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday Burton's committee subpoenaed task force  
records on several aspects of the campaign finance investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she would try to work with the committee, but noted  
potential conflicts in turning over documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are matters relating to pending investigations and  
pending prosecutions in which if we provide information and if it's 
made public can have a dramatic impact on the pending 
investigation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also said prosecutions are a function of the executive  
branch, and ``for Congress to be involved in the management of an 
investigation or a prosecution produces questions about is it being 
handled the right way.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Avery Has Shoulder Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds pitcher Steve Avery had  
surgery on his left shoulder Thursday, ending his 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews and Dr. Timothy Kremchek performed the  
90-minute operation in Birmingham, Ala. Avery can begin throwing 
again in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery signed with the Reds as a free agent last December and  
went 6-7 with a 5.16 ERA in 19 starts. His control was a big 
problem -- he walked 78 in 96 innings and got progressively wilder 
as the season went along.

<HEADLINE> Bears Trying To Revive Pass Rush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Richard Dent. Steve McMichael. Dan  
Hampton. Trace Armstrong. Alonzo Spellman. 
</P>
<P>
	For 10 years, the Chicago Bears had one of the most feared pass  
rushes in the NFL. Just the sight of a big, bruising lineman could 
be enough to make a quarterback bobble the ball or dump it off. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last few years, to put it nicely, the Bears' pass rush  
isn't what it used to be. No offense to Jim Flanigan, but when a 
tackle leads a team in sacks, that's usually not a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are questions that we've talked about through the whole  
off-season,'' coach Dick Jauron said. ``We've got to get production 
from the quarterback position, regardless of who it is. We've got 
to have an effective running game in order to be successful. And 
we've got to have a pass rush and we've got to find it from the 
defensive end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consistency at defensive end has been Chicago's biggest problem.  
While Dent was a fixture at right end from 1984 to 1993 and 
Armstrong at left end from 1989 to 1994, the roster from the last 
four seasons reads like a guest list. Spellman at left end one 
year, right end the next. John Thierry switching sides. Albert 
Fontenot, Carl Reeves, Shawn Lee, Mark Thomas and Bryan Robinson -- 
they all got a try at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterbacks, meanwhile, got away practically unscathed. The  
Bears had 28 sacks last season, tied for last in the NFL with 
Cincinnati and way behind the league average of 40.3. Flanigan led 
the team with 8 1/2 sacks. He and linebacker Barry Minter shared the 
team lead in 1997 with six sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Jauron took over as coach in late January, one of his  
first moves was to shore up defensive end. He recruited Clyde 
Simmons -- 10th on the NFL's all-time sack list and a two-time Pro 
Bowler -- to be a pass-rush specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Clyde Simmons. Everybody in the league knows Clyde  
Simmons,'' Jauron said. ``He's a proven pass-rusher and he's a 
force at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears also signed Jamal Duff, who had three sacks and a  
career-high 38 tackles with Washington last season. They continued 
their conversion of Robinson, who played the last five games of the 
season at left end. 
</P>
<P>
	They also used their second-round pick on Russell Davis, who  
played end as a freshman and sophomore at North Carolina and has 
been compared to the Green Bay Packers' Vonnie Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real rusty and I feel kind of sloppy out there. But each  
day, I think I'm progressing,'' said Davis, who played tackle his 
last two seasons at Carolina. ``I don't feel any pressure on me to 
be the savior. Clyde's here, Bryan Robinson's here. Those guys are 
veterans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Progress is slow, though. Duff has drawn a lot more attention  
this week, and the rest of the ends seemed to have made more 
progress in the last couple of days, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're still nowhere near where Jauron and the rest of his  
staff want them to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting good play out of them at times. We're not  
getting the consistent play we need or want,'' Jauron said. ``But 
in fact, at this point in camp, we're probably not getting as 
consistent of play anywhere as we wanted. So we'll just have to 
wait and see that one.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Eyeing Other LA Stadium Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue told Gov.  
Gray Davis on Thursday the league will investigate other potential 
stadium sites for an expansion team in the Los Angeles area 
following failed negotiations involving the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Eli Broad, the head of one of the groups vying for  
the expansion franchise, released a letter he sent to the NFL 
earlier this week proposing his group pay a $2 million 
non-refundable fee for a 60-day option to acquire the franchise at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad's proposal includes more public funds than previously  
offered, but doesn't make clear how he will be able to change 
authorities' minds on that issue. The Coliseum bid has been in 
doubt because the state is unwilling to spend as much taxpayer 
money as the NFL has requested. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello confirmed Thursday night the league  
received the letter, but had not yet responded. He wouldn't comment 
on Broad's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Broad's proposals was that a $550 million franchise fee be  
established -- half payable in cash, the other half to come from all 
new revenues. The annual rent would be $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed making the public responsible for additional  
costs and work associated with the Coliseum, contrary to the 
original offer, and that tax revenues be used to make a $150 
million investment in the project, which also differs from the 
original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The original agreement offered by the state's official  
negotiator said the state would charge the expansion team $2.5 
million to $5 million in annual rent for the property, and pledged 
the state's support for issuing $150 million in bonds to pay for 
parking at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiator, Bill Chadwick, asked the owners last week in  
Chicago to sign the non-binding agreement to build a stadium on 
publicly owned land at Exposition Park. Instead of signing it, 
Tagliabue asked for more state money, and Chadwick submitted a 
letter of resignation out of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis issued a statement Thursday asking Chadwick to ``be  
available to re-engage in discussions with the NFL on behalf of the 
state if there is an opportunity to move this discussion forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also said he felt Chadwick had presented a ``fair and  
reasonable offer'' to the NFL regarding the Coliseum proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is already a substantial commitment of local and federal  
resources to improve Exposition Park,'' Davis said. ``The NFL has 
to appreciate that there are a number of higher priorities for the 
use of public funds in California than attracting an NFL team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on the letter, Chadwick said he believes the NFL is  
trying to get as much money as possible for the league and the 
ownership entity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my job to second-guess their evaluation of their  
interests. And it's not their job to second-guess my evaluation of 
the state's interests,'' Chadwick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected to be involved any further, Chadwick said,  
``I don't know at this point what the future holds for the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum site. If they were to make a proposal to 
the state with respect to that site, I think based on the 
governor's statement that he would ask me to look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In responding to Davis' letter, Tagliabue said, ``We are now  
convinced that this goal (of bringing an expansion team to Los 
Angeles) can best be pursued through the evaluation of an expanded 
range of alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concluded that our effort to reach agreements for the  
operation of an NFL team in Los Angeles can no longer be limited to 
the Coliseum or Exposition Park,'' Tagliabue said in a letter to 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other potential stadium sites in the area are one in  
nearby Carson, proposed previously by Michael Ovitz; one near 
Hollywood Park in Inglewood; one at Dodger Stadium; and in Anaheim 
or Irvine in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
	Aiello said the Coliseum has not been eliminated, but added,  
``Our focus will be on alternative sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aiello also said, ``At this point, we can't rule out any  
possible alternative in the Los Angeles area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL announced in March it was awarding the league's 32nd  
franchise to Los Angeles over Houston, but set a Sept. 15 deadline 
for details to be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Houston representatives are waiting with their  
proposal should the Los Angeles bid fail, and the clock is running. 
</P>
<P>
	After the NFL made clear it favored the Coliseum over Ovitz's  
proposed site, the Broad-Roski team and the Ovitz team unified 
their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz was out of the country and unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would love for football to come back to Los Angeles,'' said  
Peter Levin, a spokesman for Ovitz. ``We have been working hard to 
reach this goal and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without an NFL team since the Raiders moved  
to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 season.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves $7.4B in Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has agreed on a $7.4 billion  
package of farm assistance, sending a ``clear signal'' to growers 
that they're likely to get extra cash this fall to compensate for 
slumping crop prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan omits any special assistance for Eastern growers who  
are suffering through one of the region's worst droughts this 
century. But that could be added when House and Senate negotiators 
work out of the final version of the measure this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good place to start,'' said Mary Kay Thatcher, a  
lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. ``It's a very 
good indication for the House on what kind of aid the Senate 
believes is necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats wanted as much as $11 billion, but GOP leaders beat  
back several attempts Wednesday to fatten the package. In the end, 
Democrats decided the GOP plan was ``better than there being no 
assistance all,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 89-8 vote, the $7.4 billion was added to an annual  
Agriculture Department spending bill for the fiscal year beginning 
Oct. 1, pushing the cost of the legislation to $68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The House didn't put any such assistance in its version of the  
bill, but Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said recently that the 
House is ``committed to taking decisive action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee will negotiate a final  
version of the assistance package, with negotiations starting in 
September after Congress returns from a month-long recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hasn't taken a position on how much  
aid is needed. ``We hope that they'll send us something we can 
sign,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday. Last 
year, President Clinton vetoed a $4 billion farm bailout and forced 
congressional Republicans to add $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops are depressed  
for the second year in a row because of huge crops worldwide. 
Federal farm subsidies already were expected to reach a near record 
$16.7 billion even without the additional assistance Congress is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's aid package includes $5.5 billion in direct  
payments to most growers as compensation for low commodity prices, 
a separate $475 million for soybean growers, $400 million in 
subsidies for crop insurance, $328 million for tobacco growers and 
$325 million in livestock assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would double the cap on crop subsidies that an  
individual farmer can receive from $150,000 to $300,000, a change 
sought by large-scale farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate plan ``will send a clear signal to bankers ... and  
family farmers that there is going to be additional help coming at 
a critical time,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaylen Affield, who grows corn, soybeans and wheat near Fergus  
Falls, Minn., was pleased. ``The government has to do something 
here because we can't produce at these prices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate became something of a referendum on the 1996 farm  
law, popularly known as ``Freedom to Farm,'' which scaled back 
production-based crop subsidies. Democrats wanted to put the bulk 
of the disaster aid into raising crop subsidies, but Republicans 
said that would appear to be undoing the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight senators who voted against the aid package were  
Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas, Judd Gregg and Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire, George Voinovich of Ohio and Connie Mack of Florida, and 
Democrats Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Bob Graham of Florida and 
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate move intended to boost farm exports, the Senate  
added a provision to the spending bill requiring the president to 
get congressional approval before including food or medicine in a 
trade embargo. The only exceptions would be for governments deemed 
to be sponsoring terrorism, including Cuba, Iraq and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the U.S. uses food as a diplomatic weapon, by imposing  
unilateral agricultural embargoes against foreign leaders, it takes 
away from our farmers their ability to sell their product,'' said 
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.

<HEADLINE> BBC Confronts Digital TV Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A government panel recommends raising the  
television license fee paid by British households to help the 
British Broadcasting Corp. convert to digital broadcasting. The 
panel also called today for the BBC to sell assets, cut costs and 
increase revenues to fund the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	The BBC complained that the proposed funding would be  
insufficient, while BBC rivals protested that the BBC was being 
given an unfair edge in the race to digitize. 
</P>
<P>
	Culture Secretary Chris Smith said he hoped there would be a  
vigorous debate on the proposals before the government makes its 
decision in the autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	The BBC's domestic services are primarily funded by a license  
fee paid by every household in Britain with a television set. 
</P>
<P>
	The government commission, chaired by economist Gavyn Davies,  
recommended that the basic BBC license fee be frozen at the current 
annual rate of 101 pounds ($164), but proposed a monthly supplement 
of 1.99 pounds to fund new digital services. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplement would be gradually reduced over the years and  
phased when all British broadcasts convert to digital. 
</P>
<P>
	The BBC said the digital levy was the most equitable method of  
raising extra public money, but added: ``In the face of the sheer 
scale and immediacy of the digital challenge, the funding level 
proposed will not enable the BBC to offer the full benefits of the 
digital age to license payers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clive Jones, chief executive of the independent Carlton  
Television, argued that, ``We spent hundreds of millions of pounds 
on digital television. The BBC is now going to get an unfair 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said the BBC should help finance the switch to  
digital by achieving savings of 350 million pounds a year and 
generating an extra 250 million pounds a year in business income. 
However, the panel ruled out advertising, sponsorship or 
subscriptions as new revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also recommended that BBC sell its Resources  
division, including studios, outside broadcast units, costumes and 
technical support. It also suggested selling a 49 percent stake in 
BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals do not affect the BBC World Service, which is  
underwritten by the government.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Traded to Phoenix Suns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway got what he wanted Thursday and  
was traded to the Phoenix Suns, ending his fading star career in 
Orlando and completing the breakup of a Magic team that went to the 
NBA Finals just four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After a final day of reconsidering their options and trying to  
talk Hardaway into staying, the Magic finally made the trade and 
acquired Danny Manning, Pat Garrity and two first-round draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, who will be paid $86 million over the next seven  
years, joins Jason Kidd in what could be one of the most formidable 
backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a major coup for the Suns, who had no room under the  
salary cap to go after free agents, let alone one the stature of 
Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic tried to work out a deal with the Lakers, Raptors and  
a few other teams, but all of them had dropped out of the bidding 
by the middle of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Magic, it marked the end of an era. Just a few years  
ago, the team looked like it would be an enduring Eastern 
Conference powerhouse when its roster included Hardaway and 
Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Magic will plunge into a massive rebuilding without  
a single star left. The Magic have 10 first-round draft picks over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the goal for the franchise is to win a world  
championship, even though this might not happen next year,'' 
general manager John Gabriel said. ``The trade of Penny Hardaway 
sets us for the launch of a new era and a new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's the best thing for (Penny) to get a fresh  
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was en route to Phoenix and was to appear at a 10 p.m.  
EDT news conference. He was in Phoenix last Friday and Saturday to 
meet with Suns officials, played a round of golf with coach Danny 
Ainge and was presented with a golf bag in Suns' purple with his 
name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it clear to the Suns that they were his first choice,  
and when Phoenix agreed to pay him the maximum allowable under the 
collective bargaining agreement it was only a matter of getting 
Orlando to agree to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway opted out of the final three years of his contract and  
became a free agent this summer, but only Chicago, the Los Angeles 
Clippers and Toronto had anywhere near the money available to land 
him. He made it clear to Magic officials over the past few days 
that he did not want to return as Orlando -- especially new coach 
Doc Rivers -- tried in vain to get him to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was drafted by Golden State as the third pick overall  
in 1993, then was traded to Orlando, which had drafted O'Neal the 
previous year. Hardaway and O'Neal almost instantly made the Magic 
a title contender. By their second season together, 1994-95, the 
Magic made it to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the 
Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal left for Los Angeles in 1996, and Hardaway's image as one  
of the NBA's rising superstars took a beating in the ensuing years 
as he orchestrated the departure of coach Brian Hill and then sat 
out most of the 1997-98 season but still played in the All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had an uneven relationship with Magic coach Chuck Daly,  
who resigned after the 1999 season, and trade talk began as early 
as February of 1998, when he nearly was dealt to the New Jersey 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Magic were ousted by the 76ers and Hardaway complained  
about having to defend the speedy Allen Iverson, owner Rich DeVos 
made it clear that Hardaway's days in Orlando were numbered by 
saying maybe the Magic didn't need any more superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking forward to a new era of Magic basketball,''  
Gabriel said, ``one we believe will be extremely exciting with the 
young talent we have and will assemble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic have traded three starters this offseason, also  
sending Horace Grant to Seattle and Nick Anderson to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway averaged 19 points in his six seasons in Orlando, but  
nagging injuries severely cut into his playing time the last three 
seasons. Last season, he averaged a career-low 15.8 points per 
game. He averaged 19 in the playoffs, but shot just 35 percent from 
the field as Orlando was beaten by Philadelphia in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he is considered one of the top shooting guards in the  
game, and his 6-foot-7 height will be invaluable to a Suns team 
that was often overmatched with Rex Chapman at that position. 
Hardaway also could form a spectacular fast-break combination with 
Kidd, arguably the best point guard in the NBA at pushing the ball 
up the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, 33, is the only NBA player to come back from three  
major knee surgeries. He won the NBA Sixth Man award in 1998, just 
before he went down with his third major knee injury. He came back 
last season to average 9.1 points and 4.4 rebounds off the bench 
for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, the college player of the year when he led Kansas to  
the NCAA championship in 1988, has averaged of 16.6 points per game 
in 11 NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrity, from Notre Dame, averaged 5.6 points as a rookie last  
season. He has been the property of four teams in his brief 
professional career. He was drafted by Milwaukee, then traded to 
Dallas, which dealt him to Phoenix before he'd ever played a game.

<HEADLINE>  Young's Comeback Still in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stockton, Calif (AP) -- Bryant Young walks and runs easily now,  
and that's saying a lot considering the gruesome injury that ended 
his season last November. 
</P>
<P>
	A star defensive tackle for the San Francisco 49ers, Young has  
made remarkable progress since breaking both bones in his lower 
right leg in a freak collision with a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a good chance, according to coach Steve Mariucci,  
that Young could be ready for the Sept. 12 regular season opener at 
Jacksonville, a prospect once regarded as unthinkable because of 
the severity of the injury. At one time, the 49ers forecast a 
midseason return. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Young's comeback is a work in progress and will  
remain so even after he resumes playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get back on the field, it doesn't stop there. That's  
where it starts,'' Young said. ``I've been feeling pretty good 
about how things have been going so far. It can only get better as 
long as I keep working at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very serious injury and I've been very careful and  
tried to be as honest with myself as possible, listening to my body 
and I think I've done a pretty good job. Really, I feel I have a 
bright outlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young has indeed come a long way in the eight months since  
suffering the devastating injury. The tibia and fibula snapped when 
linebacker Ken Norton Jr.'s helmet struck Young's leg as he braced 
to tackle New York Giants quarterback Kent Graham last Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was lifted from the soggy turf in his uniform, placed on a  
gurney and wheeled to an ambulance that transported him to Stanford 
Hospital, where he spent the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent three operations, including the insertion of a  
titanium rod in the tibia to stabilize the weight-bearing bone. His 
leg swelled badly after surgery and doctors had to slice 6-inch 
openings on both sides of his calf to drain fluids and relieve 
inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it happened, you think, `Wow, is my career over?''' said  
Young, who also underwent skin graft surgery to repair the wounds 
on his calf. ``And you never know where it's going to end up at, 
but with prayer and the support of my family, friends, the 
organization, and my teammates, they've all helped me along. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there were some tough times but once I was able to  
start walking and then gradually going to a light jog, and then 
sprinting, I knew in my heart I would be able to come back from 
this injury. It does stay with you because of the way it happened. 
But I think it's healthy to think about it. It can only help you to 
deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deep scars on his calf are about the only visible sign of  
the injury. The metal rod will remain in his leg for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's feeling pretty good,'' Young said. ``But if it was  
bothering me, and I wasn't able to do the things I've been doing, I 
would have had to make a decision to have it taken out. It feels 
very natural. It's a light piece of metal so I'm able to work and 
run like I was before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the club's training camp, the 27-year-old Young is still  
working apart from the team, engaged in daily rapid-fire 
rehabilitation and conditioning drills under the supervision of 
physical development coordinator Jerry Attaway. 
</P>
<P>
	What quickly becomes clear is that Young is as powerfully built  
as ever -- he can bench press 500 pounds. He still possesses an 
explosive burst off the ball and continues to showcase in his 
workouts the intense, determined style that epitomized his play and 
made him such a defensive force. 
</P>
<P>
	Young is expected to be activated from the physically unable to  
perform list by the middle of next week, allowing him to start 
practicing with the team on a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll start off slowly,'' said Mariucci, adding that in all  
likelihood Young will prepare for the season without playing in any 
of the team's four exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to be able to go through all the drills that we do  
without having any pain, without favoring it, without having any 
problem. He's got to be able to go 1-on-1 pass rush. He's got to go 
1-on-1 against offensive lineman in the run game and be able to 
hold up. Then he's got to be able to take on some double-team 
blocks. He's got to be able to defeat the trap block coming from 
the side, but we can do that in a controlled environment. You're 
not going to have nine bodies flying around in piles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he's confident he can regain his past form.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty confident I can be the same player if not better,''  
he said. ``Once I decide to step on the field and see how things 
go, that will really tell me where I'm at.''

<HEADLINE>  Young's Comeback Still in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stockton, Calif (AP) -- Bryant Young walks and runs easily now,  
and that's saying a lot considering the gruesome injury that ended 
his season last November. 
</P>
<P>
	A star defensive tackle for the San Francisco 49ers, Young has  
made remarkable progress since breaking both bones in his lower 
right leg in a freak collision with a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a good chance, according to coach Steve Mariucci,  
that Young could be ready for the Sept. 12 regular season opener at 
Jacksonville, a prospect once regarded as unthinkable because of 
the severity of the injury. At one time, the 49ers forecast a 
midseason return. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Young's comeback is a work in progress and will  
remain so even after he resumes playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get back on the field, it doesn't stop there. That's  
where it starts,'' Young said. ``I've been feeling pretty good 
about how things have been going so far. It can only get better as 
long as I keep working at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very serious injury and I've been very careful and  
tried to be as honest with myself as possible, listening to my body 
and I think I've done a pretty good job. Really, I feel I have a 
bright outlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young has indeed come a long way in the eight months since  
suffering the devastating injury. The tibia and fibula snapped when 
linebacker Ken Norton Jr.'s helmet struck Young's leg as he braced 
to tackle New York Giants quarterback Kent Graham last Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was lifted from the soggy turf in his uniform, placed on a  
gurney and wheeled to an ambulance that transported him to Stanford 
Hospital, where he spent the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent three operations, including the insertion of a  
titanium rod in the tibia to stabilize the weight-bearing bone. His 
leg swelled badly after surgery and doctors had to slice 6-inch 
openings on both sides of his calf to drain fluids and relieve 
inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it happened, you think, `Wow, is my career over?''' said  
Young, who also underwent skin graft surgery to repair the wounds 
on his calf. ``And you never know where it's going to end up at, 
but with prayer and the support of my family, friends, the 
organization, and my teammates, they've all helped me along. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there were some tough times but once I was able to  
start walking and then gradually going to a light jog, and then 
sprinting, I knew in my heart I would be able to come back from 
this injury. It does stay with you because of the way it happened. 
But I think it's healthy to think about it. It can only help you to 
deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deep scars on his calf are about the only visible sign of  
the injury. The metal rod will remain in his leg for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's feeling pretty good,'' Young said. ``But if it was  
bothering me, and I wasn't able to do the things I've been doing, I 
would have had to make a decision to have it taken out. It feels 
very natural. It's a light piece of metal so I'm able to work and 
run like I was before.''

<HEADLINE> Group Opposes 'Claritin Bill' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The sick, poor and elderly who need  
prescriptions would suffer from a bill that would extend patents on 
seven drugs, a former senator who represents consumer groups said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Metzenbaum of the Consumer Federation of American said  
the legislation would block manufacturers of generic drugs from 
making cheaper versions of brand-name medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is essentially a tax on the uninsured, the poor, the  
sick and the elderly,'' Metzenbaum, a former Democratic senator 
from Ohio, told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``I strongly urge 
you to reject it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Reps.  
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., and Jim McDermott, D-Wash., would allow the 
companies that make seven prescription drugs to ask the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office for three years of patent protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The protection would extend that afforded under a 1984 law that  
gave the companies making Claritin and six other drugs only 
two-year patent extensions rather than the five years given other 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	When a patent expires, generic drug makers can manufacture  
cheaper versions, which could give makers of name-brand medicines 
less incentive to develop new drugs. Supporters of the legislation 
say Congress has a constitutional duty to foster the research and 
development of new medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fair patent process will help consumers in the short term  
with affordable drugs and in the long term by supporting the 
research that produces new medicines,'' Torricelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has become an expensive legislative fight in Congress  
involving some of Capitol Hill's top lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough Corp., which makes Claritin, has brought in some  
big names to push legislation that could extend the patent on its 
popular anti-allergy drug by three years. The patent is set to 
expire in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without fair patent protection, we simply could not generate  
the necessary capital that allows us to make these risky and large 
investments,'' Richard Jay Kogan, chairman and CEO of 
Schering-Plough Corp., told the committee.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Harper Set for Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- San Diego Chargers cornerback Dwayne  
Harper has steel in his eyes to match the steel in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper will play his first game Sunday in almost a year, coming  
back after neck surgery which would have prompted many 33 year olds 
to give up football. 
</P>
<P>
	A collision with teammate Rodney Harrison and Buffalo receiver  
Andre Reed left Harper with a fractured bone in his neck. Surgery, 
faith and a metal plate in his neck have Harper ready to challenge 
for his starting job again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just taking the same approach as before,'' Harper said  
Thursday, ahead of Sunday's exhibition match against the Denver 
Broncos at Stadium Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to worry about what happened last year with my  
neck I'm just going to go out there and do whatever I can to help 
my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper missed 15 games last season, and, with other injuries, he  
has been restricted to just 29 games in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	His starting place went to another 33-year-old, Charles Dimry,  
one of the few NFL players to face a more harrowing time than 
Harper in 1998. Dimry lost his wife Francine to leukemia five 
months ago and was honored as San Diego's most inspirational 
player. Despite his wife's illness, Dimry had an explosive season 
with 63 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	While injured players are usually given a clear ride back into  
the starting lineup, Dimry did enough to hold onto the position. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, who says he feels like he's lining up for his rookie  
season, is pressuring Dimry, saying his decision to continue 
``wasn't too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have very strong faith in the man above, God, and support  
from my family and friends and a doctor who made me feel very 
confident about the surgery,'' Harper said. ``It's taken a long 
time just thinking about whether or not I was going to come out and 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says the long time on the sideline has evaporated any fears  
he might have had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I go out there with fear, something bad could  
happen,'' Harper said. ``You've just got to go out there with your 
natural self.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper admits some players would have retired.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'd be nice if I play two or three more years,'' said Harper.  
``I've had a good career and I'll just go out and play as many as I 
can until my body says no more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I have to prove to anyone that I can still play  
the game.''

<HEADLINE> Drought May Deter Leef Peepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Each autumn, millions of people flock to  
New England for a glimpse of the brilliant red, orange and yellow 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a summer drought already causing maples, elms and  
poplars to dry up, merchants and innkeepers who rely on tourism to 
sustain their quaint towns fear tourists won't have much to look at 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about the whole area because the drought  
is terrible and it is drying up the grass and affecting the 
trees,'' said Terry Kinsman, 73, who owns the Felshaw Tavern, a 
pre-Revolutionary War bed and breakfast in Putnam, with her husband 
Herb. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trees are not as robust as they should be, though their  
roots are very deep. I pray they will be all right,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the East Coast has been stuck for weeks in a devastating  
drought, by some accounts one of the worst this century. Foresters 
across New England predict that if the drought continues, the 
leaves will begin to change color in late September instead of 
mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Vreeland, a climatologist at the Northeast Regional  
Climate Center at Cornell University, said the drought is taking a 
toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already I'm noticing leaves on the ground in upstate New  
York,'' she said. ``Some trees are brown. I think it's a mechanism 
where the trees kind of go into shutdown mode so they might have a 
chance at living if they get through this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut state forester Donald Smith said some birches and  
red maples already have begun to turn color, but the damage has 
been limited. For the most part, the trees are holding their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some trees are wilting and may be losing some leaves, but  
there's no statewide problem,'' he said. ``It will vary with the 
region of the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Teillon, chief of forest protection for the Vermont  
Department of Forests and Parks, said he and his colleagues are 
concerned about the possibility of forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need is more rain and we need it now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	If the region gets significant rainfall soon, the foliage season  
could be saved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a great chance of recovery. Trees are tremendous in  
their ability to bounce back, but the next couple of weeks are 
going to be important,'' Teillon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, the state director of forests and lands  
doesn't think tourists and others will be able to see the trees 
through the forest. Philip Bryce said individual trees are 
suffering, but ``as you look out over the landscape, we're not 
really going to see anything much different in terms of the fall 
colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe folks are going to be able to tell much of  
difference,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Isaac Shepard House, a 1740 Colonial-style bed and  
breakfast in Plainfield, 79-year-old Elizabeth Kemp is using a 
garden hose to fight for the hollies, pines and locust trees 
growing on her five acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm lucky in the fact that my 200-year-old maples are  
probably pretty well protected. Their roots are pretty deep,'' she 
said. ``It may be that some of my new trees will die, but I think 
it's too early to tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some bed and breakfast owners worry about the financial  
repercussions of a poor foliage season, Wilhelmina Smith, owner of 
the Highland Lodge in Greensboro, Vt., isn't worried. Travelers 
have already booked every weekend of leaf-peeping season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foliage is so subjective, you can't measure whether it was  
great or not,'' she said. ``I never predict foliage in advance.''

<HEADLINE> House Voting on Tax Compromise Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offering a multitude of tax breaks for average  
taxpayers and special interests, Republicans readied a 10-year, 
$792 billion tax cut for final congressional approval in defiance 
of repeated veto threats from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House planned to vote on a compromise version of the bill  
today, with the Senate expected to follow later in the day or 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders will not send the bill to the White House until  
September, hoping to build public support during the August recess 
and avoid an immediate veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, listen,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``Listen to the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and most Democrats on Capitol Hill don't believe  
people are clamoring for tax cuts and prefer that projected budget 
surpluses be used to first safeguard Social Security and Medicare, 
pay down public debt and ensure adequate levels of government 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're to make the most of this prosperity, we simply have  
to put first things first,'' Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has said he would sign a modest tax cut of  
perhaps $300 billion, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said in an 
interview that he saw no signs of compromise with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any indication that he's serious at all,'' said  
Lott, R-Miss. ``I'm hopeful, because I want it very badly. But the 
president has shown no inclination to engage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a signal that the GOP doesn't expect the bill to ever  
become law, many of the major provisions would expire after 2008. 
That means current law would return into force unless the cuts were 
renewed by a future Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans said the projected $2.9 trillion surplus over  
the next decade was enough to meet Clinton's priorities and still 
enact the largest tax cut since 1981, mainly by delaying full 
impact of the breaks until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the big-ticket item in the 10-year package would  
trim all income tax rates by 1 percentage point: First, the bottom 
15 percent rate would drop to 14 percent by 2003, followed by all 
the others in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, repeal of the estate tax would take place in small  
increments beginning in 2003, with the full impact delayed until 
2009. Relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that hits many 
two-income couples would phase in beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the tax cut for 2000 would total only $5.2 billion and  
only $156.2 billion over its first five years, said Lindy Paull, 
staff director for the Joint Committee on Taxation, which makes 
official tax estimates for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the partisan gridlock, Republicans made sure their tax  
bill was chock full of items that would please many GOP 
constituencies, ranging from pro-family conservative groups to 
international and domestic business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Family Research Council, for example, joined GOP lawmakers  
at a Capitol Hill news conference to hail the marriage penalty 
provisions, which have been beefed up from an original House 
measure that caused some grumbling among conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide tax breaks for education, long-term  
health care and health insurance premiums, repeal the alternative 
minimum tax for individuals and cut top capital gains tax rates for 
most taxpayers from 20 percent to 18 percent retroactive to Jan. 1, 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contained some special targets: a repeal of a 10 percent  
excise tax on certain kinds of fishing tackle boxes; an increase in 
tax breaks for reforestation expenses incurred by timber companies; 
breaks for purchasers of nuclear plants aimed at the costs of 
cleaning up reactor sites; and a credit for electricity produced 
from poultry waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would extend the research and development tax  
credit sought by high-tech businesses by five years, instead of the 
permanent extension they want. That brought a retort from 
Democrats, who are competing fiercely for support from those same 
companies and sought a permanent extension in their tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We listened and we delivered in our plan,'' said Sen. Harry  
Reid, D-Nev. ``The Republicans have done nothing more than talk.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms Holbrooke to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today confirmed veteran diplomat  
Richard Holbrooke as U.N. ambassador, filling a post that has stood 
vacant through military conflicts in the Balkans and the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-16 vote ended a 14-month odyssey for Holbrooke, 58, the  
Clinton administrator's top international troubleshooter and the 
architect of the 1995 agreement that brought peace to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the long delay, the Senate debated the nomination  
for only 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabinet-level post at the U.N. headquarters in New York has  
been vacant since Bill Richardson left in September to become 
energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, 58, currently an investment banker, is a former Peace  
Corps director, ambassador to Germany and assistant secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, told colleagues that in his on 27 
years in the chamber, no foreign policy nominee ``is more qualified 
for the job for which he was nominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called Holbrooke ``one of  
America's great natural resources. He is a person of ... enormous 
energy and talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, the only senator to speak  
against the nomination, called him a ``principled man ... I admire 
his dedication, his tenacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she blamed him for helping to frame a Balkans policy that  
she said ``is to force factions to live together in an American 
model. ... I cannot in good conscience vote for someone who has 
taken our country in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton first announced his choice of Holbrooke in June 1998.  
But the selection remained bogged down for eight months in internal 
State and Justice Department ethics investigations into Holbrooke's 
business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, the nomination was delayed by individual senators  
for unrelated reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's confirmation vote was all but assured on Wednesday when  
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the final senator blocking the 
nomination, lifted his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is in a standoff with the State Department over its  
treatment of a career employee he claims was punished for sharing 
information on U.N. financial irregularities with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grassley's tactics created new problems for other diplomatic  
nominees. Grassley said that to make his point he would block three 
other pending nominations, including that of Peter Burleigh as 
ambassador to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh has been filling in for Holbrooke at the United Nations  
since September. In New York, Burleigh said he would have no 
comment on Grassley's ``hold'' on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said he was also putting ``holds'' on Carl Spielvogel  
to be ambassador to the Slovak Republic and Richard Fredericks to 
be ambassador to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other senators had also sought to block the Holbrooke  
nomination -- Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio -- but they 
earlier abandoned the tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate tradition, any member without explanation may block  
action on legislation or a nomination for as long as the majority 
leader permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats today criticized the tradition of holds. ``We  
have lost our sense of proportion,'' Biden said. ``We held up the 
single most important foreign policy decision to be made by this 
administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley used the technique to protest the State Department's  
treatment of a whistle-blower, Linda Shenwick. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley contends that Shenwick, who worked at the U.N. mission  
in New York, was demoted and transferred to a lesser job in 
Washington in retaliation for telling members of Congress about 
waste and inefficiency at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said Shenwick was reassigned because of  
unsatisfactory job performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Richardson left the U.N. post in September, the United  
States launched airstrikes against both Iraq and Yugoslavia. 
Burleigh, the assistant U.N. ambassador, served a stint as 
presiding officer of the Security Council and had to deal with the 
issue of delinquent U.S. payments to the international body. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke had been confirmed by the Senate three times  
previously: in 1977 as assistant secretary of state in the Carter 
administration, again in 1993 as ambassador to Germany, and later 
as assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a contender for secretary of state in Clinton's  
second term before the president chose Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holbrooke, ambitious and with a forceful personality, has  
produced detractors as well as fans, both in Congress and within 
the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been at odds at times with Albright. And he is a favorite  
target for Republicans since he's widely viewed as a likely 
secretary of state if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency.

<HEADLINE> SEC Proposes `Pay-to-Play Rule' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, exasperated with the  
practice of money managers making campaign donations to officials 
who oversee public-employee pension funds, are proposing a rule to 
prohibit such contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission made the proposal  
Wednesday as it imposed a $10,000 fine on a former board member of 
Florida's Housing Finance Agency accused of taking a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The donations to officials by money managers, a practice known  
as pay-to-play, are legal but can unfairly tilt the political 
playing field, securities regulators and other critics say. They 
contend that thousands of police, firefighters, teachers and other 
public employees may be unwittingly entrusting their retirement 
savings to financial companies with the strongest political ties 
rather than those most qualified to manage the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is the management of such pension funds, which hold  
more than $2 trillion in assets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed rule, which the SEC opened to a 75-day public  
comment period, money managers would be barred from making 
political donations to state and local officials who oversee 
public-employee pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Plaze, associate director of the SEC's investment management  
division, acknowledged that the proposed rule ``is not campaign 
finance reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not naive enough to expect that we're going to entirely  
eliminate pay-to-play,'' Plaze told reporters in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibit money management firms with more than $25 million in  
assets under management from providing investment advice to public 
pension funds for two years after the firm, or any of its partners 
or executives, contributed to the campaigns of certain elected 
officials or candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	--Exempt donations of $250 or less.  
</P>
<P>
	--Require money management firms with government clients to keep  
records of their political contributions. The records would not be 
made public but would be provided to SEC examiners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory  
group, took similar action in 1994 with regard to the $1.3 trillion 
municipal bond market, restricting how much money bond-underwriting 
firms can contribute to state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that action, many bond underwriters have gotten around the  
municipal pay-to-play restrictions by making donations to political 
parties rather than particular state and local candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	William Jay Ramsey, the ex-board member of the Florida Housing  
Finance Agency, is one of several public officials ensnared in a 
criminal investigation of alleged bribes that steered Florida 
municipal bond business to Stephens Inc., a prominent investment 
firm based in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	The wide-ranging federal probe already has led to the criminal  
conviction of a former Arkansas state legislator who paid bribes to 
help the Stephens firm get two bond underwriting contracts in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In a civil settlement with the SEC announced Wednesday, Ramsey  
agreed to pay the $10,000 fine, return the compensation he 
allegedly received plus interest, a total of $2,190.03, and refrain 
from future violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement, Ramsey neither admitted to nor denied the  
SEC's allegation that he failed to disclose having secretly agreed 
to receive from Stephens $1,500 a month for a year, though he 
allegedly only received one payment. The SEC said the 1995 payment 
was a bribe in return for Ramsey voting to select Stephens for bond 
underwriting business of the housing finance agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, federal criminal prosecutors secured an indictment  
against Ramsey on related charges. Stephens agreed the same month 
to pay $3.1 million to federal and north Florida officials to 
settle a civil suit, and the company was barred from underwriting 
bonds in Florida for five years. Stephens also agreed to pay a 
$2.25 million civil fine to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey's attorney, David McGee of Pensacola, Fla., declined  
comment on the matter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action shows the agency ``is continuing to  
aggressively investigate and bring enforcement actions in an effort 
to stamp out pay-to-play practices,'' Kathleen Hamm, an assistant 
enforcement director at the SEC, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule proposed by the SEC would apply to legal campaign  
contributions to officials by money managers, which regulators want 
to stop on ethical grounds, as opposed to the illegal bribe that 
Ramsey allegedly received. But Ms. Hamm said both kinds of payments 
were examples of pay-to-play.

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Facing Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- The auto industry is less than a  
decade away from producing more efficient cars and trucks by 
replacing many mechanical parts with electronics, Ford Motor Co.'s 
research chief says. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will permit the broader use of vehicles with  
``hybrid'' power systems, which combine an internal combustion 
engine with an electric motor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as microcomputers proved to be the key in crossing the  
last hurdles, electronics is emerging as the automotive Grail of 
the next two decades,'' Bill Powers, Ford vice president of 
research, told an industry conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Within just a few years, some accessories that now operate on  
engine power will run independently, Powers said. The result will 
be vehicles that run far more efficiently and enhance engine 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	A necessary change is upgrading the automotive electrical system  
from the 12-volt standard used since the 1950s to a 42-volt system, 
Powers said. That will allow what's called a ``belt-less engine,'' 
in which major accessories now powered via belts connected to the 
engine would be run instead by the supplemental electric motor and 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits for consumers will be improved fuel economy, a  
quieter, smoother-running vehicle, and better performance because 
fewer accessories will be drawing power from the engine. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a 42-volt system in place, the air conditioning  
compressor, the power steering and even the water pump could run 
independently of engine power,'' Powers said. A fully electronic 
engine-valve control system also would be possible, resulting in 
the elimination of some mechanical parts that consume energy, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The key is reducing the costs of high-tech batteries and power  
electronics. Powers said battery breakthroughs are most likely to 
come from the computer industry, where the technology holds the 
promise for bigger profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get the electric motor in the loop, and we can't do  
it until we get better supporting batteries at reasonable costs,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The power upgrade also is needed just to handle the growing  
demand on the average car's electrical system. 
</P>
<P>
	``From lights, horn and a starter, the automobile electrical  
system has grown to incorporate a huge, glowing Emerald City of 
functions,'' Powers said. ``Power demand is growing at 4 percent 
annually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-generation hybrids arriving on the market use conventional  
12-volt electrical systems and utilize the electric motor mainly to 
supplement the engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers said the car's ``nervous system'' will continue to  
evolve, with ``drive-by-wire'' electronics eventually replacing the 
shafts and cables used today to steer. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers spoke at the University of Michigan's annual automotive  
management conference in Traverse City.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes $792B Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans overcame solid Democratic  
opposition Thursday to narrowly win final passage of a 10-year, 
$792 billion tax cut trumpeted by the GOP as a deserving return of 
budget surpluses to wage earners and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton denounced the bill and promised a veto.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 50-49 for the final package a few hours after  
the House passed it 221-206. The Senate then adjourned until Sept. 
8.. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals and families are due a refund, and that is exactly  
what we do with this legislation,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ``Government is not 
automatically entitled to the surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With little chance of becoming law, the bill will serve mainly  
as a defining issue between Republicans and Democrats in the 2000 
struggle for control of Congress and the race for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a dramatic difference between Democrats and  
Republicans in this capital city, and this is the dividing line,'' 
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders will not send the bill to Clinton until September,  
to prevent a veto while Congress is away for its August recess. Top 
Republicans intend to fan out across the country in an effort to 
sell the public on the wisdom of the tax cut -- and demonstrate 
their political priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good deal for the American people,'' said House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``It's a fair, responsible and 
balanced tax relief bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an immediate condemnation, saying that no matter  
when the bill reaches his desk, ``I will have no choice but to veto 
it immediately. It threatens Social Security and Medicare, makes it 
harder to pay off the debt, and imperils the prosperity that has 
brought real benefits to American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Democratic senators and four Republicans voted no: Arlen  
Specter of Pennsylvania, George Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia Snowe 
and Susan Collins, both of Maine. The lone absent senator was 
Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho, who was attending his daughter's 
wedding but supported the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Democrats supported the measure in the House and four  
Republicans voted against. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which would be the largest tax cut since 1981, would  
trim the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14 percent in 2003 
and reduce the other rates by 1 percentage point in 2005. Relief 
from the ``marriage penalty'' that affects millions of two-income 
couples would begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax would be repealed gradually starting in 2003, and  
capital gains taxes would be cut from 20 percent to 18 percent for 
most investors retroactive to Jan. 1, 1999. There are breaks for 
education and health care, expanded IRAs and pensions and a legion 
of breaks for businesses large and small. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats portrayed the package as primarily favoring the  
wealthy and business and conservative groups. They said it unwisely 
uses a third of the next decade's projected $2.9 trillion budget 
surplus for tax cuts at the expense of safeguarding Social Security 
and Medicare, repaying the national debt and preventing deep cuts 
in government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is radical, it is risky and it is reckless,'' said Sen.  
Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Capitol Hill rally, Clinton said he would only consider  
signing a modest tax cut aimed at the middle class once those other 
priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to ask ourselves how much is left, and whatever it  
is, we ought to give it back to the American people in a tax cut,'' 
the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading Republican presidential candidate, Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush, said during an appearance in West Des Moines, Iowa, that 
he strongly supports the bill and urged Clinton to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my judgment, we ought to pass back the money to the people  
who pay the taxes,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls show the public considers cutting taxes a lower  
priority than ensuring that there is enough Social Security money 
to handle baby boomer retirements. Nearly half the public thinks 
wealthy people would benefit most from the tax cuts, according to 
an ABC News poll of 1,012 adults taken July 28-Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	That poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3  
percentage points, indicated that about a fourth of the people 
think the cuts would benefit everyone equally, while 14 percent 
said it would benefit middle-income people most, and 6 percent said 
the poor would benefit most. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said such polls only demonstrate that they are  
acting on principle by returning some of the surplus in the form of 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it may not be the single most popular thing, but it's  
the right thing to do,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, however, claimed that the motive for the tax cuts was  
the GOP's desire to curry the favor of business and conservative 
political supporters. ``A wish list so that every contributor ... 
will get a promise,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., called it. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is crammed with dozens of items sought by  
business lobbyists that total $60 billion over 10 years, according 
to Democrats. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
	--The National Federation of Independent Business, National  
Restaurant Association and others got an increase in the deduction 
for business meals from 50 percent to 60 percent, costing $3.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For global energy companies, a $1.6 billion repeal of the limit  
on foreign tax credits for oil and gas produced overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	--For defense contractors, repeal of a limit on the benefits  
companies receive to compensate for the cost of selling military 
products abroad, worth $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For Silicon Valley firms, the National Association of  
Manufacturers and others, a five-year extension of the research and 
development tax credit, worth $13.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For chicken farmers, a new credit for electricity produced from  
poultry waste, along with a four-year extension of a biomass and 
wind electricity credits, about $534 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This last item produced one of the more lighthearted moments of  
Thursday's debate. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, held up a large 
photo of a plucked chicken and compared it to the fleecing of key 
government programs through tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a chicken this is,'' Doggett said. ``They've given new  
meaning to chicken deluxe.''

<HEADLINE> Gene Found That Causes Narcolepsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Drift off during the day? Toss and turn all night?  
New research into the genes that guide slumber may someday help 
craft better ways to make sleep come and go on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers working with dogs and mice that suddenly drop asleep  
at odd moments offer the first clues about the genetic origins of 
narcolepsy, the strange sleeping disorder that afflicts an 
estimated 135,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Their research suggests narcoleptics' overwhelming urge to fall  
asleep may result from a glitch in signals sent between cells in 
the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates appetite and 
other basic drives. 
</P>
<P>
	While this link seems clear in lab animals, scientists caution  
that the origins of the disease are almost certainly far more 
complex in people. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, experts say the research offers insights into how  
sleep works -- or goes wrong -- and suggests directions for creating 
new drugs to treat sleep problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, these two papers will revolutionize the field of  
sleep research,'' predicted Juliette Faraco of Stanford University, 
a geneticist who co-authored one of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford research, directed by Dr. Emmanuel Mignot, is being  
published in today's issue of the journal Cell. Another study 
reaching similar conclusions was conducted by Dr. Masashi 
Yanagisawa of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center 
in Dallas. It will be published in Cell on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas team-bred mice that were missing one gene and would  
keel over asleep while racing on their running wheels. The Stanford 
team worked with dogs that have an inherited form of narcolepsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Like these animals, people with narcolepsy are overcome by  
uncontrollable urges to sleep, often at inconvenient times, such as 
when driving. Unlike folks taking ordinary naps, they fall 
immediately into the deepest stage of sleep, called REM. Some may 
suffer sleep paralysis, the inability to move shortly after 
awakening. Others have especially vivid dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	One common feature is called cataplexy, which is when people  
suddenly lose consciousness and fall down. Strong emotions, such as 
anger, surprise or laughter, often trigger this disconcerting 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Narcoleptic dogs get cataplexy, too, during moments of  
tail-wagging excitement. ``You show them a doggy biscuit and 
ker-flop, they go down on the ground,'' said Faraco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford team traced the condition in these dogs to a gene  
that makes a receptor -- a bit of material on the surface of brain 
cells that allow them to get signals from other cells. This 
particular receptor hears messages that are transmitted by a 
protein called hypocretin-2. 
</P>
<P>
	When the gene is broken -- either because it is missing some code  
or has extra bits -- it makes a receptor that fails to recognize 
hypocretin-2, so the signal never gets through. 
</P>
<P>
	``This work implicates hypocretin in sleep regulation, which  
gives us a wonderful new handle on how we might approach sleep 
control'' with new medicines, said Dr. Charlotte McCutchen of the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which 
financed the research. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of treating narcolepsy with stimulants such as  
amphetamines, which have unwanted side effects, she said, it soon 
may be possible to find drugs that work solely on the brain's 
hypocretin system. Medicines could be designed to both prevent 
sleep in narcoleptics and induce it in insomniacs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Yanagisawa discovered that a protein dubbed orexin-B  
stimulates the appetite. Now it turns out that orexin-B and 
hypocretin-2 are the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	To study the protein's effects on appetite, Yanagisawa produced  
gene-altered mice that cannot make orexin-B. The scientists hooked 
up infrared cameras to watch their eating habits at night, when 
they are most active. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw this very bizarre change in behavior,'' Yanagisawa  
said. ``The mice would be grooming, running and burrowing and then 
all of a sudden they would fall over and stay there for one or two 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first the scientists suspected epileptic seizures. But  
further testing showed the mice had fallen into deep REM sleep. 
Like the Stanford dogs, these mice had cataplexy.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Goes to Suns for 2 Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway got what he wanted Thursday and  
was traded to the Phoenix Suns, ending his fading star career in 
Orlando and completing the breakup of a Magic team that went to the 
NBA Finals just four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After a final day of reconsidering their options and trying to  
talk Hardaway into staying, the Magic finally made the trade and 
acquired Danny Manning, Pat Garrity and two first-round draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, who will be paid $86 million over the next seven  
years, joins Jason Kidd in what could be one of the most formidable 
backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a major coup for the Suns, who had no room under the  
salary cap to go after free agents, let alone one the stature of 
Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic tried to work out a deal with the Lakers, Raptors and  
a few other teams, but all of them had dropped out of the bidding 
by the middle of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Magic, it marked the end of an era. Just a few years  
ago, the team looked like it would be an enduring Eastern 
Conference powerhouse when its roster included Hardaway and 
Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Magic will plunge into a massive rebuilding without  
a single star left. The Magic have 10 first-round draft picks over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the goal for the franchise is to win a world  
championship, even though this might not happen next year,'' 
general manager John Gabriel said. ``The trade of Penny Hardaway 
sets us for the launch of a new era and a new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's the best thing for (Penny) to get a fresh  
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was en route to Phoenix and was to appear at a 9:30  
p.m. EDT news conference. He was in Phoenix last Friday and 
Saturday to meet with Suns officials, played a round of golf with 
coach Danny Ainge and was presented with a golf bag in Suns' purple 
with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it clear to the Suns that they were his first choice,  
and when Phoenix agreed to pay him the maximum allowable under the 
collective bargaining agreement it was only a matter of getting 
Orlando to agree to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway opted out of the final three years of his contract and  
became a free agent this summer, but only Chicago, the Los Angeles 
Clippers and Toronto had anywhere near the money available to land 
him. He made it clear to Magic officials over the past few days 
that he did not want to return as Orlando -- especially new coach 
Doc Rivers -- tried in vain to get him to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was drafted by Golden State as the third pick overall  
in 1993, then was traded to Orlando, which had drafted O'Neal the 
previous year. Hardaway and O'Neal almost instantly made the Magic 
a title contender. By their second season together, 1994-95, the 
Magic made it to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the 
Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal left for Los Angeles in 1996, and Hardaway's image as one  
of the NBA's rising superstars took a beating in the ensuing years 
as he orchestrated the departure of coach Bob Hill and then sat out 
most of the 1997-98 season but still played in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had an uneven relationship with Magic coach Chuck Daly,  
who resigned after the 1999 season, and trade talk began as early 
as February of 1998, when he nearly was dealt to the New Jersey 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Magic were ousted by the 76ers and Hardaway complained  
about having to defend the speedy Allen Iverson, owner Rich DeVos 
made it clear that Hardaway's days in Orlando were numbered by 
saying maybe the Magic didn't need any more superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking forward to a new era of Magic basketball,''  
Gabriel said, ``one we believe will be extremely exciting with the 
young talent we have and will assemble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic have traded three starters this offseason, also  
sending Horace Grant to Seattle and Nick Anderson to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway averaged 19 points in his six seasons in Orlando, but  
nagging injuries severely cut into his playing time the last three 
seasons. Last season, he averaged a career-low 15.8 points per 
game. He averaged 19 in the playoffs, but shot just 35 percent from 
the field as Orlando was beaten by Philadelphia in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he is considered one of the top shooting guards in the  
game, and his 6-foot-7 height will be invaluable to a Suns team 
that was often overmatched with Rex Chapman at that position. 
Hardaway also could form a spectacular fast-break combination with 
Kidd, arguably the best point guard in the NBA at pushing the ball 
up the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, 33, is the only NBA player to come back from three  
major knee surgeries. He won the NBA Sixth Man award in 1998, just 
before he went down with his third major knee injury. He came back 
last season to average 9.1 points and 4.4 rebounds off the bench 
for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, the college player of the year when he led Kansas to  
the NCAA championship in 1988, has averaged of 16.6 points per game 
in 11 NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrity, from Notre Dame, averaged 5.6 points as a rookie last  
season. He has been the property of four teams in his brief 
professional career. He was drafted by Milwaukee, then traded to 
Dallas, which dealt him to Phoenix before he'd ever played a game.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die, 6 Missing, on Bering Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A flotilla of skiffs carrying Russian  
Eskimos home from a visit to Alaska ran into a storm that flipped 
and sank one boat, drowning two people. Three more boats and six 
people remained missing today. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 37 people had set out in 14 small boats Tuesday  
morning for the 65-mile trip from the Alaska village of Gambell on 
St. Lawrence Island to the coastal town of Provideniya, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	They were returning from a visit to friends and relatives when  
they got caught in a storm with 35 mph winds and eight- to 10-foot 
seas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was called out just before midnight Tuesday  
after two skiffs reached Provideniya and those on board told 
authorities of the dozen boats, which were 12 to 16 feet long, 
still trying to make the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boats overturned and a father and son drowned. Others  
aboard, including an American photographer, were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight more boats ultimately reached Provideniya. Three boats and  
six people were still missing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents of Russia's Chukotsk Peninsula, where Provideniya  
is located, share the same Siberian Yupik Eskimo ancestry and 
language with residents of Alaska's St. Lawrence Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Bradner, a free-lance photographer who grew up in Alaska,  
was briefly hospitalized on arrival in Provideniya after spending 
time in the cold water. Bradner was working on a magazine story 
about the renewal of relations between native people on the two 
sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard resumed the search today. A C-130 and two Coast  
Guard helicopters searched the U.S. side Wednesday evening while 
Russian rescue craft looked on their side of the area.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Push $792B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 10-year, $792 billion Republican tax cut,  
sure to be vetoed by President Clinton but embraced by the GOP as a 
bedrock political issue, hurtled toward final congressional passage 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed the bill 221-206, and final Senate approval was  
expected by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
	With little chance of becoming law, the bill will serve mainly  
as a defining issue between Republicans and Democrats in the 2000 
struggle for control of Congress and the race for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a dramatic difference between Democrats and  
Republicans in this capital city, and this is the dividing line,'' 
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders will not send the bill to Clinton until September,  
to prevent a veto while Congress is away for its August recess. Top 
Republicans intend to fan out across the country in an effort to 
sell the public on the wisdom of the tax cut -- and demonstrate 
their political priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good deal for the American people,'' said House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``It's a fair, responsible and 
balanced tax relief bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which would be the largest tax cut since 1981, would  
trim the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14 percent in 2003 
and reduce the other rates by 1 percentage point in 2005. Relief 
from the ``marriage penalty'' that affects millions of two-income 
couples would begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax would be repealed gradually starting in 2003, and  
capital gains taxes would be cut from 20 percent to 18 percent for 
most investors retroactive to Jan. 1, 1999. There are breaks for 
education and health care, expanded IRAs and pensions and a legion 
of breaks for businesses large and small. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats portrayed the package as primarily favoring the  
wealthy and business and conservative groups. They said it unwisely 
uses a third of the next decade's projected $2.9 trillion budget 
surplus at the expense of safeguarding Social Security and 
Medicare, repaying the national debt and preventing deep cuts in 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is radical, it is risky and it is reckless,'' said Sen.  
Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Capitol Hill rally, Clinton again promised to veto the bill  
and said he would only consider a modest tax cut aimed at the 
middle class once those other priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to ask ourselves how much is left, and whatever it  
is, we ought to give it back to the American people in a tax cut,'' 
the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading Republican presidential candidate, Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush, said during an appearance in West Des Moines, Iowa, that 
he would strongly support the tax bill and urged Clinton to 
reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my judgment, we ought to pass back the money to the people  
who pay the taxes,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls show the public considers tax cuts a lower surplus  
priority than ensuring Social Security is ready for baby boomer 
retirements. One reason could be that nearly half the public thinks 
wealthy people would benefit most from the tax cuts, according to 
an ABC News poll of 1,012 adults taken July 28-Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	That poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3  
percentage points, indicated that about a fourth of the people 
think the cuts would benefit everyone equally, while 14 percent 
said it would benefit middle-income people most, and 6 percent said 
the poor would benefit most. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said such polls only demonstrated that they are  
acting on principle by returning some of the surplus with tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it may not be the single most popular thing, but it's  
the right thing to do,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, however, found a far different reason for many of the  
breaks: an effort by the GOP to please business and conservative 
political supporters. ``A wish list so that every contributor ... 
will get a promise,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., called it. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the legislation is crammed with dozens of items sought  
by business lobbyists. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
	--The National Federation of Independent Business, National  
Restaurant Association and others got an increase in the deduction 
for business meals from 50 percent to 60 percent, costing $3.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For global energy companies, a $1.6 billion repeal of the limit  
on foreign tax credits for oil and gas produced overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	--For defense contractors, repeal of a limit on the benefits  
companies receive to compensate for the cost of selling military 
products abroad, worth $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For Silicon Valley firms, the National Association of  
Manufacturers and others, a five year extension of the research and 
development tax credit, worth $13.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For chicken farmers, a new credit for electricity produced from  
poultry waste, along with a four-year extension of a biomass and 
wind electricity credits, about $534 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This last item produced one of the more lighthearted moments of  
Thursday's debate, when Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, held up a 
large photo of a plucked chicken and compared it to the fleecing of 
key government programs through tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a chicken this is,'' Doggett said. ``They've given new  
meaning to chicken deluxe.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Los Alamos Probe 'Flawed' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI's espionage case against a Los Alamos  
weapons scientist was considered ``flawed from the outset'' because 
authorities identified a number of other suspects, but failed to 
investigate them, a congressional report revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also disclosed for the first time that in a polygraph  
test in February when the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was asked if he 
had passed nuclear secrets ``to any unauthorized person,'' he 
failed the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the leaders of the Senate Governmental Affairs  
Committee described a string of missteps, communications lapses and 
misunderstandings over three years that prevented the FBI from 
establishing a strong case against the Taiwan-born scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the committee chairman, said the  
investigation was ``beset by communications failures and poor 
judgment'' and that Attorney General Janet Reno for the most part 
``was out of the loop'' despite the issue's importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's investigation was not a comedy of errors, but  
a tragedy of errors,'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the 
committee's ranking Democrat. He too said Reno should have been 
more closely involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked this morning if she had seen the report, Reno said she had  
not had time to examine the details. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings summarized information gathered during two  
closed-door hearings the committee held on the federal 
investigation into Lee. He was fired from his top-secret job last 
March after being the primary suspect since 1996 in the alleged 
theft by China of secrets involving the sophisticated W-88 nuclear 
warhead in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with a crime, although a federal grand  
jury was hearing evidence in the ongoing case. In his only public 
comments, Lee in a television interview last Sunday categorically 
denied providing nuclear secrets to China or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate report disclosed that last February, Lee was  
asked during an FBI polygraph test whether he had ever given 
specific classified computer code related to weapons testing, or 
``passed W-88 information to any unauthorized person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wen Ho Lee failed this polygraph test,'' said the report.  
</P>
<P>
	The 30-page report provided new details on the FBI's failed  
attempts to get Justice Department approval to search Lee's office 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the dispute between the FBI and Justice over the  
computer search, the bipartisan report said it was ``remarkable'' 
that FBI Director Louis Freeh ``at no point contacted the attorney 
general about this issue'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was made aware of the FBI's problems in getting approval  
for a computer search during a meeting in August 1997, the report 
said. She asked the deputy attorney general's office to look into 
it, but never heard back from that office, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's attempt to get clearance for a computer search,  
however, was made more difficult in part because of FBI bungling, 
the report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as 1996, a series of misunderstandings between an FBI  
field agent and Los Alamos officials failed to make clear that 
apparently Lee had agreed on his computer being searched and that 
his computer, in fact, carried a ``banner'' warning such searches 
could be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to provide accurate information to senior FBI and  
Justice officials had ``significant implications for the course of 
the Lee espionage investigation,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, investigators finally searched Lee's computer and  
found he had transferred thousands of top-secret computer code 
files from the Los Alamos highly secured computer system to his 
unclassified office computer that was linked to the Internet. It 
has not been determined whether any of the data ever left the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who appeared to pass another lie detecter test, was fired  
on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Justice Department's office that reviewed  
requests for the Lee computer search described the case as ``flawed 
from the outset'' because the FBI had focused almost exclusively on 
Lee and his wife, also a Los Alamos employee, while other suspects 
were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DOE and Bureau had (multiple) suspects, and only two were  
investigated,'' Justice attorney Allan Kornblum told the Senate 
committee, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	These other suspects also had access to the secret information  
at Los Alamos, traveled to China, had contacts with Chinese 
scientists visiting the New Mexico lab, and fit the profile that 
made Lee a prime suspect, the report said. Still, they were not 
investigated in any detail, although the FBI questioned some of 
them earlier this year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 0.63; Nasdaq Off 49.`9 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as a government report on  
rising labor costs increased fears that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 0.63 at 10,674.14. Earlier in the session, the Dow had fallen 
108 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 8.66 at 1,296.67, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 49.19 at 2,490.90, continuing its steep decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell as traders awaited and then received the Labor  
Department's report on productivity and labor costs. The department 
said American workers' productivity slowed significantly in the 
spring, rising at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent, while labor 
costs surged at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the worst showing 
for this measurement since the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, increased productivity has enabled U.S.  
businesses to counteract rising labor costs. But Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan has cautioned that investors have been too confident that 
strong productivity gains would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	If productivity levels off and labor costs rise, that could  
persuade the Fed to raise rates in an effort to slow down economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The market remained nervous as it also anticipated Friday's  
unemployment report, another widely watched barometer of U.S. 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online was among the biggest decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, falling 8 3/16 to 79 1/4. While the entire Internet 
sector has been suffering in recent sessions, AOL is also being 
hampered by battles over its instant-messaging technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest retailers reported that sales rose to  
better-than-expected levels in July. Shares of Saks Inc., the 
parent company for luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue, rose 1 1/8 to 21 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 289.54 million shares, ahead of 
Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.78 at 610.68, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 7.56 at 769.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.95 to 422.75.

<HEADLINE> FCC Changes Broadcast Owner Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Thursday eased  
restrictions on the number of local radio and television stations 
that a broadcasting company can control. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 4-1 vote, the Federal Communications Commission relaxed a  
rule that currently forbids a single company from owning more than 
one local TV station in a given market. Under the changes, a 
company could own two TV stations in the same market if there were 
at least eight other competitors after the deal and if one of the 
stations is not among the market's top four. 
</P>
<P>
	Common ownership could also be permitted if one of the stations  
was failing or was not yet operating. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have argued against loosening the rules too much for  
fear it could shrink editorial diversity and concentrate ownership 
of the airwaves in the hands of a few big media conglomerates. 
Broadcasters say they need to compete against new media 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote also provided leeway on a rule that prohibited  
ownership of radio and TV stations in the same market. The amended 
rules allow a company to own up to two TV stations and six radio 
stations in a market as long as there are at least 20 independent 
media voices -- including broadcast stations, daily newspapers and 
cable services. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters had benefited from a lenient policy that waived the  
restrictions, and the commission said companies would be protected 
by such waivers until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners backing the changes said they would allow  
broadcasters to compete more effectively in a changing media 
marketplace while preserving the diversity of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ownership rules have always reflected core values of  
competition, diversity and localism,'' said FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth dissented, saying the FCC  
could not adequately define how the regulations would preserve 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision received the praise of the National Association of  
Broadcasters and members of the industry. Bud Paxson, chairman of 
Paxson Communications Corp., which owns or operates 73 television 
stations nationwide, said the changes were needed for broadcasters 
to face new competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '80s we were all alone, but now we have cable, direct  
satellite, and now the Internet is coming into play,'' Paxson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predicted that broadcasters would combine facilities  
where possible to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest and most competitive markets will be the most  
affected, and it won't be the highest-ranked stations,'' said 
Vinton A.G. Vickers, a broadcast industry analyst with ING Barings 
in New York. ``One of the goals of these decisions is to help out 
the most struggling stations who can't afford top-notch 
programming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victor B. Miller IV, a broadcast industry analyst at Bear  
Stearns, said large cities like Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and 
San Francisco -- which have 15 or more voices in them -- are likely 
to see the most activity. A medium-sized city like Detroit has only 
nine voices, leaving room for only one deal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller predicted that large network operators would benefit from  
the decision, ``but this will also be very helpful to companies 
like USA Networks because they could buy network affiliated 
stations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also more clearly defined ownership by clamping down on  
local marketing agreements that allow one TV station to operate 
another TV station in the same market, but not actually own it. 
Such agreements from before November 1996 would be respected until 
2004. Other stations with such agreements would have two years to 
comply with new ownership rules or would be forced to terminate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners said the new rules help clarify a system  
riddled with waivers and exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have long felt that our rules were susceptible to  
'gaming,''' said Commissioner Susan Ness. ``We have been too 
willing to permit through the back door what we would not 
countenance through the front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a  
public-interest law firm, said he was glad to see the FCC closing 
out some of its loopholes.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- An ex-convict who confessed to killing  
three women in what became known as the North Dallas ``bathroom 
slayings'' was executed by injection Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Anthony Boyd, 39, was the second convicted killer to die  
in as many days in Texas and the 18th person put to death in Texas 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd initially declined to make a final statement, but as the  
drugs began flowing into his arms, he said, ``I want you all to 
know I did not do this crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was condemned for strangling and drowning 21-year-old Mary  
Milligan in her bathroom apartment on April 1987, but had confessed 
to two other slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1986, Tippawan Nakusan, 37, a waitress who lived  
upstairs from Boyd, was found stabbed and suffocated in her 
bathtub. That September, Lashun Chappell Thomas, 22, a nursing home 
aide, was found stabbed in a bathtub in the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
	He was never tried in the killings.

	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Activists protesting alleged  
government corruption set fire to tire barricades Thursday in the 
latest demonstration to hit Haiti's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police quickly removed the small barricades, scattered about  
several areas of Port-au-Prince. Traffic was not disturbed, and 
businesses opened as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic protests have hit Port-au-Prince since April, when a  
community activist allied with former President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide was killed in an altercation. Demonstrators claimed police 
killed the man; police denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters called on President Rene Preval to fire top police  
and public administration officials. Community leaders claim Preval 
hasn't fulfilled pledges to replace government officials with 
grass-roots militants. 
</P>
<P>
	They also accuse police of being soft on crime. Police officials  
counter that the street protests are an attempt to destabilize 
Haiti before legislative and municipal elections can be held this 
fall.

<HEADLINE> Young's Comeback Still in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stockton, Calif (AP) -- Bryant Young walks and runs easily now,  
and that's saying a lot considering the gruesome injury that ended 
his season last November. 
</P>
<P>
	A star defensive tackle for the San Francisco 49ers, Young has  
made remarkable progress since breaking both bones in his lower 
right leg in a freak collision with a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a good chance, according to coach Steve Mariucci,  
that Young could be ready for the Sept. 12 regular season opener at 
Jacksonville, a prospect once regarded as unthinkable because of 
the severity of the injury. At one time, the 49ers forecast a 
midseason return. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Young's comeback is a work in progress and will  
remain so even after he resumes playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get back on the field, it doesn't stop there. That's  
where it starts,'' Young said. ``I've been feeling pretty good 
about how things have been going so far. It can only get better as 
long as I keep working at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very serious injury and I've been very careful and  
tried to be as honest with myself as possible, listening to my body 
and I think I've done a pretty good job. Really, I feel I have a 
bright outlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young has indeed come a long way in the eight months since  
suffering the devastating injury. The tibia and fibula snapped when 
linebacker Ken Norton Jr.'s helmet struck Young's leg as he braced 
to tackle New York Giants quarterback Kent Graham last Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was lifted from the soggy turf in his uniform, placed on a  
gurney and wheeled to an ambulance that transported him to Stanford 
Hospital, where he spent the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent three operations, including the insertion of a  
titanium rod in the tibia to stabilize the weight-bearing bone. His 
leg swelled badly after surgery and doctors had to slice 6-inch 
openings on both sides of his calf to drain fluids and relieve 
inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it happened, you think, `Wow, is my career over?''' said  
Young, who also underwent skin graft surgery to repair the wounds 
on his calf. ``And you never know where it's going to end up at, 
but with prayer and the support of my family, friends, the 
organization, and my teammates, they've all helped me along. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there were some tough times but once I was able to  
start walking and then gradually going to a light jog, and then 
sprinting, I knew in my heart I would be able to come back from 
this injury. It does stay with you because of the way it happened. 
But I think it's healthy to think about it. It can only help you to 
deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deep scars on his calf are about the only visible sign of  
the injury. The metal rod will remain in his leg for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's feeling pretty good,'' Young said. ``But if it was  
bothering me, and I wasn't able to do the things I've been doing, I 
would have had to make a decision to have it taken out. It feels 
very natural. It's a light piece of metal so I'm able to work and 
run like I was before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the club's training camp, the 27-year-old Young is still  
working apart from the team, engaged in daily rapid-fire 
rehabilitation and conditioning drills under the supervision of 
physical development coordinator Jerry Attaway. 
</P>
<P>
	What quickly becomes clear is that Young is as powerfully built  
as ever -- he can bench press 500 pounds. He still possesses an 
explosive burst off the ball and continues to showcase in his 
workouts the intense, determined style that epitomized his play and 
made him such a defensive force. 
</P>
<P>
	Young is expected to be activated from the physically unable to  
perform list by the middle of next week, allowing him to start 
practicing with the team on a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll start off slowly,'' said Mariucci, adding that in all  
likelihood Young will prepare for the season without playing in any 
of the team's four exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to be able to go through all the drills that we do  
without having any pain, without favoring it, without having any 
problem. He's got to be able to go 1-on-1 pass rush. He's got to go 
1-on-1 against offensive lineman in the run game and be able to 
hold up. Then he's got to be able to take on some double-team 
blocks. He's got to be able to defeat the trap block coming from 
the side, but we can do that in a controlled environment. You're 
not going to have nine bodies flying around in piles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he's confident he can regain his past form.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty confident I can be the same player if not better,''  
he said. ``Once I decide to step on the field and see how things 
go, that will really tell me where I'm at.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Behind U.K. Pet Passport Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Fifteen-year-old William Dowell is back in England  
after a kidney transplant and cancer treatments in France. And his 
dog Cassis is home, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassis traveled across the English Channel on the first of  
Britain's new pet passports, rabies-free certificates that mark the 
abolition of a law requiring all arriving dogs and cats to spend 
six months in quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats and celebrities in this nation of animal-lovers have  
long campaigned against the 100-year-old law, aimed at keeping 
Britain free of rabies. But it was William's letter to Prime 
Minister Tony Blair that finally got things moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him could he please change the law and please speed up  
the change,'' William said. ``I told him I was worried I may never 
see Cassis again -- which could go two ways because dogs die in 
quarantine, so it wasn't just me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under new regulations detailed this week, owners will be able to  
bring pets into Britain from 22 West European countries. The 
program will likely be extended to the United States, Canada and 
the Caribbean in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Each passport certifies the pet has a tiny microchip implant to  
verify its identity, has been vaccinated against rabies and has 
been treated for ticks and tapeworm 24 to 48 hours before arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassis, a 21-month-old Pyrenean mountain dog, traveled with  
William, his mother and brother to their home in Coniston, a 
village in the Lake District in north England, 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had moved to France a year ago because William, whose  
father is French, needed a kidney transplant and could get one more 
quickly there. He was diagnosed with cancer in the spring, shortly 
before the family was due to come home. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a few months before the Passports for Pets program,  
first announced in March, is operating for everyone. After that, 
officials believe about 300,000 pets could be on the move each year 
-- from pampered pooches of expatriates to English dogs accompanying 
their families on vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 9,000 pets -- 40 percent from the United States -- are  
put into quarantine each year. Some fall ill, many pine and others 
die. It also costs pet owners around $3,200 to kennel an animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Fretwell remembers the homecoming of Bertie, her Basset  
hound, quarantined when her husband, Sir John Fretwell, retired as 
British ambassador to Paris in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	For two months, she heeded the kennel owners' advice not to  
visit Bertie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I had a dream,'' Lady Fretwell said. ``I went rushing  
down there. He was in a deep, deep depression. ... After that, I 
went three or four times a week and crawled into his cage with 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was released, she said, Bertie couldn't bark and his  
paws were raw from the kennel's cement floor. Angered by his 
plight, she founded a pressure group in 1994 to end the quarantine 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Other diplomatic pets live in exile rather than be quarantined.  
</P>
<P>
	Whisky and Soda, Norfolk terriers belonging to the last British  
governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, have been trapped in France 
since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And former U.S. Ambassador Raymond Seitz, whose London posting  
ended in 1994, is still here because of dogs Scarlett and Chloe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't come back with them if we left, because of the  
quarantine,'' Seitz recalled last year. ``It simply made more sense 
to stay here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit to Britain in the 1960s, Elizabeth Taylor and  
then-husband Richard Burton kept their four dogs aboard a luxury 
yacht moored in the River Thames -- circumventing the regulations 
with the world's most expensive kennel. 
</P>
<P>
	As for William, he's just happy to have Cassis with him -- and  
that maybe he has helped others. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this has speeded up everything, as I think it has, I am  
completely delighted for everyone,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Still One Short of Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony Gwynn was only an observer Thursday night  
as one of baseball's most cherished milestones was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	His shining moment will have to wait for another day in another  
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before had two players entered a game with a chance to  
each grab a big piece of history. Mark McGwire got his, and then 
some, hitting his 500th and 501st career homers for St. Louis in a 
10-3 loss to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn needed two hits to become the 22nd player to get 3,000,  
but the Padres star didn't quite make it. He flied out in the 
first, walked in the second, flied out again in the fifth, grounded 
to second in the seventh, then lined a two-run double down the 
right-field line in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I swung the bat pretty good tonight, but I fell  
one hit short,'' Gwynn said. ``I'll move on to the next stop, which 
is Montreal, and hopefully I can get it there tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres open a four-game series against the Expos on Friday  
night. Dan Smith starts for Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire became the 16th player to hit 500 homers, connecting  
against Andy Ashby in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, stationed in right field, removed the glove from his  
right hand, tucked it under his arm, and clapped as McGwire rounded 
the bases. He stood and watched as fireworks exploded, streamers 
littered the field and the sellout crowd stood and cheered the 
hometown hero for three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough, because the 500th home run tied the game,''  
Gwynn said. ``I'm standing out in right field wondering, `Should I 
clap like everybody else, or try to be a professional?' But 500 
only comes around a few times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire did it again in the eighth, when he hit his second homer  
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals fans were rooting hard for Gwynn, recalling how crowds  
around the NL embraced McGwire on his way to 70 home runs last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those cheering on Gwynn was Lou Brock, the Cardinals Hall  
of Famer and the last NL player to get 3,000 hits. He reached the 
milestone 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have loved to have seen him get it here,'' said Brock, who  
said he will not travel to Montreal to see Gwynn continue his 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	After his ninth-inning hit, Gwynn doffed his helmet from second  
base as the St. Louis fans gave him a standing ovation. He was 
greeted with another loud ovation as he left the field after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, it is amazing to me as a visiting player to be  
treated like I've been treated here,'' Gwynn said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Issues New Federalism Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After strenuous protests by governors and  
mayors at his previous attempt, President Clinton issued a revised 
executive order Thursday on the division of responsibilities 
between the federal government and state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The new order on federalism said Washington ``should be  
deferential to the states'' when taking action that affects them. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies may pre-empt state law only when Congress gives  
express authority to do so, the order said, or there is clear 
evidence Congress intended to pre-empt state powers. But when state 
and federal rules conflict, the federal authority will be supreme. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's previous order, signed in May 1998, met with howls of  
protest when state and local officials complained they were not 
consulted. The order was suspended without taking effect, and the 
administration began negotiations with state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a former governor,'' Clinton said, ``I know how important  
it is for the American people that the federal government and state 
and local governments work together as partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his revised order would ``strengthen our partnership  
with state and local governments and ensure that executive branch 
agencies are able to do their work on behalf of the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State and local officials appeared satisfied with the rewritten  
order. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Clinton, the leaders of seven major  
intergovernmental organizations said, ``The executive order 
constructively responds to the concerns we raised during these 
consultations and provides to federal agencies strengthened 
guidance on the importance of federalism and state and local 
authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An excerpt of the letter, released by the White House, expressed  
appreciation to Clinton for ``consulting extensively'' on the 
revised order. 
</P>
<P>
	The order replaces a 1993 Clinton directive as well as one  
signed by President Reagan. Intended to guide federal regulators, 
the new order was written to combine the two earlier ones and bring 
them into line with current Supreme Court decisions.

	Congress Passes $792B Tax Cut Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans overcame Democratic opposition  
today to narrowly win final passage of a 10-year, $792 billion tax 
cut the GOP calls a deserving return of budget surpluses to wage 
earners and businesses. President Clinton denounced the bill and 
promised a veto. The Senate voted 50-49 for the final package a few 
hours after the House passed it 221-206. With little chance of 
becoming law, the bill will serve mainly as a defining issue 
between Republicans and Democrats in the 2000 struggle for control 
of Congress and the race for the White House.

	House Compromises on HMO Legislation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats and breakaway Republicans  
announced an agreement today on legislation that strengthens the 
rights of patients dealing with managed care plans and lowers their 
barriers to medical care. The bill would ease access for the 
insured to medical care in emergency rooms, from specialists in 
clinical trials and elsewhere. It also would establish an outside 
review process for patients who believe they unfairly were denied 
care. Companies obeying an independent panel's ruling still could 
be sued in state courts, but would not be liable for punitive 
damages.

	Man Charged in Alabama Shootings  
</P>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A man allegedly shot two co-workers to death  
at their office today, then killed a third person at a company 
where he used to work, in a burst of workplace violence just one 
week after the Atlanta office massacre. Alan Eugene Miller, 34, was 
arrested shortly after the shootings when police spotted him on 
nearby Interstate 65 and forced him to pull over. He briefly 
scuffled with officers, and a gun was found in his car. Miller was 
charged with three counts of capital murder. The motive was 
unclear.

	Senate Report Slams Media Violence

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents need to do more to shield children  
from violence in movies, TV shows, music and other media, according 
to a Senate report issued today. Senate Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked for the report after the April 
shooting at Colorado's Columbine High School, which left 15 people 
dead. It reached three conclusions: that the media dominate 
children's lives, that they are ``exceedingly violent'' and that 
the images lead to real world violence, Hatch said.

the most rigorous to date investigating the oil's potential 
heart-healthy properties. The study, published in this week's issue

unlike other studies, it did not find they offer heart attack

<HEADLINE> Rams Sign Marshall Faulk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Marshall Faulk never missed a day of training  
camp his first five NFL seasons, and he doesn't want to miss any 
more after ending a 12-day holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing a seven-year, $45.15 million contract with the St.  
Louis Rams that makes him the highest-paid player in franchise 
history, Faulk said his stand was never about money or skipping 
part of the training camp grind. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he is in good enough shape to play at least a few  
plays in Saturday's preseason opener against Oakland. Faulk has 
been working out under the supervision of trainer Bobby Kersee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say what I need to do,'' he said. ``If they  
say `Marshall, we want you to make a couple carries,' fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, he said nothing can prepare a player for  
going on the field in pads. Faulk planned to start practicing today 
and joked that he might ``pass out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a while,'' he said. ``Football is a fast game and I  
can't say exactly how long it'll take. Before that last preseason 
game, I want to be up to speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was the NFL's best all-purpose back last season, rushing  
for 1,319 yards and catching 86 passes for the Indianapolis Colts. 
His total of 2,227 yards rushing and receiving was the 
sixth-highest total in league history, and in five seasons he has 
rushed for 5,320 yards and earned three Pro Bowl invitations. 
</P>
<P>
	He fell out of favor with Colts management, and the Rams got him  
for second- and fifth-round picks two days before the NFL draft in 
April. But the Rams view him as the next Eric Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really excited to have him, and his record proves the  
type of player he is,'' said executive vice president Jay Zygmunt, 
who negotiated the contract with Faulk's agent, Rocky Arceneaux of 
St. Louis. ``We really think he's a franchise back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk is guaranteed $9.6 million this year, with a $7 million  
signing bonus and $2.6 million base salary. He'll make $19 million 
in the first four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point in negotiations was the fifth year, in which  
Faulk will get a $7 million salary and a $5 million roster bonus. 
The deal was structured in that fashion to prevent the Rams from 
designating Faulk as a transition or franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll also make $7 million in the sixth and seventh years. In  
addition, Faulk can void the contract after four years and become 
an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'll opt out,'' Arceneaux said. ``If he gets to  
year five of the contract, there's a big reward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams knew they'd have to rework the contract he signed out  
of San Diego State as the second player taken in the 1994 draft. 
Faulk had two years to go on a deal that was scheduled to pay him 
$2.2 million in base salary this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk attended an early minicamp, saying it was a show of good  
faith, but skipped the June minicamp when talks stalled. The 
signing comes three days after the Rams scrimmaged with the Colts 
in Champaign, Ill., and Faulk said he hated to miss that gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would I duck them?'' he said. ``I would love to scrimmage  
against those guys. Nothing against the players, the coaching staff 
or Jim Irsay, but there's some people there who felt I couldn't 
play the game at the level at which I was playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Faulk donated $500,000 to his charitable  
organization for inner-city youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around the NFL:  
</P>
<P>
                             *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Dimitrius Underwood might have cost himself a job with Minnesota  
by failing to return to training camp as promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft pick, went AWOL after his first  
pro practice on Monday, but apologetically called his agent 24 
hours later, saying he needed to tend to a family crisis and was on 
his way back to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Underwood, who signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract on  
Sunday, missed Wednesday's workouts, too, leaving coach Dennis 
Green stewed and general manager Tim Connolly stumped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not talked to him at all,'' Green said. ``We've got a  
football camp here. He knows where it's at and he knows where his 
room is. He is not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Raghib Ismail's debut with the Dallas Cowboys is on hold after  
the receiver slightly separated his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're calling it day-to-day, but it looks like it'll be closer  
to a week before we actually get him back on any type of full-time 
basis,'' coach Chan Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said Ismail definitely will not play Monday night in the  
team's exhibition opener, the Hall of Fame game against the 
Cleveland Browns in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail was injured while trying to catch a pass in a morning  
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail joined the Cowboys as a free agent in April. The former  
Oakland Raiders and Carolina Panthers player cashed in on the two 
best seasons of his career by signing a $21.5 million, seven-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Dixon Edwards, a veteran of 18 playoff games and two Super  
Bowls, left the Dolphins on Wednesday and might sit out the season 
because of an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old linebacker was aware of the problem last year,  
when he started 14 games for the Minnesota Vikings. He participated 
in Miami's first three training camp workouts last week, then 
underwent further tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator George Hill said Edwards' return is a long  
shot. The Dolphins released him and terminated his contract, and 
Edwards returned the $350,000 signing bonus he received for joining 
Miami in June as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	After five straight days of two-a-day workouts, Eric Green was  
excused for the second straight day from training-camp sessions 
with a sore left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Eric Green can't play, we're going to have big problems,''  
coach Bill Parcells said. ``It would impact us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Pro Bowler, who signed a four-year, $7.5 million  
free-agent contract with the Jets during the offseason, is being 
counted on to fill the void created when Kyle Brady signed with 
Jacksonville in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Jets nor Green would reveal the exact nature of the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Detroit released ex-Notre Dame star Ron Powlus to make room for  
newcomer Donald Hollas, a former quarterback for the Oakland 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Powlus joined the Lions as a free agent, but was let go in a  
move Lions coach Bobby Ross called ``a tough thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to take a good look at Powlus,'' Ross said. ``I  
don't want five QBs out here. I wanted four, so we had to make that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we have Don Hollas in, he has to do a lot of catching  
up,'' Ross said of the newcomer who spent his first day in 
Detroit's camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions corps of quarterbacks also includes starter Charlie  
Batch, Gus Frerotte and Corey Sauter.

<HEADLINE> Winnie The Pooh Piano Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 200,000 toy pianos were recalled  
Thursday because a small part may pose a choking risk to children. 
</P>
<P>
	After testing the piano, the Consumer Product Safety Commission  
determined pieces on a microphone attached to the Tiger Electronics 
Pooh Poppin' Pianos may break off and create a hazard for young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	No choking incidences or injuries have been reported, said Russ  
Rader, commission spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The lime green, eight-key piano has figures from ``Winnie the  
Pooh,'' including Pooh, Tigger and Roo. Only toys with serial 
numbers starting with ``WT'' or ``CO15D'' have the defective 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Electronics of Vernon Hills, Ill., sold the toys from  
August 1997 until this month for about $20. Consumers should call 
1-888-748-2860 to find out how to receive a safe replacement toy.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Pleas in ValuJet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former executive and two ex-mechanics for an  
aviation maintenance company pleaded innocent Thursday to federal 
charges stemming from the 1996 ValuJet crash that killed 110 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The mechanics, Mauro Valenzuela and Eugene Florence, and Daniel  
Gonzalez, SabreTech Inc.'s former vice president of maintenance, 
made their pleas before a federal magistrate judge. An attorney 
entered the same plea for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the men are charged with conspiracy and making  
false statements that led to the 1996 crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say SabreTech took oxygen canisters from another  
ValuJet plane, mislabeled them as empty, packed them up and 
delivered the carton to a ValuJet ramp, where it was loaded aboard 
Flight 592. Investigators said the canisters ignited in the cargo 
hold of the DC-9, transforming the jet into an airborne inferno 
that nose-dived into the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	This is believed to be the first time that criminal charges have  
been filed against maintenance workers in a U.S. plane crash. 
SabreTech also faces state charges of murder and manslaughter for 
illegally packaging the oxygen canisters, which also were missing 
required yellow safety caps. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge Ted Banstra granted the defendants'  
request for a jury trial, which is scheduled to begin Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men remained free on bond. Each of them could be  
sentenced to up to 55 years in prison and fined $2.7 million if 
convicted.

<HEADLINE> Senate Protects Arts Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate decisively rejected a conservative  
effort to kill the National Endowment for the Arts today as 
Congress tries to wrap up some of its spending work before 
embarking on its August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, I-N.H., proposed eliminating the entire $99  
million provided for the endowment in a Senate bill, but was 
defeated 80-16. Though some of the controversial arts projects the 
endowment has financed over the years have made it a perennial 
target of conservatives, today's vote underlined how the Senate has 
long looked favorably at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came as the Senate resumed debating a $14.1 billion  
measure financing the Interior Department and cultural programs. 
That measure has become a battleground over mining and other issues 
pitting industry against environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also planned to continue considering a $37.7 billion  
measure today that would finance the departments of Justice, State 
and Commerce and smaller agencies for the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce-Justice measure had contained $141 million  
for the Legal Services Corp., which provides free legal 
representation in civil cases for the poor. But in an alliance of 
Democrats and moderate Republicans, the House voted 242-178 
Wednesday to boost that figure to $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simple decency and a commitment to equal justice under the law  
should be enough'' to win support for the corporation, said Rep. 
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	On the losing side were conservatives, who try to slash Legal  
Services' budget virtually every year. This year they cited a new 
report by the General Accounting Office, Congress' official 
auditor, which found that five of the corporation's local offices 
had counted 75,000 cases in 1997 that they couldn't document. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., called the undocumented cases ``one of  
the most outrageous misrepresentations of any agency ... probably 
one of the worst in this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $250 million still falls short of the $300 million provided  
for Legal Services this year. But with President Clinton having 
requested $340 million for fiscal 2000 and the Senate having 
already voted for $300 million, the final figure is likely to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old, nonprofit corporation receives federal and  
private aid and distributes grants to local boards of lawyers, who 
then provide free legal assistance to low-income people in civil 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall Commerce-Justice bill faces a White House veto  
threat because the measure provides less than Clinton wants for 
legal aid, hiring local police officers, protecting endangered 
species and U.S. payments to international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, written largely by Republicans, includes nearly all  
of the $4.8 billion Clinton requested for the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowing to budget pressures, it declares $4.5 billion of it an  
emergency, exempting that money from spending limits and paying for 
it out of expected federal surpluses. Democrats, then 
conservatives, lost separate attempts to knock that emergency 
designation out of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate began debating the Interior bill last week as  
Democrats succeeded in knocking out four provisions that they 
considered anti-environmental. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters of the deleted language were expected to try  
reviving their provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who for the  
fourth time wants to delay the Interior Department from forcing oil 
companies to pay higher royalties to the government for drilling on 
federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the start of fiscal 2000 less than two months away, the  
House has so far approved 10 of the 13 annual spending bills for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has approved nine, including a $68 billion measure  
financing agriculture and food programs. The Senate approved it 
Wednesday after including $7.4 billion in emergency aid for farmers 
hurt by drought and low crop prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, a House-Senate compromise version of only one bill  
has gotten final congressional approval, an $8.4 billion measure 
financing military construction. 
</P>
<P>
	In other spending action,  
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers approved a compromise bill providing  
the District of Columbia's local government with $429 million in 
federal aid and ordering it not to give needles to illegal drug 
users in an effort to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate negotiators also agreed to a near $2.5 billion  
measure financing Congress' own operations.

<HEADLINE> DeLay: Farm Aid Adds Complications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican plans to leave Social Security  
surpluses alone this year have been thrown into disarray by Senate 
passage of $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid, House Majority Whip 
Tom DeLay said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, R-Texas, said GOP leaders still intend to pass  
tax-cutting and spending bills that don't touch the billions in 
surpluses the massive pension program is building up. By the end of 
Congress' August recess, he said, top House Republicans hope to 
decide how to do that and still move their own farm aid package 
through the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a discussion with reporters about his party's budget  
tactics, the No. 3 House Republican said Senate approval of farm 
aid Wednesday night had complicated things. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the atomic bomb that blows up the whole strategy,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trent tried to hold off the mules and wagons, and he was  
rolled,'' Delay said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., ``And we'll get rolled over here if we try to stop 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay's remarks spotlighted the difficult time GOP leaders are  
having hewing to their pledge to leave Social Security surpluses 
undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office has estimated there will be a  
$14 billion budget surplus next year without counting Social 
Security's surplus. DeLay said it has been the GOP's intent ``from 
the get go'' to use that money for tax cuts and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, Republicans have committed $5.3 billion of it to  
their tax bill; $4.5 billion for paying for next year's census; 
plus the still undetermined costs of the farm aid bill, which could 
well grow to about the Senate's $7.4 billion figure. 
</P>
<P>
	That excludes the price tag for other emergencies that may  
occur. It also excludes money that Republicans want to use to shore 
up a huge spending bill for health and education that is currently 
about $15 billion below last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay said President Clinton's expected veto of several of the  
13 annual spending bills for next year would demonstrate to the 
public that it was he -- not Republicans -- who wants to use Social 
Security money for extra spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll just have to go to the American people and convince them  
it's important,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Linda Ricci of the White House Office of Management  
countered, ``Their budget doesn't meet the responsibility test and 
it doesn't meet the reality test. It's a cynical plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay spoke as Congress sorted through spending business as it  
approached its August recess. The Senate adjourned Thursday evening 
until Sept. 8, and the House worked into the night planning to do 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 2000 begins Oct. 1. So far, Congress has completed the  
final version of just one of the 13 annual spending bills for the 
new year. With lawmakers not returning until after Labor Day, the 
pressure will be on for Clinton and lawmakers to work out their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 217-210 to approve a $37.7 billion measure  
financing the departments of Justice, Commerce and State for next 
year after refighting a familiar battle over U.S. abortion spending 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	By 221-206, the House rejected an effort by Rep. Tony Hall,  
D-Ohio, that would have allowed payment of $244 million of this 
country's U.N. back dues without linking them to limits on abortion 
funds. Conservatives would allow the payment of the dues only if 
U.S. funds are banned for groups that use their own money to lobby 
for liberalized overseas abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate debated, but did not complete, a $14.1 billion  
measure financing the Interior Department and cultural programs. 
That measure has become a battleground over mining and other issues 
pitting industry against environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a defeat for conservatives, the Senate voted 80-16 to reject  
an effort by Sen. Bob Smith, I-N.H., to kill the National Endowment 
for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House's Justice-Commerce-State bill and the Senate's  
Interior bill face veto threats from the Clinton administration 
because they provide less money for many programs than the White 
House favors.

<HEADLINE> Discovery Channel To Cover Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Discovery Network plans three hours of live  
television coverage next Wednesday of something mom warned you 
never to look at directly -- a solar eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable channel's cameras will follow the 60-mile wide path  
where the sun is totally obscured by the moon, from its start in 
southern England, through France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, 
Romania to the Middle East and its conclusion in India. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the most extensive live coverage of any event in  
Discovery's 15-year history and, the network believes, the first 
time TV has followed an eclipse in such detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Eclipse coverage runs from 6 to 9 a.m. EDT, with an hour-long  
wrapup that night at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human beings have always been totally enthralled by  
eclipses,'' said Discovery general manager Mike Quattrone, ``but if 
you wanted to see an eclipse, you had to be geographically lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People shouldn't stare at the sun because there's a risk of eye  
damage, but cameras can safely capture an eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will do more than beam three hours of the sun. It will  
explain the science behind the eclipse and show how people in each 
country react to it. The network hopes to climax its coverage with 
an arresting image of the eclipse over the Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will pull its coverage together with the help of  
Discovery Europe and a dozen European TV affiliates. British 
broadcaster Mary Nightingale will be the host. 
</P>
<P>
	The last total solar eclipse in the mainland United States took  
place in 1979. Discovery has time to make plans for the next one -- 
it comes on Aug. 21, 2017.

<HEADLINE> Details of GOP $792B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Details of the 10-year, $792 billion tax cut package agreed to  
by House and Senate Republican negotiators. 

</P>
<P>
                            *INCOME TAX   	
</P>
<P>
	--A reduction of 1 percentage point in all marginal income tax  
rates between 2001 and 2005. The bottom 15 percent rate would fall 
to 14.5 percent in 2001 and 14 percent in 2003, followed by a 1 
percentage point reduction in all other rates in 2005. Cost: $283 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--To ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of two-income  
couples, the standard deduction would be gradually doubled over a 
five-year period, beginning in 2001, for those who do not itemize. 
Also, the income subject to the bottom tax bracket would rise for 
couples who file jointly in 2005. Cost: $119 billion.

<P>
                           *CAPITAL GAINS   	
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce individual capital gains rates for most investments held  
at least one year from 20 percent to 18 percent, or from 10 percent

1999) for people who care for an elderly relative at home. Cost: 
$42.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase tax-exempt contribution limits to IRA-like education  
savings accounts from $500 to $2,000 and include elementary and 
secondary expenses. Interest on prepaid tuition accounts for public

areas, where a variety of tax breaks would apply for businesses 
that create jobs, clean up former industrial sites and take other 
actions. Cost: up to $2 billion. 

</P>
<P>
                            *CORPORATE   	
</P>

<HEADLINE> German Jobless Rate Rises in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) -- The number of jobless persons in  
Germany edged above the politically sensitive 4 million mark again 
in July, pushing the unemployment rate to 10.3 percent from 10.1 
percent a month earlier, the Labor Office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the increase was less than expected and largely the  
result of seasonal factors such as the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Office president Bernhard Jagoda said conditions were  
picking up, especially in the west, where most German industry is 
located. Jagoda also noted there were fewer people in government 
job programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The unadjusted jobless tally rose 89,000 to 4.027 million, the  
Labor Office said. The 10.3 percent rate for the month was lower 
than the 10.7 percent registered in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted for seasonal factors, the number of jobless rose only  
1,000 -- far below analysts' expectations of about 9,000 -- after a 
15,000 rise in June. The German jobless rate was expected to have 
risen to an unadjusted 10.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Germany's unadjusted unemployment rate was 8.6 percent  
in July, up from 8.4 percent in June. That compared with 17.4 
percent in formerly communist eastern Germany, up from 16.8 percent 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of unemployed Germans topped 4 million in 1997 and  
has stubbornly held near that level since, contributing to last 
year's defeat of long-serving conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	New Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government has pledged to  
reduce the level by at least 1 million by 2002, but has had little 
success so far.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Lowest in 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks on Thursday dropped to their  
lowest level since late March, with the hardest hit in 
telecommunications and technology shares and in media stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies fell 6.71  
points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 292.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications and technology were the worst-performing  
sectors, with both indexes dropping 3.8 percent. Media was nearly 
as hard-hit, with a 3.6 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sell-off has accelerated,'' said Joe Hall, head of  
marketing for European equities at Deutsche Bank. ``There's been 
genuine heavy selling pressure in the more expensive companies such 
as mobile phone operators, which are more sensitive to rising 
interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 2.8  
percent to 4,978.45, the Paris CAC-40 index was 2.0 percent lower 
to 4,240.70, London's FTSE 100 index fell 2.1 percent to 6,101.60, 
Milan's MIBtel index fell 1.9 percent to 31,850 and Amsterdam's AEX 
index fell 2.2 percent to 529.02. 
</P>
<P>
	The German telecom and industrial conglomerate Mannesmann warned  
that net profit this year will fall below last year's level. The 
company's shares fell 7.5 percent , and Nokia, Orange and the 
German software company SAP, all registered declines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weakness in the tech sector is intensifying,'' said Nick  
Stevenson, head of European equity strategy at Paribas. 
``Mannesmann's figures weren't good and more people are getting 
nervous. It's also interesting to see how the sell-off in techs in 
the U.S. is coming through to telecoms in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed International fell in  
London and Amsterdam after the group posted a 10 percent slide in 
pretax earnings. Reed International fell 41.25 pence (67 cents) to 
424 pence ($7.11) in London, and Elsevier dropped EUR1.10 ($1.19) 
to EUR10.50 ($11.34) in Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries joining the single currency, closed down 6.54 points at 
302.89. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 77.98 points to 3,512.71,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 83.25 points at 3,502.57.

<HEADLINE> Charity Takes New Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- For decades, private foundations have focused  
on solving specific problems in the nation's poorest communities -- 
funding a job-training program here, an after-school program there 
-- but hundreds of urban communities remain poor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, researchers reconsidered the narrow approach. The  
best way to eliminate poverty, according to the growing consensus, 
is by simultaneously tackling all the problems confronting poor 
neighborhoods -- crime, bad schools, the lack of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experiments got under way in cities such as Seattle and Chicago.  
But no foundation launched a comprehensive community building 
program nationally. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Annie E. Casey Foundation, the nation's 20th largest charity  
with assets of nearly $1.6 billion, is gearing up to launch its 
``Making Connections'' program in 22 cities. Foundation officials 
are prepared to spend up to $500 million over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do only what others are doing well, the question is why  
bother?'' said Ralph Smith, a vice president of the Baltimore-based 
foundation. It was established in 1948 by United Parcel Service 
founder Jim Casey in his mother's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Making Connections aims to help poverty-stricken families earn  
more, live healthier and feel safer so they can provide better 
lives for their children. The idea is stronger families will 
eventually result in stronger communities over time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are putting families back in the center of the action,''  
Smith said. ``The solution is going to require us to reconnect 
families to opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation wants to work with neighborhoods where grassroots  
groups, foundations and government agencies are already trying to 
solve problems. Casey doesn't want to supplant the existing work, 
just make it better, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey representatives will bring together the residents, local  
businesses, faith groups, social service agencies, local 
governments, schools and the police so that the community can 
jointly figure out which problems are the most pressing and how to 
fix them. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the foundation will award grants, provide staff and other  
resources, and work to procure more aid and support, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say Casey has the right idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Figuring out the neighborhood's needs is a crucial step in a  
``holistic'' approach to fighting poverty, said John McKnight, a 
Northwestern University professor who has done such work in 
Chicago. The next step is to find out what the community is doing 
right and expand that effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Making Connections work? No one is sure, and experts like  
Christopher Jencks at Harvard University are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a huge number of these kinds of discussions  
about what's the right strategy. We're going on 35 years of tearing 
our hair over this,'' Jencks said. ``I don't think we have any 
basis to say this kind of thing is better or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey officials know they are taking on a tough job, said Gary  
Walker, president of Public/Private Ventures, a social policy 
research group in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know whether it's going to work, but you have to have  
some admiration for the fact that they're willing to try this,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Social-welfare groups, even those working within a neighborhood,  
don't always agree what the main problems are and how to solve 
them, causing turf battles. And the foundation's biggest challenge 
will be to get jobs and investment to move into blighted areas, 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	One neighborhood that could benefit from Making Connections is  
Historic East Baltimore, a turn-of-the-century rowhouse community 
about a mile from the foundation's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug dealers haunt the 144-square-block community. Homes are  
boarded up. Trash and liquor bottles litter the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, 24 neighborhood associations, churches, and  
social service agencies formed the Historic East Baltimore 
Community Action Coalition to improve things from the ground up. 
But the progress has been agonizingly slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey gave the coalition several thousand dollars, and a  
foundation subsidiary, Casey Family Services, helped set up 
after-school programs, a men's center and the like. Casey officials 
said they haven't decided if they want to launch Making Connections 
in Historic East Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer David, a 45-year-old welfare mother of two, said things  
haven't gotten any better, a sentiment shared by several other 
residents. Many people living there would move in a second if they 
could only afford to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the main problems here is the housing,'' she said.  
``The job situation is bad. ... It would be nice if they could get 
the drug dealers out of the park. Children can't even play in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see it getting worse. I don't see any improvements.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Approves New Cancer Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A newly approved drug that can literally light  
up cancerous cells promises help for patients with suspicious chest 
X-rays who are trying to determine whether they need a biopsy for 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Diatide Inc.'s NeoTect will not replace biopsies in which lung  
tissue is surgically removed to definitively diagnose cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But because NeoTect works differently than other noninvasive  
cancer tests, ``it is a very valuable tool'' for deciding which 
patients need a biopsy, said Dr. Florence Houn of the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	NeoTect, approved Wednesday, is for patients whose chest X-rays  
or CT scans show a mass that doctors cannot determine is benign or 
cancerous. Sometimes mere scars, for instance, appear suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	Many types of lung cancer produce a protein called somatostatin.  
NeoTect is injected into the arm and travels to the lungs, where it 
detects somatostatin by latching onto somatostatin ``receptors,'' 
or docking points, on cancer cells. NeoTect carries a radioactive 
label that lights up the cancer under a common nuclear-medicine 
camera.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Johnson: `I'm Not a Backup' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- It was a freak play, and Rob Johnson  
winces at the cruel memory. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Johnson, crashing to the turf on Buffalo's first  
offensive series in Indianapolis last October. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Johnson, sandwiched between the point of the football  
and Colts tackle Larry Chester. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Johnson's job, taking a perfect bounce right into the  
eager and capable hands of scrambling Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays showed a separation of his rib cartilage, and the Bills  
didn't know how long Johnson would be out. 
</P>
<P>
	He has yet to reclaim his status as starting quarterback for the  
Bills. Johnson acknowledged in training camp on Thursday that 
there's no question he's the backup to Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves it,'' Johnson said. ``He played well last year.  
You know who's going to be in there. You don't have to be a brain 
surgeon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson lost out to fate and Flutie last year. Now, he's ready  
to return the favor to Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got everyone in his corner, which is great,'' Johnson  
said. ``That's what the quarterback needs to do. My job is to be 
there in case something happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who was signed to a $25 million contract before last  
season after just one NFL start to his credit, wasn't happy about 
being sent to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a backup, and I've proven that,'' Johnson said  
Thursday. ``I've played pretty well in every game I've been in. I 
just haven't been able to stay healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting isn't something Johnson does well, although he has been  
gracious about it. He left USC as the school's career leader in 
completions, yards and touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	A classic drop-back passer with a great arm, Johnson has yet to  
really use his skills in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	For three seasons at Jacksonville, Mark Brunell was there.  
</P>
<P>
	Now Flutie.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much his town and his team right now,'' Johnson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, once cast off as too small to play in the NFL, helped  
carry the team to the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie made the Pro Bowl and was named comeback player of the  
year. In the offseason the Bills gave him a four-year, $22 million 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson bought a house on the water in Laguna Beach, Calif. His  
surfboard sat while Johnson worked out near his parents' home in 
Mission Viejo, Calif., with his friend and former USC teammate, 
Baltimore linebacker Jeff Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran a lot of stairs and hills, and lifted,'' said Johnson,  
who came to camp in the best shape of his life. ``There's a 
140-yard hill that's straight up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upon his arrival at camp, Johnson discovered his name listed  
beside Flutie's on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice that they list us as co-starters and they think that  
much of me,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, while Flutie signs autographs, Johnson zips away  
in a golf cart with third-string quarterback Alex Van Pelt. Later, 
Johnson and Flutie face off in video hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just push each other,'' Johnson said. ``Doug's very  
competitive and so am I. We're very different other than that. It's 
not like we're enemies. I wish him well and I'm sure he wishes me 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is trying to be patient, but he can hear the clock  
ticking. ``I want to play,'' he said. ``I'm 26. This is going to be 
my fifth year, and I've started six games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my decision; it's their decision,'' he said. ``I like  
it here, I like the team. If they want to keep me, great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's somewhere in the league for me. If this is  
going to be Doug's team for years, they'll probably trade me and 
try to get something for me.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago, London Markets in Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London  
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange have formed an 
alliance to give customers electronic access to each other's 
products, a move aimed at cutting traders' costs and improving 
their efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	The connection will allow customers to trade futures contracts  
for securities pegged to short-term interest rates for both markets 
on one computer screen, officials for the two exchanges said in a 
joint news conference Thursday with participants in Chicago and 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is set to begin early next year and will provide  
the exchanges' customers access to both the Merc's Globex2 and 
LIFFE's CONNECT electronic trading systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also announced plans for a for-profit joint venture to  
develop new products and services -- a plan which requires 
regulatory approval both in the United States and in England. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is a response to a growing number of alliances in  
electronic trading, including a recently approved deal between 
Eurex -- LIFFE's Swiss-German competitor -- and the Chicago Board of 
Trade, the Merc's rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is truly a significant step for our two exchanges,''  
said Scott Gordon, chairman of the Merc's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Partnerships like the one we are announcing today are the wave  
of the future,'' said Gordon, who began revamping the Merc after 
his election last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In years past, there has been resistance to electronic links  
between the world's exchanges from traders in U.S. commodity 
markets who rely on the ``open outcry'' method of yelling and 
gesturing to set prices on contracts for future delivery of 
everything from uncured bacon to sophisticated financial 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon said that has quickly changed -- adding that  
electronic trading is quickly becoming a complement to open outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is not, however, as extensive as the Eurex alliance  
with the Chicago Board of Trade. That deal calls for the Board of 
Trade to acquire Eurex's electronic trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials at the Merc and LIFFE say their alliance is unique  
because it is an ``open'' system that allows each exchange to set 
up more trading alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not one exchange merging with or taking over another  
exchange. ... It is not for the benefit of both exchanges; it's a 
benefit to our customers,'' said Brian Williamson, LIFFE's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, LIFFE officials turned down a proposed alliance that  
would have linked it with the Merc and French-based Matif. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say this latest alliance offers LIFFE a chance to  
rejuvenate itself -- now that Eurex controls trading in German 
government bond futures contracts that LIFFE developed more than a 
decade ago.

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Free-Net, the nation's first free

bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, which started as an electronic bulletin board in  
1984 at Case Western Reserve University, is scheduled to go out of

<HEADLINE> Fox Signs Contract With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Rick Fox signed a multi-year contract  
with the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, becoming the second free 
agent this week to decide to remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	No terms were announced, but it was believed Fox agreed to a  
six-year deal worth around $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Fox averaged 9.0 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.2  
assists in 44 games for the Lakers last season, his second with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox played the previous six years with the Boston Celtics, who  
selected him 24th overall in the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made it clear the past two years how much I've wanted to  
be a part of the Lakers, and for them to make this long-term 
commitment to me is very gratifying,'' Fox said in a statement 
issued by the team. ``Both the Lakers and I are making commitments 
with one goal in mind -- to win championships. We have a lot of 
exciting things happening, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls to six championships  
in the 1990s, was hired as coach of the Lakers in June. Point guard 
Derek Fisher signed a long-term deal to remain with the team on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick is a very talented and also a very versatile player,''  
Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``Whether as a starter 
or a key player off the bench, he can help us in many different 
ways, whether it be his shooting, defense or rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox was a starter in his first season with the team and a  
reserve in his second. He earned $1.75 million last season and $1 
million in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick has also made sacrifices the past couple of years to be  
with the Lakers,'' Kupchak said. ``We appreciate that, and are very 
happy to be able to sign him to this long-term contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, 30, has career averages of 10.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and  
2.8 assists.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers 'Steel Action Plan' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration presented steel  
industry chiefs and labor leaders with a plan Thursday to bolster 
the weakened industry, including a pledge to oppose international 
loans that would further subsidize imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many steelworkers and communities are experiencing continuing  
hardship as a result of last year's sharp rise in steel imports,'' 
President Clinton said in a statement released by his press 
secretary. ``I am determined to continue taking forceful action to 
address the unfair trade practices that have contributed 
significantly to this crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders and executives from 10 steel companies who have  
clashed with the administration over how to react to low-priced 
steel flooding U.S. docks from Japan, South Korea and other 
countries emerged from the White House session pleased with the 
administration's promises to defend anti-dumping laws in upcoming 
trade talks and to hold an international conference on unfair trade 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're encouraged by the recognition of the crisis, the  
framework to resolve the problems in our industry,'' said Curtis H. 
Barnette, chairman and CEO of Bethlehem Steel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Surging steel imports in recent years have driven down prices  
and forced at least three publicly traded American steel companies 
to declare bankruptcy. Administration officials have pointed to the 
fact that imports have begun to recede as evidence that continuing 
to enforce existing trade laws is the right course. 
</P>
<P>
	But labor and the industry continued to press for tougher  
action, and the issue has vexed Vice President Al Gore as his 
presidential campaign courts labor's support. Thursday's session 
was aimed at reassuring both labor and manufacturers that steel 
remained a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to initiate legislative actions, administrative  
actions, to help deal with this,'' said United Steel Workers 
President George Becker. ``They're dealing with the important 
elements that we want done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others were less enthused about the plan. Rep. Ralph Regula,  
R-Ohio and chairman of the House steel caucus, called it ``a purely 
political document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too little and too late,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The industry has filed trade complaints against several  
countries and won several cases, but manufacturers complain that as 
soon as one country reduces exports of a certain type of steel, 
another steps up its exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's ``steel action plan'' includes:  
</P>
<P>
	--A pledge to block World Bank and International Monetary Fund  
loans that would further subsidize foreign steel industries and 
ensure that the next round of World Trade Organization talks 
maintains strong sanctions against unfair trade. 
</P>
<P>
	--A comprehensive Commerce Department review of existing foreign  
government subsidies of industries and other ``market destroying 
trade barriers,'' such as the decline in production of iron ore and 
coke. 
</P>
<P>
	--A global forum on unfair trade practices that can lead to  
excess capacity in the steel market, deflating prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, administration officials said Clinton would sign a  
congressional package of $1.5 billion in loans for steel, oil and 
natural gas companies to help industries rocked by low prices.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Plan for Steel Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration presented a plan  
today to bolster the troubled steel industry against unfair trade 
practices, including a proposal to fight international loans that 
would subsidize imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials presented the proposals to industry  
chiefs and labor leaders at a White House meeting as Congress sent 
President Clinton a $1.5 billion loan plan aimed in part at helping 
steel producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plan that we have put forward today will continue to show  
an aggressiveness on this administration's part,'' said Commerce 
Secretary William Daley. ``The feeling at the meeting ... was very 
much one of working together to address this very difficult and 
complex problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surging steel imports in recent years have driven down prices  
and forced at least three publicly traded American steel companies 
to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports have begun to recede and the administration's focus  
continues to be on enforcing existing trade laws. But industry and 
labor have pressed for tougher steps, and today's session aimed at 
reassuring them that steel remains a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has filed trade complaints against several  
countries and won several cases, but those take a long time and 
have to be handled for one kind of steel at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers have complained that as soon as one country  
reduces exports of a certain type of steel, another steps up its 
exports, leaving American docks just as loaded with inexpensive, 
hard-to-compete-against steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has vexed Vice President Al Gore as his presidential  
campaign courts labor's support. The United Steel Workers union has 
opposed an early endorsement of Gore, principally because of their 
differences with the administration over trade. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and George Becker, president of  
the Steel Workers, attended the session with White House chief of 
staff John Podesta, Daley and Gene Sperling, the president's 
economic adviser. The president also dropped by the session, where 
the heads of a half-dozen steel companies also were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said he was gratified by the administration's proposals.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are gong to initiate legislative actions, administrative  
actions, to help deal with this in a way that it needs to be dealt 
with,'' he said. ``We're going to do our best to work with the 
administration to see that this works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the proposals were:  
</P>
<P>
	--A pledge to block World Bank and International Monetary Fund  
loans that would further subsidize foreign steel industries and 
ensure that the next round of World Trade Organization talks 
maintains strong sanctions against unfair trade. 
</P>
<P>
	--A comprehensive Commerce Department review of existing  
government subsidies of foreign industries and other ``market 
destroying trade barriers,'' such as the decline in production of 
iron ore and coke. 
</P>
<P>
	--Participation in global forums on unfair trade practices that  
can lead to excess capacity in the steel market, deflating prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The House gave final congressional approval Wednesday to federal  
guarantees for $1.5 billion in loans for steel, oil and natural gas 
companies, aiming to help industries that have been rocked by low 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 246-176 vote came seven weeks after the Senate passed the  
bill by a 63-34 vote. Supporters said they expected Clinton to sign 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the measure was little better than the  
protectionism the U.S. government criticizes other countries for. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., pushed the steel aid through the  
Senate earlier this year in legislation paying for the air campaign 
against Yugoslavia. It was designed to help only some small steel 
companies, including Weirton Steel in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	He took it off that bill in exchange for promises that Congress  
would consider it separately. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., won a 
similar pledge for assistance for oil and gas companies.

<HEADLINE> Suns Trade for Hardaway Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway is on the verge of joining the  
Phoenix Suns, a major acquisition for a team that has almost no 
money under the salary cap and not a lot to offer in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the Orlando Magic had little choice but to  
accept the Suns' offer of Pat Garrity, Danny Manning and two 
first-round draft picks. It was the only offer that remained on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement that the trade was completed was likely to come  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a done deal until we get the league office on the  
phone and we have the transaction take place,'' Suns president 
Jerry Colangelo said Wednesday night. ``And we have not had that 
take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Colangelo gave every indication that the Magic were prepared  
to go through with the trade. Hardaway has told Colangelo that he 
wants to go to the Suns, and the Magic apparently have reluctantly 
gone along. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us that we had a deal in that we've agreed to what  
we're going to give them in terms of compensation,'' Colangelo 
said. ``We took care of our end of the business. That's why I keep 
saying we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been indications that Orlando's management was trying  
mightily to salvage more out of the deal than the Suns were 
offering, either by persuading Hardaway to stay and play for new 
Magic coach Doc Rivers or by finding another interested trading 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic general manager John Gabriel went home Wednesday evening  
without publicly giving his approval to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge decision for us, obviously,'' Gabriel said. ``I  
was in here until midnight trying to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make the trade happen, Hardaway would sign a seven-year, $86  
million contract with Orlando, the largest allowed for a player 
with his experience under the NBA's collective bargaining 
agreement. Then he would be traded to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a major boost to the Suns, who endured a lackluster  
season this year and are handicapped in any efforts to improve by 
the new salary cap. The team used its new $2 million exception 
Wednesday to sign free-agent forward Rodney Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hardaway joins the Suns, he would team with Jason Kidd as one  
of the most formidable backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, 28, has averaged 19 points in six NBA seasons, making  
the All-Star game four times. Nagging injuries have plagued him the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic might be tempted to thwart Hardaway by refusing to  
sign him and allowing him to enter the free-agent market, where he 
could only sign a six-year deal for significantly less money. Only 
Chicago, the Los Angeles Clippers and Toronto appear to have the 
salary cap room to meet his demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gabriel said such a scenario probably won't happen,  
leaving as the only alternatives the nearly impossible task of 
persuading Hardaway to stay in Orlando, or letting him go to 
Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Meaning of National Debt Buyback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department is considering buying  
back a portion of the $3.6 trillion national debt held by the 
public. What does that mean and what would it entail? 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, it means the government would have the option of  
buying back such things as Treasury bills, notes and bonds before 
they mature. No one would be forced to surrender their government 
securities. The process would be purely voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be done through a type of reverse auction in which the  
government would announce the type of securities it was interested 
in buying and accept the most competitive bids from holders of 
those securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, in question and answer form, is a look at the buyback  
program announced Wednesday by Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What is the significance of this for the government's  
long-term budget policies? 
</P>
<P>
	A: The Treasury Department's proposal sets the stage for  
completely eliminating debt held by the public by 2015, something 
that has happened only once before in the nation's history: in 1835 
when Andrew Jackson was president. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, interest on the public debt cost the government $364  
billion. Reducing the debt by buying back some securities would 
lower the government's interest payments. The savings could be used 
for other purposes, such as shoring up Social Security or Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that even a tiny  
reduction in federal borrowing costs would save the government more 
than $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing the debt also means less U.S. government reliance on  
overseas investors to finance American investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why should the average consumer or business care about a  
buyback? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Reducing debt would lower interest rates and would lower  
borrowing costs to consumers and businesses. In theory, that should 
help reduce rates for home mortgages, car loans, credit cards and 
business loans. Businesses could invest the resulting savings in 
other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: But what happens if the Federal Reserve becomes worried about  
the economy growing too quickly and starts to raise the short-term 
interest rates it controls? 
</P>
<P>
	A: That could happen. But the administration argues that no  
matter what the Fed does, the buyback plan for reducing the 
national debt will mean interest rates would be lower than they 
would be without the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Can any individual holder of government securities, such as  
Treasury bonds, sell them and get some quick cash? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Yes. But any individual holder of a government security can  
do that now by participating in what is known as the secondary 
market for Treasury securities, where billions of dollars in 
Treasury bills, notes and bonds change hands every day. Brokerage 
houses handle trades for small investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's buybacks will be handled by so-called primary  
dealers -- one of three dozen or so banks and investment houses that 
are authorized to buy and sell government securities. But the 
primary dealers will make their purchases from the secondary 
market, thus increasing the demand for securities being offered for 
sale by small investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What impact could this have on personal investment decisions?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Reduced debt tends to lower interest rates for bonds, which  
could make stocks seem like a more attractive return for investors. 
That would be similar to the forces that have helped in recent 
years to fuel the current long-running bull market in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What is the likelihood that a buyback would happen soon?  
</P>
<P>
	A: It's hard to tell. The Treasury Department's proposal --  
laying out the rules that would guide buying back securities -- will 
soon be open to a 60-day comment period. At that time, members of 
the public and industry will have a chance to weigh in on the plan. 
The department, after digesting these comments, hopes to adopt a 
final set of rules by January. However, the department has not made 
a decision on when the buyback would occur after the rules are in 
place.

<HEADLINE> Will Vikings' AWOL Rookie Return? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood's agent said Thursday  
he still didn't know where the AWOL rookie was hiding out but held 
out hope that his troubled client would return to the Minnesota 
Vikings' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green, however, sounded as though the first-round  
pick might not be welcomed back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once a guy walks out, I don't think you'll find another player  
on this team that can count on the guy regardless of what the 
situation was,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State and the 29th pick in the NFL draft, mysteriously vanished 
after his first pro practice Monday, walking out of his dorm and 
catching a cab out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologetically called his Chicago-based agent, Craig Domann,  
24 hours later saying he'd needed to tend to a family crisis and 
was on his way back to camp to meet with Green, who would decide 
whether to take him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract on  
Sunday, hadn't returned by Thursday, and the team, which was able 
to freeze all but about $27,000 of the approximately $543,000 
after-taxes bonus wired to Underwood's bank account in Milwaukee, 
was contemplating its next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann faxed The Associated Press a statement on Thursday  
afternoon that said all attempts to locate Underwood had been 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deeply regretted not seeking permission from Coach Dennis  
Green and the Vikings before he left, but he felt the situation 
demanded immediate action,'' Underwood's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I join everyone involved in this matter in emphasizing  
that the verification of Dimitrius' safety and well being is of 
utmost importance. Even though the specific reasons for his 
departure are not yet known, I can assure you that Dimitrius would 
never knowingly hurt his family, coaches and teammates by his 
unexcused absence. I remain hopeful that he is OK and I am 
confident that you will see Dimitrius in camp and ready to play 
soon,'' Domann added. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann said his client was eager to play for the Vikings, among  
the favorites for the Super Bowl this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dimitrius' dream is to play in the NFL. ... He has been  
looking forward to playing for Coach Green and he has been treated 
more than fairly by the entire Vikings organization,'' Domann said. 
``I ask that Coach Green and the Vikings continue to be patient and 
understanding with my client until such point when more facts 
become available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann also added that ``all speculation that Dimitrius intended  
to simply take the Vikings money and not play football is totally 
inaccurate and erroneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann negotiated a five-year, $5.3 million deal for Underwood  
on Sunday, including a partially deferred $1,725,000 signing bonus. 
Before taxes, Underwood got half the bonus, or $862,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said he still hadn't heard from Underwood on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't worry about it once he left, to be honest with you,''  
Green said. ``I think other people kind of misinterpreted what our 
football team is about. I think everybody has been here long enough 
to understand that only a certain type of player can play on this 
football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings were originally under the impression they had to  
make a decision on Underwood's status by Sunday. But the league 
says the team has many options. It could either cut its ties and 
recoup its money, leave him on the active-left squad list or place 
him on the reserve-left squad list. The Vikings also could keep him 
on their roster.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Air Bag Rules Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Transportation says it will  
need six more months before issuing regulations on advanced air 
bags in new cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rule, one of the most complex in the department's  
history, is intended to prevent deaths caused by air bags that 
inflate in low-speed crashes while saving hundreds more lives by 
improving the bag's performance in high-speed crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Issued last September, the proposed rule called for an array of  
new federal tests for air bags that included crash tests at 
different speeds and child and female dummies as well as the 
traditional male dummies. 
</P>
<P>
	The final regulation was due to be issued this September by the  
department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But a 
transportation bill enacted last year allows the department an 
extra six months, until March 2000, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater wrote Tuesday to Sen.  
John McCain, R-Ariz., author of the provision requiring the 
timetable, that he had ``determined that we must extend the date 
for issuing the final rule'' until March. The department released 
the letter Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater's letter also said the department would issue a  
``supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking,'' a document intended 
to either narrow the department's earlier broad proposal on air 
bags or clarify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have criticized the proposal for being too ambitious,  
pushing the industry through a lot of new testing designed to get 
greater benefits from air bags while also trying to prevent deaths 
from the inflating devices. Automakers have argued the agency 
should concentrate first on eliminating deaths caused by air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflating air bags have been blamed for 141 deaths since 1990 --  
mostly to child passengers or short female drivers in low-speed 
accidents they otherwise should have survived, according to NHTSA.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department announced this morning  
that new claims for unemployment insurance rose by 4,000 to 279,000 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department will announce second-quarter productivity  
numbers at 10 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday, the Commerce Department announced that orders to  
factories, bolstered by higher demand for autos and electronic 
equipment, rose 0.7 percent in June in a fresh sign of recovery for 
the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
	This 10th increase in the last 13 months followed a 1 percent  
gain in May, the Commerce Department said. Many analysts expected 
factory orders to rise by 0.4 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the factory sector continues to show signs of a  
jagged recovery, but it appears to be on an improving path,'' said 
economist Lynn Reaser with Bank of America Private Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in orders for autos and car parts more than offset a  
decrease in demand for airplane and aircraft parts and contributed 
to a 2.3 percent increase in orders for all transportation products 
in June. That was down from a hefty 9.9 percent gain the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders  
still would have risen a solid 0.5 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are surprisingly good,'' said National Association  
of Manufacturers economist Gordon Richards, adding that factory 
orders are running 4.1 percent higher than in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, the  
category that includes household appliances and communications 
equipment, rose 2.4 percent in June following a drop of 0.9 percent 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain in June factory orders came despite a steep,  
5.1 percent decrease in orders for industrial machinery and 
equipment, the sector that includes computers. It was the second 
straight monthly decline. In May, orders for industrial machinery 
fell 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the U.S. manufacturers are gradually recovering  
from a global financial crisis, which dampened overseas demand for 
U.S. goods and increased competition from a flood of cheaper 
imports. Since March 1998, about 488,000 manufacturing jobs have 
been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported  
Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the 
sixth straight month, but not as strongly as most analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's report also offered some positive signs for the  
steel industry. Orders for primary metals, the category that 
includes steel, rose 0.4 percent in June, following gains in April 
and May. The steel industry has been one of the hardest hit by the 
Asian crisis, suffering from a flood of cheaper imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at  
least three years -- also went up in June, rising 0.4 percent. It 
was the 10th increase in the last 13 months. And, orders for 
nondurable goods, such as food and fuel also increased, posting a 
1.2 percent gain, following a 0.9 percent gain in May.

<HEADLINE> No Answers in BP Amoco Cancer Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Six workers at a BP Amoco research  
center probably got deadly brain cancer from their jobs, company 
officials said Thursday, citing a two-year study that dismissed any 
work connection to other ill employees and left many questions 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	While the investigation will continue, officials acknowledged  
that the most intensive efforts to solve the decade-long medical 
mystery at the oil giant's suburban Chicago center have ended 
without identifying any specific cause for the malignant brain 
tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we know today is that six of our colleagues have been  
affected with brain cancer and there's a pattern that appears to be 
work-related,'' said Jim Lowry, head of the company's health 
investigation task force. ``And we will continue to study; we will 
continue to look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for former employees and surviving relatives who are  
suing the company said they hadn't yet received the report by 
investigators from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and 
Johns Hopkins University. But some expressed disappointment that 
the report didn't go further and suggested the company was dragging 
its feet because it is reluctant to admit responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're concluding about the (brain cancer) cases is  
probably less strong than what my experts concluded a year ago,'' 
said attorney Marios Karayannis, whose father Nick was among the 
Amoco researchers killed by a malignant tumor. ``It becomes 
troubling that they took another year to come up with such a 
vanilla report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of 21  
people, some with malignant brain tumors, others with non-cancerous 
tumors in their heads and still others with different types of 
cancer. The lawsuits allege workers were exposed to numerous 
neurotoxins -- elements that poison the central nervous system -- 
because of inadequate ventilation and lax safety. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has spent millions investigating and hiring experts to  
determine what, if anything, in the workplace caused the tumors. 
The research looked at more than 6,000 chemicals or agents used by 
researchers and made detailed comparisons of their work histories, 
but found no likely suspects for the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the victims at the heart of the case had the same type of  
cancer, known as glioma, and were all longtime employees who 
``crossed paths'' at the center's chemical research complex in the 
mid-'70s and the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``So there's a very strong pattern there,'' said Dr. Michael  
Wells, the company's chief epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the men have died.  
</P>
<P>
	The research didn't find any work relation to employees with  
benign brain tumors, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' attorneys said they would press forward now with their  
lawsuits but held out the hope that the company might be ready to 
settle cases involving the glioma victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go talk to those families and find out what  
they need,'' said Amoco spokeswoman Vicki J. Kastory. ``We are 
going to share their financial burden. What I don't know is what 
that means in terms of dollars and cents.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines, Pentagon Agree on Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six major U.S. airlines and the Pentagon today  
signed an agreement under which the airlines will check the safety 
of foreign partners who help them fly American troops overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, growing out of a 1985 charter crash in  
Newfoundland that killed 248 U.S. soldiers, should also help 
prevent commercial passengers from ending up on foreign carriers 
with substandard safety records. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. airlines plan to certify that they have processes for  
ensuring safety, that they have trained safety inspectors and that 
their flight crews get training through manuals that meet 
international flight safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the airlines and the military announced the  
agreement during a news conference at the Air Transport 
Association, a trade group that represents the major U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a process that is really win-win,'' said Carol  
Hallett, president of the ATA. ``Win-Win for the government, for 
the employees of the U.S. government who travel on (foreign) 
partners, but for us as well to have the assurance that we can give 
to DoD (the Defense Department) of the quality of service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of foreign carriers has become an issue for U.S.  
airlines because many of them now have partnerships with overseas 
airlines known as ``code-shares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under such an arrangement, the carriers buy tickets on each  
other's planes and then sell them to passengers on connecting 
flights as if they were their own. Under those circumstances, a 
passenger with a United Airlines ticket, for example, may fly on a 
United plane to New York and then transfer for a flight to Europe 
with the airline's German partner, Lufthansa, even though the 
ticket still reads ``United'' and has a United flight number. 
</P>
<P>
	Both carriers have excellent safety records, and airlines favor  
such partnerships because it allows them to project the image of a 
larger route network. It also gives passengers the ability to make 
seamless connections between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, however, Delta Air Lines halted it code-sharing  
arrangement with Korean Air after the Asian carrier suffered a 
cargo plane crash in China -- the latest in a series of fatal 
accidents or aircraft losses for Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta had said previously that it would not team up with an  
airline it deemed unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has a travel budget of $1.2 billion per year, and  
has used its clout to push the airlines into taking visible steps 
to assure the safety of foreign partners who might carry U.S. 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has placed a renewed emphasis on troop safety since  
the 1985 crash, in which an Arrow Air DC-8 carrying soldiers from 
the 101st Airborne Division crashed on takeoff after a refueling 
stop in Gander, Newfoundland. The troops were returning to Fort 
Campbell, Ky., after a six-month peacekeeping mission in the Sinai 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was later blamed on wing icing, although some  
relatives suspect terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Transportation Department, which must  
approve code-shares, is considering changing its policies so it can 
directly weigh the quality of the foreign airline partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Under existing rules, the department looks only at the safety  
standards of the country where the foreign carrier is based, not at 
the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's inspector general is also analyzing whether  
existing code-share policy adequately assesses foreign airline 
safety.

<HEADLINE> New England's Top Jockey Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The top jockey in New England underwent surgery  
Thursday after a career-threatening racing accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Baez, 49, did not move after falling from his horse shortly  
after the start of the second race Wednesday at Rockingham Park in 
Salem, N.H. He was taken to a hospital in Methuen, Mass., then 
airlifted to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The result of Baez's surgery was not immediately known,  
according to Rockingham Park spokeswoman Lynne Snierson. Baez was 
listed in serious condition, Snierson said. His injuries are not 
believed to be life-threatening, the Boston Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred when Baez's horse, Gaitor Bait, clipped the  
heels of the horse in front of him as the field began to crowd 
shortly after coming out of the gate. The horse fell along the 
rail, sending Baez headlong onto the track. 
</P>
<P>
	No other riders or horses went down. Gaitor Bait was uninjured.  
</P>
<P>
	Track officials reviewed tapes of the race but there were no  
disqualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez, a native of the Dominican Republic, lives in Wakefield  
with his wife and three children. He started riding when he was 13 
years old and has ridden in 28,000 races, winning more than 4,800. 
</P>
<P>
	He has won numerous jockey titles at both Rockingham and Suffolk  
Downs in Boston since the mid-1980s. Baez is ranked sixth in the 
nation based on the number of races won. On Sunday, he won the 
$100,000 Spicy Living Stakes in Rockingham, riding a horse named 
Lambana.

<HEADLINE> Discovery Channel To Cover Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Discovery Network plans three hours of live  
television coverage next Wednesday of something mom warned you 
never to look at directly -- a solar eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable channel's cameras will follow the 60-mile wide path  
where the sun is totally obscured by the moon, from its start in 
southern England, through France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, 
Romania to the Middle East and its conclusion in India. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the most extensive live coverage of any event in  
Discovery's 15-year history and, the network believes, the first 
time TV has followed an eclipse in such detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Eclipse coverage runs from 6 to 9 a.m. EDT, with an hour-long  
wrapup that night at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human beings have always been totally enthralled by  
eclipses,'' said Discovery general manager Mike Quattrone, ``but if 
you wanted to see an eclipse, you had to be geographically lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People shouldn't stare at the sun because there's a risk of eye  
damage, but cameras can safely capture an eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will do more than beam three hours of the sun. It will  
explain the science behind the eclipse and show how people in each 
country react to it. The network hopes to climax its coverage with 
an arresting image of the eclipse over the Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will pull its coverage together with the help of  
Discovery Europe and a dozen European TV affiliates. British 
broadcaster Mary Nightingale will be the host. 
</P>
<P>
	The last total solar eclipse in the mainland United States took  
place in 1979. Discovery has time to make plans for the next one -- 
it comes on Aug. 21, 2017.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Says Reform Rumor Hurts Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan accused political opponents of  
spreading rumors that he is bolting the Republican Party, saying 
Thursday that the reports could damage his presidential campaign in 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know how it comes out, `Buchanan to bolt the GOP.' Someone  
is pushing this story ... and the purpose is to suppress my vote,'' 
he said in a telephone interview between campaign stops in Iowa 
before a critical pre-election contest next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he did not deny that joining the Reform Party is a  
consideration. ``I can't,'' he said. ``It wouldn't be truthful. 
I've been talking to people for five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press, citing sources close to Buchanan's  
campaign and the Reform Party, reported Wednesday that the former 
Nixon White House aide was considering the departure. The 
associates said Buchanan hadn't determined whether to leave the 
GOP, and wouldn't make up his mind until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A major factor in his decision will be his showing in Iowa's  
Aug. 14 straw poll, an informal contest that tests the 
organizational strength of GOP presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts said Republican activists may be less likely  
to support Buchanan because of the attention given to his 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's pretty decimating to his campaign,'' said Tom  
Cope, a GOP legislative aide in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not helpful,'' said Steve Roberts, a Des Moines lawyer  
and national party leader. But he said it's too early to tell 
whether there is lasting damage, because many Buchanan supporters 
are loyal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some Buchanan people will go (to the straw poll)  
because he has said he wants them there,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Buchanan questioned the timing of the AP story  
-- saying he has been a longtime critic of the GOP establishment and 
third-party officials have talked to him in the past. ``Here this 
old familiar rumor runs one week before the straw vote. That's no 
coincidence, comrade,'' the candidate said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why a GOP voter should support him Aug. 14, even as he  
considers leaving the party, Buchanan said, ``I considered this and 
I've gone Republican. That's why we're doing well. I'm currently 
focused on the straw poll and the Iowa caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying the key word is ``currently,'' associates say Buchanan is  
focused on the GOP primary -- for now. But he has allowed his 
sister, Bay Buchanan, to talk with allies in the Reform Party in 
the event he becomes convinced he cannot win the nomination -- or at 
least get his voice heard on issues such as trade and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, the lifelong Republican may not have the stomach for  
abandoning his party, the associates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan accused the campaign of millionaire Steve Forbes of  
spreading rumors of his departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers out in western Iowa -- three or four people who are  
working for Mr. Forbes -- are calling around saying, `Pat is going 
to the third party,''' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the rumors are damaging, he said: ``Of course. It's  
designed to suppress your vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col denied any involvement by  
his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Pat should stay in the Republican Party. We  
need Pat in the Republican Party,'' Dal Col said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment was echoed throughout the Republican  
establishment. Party leaders fear the populist conservative would 
take GOP voters with him to the Reform Party, if he goes, and hurt 
the GOP nominee in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that he wouldn't leave the Republican Party,''  
said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the party's presidential 
front-runner. ``This is I presume entirely speculative. The last I 
heard he was going to stay in the Republican Party and I hope he 
does.''

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Top Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at the most of nation's biggest retailers  
rose to better-than-expected levels in July, with hot weather and 
the economy's continued strength giving Americans incentive to 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Warmer-than-normal weather through much of the country sent  
consumers heading to the stores both to escape the heat and buy 
seasonal items such as air conditioners, inflatable pools and 
bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong July sales reported today followed big gains the  
prior two months. As a result, Wall Street analysts expect to see 
very strong second-quarter profits when retailers begin to report 
earnings next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, rose 
4.5 percent in July. It rose 6.3 percent in June and 5.4 percent in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``July, for the most part, met and exceeded what we had  
expected,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of the consulting firm 
Barnard's Retail Trend Report, based in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``A 
lot of Americans feel wealthy and feel that they are entitled to 
spend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a stunning year for retailers, who have benefited  
greatly from a surprisingly resilient U.S. economy with low 
unemployment and tame inflation. That's helped consumers remain 
confident about their finances and ability to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department reported that the number  
of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 
4,000 last week to 279,000 after falling to its lowest level in two 
years the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	Many merchants have been worried borrowing and spending would  
slow following the Federal Reserve's decision on June 30 to boost 
interest rates as a preemptive strike against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the Fed action has unsettled investors and weighed  
down the stock market, consumers were apparently unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rising in interest rates encouraged the stock market to be  
more cautious,'' said Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst at Bank of 
America Securities in San Francisco. ``But the consumer economy is 
still roaring and we don't see a signals yet that the consumer is 
shying away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in July were the discount chains, as shoppers  
turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart for a wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also faring well were specialty clothing chains the Limited and  
Ann Taylor, and Federated Department Stores, which includes the 
Bloomingdale's and Macy's chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Even J.C. Penney, which has been struggling in recent months,  
reported surprising sales gains last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers often use July as a clearance month to unload summer  
merchandise. But since sales have topped estimates in the last few 
months, merchants didn't have much stock to clear out at reduced 
prices. That bodes well for second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the Limited and a few other retailers have said their  
quarterly profits will top Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	One weak spot in July was the Gap, which is typically one of the  
strongest apparel merchants. Analysts cited a deliberate delay in 
the introduction of fall merchandise and noted that that weakness 
in the Gap chain offset a solid showing from Banana Republic and 
Old Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported that sales  
from stores open at least a year rose 9.6 percent compared with 
July 1998, while total sales rose 16.3 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected figures on July's sales at leading retail chains:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears, same-store sales up 0.9 percent, total sales down 3.4  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart, same-store sales up 3.8 percent, total sales up 6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney, same-store department store sales up 4.1 percent;  
same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 8 percent; total sales up 
8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson, same-store sales up 3.3 percent, total sales up  
8.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated, same-store sales up 4.7 percent, total sales up 15.7  
percent. Federated's total sales include revenues from the Internet 
and catalog seller Fingerhut, which was acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores, same-store sales up 1.9 percent, total  
sales up 6.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited, same-store sales up 7 percent, total sales up 7  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap, same-store sales up 2 percent, total sales up 22 percent.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Los Alamos Probe 'Flawed' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI investigation of a Los Alamos weapons  
scientist was plagued by errors, poor judgment and delays that 
probably doomed the case, two senators said Thursday in releasing a 
report on the three-year inquiry into the theft of nuclear secrets 
by China. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee said the  
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, had signed a waiver allowing his computer to 
be searched, but top FBI officials and Justice Department lawyers 
did not learn of it until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the FBI and Justice Department wrangled for three  
years over whether a search could be conducted. When the computer 
was finally examined earlier this year, it was found that Lee had 
shifted thousands of super-secret weapons codes into an unsecured 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's investigation was not a comedy of errors, but  
a tragedy of errors,'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., the 
committee's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the committee chairman, said the  
investigation was ``beset by communications failures and poor 
judgment'' and that Attorney General Janet Reno for the most part 
``was out of the loop'' despite the issue's importance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman agreed that Reno, who was briefed informally about the  
Lee case in August 1997, should have been more involved. Thompson 
said he found it ``remarkable'' that FBI Director Louis Freeh 
didn't call the attorney general and try to resolve the dispute 
over whether Lee's computer could be searched. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno issued a statement in which she acknowledged the Senate  
report ``raised several important issues'' about the handling of 
the Lee investigation. She said she wished the question of 
examining Lee's computer had been brought to her attention after it 
was reviewed by senior department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, she said, she still believes the decision not to  
seek permission from a special court to examine the computer 
``based on the information presented at that time was the right 
one.'' She said the concern was to ``balance the needs of national 
security against an individual's civil liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House and Senate conferees approved as part of a  
final $288.8 billion defense spending bill a provision to create a 
new semiautonomous agency within the Energy Department to deal with 
nuclear weapons programs including the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Nuclear Security Administration would still be  
under the energy secretary but largely control its own budget. The 
administration earlier had expressed concerns about some aspects of 
the reorganization, raising the possibility of a veto. However, it 
was not clear late Thursday whether those issues had been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has said he would go along with  
a new agency, but only if it did not weaken the authority of the 
energy secretary and leave security and counterintelligence 
responsibilities outside the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Taiwan, was  
fired last March on security grounds after he had been under 
investigation by the FBI since 1996 on suspicion that he provided 
China with secret information about the sophisticated W-88 nuclear 
warhead, a mainstay of America's nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	His transfer of computer codes was not discovered until after he  
was dismissed on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Not charged with any crime, Lee has emphatically denied giving  
nuclear secrets to China or anyone else and in a recent television 
interview complained he had been singled out because of his ethnic 
background. The investigation into Lee's activities continues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate report provided some details on how Lee was targeted  
by the FBI in 1996 and for the first time disclosed that the agency 
had other suspects but never pursued them. 
</P>
<P>
	When informed in 1995 that W-88 warhead secrets probably had  
been obtained by China, the FBI used a so-called ``matrix 
analysis'' that focused on anyone at Los Alamos where the warhead 
was developed, anyone who had traveled to China and anyone who had 
contact with Chinese scientists visiting the lab in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Wen Ho Lee met all three criteria -- and also raised other  
concerns -- investigators told the Senate committee in two closed 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lieberman said the failure to cast a wider net to other  
facilities and not to investigate the other Los Alamos suspects 
hurt the FBI's case. ``This investigation was flawed from the 
start,'' he said at a news conference, adding that secrets about 
the W-88 warhead were available at places other than the Los Alamos 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Other suspects met the FBI matrix in that they had access to the  
secret information at Los Alamos, traveled to China and had 
contacts with visiting Chinese scientists. But they were never 
investigated in detail, although some were questioned earlier this 
year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was particularly interested in Lee and his wife, Sylvia,  
who also had worked at the Los Alamos lab. Both had gone out of 
their way to make contact with visiting Chinese delegations. And 
Lee twice previously had caught the FBI's attention, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once such contact involving an incident in the early 1980s had  
previously been reported, but the Senate panel disclosed the FBI 
also questioned Lee in the early 1990s -- before concern about the 
W-88 warhead surfaced -- in connection with another security matter. 
Details remained classified.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Sign Cheaney to 3-Year Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Celtics continued a busy week of  
dealing, signing free agent guard Calbert Cheaney to a three-year 
pact Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing comes two days after Boston shipped guard Ron Mercer  
to the Denver Nuggets in a six-player swap. Cheaney signed with 
Boston after turning down a sign-and-trade deal that would have 
sent him to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics coach Rick Pitino didn't commit to inserting Cheaney in  
his starting lineup, but said the six-year veteran, who played 
forward and guard for the Washington Wizards last season, would 
help fill the hole left by Mercer at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to give us the necessary leadership and ability to  
make the playoffs next season,'' Pitino said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaney, 28, played in all 50 Wizards games, starting in 18. He  
averaged 7.7 points per game while shooting 41.4 percent from the 
field. His best season as a pro was in 1994-1995, when he averaged 
16.6 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaney said he was confused about the direction Washington was  
headed, and decided to shop his services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was time for a change,'' he said. ``The last two or  
three seasons were disappointing for me. It was time for a fresh 
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He backed out of he Miami deal because of what he called ``a gut  
instinct'' and said Boston's young squad and his respect for Pitino 
were key factors in his decision to sign with the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaney was drafted sixth overall by Washington in the 1993 NBA  
draft after a standout career at Indiana, where he finished as the 
Big Ten's all time leading scorer and was selected The Associated 
Press 1993 College Player of the year.

<HEADLINE> Cross Burners Must Watch `Amistad' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDWARDSVILLE, Ill (AP) -- Four men who burned a cross in a black  
family's yard have been ordered to take racial sensitivity training 
that will include watching films like ``Schindler's List'' and 
``Amistad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Lawrence Keshner on Wednesday also ordered the men to  
participate in a special college program on cultural and social 
diversity and to write letters of apology to family they terrorized 
in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first reaction was to lock you up and throw the key away,''  
Keshner said during sentencing. But he said the men showed remorse 
and a willingness to be rehabilitated. ``It's time to heal,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men -- Steven Horvath, 20, and Ryan Burns, 19, of  
Edwardsville; Darren Burgess, 30, of Glen Carbon; and Scott Davis, 
20, of St. Jacob -- have said they were drunk when they burned the 
cross on the front lawn of Keith Ellis' and Antonia Valentine's 
home. The couple and their two children have since moved away from 
the area in southwest Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their sentence, the men must also pay $500 each into  
an educational trust fund for the couple's daughter, attend 
counseling and perform 100 hours of public service at an annual 
summer festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Keshner also sentenced each man to 2 1/2 years probation. They  
could face up to two years in prison if they fail to complete their 
tasks, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four had been charged with, among other offenses, felony  
hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- No nerve-fraying penalty kicks or  
shirt-ripping celebrations this time. This was another women's 
soccer team from the United States, doing things its own way and 
enjoying it just as much. 
</P>
<P>
	And now the U.S. 18-and-under team has something in common with  
its sisters from the World Cup: a championship. In fact, a gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Reddick went solo, scoring after a series of  
magnificent moves in the first half, and goalie Hope Solo had an 
act of her own Thursday as the United States edged Mexico 1-0 in 
the Pan American Games final. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World Cup team was pressing on for the gold and they got  
it. You set your standards so high to be like them,'' Reddick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the World Cup is in my future. It's my goal right  
now. The Pan Ams is the biggest game of all of our lives right now. 
It's so special, right after the World Cup to live up to what they 
did. It's such a great experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Goldstein of Rockville, Md., won an all-American final in  
men's tennis, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 over Cecil Mamiit of Los Angeles. Maria 
Vento of Venezuela defeated Tara Snyder of Houston for the women's 
crown, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's basketball team can do no better than a bronze  
medal after falling to Cuba for the second time, 87-78. It was an 
improvement from a 95-64 loss in the preliminary round. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've come a million miles,'' U.S. coach Nell Fortner said  
of her team, which was put together just two weeks before the 
games. ``I just wish we could have hit a few more shots against 
that zone defense and maybe it's a different outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba plays Canada for the gold. The hosts upset Brazil 56-54.  
</P>
<P>
	Games records by Staciana Stitts of Carlsbad, Calif., and Karen  
Campbell of Kalamazoo, Mich., gave the beleaguered U.S. women's 
swimming team a major boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Stitts, 17, smashed the Pan Ams record in the 100-meter  
breaststroke with a time of 1:09.16. Kristen Woodring of Sinking 
Springs, Pa., got the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, 22, a black belt in taekwondo, shattered the record in  
the 100 butterfly in the preliminaries in 59.70, then won the final 
in 1:00.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which has dominated the men's races, added two more  
golds for a total of five, and Canada won the other men's final. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States now has 235 medals, 87 gold, followed by  
Canada with 149, 49 gold. Cuba has 122, 53 gold. 
</P>
<P>
	In soccer, Reddick, a 17-year-old high school senior from  
Birmingham, Ala., chest-trapped the ball near midfield, dribbled 
about 40 yards, juked two defenders in front of the penalty area 
and then drove a right-footed shot high over Mexican goalie Linny 
Quinones in the 26th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw I had a shot and said, `Please go in.' And it went in,''  
Reddick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solo and the Americans' defense made it last. Solo, who plays at  
the University of Washington, was unscored upon in the three 
matches she started. Her fully extended block of a shot by Iris 
Mora in the 53rd minute and her diving stop of a shot in the 
penalty area by Fatima Leyva in the 87th preserved the U.S. lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The American soccer team bowed in a chorus line after its  
victory and took a lap around the field after getting the gold 
medals. The United States, tied by Mexico 1-1 in the preliminary 
round for its only blemish, outscored its opponents 22-2 in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our own expectations, because we are a different  
team,'' Solo said. ``We are not the USA team, not the World Cup 
team. So we had to establish our own expectations and distinguish 
ourselves. And it wasn't just because they won. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they intrigued us and they inspired us.''  
</P>
<P>
	Two American boxers won and three lost in the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
	Super heavyweight Davin King moved into the final against Cuba's  
Alexis Rubalcaba by shutting out Argentina's Manuel Azar 4-0. Jose 
Navarro of Los Angeles won his flyweight bout when he outpointed 
Daniel Ponce of Mexico 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Featherweight Aaron Torres lost a defensive match with Zayas  
Younan of Canada 2-1. Light welterweight Corey Bernard was beaten 
10-4 by Kleson Pinto of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnell Wilson lost 9-8 to Cuban star Jorge Gutierrez. The bout  
was tied 7-7, then Wilson took a one-point lead. Gutierrez tied it 
and scored a winning punch in the final 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows me how far I have come,'' said Wilson, who gets a  
bronze medal. ``There are a lot of boxers leaving here with 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalberto Aranda of Cuba set the world record in the clean and  
jerk for the 77 kilogram division. Aranda lifted 205.5 kilograms 
(453 pounds) to break the record of 205.0 (452 pounds) set by 
Armenian Khachatur Kyapanaktsyan on Jan. 1, 1998 in La Coruna, 
Spain. Aranda won the gold.

 *School meets Muslim's request    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The University of Health Sciences in Kansas  
City, Mo., has agreed to admit an unnamed Muslim applicant who had 
requested on religious grounds that she be physically examined only 
by other female students. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was announced by the Council on American-Islamic  
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	In her application to the osteopathic college, the woman said  
she was willing to examine male students but contended it was not 
educationally necessary that she be examined by men. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim council said the school originally denied her  
request, citing the need for a ``full educational experience.'' It 
reversed that decision after the council intervened. 
</P>

	The council explained that Islam permits medical personnel to  
treat patients of both sexes if necessary, but same-gender 
treatment is preferred.

 *Married priests nudge Catholic stance    	
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- ``We are still priests and we are still called to  
minister,'' said Ed Minderlein, 55, one of 200 men from 15 
countries attending a meeting of the International Federation of 
Married Catholic Priests. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation members challenge the church's celibacy rule imposed  
in the 12th century. Despite regular rebukes from the Vatican and 
Pope John Paul II, they plan to continue their campaign in the hope 
that the next pope will consider changing the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Catholic canon law, one who is ordained remains a priest  
for life. But a priest who marries generally forfeits his good 
standing in the eyes of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Married priests are still allowed to perform some sacraments --  
last rites, baptism, confirmation, and confession -- but only when 
no other priest is available. They also can perform marriages that 
are legal but not recognized by the church. Facing a shortage of 
priests, some bishops have resorted to their services on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic Church allows married priests in Eastern Rite  
countries. In the West, it has accepted married priests who convert 
from the Episcopal Church and in other special cases. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the conservative Catholic League said those who  
left the priesthood ignored church law and ``ought to be spending 
more time understanding themselves and explaining the reasons for 
these church teachings rather than actually opposing them.''

 *Antidote for road rage?    	
</P>
<P>
	UNITY VILLAGE, Mo. (AP) -- Combining soft-sell evangelism with  
practical help, the Unity School of Christianity hopes to combat 
road rage by selling a soothing audiotape and CD recording to 
listen to while driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The script for ``The Peaceful Driver'' by Allen Liles, a Unity  
minister and outreach official, combines safe driving tips (don't 
use cell phones), inspirational commentary (``I am too important to 
be drawn into any negative situation or reaction. I am a forgiving 
person ...'') and spiritual exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aggressive driving is already a serious problem and getting  
worse,'' Liles says. ``The idea is to change the way a driver 
approaches the entire process of relating to other drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Unity School, founded by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore in  
1889, teaches spiritual and physical healing through ``affirmative 
prayer'' but, unlike Christian Science, recognizes the reality of 
matter, sin and sickness. The related Association of Unity Churches 
reports 695 local groups in the United States with 189,000 
adherents.

	DETROIT (AP) -- At least one worshipper anted up with casino  
chips when the collection plate was passed at the Most Holy Trinity 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The church is about 300 feet from the new MGM Grand Detroit  
Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Russell Kohler wouldn't say what the chips are worth.  
``Lets just call it a pile.'' He planned to cash them in and use 
the money for poor people served by his church. 
</P>
<P>
	To play casino games, a gambler buys chips and tokens in  
denominations of 25 cents to $100 or more. They can be exchanged 
for cash by anyone at the casino. In Las Vegas, some cab drivers 
accept chips.

<HEADLINE> Group Says Patent Bill Harms Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Name-brand drug makers say it would help them  
invest in developing new medicines, but a consumer group says the 
poor, sick and elderly would be hurt by a bill that would extend 
patents on seven drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would delay generic drug manufacturers from  
making cheaper versions of the medications, Howard Metzenbaum, a 
former Democratic senator from Ohio who represents the Consumer 
Federation of America, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is essentially a tax on the uninsured, the poor, the  
sick and the elderly,'' Metzenbaum told the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. ``I strongly urge you to reject it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers of both parties are considering the bill, which  
would let the companies that make the anti-allergy drug Claritin 
and six other prescription drugs petition the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office for three years of additional patent protection. 
</P>
<P>
	It is sponsored in the House by Reps. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., and  
Jim McDermott, D-Wash., and in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Robert 
Torricelli of New Jersey, home to Schering-Plough Corp., which 
makes Claritin. 
</P>
<P>
	The opportunity to petition for three-year extensions goes  
beyond what was afforded under the Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Restoration Act of 1984. That law gave the companies making 
the seven drugs, which were in the pipeline at the time, only 
two-year patent extensions rather than the five years given other 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	When a patent expires, generic drug makers can manufacture  
cheaper versions. Name-brand drug manufacturers say without 
reasonable patent protection, they don't have the revenues needed 
to invest in developing new drugs. Supporters of the legislation 
say Congress has a constitutional duty to foster the research and 
development of new medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fair patent process will help consumers in the short term  
with affordable drugs and in the long term by supporting the 
research that produces new medicines,'' Torricelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has become an expensive legislative fight in Congress  
involving some of Capitol Hill's top lobbyists.

	``Without fair patent protection, we simply could not generate

<HEADLINE> Haze Spreading in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Smoke from hundreds of dry-season  
fires burning in Indonesia was choking regional shipping traffic 
Thursday and has spread far enough to blanket Malaysia's capital in 
a mild haze. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia's worst-hit Riau Province, visibility in the air  
ranged between 500 and 800 yards. Ground visibility was only 100 to 
200 yards, weather officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights to Riau's capital were diverted and residents in many  
areas were advised to stay indoors as much as possible and wear 
masks outdoors. Meanwhile, the haze was slowing shipping traffic 
through the busy Malacca Straits, which separates Singapore and 
Malaysia from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	For four months in 1997, severe smog caused by similar forest  
fires in Indonesia enveloped Southeast Asia, closing down airports 
and schools and leading thousands of people to seek treatment for 
respiratory disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	The haze badly hurt Malaysia's tourism industry that year. To  
avoid scaring away tourists this time, Malaysia will not release 
air pollution levels as it did in 1997 and 1998, a newspaper 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing alarming,'' Environment Minister Law Hieng  
Ding said in the Star newspaper. Publicizing the pollution index 
could drive away tourists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the haze was spreading but the pollution index remained  
below 100. A reading above 100 is considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading Indonesian environmental group is blaming timber  
industries for starting the new rash of fires. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have continued to conduct land clearing with burning  
method because it is cheap and fast,'' said Longgena Ginting, 
forestry program coordinator for the environmental group Walhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Walhi said at least 441 separate fires were burning on the  
Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo.

<HEADLINE> Breast-Feeding Bill Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill headed for congressional approval would  
make clear that breast-feeding is acceptable in public areas of 
national parks and other federal property. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., says her bill is part of a push to  
make breast-feeding, which has been shown to have numerous health 
benefits for children, socially acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unthinkable that women would be stopped from doing the  
most natural thing in the world -- feeding their baby,'' Maloney 
said Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference packed with 
strollers and scampering children. The event was billed as a 
``Lactation Celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the women there was Noel Marie Taylor of Columbia, Md.,  
who said she was shocked during a family outing to the 
Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History when a guard told her to 
stop breast-feeding her child or leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard, she said, told her no food or drink was allowed on  
the premises. 
</P>
<P>
	David Umansky, a spokesman for the Smithsonian Institution, said  
the institution did not prohibit breast-feeding and had no record 
of the incident that Ms. Taylor described. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulette Roberts of Washington, D.C. told of a similar  
experience at the National Gallery in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Ziska, spokeswoman for the National Gallery, said the  
incident was ``probably a misunderstanding.'' She said guards at 
the museum have been told that breast-feeding is permissible. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney said her office had received numerous calls from women  
who say they've been asked to leave federal buildings, including 
the U.S. Capitol, and national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The breast-feeding rights act is contained in appropriations  
bills that have passed in the House of Representatives. The Senate 
is expected to support the legislation as well, Maloney said.

<HEADLINE> Web Investors Still Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A reversal of fortunes for formerly high-flying  
Internet stocks that began as a gradual drip last spring has turned 
into a flood, as a huge selloff in the sector has dragged down 
broader markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround has helped plunge the technology-laden Nasdaq  
Stock Market into a so-called correction, generally defined as a 10 
percent decline from a market's high point. On Wednesday, the 
Nasdaq closed down 11.3 percent from the all-time high reached July 
16 of 2,864.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite early declines, both the Dow Jones industrial average  
and the Nasdaq had pushed back into positive territory. The Dow was 
up 55.41 at 10,730.18 -- still well off its high of 11,209.84 set on 
July 18 -- while the Nasdaq was up 4.06 to 2,544.06 in early 
afternoon trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet company Yahoo! Inc., down as low as $110 at one point,  
had rebounded into positive territory, trading up $3 at $124. 
Service provider America Online Inc. was off its lows of the day, 
though was still down $5.43 3/4 to $82. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered almost invincible early this year, online stocks  
appear to have reached their peak in April, when the luster began 
to wear off for investors. The 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index 
has shed more than 40 percent of its value since it hit an all-time 
high on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pain, investors are snubbing new stock offerings  
from Internet firms. The market for initial public offerings, or 
IPOs, of Internet stocks had seemed virtually bulletproof through 
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the jitters that the declines have spread across  
Wall Street, there are some investors who are welcoming the slump 
as an opportunity to buy these stocks at levels far below the 
astronomical prices of this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like this had to happen, given the large number of  
Internet companies that have filed for IPOs recently. It's 
healthy,'' said Ken Fleming, an analyst with Renaissance Capital 
Corp., a financial research firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying sentiment remains 'come back, come back'  
because people love to believe in the potential of the future, 
especially Americans,'' said Steve Harmon, a San Francisco-based 
Internet analyst and money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, sharp declines are scary for investors who bought  
when stocks were peaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer Amazon.com, for example, hit an all-time high of  
$221.25 April 27. Its price today hovered around $89, a 60 percent 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Henceforth, investors may have to be more choosy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the Internet is here to stay and there will be  
significant survivors. We just don't know who those survivors will 
be,'' said Edmund Cashman, co-head of capital markets for Legg 
Mason Wood Walker, a Baltimore investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding those survivors won't be easy. Cashman noted that the  
stocks of most Internet companies continue to trade at prices that 
have no historical precedence. Traditional methods of placing a 
value on a company's stock have been thrown out the window as 
investors have increasingly gambled solely on an online company's 
potential to earn money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp., which has a  
big online business, have traded recently at a price that's 100 
times the company's annual earnings per share. By comparison, the 
shares of conventional brokerage firms such as Lehman Brothers and 
PaineWebber generally trade at prices that are 15 times the 
company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is even more surreal for the vast majority of  
Internet companies that have recently made their first public 
offering of stock because most of those companies are at high 
levels even though most have never earned a profit, Cashman noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in recent IPOs indicates that investors are  
starting to get selective. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the stocks of four Internet companies sank in their  
debuts on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Prior to Tuesday, of the dozens 
of Internet companies that have completed initial public offerings 
in the last year, just three failed to make gains in their first 
day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this has deterred investors such as Daniel Wang, 44, of  
Basking Ridge, N.J. Wang said he first began investing in the 
sector earlier this year, when many of the stocks were already 
approaching their highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have jumped in earlier,'' he said. ``I believe a few  
years from now, these stocks will be a good investment. There's 
definitely a future in these companies.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Defends Finance Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today denied that  
the Justice Department has kept open campaign finance 
investigations involving Democrats to block Republicans in Congress 
from conducting their own. 
</P>
<P>
	A House committee investigating alleged fund-raising abuses in  
the 1996 presidential election is barred from questioning anyone 
who is a target of an active Justice Department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said today it is ``certainly not true'' that the department  
has marked some probes as ``ongoing'' to thwart the committee's 
work, as was suggested this week in an article by Chicago Sun-Times 
columnist Robert Novak. 
</P>
<P>
	Novak cited an internal Justice Department memo dated June 4  
that said a number of long-dormant investigations involving 
Democratic fund-raisers and donors are marked ``ongoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of any basis for concluding that'' the  
investigations are kept open to prevent other inquiries, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	She would not comment on why the investigations are still open  
and said the memo cited by Novak ``should not have gotten out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee investigating campaign fund raising, has complained 
bitterly that Reno's Justice Department has frustrated his 
investigation in order to protect President Clinton and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was asked whether she planned to comply with a subpoena  
from Burton to turn over a large volume of Justice Department 
documents involving the fund-raising investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she would try to work with the committee, but noted  
potential conflicts in turning over documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are matters relating to pending investigations and  
pending prosecutions in which if we provide information and if it's 
made public can have a dramatic impact on the pending 
investigation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also said prosecutions are a function of the executive  
branch, and ``for Congress to be involved in the management of an 
investigation or a prosecution produces questions about is it being 
handled the right way.''

<HEADLINE> Powlus Rejoins Lions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- Ron Powlus will get another shot  
at becoming a Detroit Lions quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Notre Dame signal caller, released Wednesday when the  
Lions signed Donald Hollas, was called back to training camp 
Thursday night after Hollas, the former Oakland quarterback, left 
without speaking with coach Bobby Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got to see him. He just said he's lost his desire,''  
Ross said Thursday of Hollas. ``He was in a meeting up until about 
11 o'clock (Thursday morning). At 11:05, he was calling our 
administration and telling them he just didn't have the heart for 
it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better to know now than when we line up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ross said he had nothing against Powlus. He said his reason for  
cutting Powlus was that he had wanted the opportunity to look at 
another quarterback, and didn't want to keep five in camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron's back with us, and he's in the hunt, in the  
competition,'' Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, injuries continued to plague the Lions. Defensive  
tackle Henry Taylor had to be carted off the field Thursday after 
someone fell on his leg during a drill. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the Lions' third in two days. On Wednesday, wide  
receiver Herman Moore suffered a hip/groin strain and center Eric 
Beverly hurt his ankle. Both players were redshirted for Thursday's 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the three injuries are serious, and both Beverly and  
Taylor should be back in a couple of days, Ross said. Moore was 
kept out of Thursday's practice strictly as a precaution and could 
resume working out at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions spent the early portion of practice Thursday working  
on their goal-line offense and defense, a drill cut short by 
Taylor's injury. Ross said he scheduled some goal-line scrimmaging 
Saturday, an area where the team could use improvement on both 
sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get better at that,'' Ross said. ``It's not going  
to be anything fancy. We're just going to line up and go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's goal-line drills, the Lions did some 11-on-11  
scrimmaging at midfield. Ross said he was pleased with the passing 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought our quarterbacks threw very well, particularly (Gus)  
Frerotte and Charlie (Batch),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive tackle Aaron Gibson, one of Detroit's two first-round  
draft picks, will fly Monday to Birmingham, Ala., to get another 
opinion on his sore left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Kevin Abrams will continue to rehabilitate his ailing  
foot with a bone stimulator for about two more weeks, and defensive 
tackle Luther Elliss, who had surgery for an eye injury two weeks 
ago, is expected back in three weeks.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Prices Fall Sharply / British Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Share prices fell sharply on the London Stock  
Exchange on Thursday as interest rate concerns on both sides of the 
Atlantic sparked a rush of selling in telecommunications, financial 
and pharmaceutical stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 133.8  
points, or 2.1 percent, to 6,101.6. Provisional volume was a shade 
over 1 billion shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The three big sectors in London displayed concern in thin and  
volatile conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all highly rated stocks which have made a major  
contribution to the market's gains over the course of the year,'' 
James Dewhurst, senior salesman at CCF Charterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	With the market's focus firmly on monetary policy, a British  
policy announcement that interest rates would remain at 5.00 
percent, offered a late morning diversion. Economists said a ``wait 
and see policy'' after four cuts this year seemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. interest rates were a more pressing concern, with many  
commentators looking for a hike at the Federal Reserve's next 
policy meeting on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Dewhurst said Thursday's drop in U.S. second-quarter  
productivity made people nervous, but a strong non-farm payrolls 
report Friday has the potential to cause a big scare.

<HEADLINE> Low Birth Weight Affects Blacks More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black babies die from problems related to low  
birth weight four times as often as white babies, the government 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that black mothers are much more likely to have a low  
birth-weight baby than white mothers and that's primarily what's 
driving this,'' said Dr. Marian MacDorman, author of the report 
released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	If the proportion of underweight births among black mothers  
could be reduced to the level of white mothers, it would cut the 
overall black infant death rate by 16 percent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the latest data available, about 13 percent of black  
babies and 6.5 percent of white babies weighed under 5.5 pounds at 
birth, the CDC reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures show that overall infant mortality continued to  
decline, but black infants still died at more than twice the rate 
of white babies. 
</P>
<P>
	Black mothers fell into high-risk categories more often than  
their white counterparts. They were twice as likely to be 
teen-agers and nearly three times as likely to be unmarried, 
MacDorman said. Black mothers also got slightly less prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Henry Spring, acting deputy commissioner of the New Jersey  
Department of Health, said the death rate disparity between black 
and white infants has existed for as long as such records have been 
kept -- nearly 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no clear answer'' for why this happens, he said, but  
the problem goes beyond ``the common myths of teen pregnancy, 
drugs, and poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare women of equal position, the only difference  
being black or white,'' the higher death rate for black infants 
still exists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yvonne Wesley, director of the Black Infant Mortality Reduction  
and Resource Center, said black mothers are more likely to deliver 
prematurely. Black women suffer more often from an infection called 
bacterial vaginosis that contributes to premature births, she said, 
adding that there is also a more controversial suspect: high stress 
in the lives of black women. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers have pointed to factors such as living in  
high-crime areas and discrimination at work or school. Stress 
raises levels of hormones called corticosteroids that may trigger 
premature labor, Wesley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC report found that for every 1,000 births, nearly 14  
black babies died before age 1, compared with six deaths for white 
or Hispanic infants. For the nation overall, the infant death rate 
was just over seven deaths per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	American Indian babies also had a higher mortality rate, with  
almost nine of every 1,000 dying. Of all the groups surveyed, 
American Indians had the most deaths from Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome, a rate two and a half times that of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian infants were most likely to survive, with only five deaths  
for every 1,000 births. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDorman said the lower Asian death rate might be caused by  
``fewer births to traditionally high-risk'' mothers, such as teens 
and smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the leading causes of death among infants were birth  
defects, low birth-weight disorders and SIDS.

<HEADLINE>  Sotomayor Tests Positive for Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Did Cuban high jump great Javier  
Sotomayor ingest cocaine, as Pan American Games officials found in 
a drug test? Or was he manipulated, as Cuban officials insist? 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said Wednesday it made no difference where the cocaine originated 
or why it was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor reacted with indignation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have only seen that substance in movies,'' he told the Cuban  
Communist Party daily Granma in an interview published today. 
``Only on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials said Sotomayor never took cocaine and charged  
the substance was planted in something he ate or drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible he  
would take this substance,'' said professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, 
director of the orthopedic complex of Cuba. ``He has told us he has 
not taken this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mario Granda of the Cuban medical group added, ``The man is  
completely innocent and we trust him. He said he has not taken a 
banned substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban rhetoric aside, Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor  
record-holder and the only high jumper to clear 8 feet, will be 
suspended for two years, meaning he is ineligible for this month's 
World Track and Field Championships and next year's Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	His absence will leave the sport without one of its most  
recognizable names. Revered by athletes and fans throughout the 
world until now, Sotomayor has fallen from hero to villain. Instead 
of bringing glory and glamour to Cuba, he has brought shame and 
disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor withdrew from Saturday's International High Jump  
Meeting in Eberstadt, Germany, reportedly because of a back injury 
suffered at the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the withdrawal today, meet director Peter Schramm  
said Sotomayor had told him several days ago that the back problem 
may force him to pull out of the Eberstadt event. 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to the Cuban federation to suspend Sotomayor. If the  
Cubans do not suspend him, the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation will. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are expected to appeal the ruling against their most  
respected and popular athlete, who was seen with Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro at a gathering in Matanzas, Cuba, on Tuesday night, honoring 
the country's gold medal-winning baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, Sotomayor drove his red Mercedes into his garage  
and closed the door, and met in his home with Cuban sports 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotomayor case is the biggest drug scandal in track and  
field since Canada's Ben Johnson was suspended and lifted of his 
gold medal after testing positive for an anabolic steroid at the 
1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked. I cannot believe it. I am very surprised and  
upset, because I have great esteem for Sotomayor,'' IAAF president 
Primo Nebiolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won his fourth Pan Ams gold in the high jump last  
Friday, the final day of the track and field competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not name anyone who might have been responsible  
for causing Sotomayor's positive test. And they said they were not 
taking any special precautions to protect their athletes from 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply eating what the rest of the athletes are  
eating,'' Granda said. ``We hope those who manipulated these 
results or enhanced these results or altered the results of a 
person who never took this substance will never do this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said that in doping cases, his group does not 
differentiate a recreational drug such as cocaine from a 
performance-enhancing substance such as a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, it is sanctioned as an infraction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was the third athlete, all gold medalists, to test  
positive at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Vezina, goalie for Canada's in-line roller hockey team,  
was caught using Nandrolone, costing the team its gold medal. Juana 
Rosario Arrendel, winner of the women's high jump and the only gold 
medalist from the Dominican Republic at the games so far, was 
stripped of her medal for using stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ray Martinez, a member of Mexico's baseball team,  
refused to take a drug test, which was tantamount to a positive 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's urine sample showed cocaine in the amount of 200  
parts per million, which would be consistent with a person who uses 
the drug, de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the discovery of cocaine traces indicates the drug would  
have been taken four to five days before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than that, we would not find it,'' he said. ``When we  
find traces of cocaine ... it shows the ingestion was very 
recent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda called Sotomayor a ``complete sports gentleman'' and said  
he was a ``flagbearer for the struggle against doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His dignity is much above and beyond any results given in any  
laboratory,'' Granda said. ``He is an innocent man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor's fourth gold medal ``will be in the  
hearts of all Pan Americans who love you and trust you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gold medals now go to Canada's Kwaku Boateng and Mark  
Boswell, who tied for the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won the 1992 Olympic gold medal, the 1993 and 1997  
world outdoor championships, and the 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1999 
world indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	This was another embarrassment to Cuba's team at the Pan Am  
Games. Eight Cubans have left the delegation, including one 
journalist, with sources close to the team saying at least seven 
plan to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor earned his place in sports history by jumping 8 feet  
at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on July 29, 1989. He improved that record 
to 8-0 1/2 at Salamanca, Spain, on July 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He set the world indoor record of 7-11 1/2 on March 4, 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is considered the best high jumper ever -- better than  
Dick Fosbury, better than Valery Brumel, better than John Thomas. 
No one has accomplished more than the 31-year-old Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor had been tested in more than 60  
competitions, including eight this year, and never tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Winnipeg Convention Center, about 25 protesters  
circled in front of the main entrance, holding signs saying, ``Let 
Cuba Play,'' and ``Pan Am is a sporting event not a political 
event.''

<HEADLINE> Gordon Takes Third Brickyard Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Maybe they named the wrong road after Jeff  
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after celebrating his 28th birthday and having a street in  
nearby Pittsboro, Ind. -- where he spent most of his teen years -- 
named after him, Gordon had another big day on the 2 1/2-mile oval at 
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kid set an Indy stock car qualifying record with a lap of  
179.612 mph, grabbing his third pole in six tries on the track 
where he is the only two-time winner of NASCAR's Brickyard 400. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke the record of 179.394 set last August by Ernie Irvan in  
taking the top spot for Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place,'' Gordon said. ``I love coming here.  
And the fan reaction makes it even more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booed at most other tracks, The Kid is a crowd favorite at Indy,  
and the cheers rang throughout the sprawling track as his 
record-setting lap was announced on the public address system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of people who pull for us here,'' Gordon said.  
``That's one of the things that makes it fun to come here to Indy. 
If I had a home track or a hometown maybe that supported me, it 
probably would be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he enjoyed the reception of the estimated 50,000 people  
scattered throughout the vast grandstands, Gordon said he was 
surprised to be on the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, I'm shocked,'' he said with a smile. ``I knew we  
had a strong car; I just thought we drew too early a number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was fourth of the 55 first-day qualifiers to take to the  
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the one who drew the number, so I just thought I'd have to  
make the most of it,'' he said. ``We were pretty happy with that 
lap, but I really thought somebody would beat me, especially if 
they caught a cloud when they went out. This track is very 
sensitive to temperature changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin was closest to knocking Gordon off the pole, but  
came up well short at 178.941, followed by surprising David Green -- 
matching his best career start -- with a lap of 178.902, series 
points leader Dale Jarrett at 178.859 and Michael Waltrip at 
178.816. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has won the last two Winston Cup titles and three of  
the last four, is having a disappointing year -- for him. Despite 
winning four races -- matching Jeff Burton for the season high -- and 
leading the series with seven poles, he is a distant sixth in the 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of his problems have been mechanical and have kept him from  
finishing five of the 19 races in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think really our thought process right now is to try not to  
have failures and problems that have kept us behind and put us 
where we are now,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said there's no big secret why Gordon is so good at Indy.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a better driver than at least most of us, if not all of  
us,'' Martin said. ``I think he drives a better car than most of 
us, if not all of us. Put that all together and that's a hard 
combination to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt, another fan favorite and the 1995 Brickyard  
winner, was third from last in line and came up with a lap of 
177.791 that was good enough for 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 locked in starting positions in the 43-car field,  
with the rest of the drivers getting another opportunity to improve 
their qualifying speeds on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Waltrip, who made it official earlier Thursday that he  
will retire from the cockpit after a season-long farewell tour in 
2000, followed Earnhardt onto the track with the knowledge that he 
must qualify among the top 36 or fail to make the race field. 
</P>
<P>
	Positions 37 through 43 are based on team-owner points and  
Waltrip has already used his allotment of what are known as 
provisional starts. 
</P>
<P>
	As he prepared to drive onto the track, his engine died and,  
with the five-minute clock running, his crew worked desperately to 
get the car going again. They made it with less than a minute to 
spare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The battery cable was off the battery,'' Waltrip said. ``It's  
a brand-new car, and somebody was probably putting the battery in 
and tightened one and put the other one on. And somebody hollered 
at them and they turned around and it stayed on until I tried to go 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off  
during my run, I'd be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip's hopes for making the race remained alive as he  
qualified 32nd at 176.478. But knows he has to decide whether to 
stand on that lap or try again on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the kind of run that keeps you up all night,'' Waltrip  
said. ``Thirty-second is right where you don't want to be -- 30th is 
a no brainer, 34th is a no-brainer. But 32nd ... I have a tendency 
to not let other people beat me. I like to beat myself.''

<HEADLINE>  Sotomayor Tests Positive for Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Did Cuban high jump great Javier  
Sotomayor ingest cocaine, as Pan American Games officials found in 
a drug test? Or was he manipulated, as Cuban officials insist? 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said Wednesday it made no difference where the cocaine originated 
or why it was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor reacted with indignation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have only seen that substance in movies,'' he told the Cuban  
Communist Party daily Granma in an interview published today. 
``Only on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials said Sotomayor never took cocaine and charged  
the substance was planted in something he ate or drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible he  
would take this substance,'' said professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, 
director of the orthopedic complex of Cuba. ``He has told us he has 
not taken this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mario Granda of the Cuban medical group added, ``The man is  
completely innocent and we trust him. He said he has not taken a 
banned substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban rhetoric aside, Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor  
record-holder and the only high jumper to clear 8 feet, will be 
suspended for two years, meaning he is ineligible for this month's 
World Track and Field Championships and next year's Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	His absence will leave the sport without one of its most  
recognizable names. Revered by athletes and fans throughout the 
world until now, Sotomayor has fallen from hero to villain. Instead 
of bringing glory and glamour to Cuba, he has brought shame and 
disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor withdrew from Saturday's International High Jump  
Meeting in Eberstadt, Germany, reportedly because of a back injury 
suffered at the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the withdrawal today, meet director Peter Schramm  
said Sotomayor had told him several days ago that the back problem 
may force him to pull out of the Eberstadt event. 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to the Cuban federation to suspend Sotomayor. If the  
Cubans do not suspend him, the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation will. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are expected to appeal the ruling against their most  
respected and popular athlete, who was seen with Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro at a gathering in Matanzas, Cuba, on Tuesday night, honoring 
the country's gold medal-winning baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, Sotomayor drove his red Mercedes into his garage  
and closed the door, and met in his home with Cuban sports 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotomayor case is the biggest drug scandal in track and  
field since Canada's Ben Johnson was suspended and lifted of his 
gold medal after testing positive for an anabolic steroid at the 
1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked. I cannot believe it. I am very surprised and  
upset, because I have great esteem for Sotomayor,'' IAAF president 
Primo Nebiolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won his fourth Pan Ams gold in the high jump last  
Friday, the final day of the track and field competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not name anyone who might have been responsible  
for causing Sotomayor's positive test. And they said they were not 
taking any special precautions to protect their athletes from 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply eating what the rest of the athletes are  
eating,'' Granda said. ``We hope those who manipulated these 
results or enhanced these results or altered the results of a 
person who never took this substance will never do this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said that in doping cases, his group does not 
differentiate a recreational drug such as cocaine from a 
performance-enhancing substance such as a steroid. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- It was the 1970s, and the Rev. Robert Nugent  
wrote a note of commendation to a nun whose work with gay and 
lesbian Catholics he had read about. He ended with what he 
considered a throwaway pleasantry, to ``contact me if there was 
anything I could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent says now, ``I've never said that again, because my life  
was changed radically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Jeannine Gramick did contact him, and it was the  
beginning of a joint ministry that continued for more than two 
decades, ending last month when the Vatican summoned the two to 
Rome and ordered an end to their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican officials, reflecting traditional Judeo-Christian  
teaching that homosexual behavior is sinful, said Gramick and 
Nugent have ``caused confusion among the Catholic people and have 
harmed the community of the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent, who at first issued a statement saying he accepted the  
decision with a heavy heart, later disputed the charge in an 
interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to bring the experience of gays and lesbians to  
the rest of the church. We've been trying to build a positive 
understanding of homosexual orientation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramick took a month's leave from her church commitments to  
decide whether she will obey the Vatican. ``I am anguished and 
deeply troubled,'' she said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	While she said she is committed to Catholicism's ``core  
beliefs,'' she urged the church to stop focusing its attention on 
homosexual practice and instead to emphasize gay individuals' human 
dignity and Christ's urgings ``to liberate the oppressed and 
marginalized ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the idea behind New Ways Ministry, which Gramick and  
Nugent founded in Mount Rainier, Md., in 1977, six years after they 
met. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Nugent sent his ``contact me'' note, Gramick had  
called and asked him to come to a meeting of her Philadelphia 
group, telling him the men wanted to meet with a priest. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I found was people who loved the church very much. It was  
their family, their home. But they felt like the church didn't want 
them. There was a great love-hate relationship,'' Nugent recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ministry developed, Nugent and Gramick traveled the  
country giving seminars. They wrote books and pamphlets on 
homosexuality and the church. 
</P>
<P>
	And their work attracted scrutiny from the church hierarchy.  
</P>
<P>
	There were several discussions in the early 1980s with Cardinal  
James A. Hickey, archbishop of Washington, D.C., the diocese where 
the independent New Ways Ministry is based. In 1988, Nugent and 
Gramick were told their case was being investigated by a 
commission, which in 1994 forwarded its recommendations to the 
Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. The panel sent 
several inquiries to Nugent and Gramick, probing their beliefs on 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``They moved away from our teachings, our writings and our  
ministry and moved into an area of personal assent. They were 
trying to see if I internally accepted the teaching of the 
church,'' Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, Gramick agreed: ``To intrude, uninvited, into  
the sanctuary of another's conscience is both disrespectful and 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hickey said earlier this month that the Vatican's decision was  
not made lightly and both Nugent and Gramick were ``given numerous 
opportunities over the past 20 years to clarify their beliefs and 
to assent to the church's full teaching on homosexuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gramick, Nugent said he doesn't dissent from the core  
teachings on homosexuality, but he does disagree with the church's 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent 25 years telling homosexuals that the church cares for  
you, that it wants you to have a part in it,'' Nugent said. ``How 
can I talk to them and convince them of that if I use language like 
`evil,' `depravity' and `disorder'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the New Ways Ministry, Nugent and Gramick focused on gays  
and lesbians as Catholics first, and homosexuals second. 
</P>
<P>
	For Nugent, the decision to obey the Vatican order was  
excruciating. But the stakes were too high. Disobedience would lead 
to dismissal from the Catholic community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a priest for almost 35 years, I've been happy as a  
priest and I don't think I could give that up, it's such a part of 
me. It's who I am,'' said Nugent, who is known as ``Father Bob'' to 
his parishioners at St. John the Baptist Church in New Freedom, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent still thinks the time he and Gramick spent ministering to  
homosexuals was worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homosexuals now have more of a sense of empowerment than they  
did in the 1970s,'' he said. ``The are willing to speak out, to 
say, 'I'm gay and I'm Catholic and I want to be both. I want to be 
gay in a healthy and mature way, and I want to be Catholic in a 
faithful way.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As Gramick weighs her decision, her statement expressed concern  
that the Vatican's order will anger gay and lesbian Catholics and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``To them, I say: Use your anger creatively,'' she said. ``Don't  
leave the church. It is your spiritual home. The people of God ... 
are coming to see that the whole community is diminished when we 
exclude lesbian and gay persons from the table of the Eucharist and 
dialogue.''

<HEADLINE> Suit Against 49ers' Player Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A lawyer for two men who say former  
Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller attacked them outside a 
bar has withdrawn a $500,000 lawsuit against Druckenmiller and 
three others but said the case will be refiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Turk, lawyer for Jessie Phillips and Sean David Elko, said  
Thursday he was concerned that the suit filed in February 1998 
would be dismissed for missing the one-year deadline to notify the 
defendants. Turk said process servers had difficulty reaching 
Druckenmiller, a reserve quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Druckenmiller filed a motion this week seeking to  
dismiss the case, saying the plaintiffs didn't try to find out 
where Druckenmiller lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Elko said they were assaulted by Druckenmiller and  
three other men on March 1, 1996, outside the Top of the Stairs bar 
in Blacksburg. Phillips and Elko, who were Tech students at the 
time, said they suffered facial injuries and broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Druckenmiller's co-defendants in the suit, Christopher  
and Jonathan Bishock, were convicted on misdemeanor assault and 
battery charges following the incident. Criminal charges against 
Druckenmiller and the fourth defendant, former Tech linebacker 
George DelRicco, were dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Immigration Ad Starts Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the nation's most ethnically diverse county,  
immigrants are getting a hard lesson in democracy: a sign saying 
America doesn't want them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over 80 percent of Americans support very little or no new  
immigration. Is anyone listening to us?'' proclaims the billboard 
in Sunnyside, a Queens neighborhood sprinkled with other signs in 
Greek, Korean and Hindi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We vehemently object to the message it sends to residents in a  
borough that is home to immigrants from more than 100 countries 
around the world,'' Queens Borough President Claire Shulman said 
Wednesday at a rally organized to protest the sign. 
</P>
<P>
	The billboard is the work of Craig Nelson, a Sunnyside resident  
who runs an anti-immigration campaign he calls ProjectUSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who once taught English in China, insists he's not  
saying that individual immigrants are bad: ``We're 
anti-immigration; we are not anti-immigrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sign is just a block from the No. 7 train that is known for  
carrying immigrants to work in Manhattan. Last month, the White 
House chose the subway line as a ``National Millennium Trail'' -- a 
monument to its polyglot pastiche of riders helping build a new 
America.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Fight Douglas in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson will make his latest comeback  
against perhaps his biggest nemesis when he fights Buster Douglas 
on Oct. 2 at the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson promoter Dan Goossen denied a deal had been struck, but  
the Washington Times, CNN/SI and the New York Daily News all 
reported the news Tuesday and Wednesday and a source confirmed it 
to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's boxing adviser, Shelly Finkel, was flying from New York  
to Scottsdale, Ariz., to watch Tyson train and could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson lost his undisputed heavyweight championship to Douglas in  
one of the most shocking upsets in boxing history when he was 
knocked out in the 10th round of their fight on Feb. 11, 1990, in 
Tokyo. Douglas went off as a 42-1 underdog, but dominated the bout 
and put Tyson out with a series of punches in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas lost the title to Evander Holyfield in his first  
defense, then was out of boxing for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas launched a comeback, but has looked like a shell of  
himself in recent fights. He was knocked out in the first round by 
Lou Savarese in June 1998 and won his last two bouts by knockout 
against nondescript opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be making his third return to boxing. He will fight  
for the first time since he knocked out Frans Botha in the fifth 
round with a single punch on Jan. 16 at the MGM. Shortly after that 
fight, Tyson served time in a Maryland jail assaulting two men 
following a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, 38, will have to undergo an exhaustive series of  
medical tests by the commission before he is approved to fight 
because of his age.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defying repeated veto threats from President  
Clinton, the House today passed a Republican 10-year, $792 billion 
tax cut offering a multitude of tax breaks for average taxpayers 
and special interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 221-206 to send the bill to the Senate, where  
expected final passage was scheduled for this evening. In the 
House, five Democrats joined most Republicans in support, while the 
GOP lost only four of its votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good deal for the American people,'' Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., said at a Capitol Hill rally. ``It's fair, 
responsible and balanced tax-relief bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would trim all income tax rates by 1 percentage point:  
first, the bottom 15 percent rate would drop to 14 percent by 2003; 
the other four would be reduced in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax would be repealed gradually beginning in 2003,  
ending it completely in 2009. Relief from the ``marriage penalty'' 
that hits many two-income couples would phase in beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, addressing a Democratic rally at the Capitol before the  
vote, responded: ``We say first things first,'' urging any budget 
surplus go first for preserving Social Security and Medicare and 
reducing government debt. ``Figure out what it costs and give the 
rest back to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., accused Republicans of bending to  
business lobbyists and producing a tax bill intended mainly for 
political consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got your Christmas list and you know it will never,  
never, never become law,'' Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Des Moines, Iowa, Texas Gov. George W. Bush urged  
Clinton to sign the bill. ``In my judgment, we ought to pass back 
the money to the people who pay the taxes,'' said Bush, 
front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, GOP leaders gained key support from a handful of  
Republican Senate moderates by inserting new items aimed at 
low-income workers, affordable housing and people paying for 
dependent care, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Senate vote was expected to be close, Republicans  
were confident they could pass the bill. GOP Sen. Mike Crapo of 
Idaho was absent for his daughter's wedding, but Sen. Arlen 
Specter, R-Pa., said he might not vote, which would reduce to 50 
the number needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders will not send the bill -- negotiated from earlier  
House and Senate tax plans -- to the White House until September, 
hoping to build public support during the August recess and avoid 
an immediate veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, listen,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``Listen to the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and most Democrats don't believe people are  
clamoring for tax cuts and prefer that projected budget surpluses 
be used to first safeguard Social Security and Medicare, pay down 
public debt and ensure adequate levels of government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has said he would sign a modest tax cut of  
perhaps $300 billion, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said in an 
interview that he saw no signs of compromise with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any indication that he's serious at all,'' said  
Lott, R-Miss. ``I'm hopeful, because I want it very badly. But the 
president has shown no inclination to engage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a signal that the GOP doesn't expect the bill to ever  
become law, many of the major provisions would expire after 2008. 
That means current law would return unless the cuts were renewed by 
a future Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans said the projected $2.9 trillion surplus over  
the next decade was enough to meet Clinton's priorities and still 
enact the largest tax cut since 1981, mainly by delaying full 
impact of the breaks until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the tax cut for 2000 would total only $5.2 billion and  
only $156.2 billion over its first five years, said Lindy Paull, 
staff director for the Joint Committee on Taxation, which makes 
official tax estimates for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the partisan gridlock, Republicans made sure their tax  
bill was chock full of items that would please many GOP 
constituencies, ranging from pro-family conservative groups to 
international and domestic business. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide tax breaks for education, long-term  
health care and health insurance premiums, repeal the alternative 
minimum tax for individuals and cut top capital gains tax rates for 
most taxpayers from 20 percent to 18 percent retroactive to Jan. 1, 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contained some special targets: repeal of a 10 percent  
excise tax on certain kinds of fishing tackle boxes; an increase in 
tax breaks for reforestation expenses incurred by timber companies; 
breaks for purchasers of nuclear plants aimed at the costs of 
cleaning up reactor sites; and a credit for electricity produced 
from poultry waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would extend the research and development tax  
credit sought by high-tech businesses by five years, instead of the 
permanent extension they want.

<HEADLINE> Caddies Could Be in Shorts for PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Caddies will be allowed to wear shorts next  
week in the PGA Championship if the heat index is over 100 degrees, 
the first time the PGA of America has allowed shorts in its premier 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of America generally follows the decorum set out by the  
PGA Tour. Spokesman Julius Mason said Thursday it is following the 
same guidelines the tour is using during a three-week test that 
concludes this week in the Buick Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the caddies for U.S. Open champion Steve Jones  
and British Open champion Tom Lehman wore shorts at Valhalla Golf 
Club during the PGA Championship. The PGA of America ordered them 
to change pants on the second tee in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The USGA began allowing caddies to wear shorts in the U.S. Open  
a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Professional Caddies Association has commissioned  
a study by an Orlando, Fla., doctor on the effects of carrying a 
60-pound golf bag in 100-degree temperatures. That report is 
expected to be released later this month.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers OK Controversial Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House-Senate conference committee on  
Wednesday approved the erection of cellular phone towers in a 
popular park in the nation's capital and told its local government 
not to fund needle exchanges for drug addicts to combat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Both measures were included in a bill establishing a $4.7  
billion budget for the city government for the fiscal year 2000, 
which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation returns to both chambers for a final vote before  
going to President Clinton, who has threatened to veto it over the 
needle exchange issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, the federal government would provide $429  
million of the capital city's budget. The balance would come from 
local taxes and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill requires the National Park Service to implement an  
earlier decision to allow the cellular towers to be built in Rock 
Creek Park despite objections from Mayor Anthony Williams, other 
district leaders and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also has problems with the cell phone towers because the  
National Capital Planning Commission's authority to review the 
project was bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate conferees agreed to the House position prohibiting  
the legalization of marijuana for medical uses in the district. 
</P>
<P>
	A provision added to last year's budget prohibits votes from a  
Nov. 3 referendum on a medical marijuana initiative from being 
counted. They can be counted at the end of the fiscal year, but the 
new amendment prohibits the use of medical marijuana no matter 
which how the count goes.

<HEADLINE> Drug Suit Seeks Checkups, Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Healthy but still worried, thousands of  
people who took the fen-phen diet drug combination are seeking 
millions to pay for years of medical checkups in case they develop 
heart or lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence linking the ``fen'' half of the drug duo with sometimes  
deadly disorders forced two versions of fenfluramine off the market 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began this week in a class-action lawsuit against  
American Home Products, which made fenfluramine. If American Home 
loses the civil trial, it could be forced to pay more than $1 
billion over the next decade, one economist estimated in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implications are huge,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug industry  
analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, N.J. ``You're talking about as 
much as $1,000 per year per patient. Then if you take the national 
implications ... you're looking at some serious problems for the 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit by New Jersey residents is the first class-action case  
against American Home to come to trial and the only one seeking 
payment for medical checkups rather than financial awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home already has settled several of  
about 3,100 individual suits, but those settlements are estimated 
to total only around $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments of a fen-phen trial in Canton, Texas,  
on Wednesday, attorneys for Debbie Stone Lovett said American Home 
hid evidence that its diet drugs caused heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovett, a 36-year-old manicurist, said she developed leaky heart  
valves after taking fenfluramine. She is seeking unspecified 
damages in the case, now before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, about 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine,  
which was sold under the brand name Pondimin, or its chemical 
look-alike, dexfenfluramine, sold under the name Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home pulled both drugs off pharmacy shelves in  
September 1997, several months after the first reports from the 
Mayo Clinic linking the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve 
damage in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The company insists there's no scientific proof that patients  
who stopped taking the drugs about two years ago and have no 
disease now will be injured in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe that routine echocardiograms are not  
medically warranted for patients who have taken these drugs,'' said 
company lawyer Anita Hotchkiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies since the drugs were recalled generally indicate a  
slightly elevated risk of valve disorders, but that it appears to 
fade after patients stop taking them. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Settles in DuBose Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama reached a $350,000 settlement  
with an employee who had accused coach Mike DuBose of sexual 
harassment, and DuBose apologized Thursday for embarrassing the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	An emotional DuBose, reading a brief statement, said he had  
reached a settlement in the case but did not disclose any details. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said DuBose's salary will be cut by $360,000 in  
the next three years, almost the same amount being paid to the 
university employee who filed the complaint against him. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose admitted to misleading the public in May when he denied  
what he called ``unfounded rumors and innuendoes'' about his 
personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say I am sorry is not enough, I know,'' he said Thursday.  
``I was wrong but I cannot change the past. Today I accept the 
university's discipline and punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose had issued a statement in May when talk shows and  
Internet sites began focusing on his personal life. In his 
statement at the time, he said: ``There is absolutely no truth or 
factual basis to any of these rumors that you may have heard 
involving me or other university employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, DuBose apologized for the denial, saying it  
``made the situation worse.'' He did not take questions from 
reporters and left the room with his wife, Polly, immediately after 
reading the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	University Vice President for Media Relations Janet Griffith  
said the university employee filed a complaint with the school 
alleging sexual harassment and sexual discrimination against 
DuBose. Griffith said the university settled the complaint for 
$350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said DuBose agreed to a reduction in the length of his  
contract, from five years to three years, and the amount of his 
compensation, about $12,000 a month over 30 months, or a total of 
$360,000. His contract will now end on Jan. 31, 2002, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith also said DuBose agreed to a freeze in compensation for  
the remainder of his current contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith said the university worker who filed the complaint was  
still employed by the school but had been ``out using accrued sick 
leave and we anticipate this person will not return to the 
university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose's attorney, Leon Ashford, said the coach received a  
letter from ``a third party'' last month that ``made several 
claims, but in fairness to everyone we won't go over them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not admitting that the letter threatened a lawsuit,  
Ashford said it raised enough of a concern for DuBose to bring it 
to him. They then began negotiations on a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith said the university agreed to pay the settlement  
because the ``problem arose out of an employment relationship.''

hangout, with workers eating from brown bags in the midday sun. 
That was before April 19, 1995, when a bomb ripped apart the 
building, killing 168 people and injuring hundreds of others. ``For 
some of us there's bad memories here, but it's a lot nicer now,'' 
said John Cresswell, who was a GSA maintenance mechanic at the

also disclosed that in a polygraph test in February when the 
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was asked if he had passed nuclear secrets

Cambodia later this month with a proposal for a tribunal of five or 
seven judges, a majority to be U.N.-appointed, said an official

Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said he didn't think the injury would 
require a magnetic resonance imaging test.

<HEADLINE> White House Cites Y2K Weak Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House issued its most optimistic  
predictions ever Thursday for the Year 2000 technology problem: The 
lights won't go out, water lines won't run dry, ATM machines will 
dispense cash and planes won't fall from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	But in its next-to-last status report on the nation's Y2K  
readiness, the Clinton administration also warned that many 
schools, local governments, small hospitals and small businesses 
are making inadequate preparations, taking a wait-and-see attitude 
toward computer failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is now increasing confidence, and people should be  
comfortable, that the basic infrastructure of the country will 
hold,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on 
Year 2000 Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Cabinet officials Thursday, Clinton urged  
continued vigilance and said he was ``confident that we will be 
able to oversee a successful transition to the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	With less than 150 days left before the new year, Koskinen  
predicted that Americans will start to focus any Y2K worries closer 
to home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's comforting to know we're not going to have a national  
catastrophe in any of these major areas, but ultimately tell me 
about my local government, my power company and my water company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report carried tough criticisms of the nation's school  
districts, colleges and universities for making insufficient 
preparations. It cited a survey months ago by the Education 
Department showing only about one-fourth the nation's schools were 
ready for 2000, and fewer than one in three higher-education 
institutions were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen chided schools for what he called ``disturbingly small  
levels of compliance.'' Nearly one-third of schools haven't even 
finished taking a full inventory of ways Y2K glitches might affect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting very late in the day to be at that stage,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley on Thursday wrote to leaders  
of the country's colleges and universities ``about the seriousness 
of the Y2K computer problem in higher education,'' warning that 
problems could prevent students from receiving financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said 40 percent of schools told a recent survey that they  
won't be ready for 2000 until October or later, giving them 
``little time left to adjust if schedules slip or problems are 
discovered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House report, which called Y2K preparations ``one of  
the most extraordinary management challenges of our time,'' also 
complained about a lack of progress by many local governments. It 
warned that only slightly more than one-third the nation's 911 
emergency call centers -- largely run by local governments -- were 
ready this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said 911 computer failures probably wouldn't prevent  
police or fire departments from taking calls, but it could force 
employees to use manual dispatch systems, meaning it will take 
longer for rescue workers to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report predicted no problems with the nation's grocery  
stores, banks, electrical and water utilities and phone companies -- 
except possibly for international calls -- and said consumer 
appliances probably will not be affected, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Older model VCRs may have programming problems but will still  
play and record off the air,'' the report said. ``Fax machines and 
camcorders will operate but may show incorrect information in date 
headers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House was less optimistic about problems overseas. It  
noted that while foreign preparations have improved, there still is 
a general lack of information about industries in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is likely some countries will not escape Y2K-related  
disruptions in key infrastructure systems,'' the report said, 
finding that ``efforts to prepare electric power systems are of 
particular concern.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Sides With Pepsi in Jet Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John D.R. Leonard never felt more a part of the  
``Pepsi Generation'' than when he raised $700,000 to buy what he 
thought was a fighter jet the soft drink bottler was offering in a 
television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a great prize,'' said Leonard, 24.  
</P>
<P>
	He tapped wealthy people from around the country he had met  
while working for a mountain climbing company as investors in a 
business he would build around the plane. He planned to offer the 
public fantasy flights in it or rent it out to movie production 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	After raising $700,000 for what he thought was the stated price  
on the commercial, the company told him it was meant as a joke. 
Now, a federal court judge in Manhattan has agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said in a ruling made public  
Thursday that ``no objective person could reasonably have concluded 
that the commercial actually offered consumers a Harrier jet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign had stickers worth various points denominations  
attached to cans and bottles of Pepsi. The stickers could be 
accumulated and redeemed for gifts, such as hats and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	A commercial for the campaign showed the prizes one could get  
with the stickers, and concluded with the Harrier for 7 million 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also allowed customers to purchase points for 10  
cents each, so Leonard raised $700,000 among wealthy acquaintances 
and ordered himself a jet three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi wrote back: ``The Harrier jet in the Pepsi commercial is  
fanciful and is simply included to create a humorous and 
entertaining ad. We apologize for any misunderstanding.'' The 
company enclosed free coupons in lieu of the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue landed in federal court in Manhattan after Leonard  
sued Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	In her opinion, Ms. Wood said each jet normally sells for $23  
million so the possibility it could be bought for $700,000 was the 
first clue it was ``a deal too good to be true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David E. Nachman, Leonard's lawyer, said his client would  
consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously disappointed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Still Hungry for Super Bowls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Troy Aikman feels is helpless  
against the pull of perfection. No matter how much he tries to ease 
up, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback continues to demand it from 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I try to back off a little bit and not be quite be  
as competitive,'' Aikman said. ``But that's just my makeup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That makeup has helped the Dallas Cowboys win three Super Bowls  
this decade. It's also helped Aikman become the highest-paid player 
in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	And as he prepares for his 11th season, it keeps him from being  
satisfied with a career that will one day earn him a spot in the 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the Super Bowl as badly today as I did before I  
won the first one,'' Aikman said. ``I'd be highly disappointed if I 
left the game and didn't win another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman, who turns 33 in November, said Wednesday he plans to  
play 3-5 more seasons. That's quite a change from earlier in his 
career when he talked about retiring by 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel like my best years are ahead of me,'' Aikman  
said. ``I still feel like I can go out and play at a high level, 
compete and do the things I need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Cowboys have won only one playoff game in the three  
seasons since their last championship, Aikman said he believes they 
have the talent to win it all this year. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't, it would be the longest championship drought of  
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't think we were willing to do everything we could as  
a team and as an organization, I would not have redone my 
contract,'' said Aikman, who will receive $85.5 million through 
2007 under an extension signed in April. ``I'd like our football 
team to get back to the respectability we once had, and I think 
we're on track for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Aikman hopes to leave the NFL on top like John Elway, he  
added that he wouldn't retire if Dallas won the Super Bowl this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still healthy and my arm still feels good,'' Aikman said.  
``Barring an injury, I think I can play three to five more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long ago that Aikman thought about retiring because  
the game wasn't fun. He was rejuvenated by the departure of coach 
Barry Switzer and the arrival of offense-minded Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys were 10-6 last year in Gailey's debut season and won  
the NFC East, only to be knocked out of the playoffs in the first 
round with a 20-7 loss to Arizona that Aikman called embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss completed a five-game slide caused mainly by a  
struggling offense. The bad ending overshadowed the team's 
turnaround from 6-10 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to be critical over the last four, five  
games, but we finished eighth in offense and at one time we were 
third,'' Aikman said. ``If I hadn't missed five games due to 
injury, it statistically could very well have been my best year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman expects the offense to improve this year because players  
are more comfortable with Gailey's system. He's also encouraged by 
upgraded talent on the offensive line and at receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to have one of the better offenses  
since I've been here,'' Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey has talked about trying to rest Michael Irvin early in  
the season in hopes of having him fresher for the playoffs. Aikman 
said he's not sure that plan will work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be awfully hard to say `Hey, we need to rest  
you.' He's too valuable to the team and too competitive,'' Aikman 
said. ``I think when the game's on the line, he's still the guy I'm 
going to try to get the ball to.''

<HEADLINE> Parent Award Returned Amid Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) -- A man lauded as this year's ``Parent of  
the Year'' has given back the award after he was linked to a cult 
accused of child abuse and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Prendergast, who has 12 children with his wife Naomi, won  
the award just last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Parents Day Foundation says it did not know  
that Prendergast had connections to the Children of God cult, 
started in California in the 1960s by the late David Berg, when it 
gave him the award. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing in the information we received on them to  
indicate that they were involved in anything like that,'' Jarmin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to former acquaintances interviewed by the Houston  
Chronicle, Prendergast was a leader in the cult, which has run into 
legal trouble around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, it has been accused of having female members  
work as ``happy hookers for Jesus,'' and has been linked to child 
pornography in South America and physical abuse of members' 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Former members of the cult identified Prendergast as the leader  
of an indoctrination camp for children in Italy in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Parent of the Year'' award, authorized by Congress in  
1994, is issued by the foundation in connection with National 
Parents Day, the fourth Sunday of each July. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about Prendergast's ties to the Children of God led  
him to return the award, said Gary Jarmin, spokesman for the 
National Parents Day Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer at the Prendergasts' home Thursday in  
Longmont.

<HEADLINE> China's Retail Prices Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's retail price index dropped in July for  
the 22nd straight month, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was evidence that the economy remains in the  
doldrums, enfeebled by weak consumer demand, excess industrial 
capacity and declining foreign investment and exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which cited the State Information Center, did not  
provide a specific figure, but said retail prices have fallen every 
month since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The retail price index, the country's benchmark inflation  
indicator, fell 3.2 percent in the first half of the year compared 
with the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief Xinhua report said prices remained in decline for more  
than 80 percent of all major commodities. It cited unnamed analysts 
as saying the price decline will continue in the second half of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Information Center is a Beijing-based think-tank for  
China's State Development Planning Commission, a cabinet-level 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has sought to counter deflation by imposing  
controls on prices and embarking on a deficit-financed public works 
spending program, but economic growth has still faltered. 
</P>
<P>
	Four interest-rate cuts in 17 months have had a limited effect.  
Thanks to record unemployment caused by free-market reforms, 
consumers seem too worried about their jobs to spend some of the 
$700 billion they've stashed away in bank accounts.

</P>
<P>
		   THAILAND's automotive industry is likely to turn itself into a  
mere assembly centre if the government continues with its plan to 
revamp automotive taxes and lift local-content regulations, warned 
local auto-parts and modified pickup truck company Thai Rung Union 
Cars Plc. 
</P>
<P>
		   Thai Rung managing director Sompong Pa-ernchoke said the local  
automotive industry would follow the path of the electronics 
industry in offering low added value to the local economy, because 
the multinational companies that dominate the industry will import 
most of the parts and components they need for local production. 
</P>
<P>
		   According to Sompong, the government has a duty to make sure  
that its automotive tariffs policy will benefit the country, not 
foreign auto-makers. 
</P>
<P>
		   ''As more manufacturers turn to imported parts, especially  
semi-knocked-down kits, Thailand will become just an assembly 
keNpre where they just tighten the nuts ab Ybint the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
		   ''Local parts sourcing would only consist of products such as  
tyres and batteries$'$claimed Sompong. 
</P>
<P>
		   The Cabinet has approved the lifting of three decades-old  
local-content regulations from Jan 1, 2000, to abide by an earlier 
promise made several years ago to attract General Motors (GM) into 
establishing its auto plant in the country. 
</P>
<P>
		   The government has also announced a new auto-tariff structure to  
comply with the removal of the local content rule. 
</P>
<P>
		   Also, following lobbying by Ford and other foreign auto-makers,  
a senior Finance Ministry official was quoted as saying that the 
ministry would on Aug 15 introduce a new tax regulation on modified 
motor vehicles, to replace the current regime which discriminates 
against foreign producers. 
</P>
<P>
		   Despite decades of protection from the government, the Thai  
parts industry is still lagging behind foreign competitors in terms 
of quality and price. Sompong said that currently the parts 
industry had just completed the ''high school'' level, and needed 
to be nurtured further before being able to compete 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
		   Citing Malaysia, which insists on having a local content  
regulation, the Thai Rung managing director said Thailand should 
not to follow GM's order to abandon the local content rule, since 
this would ''kill'' the local parts industry -- which employs 
24,000 workers and is worth more than Bt10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
		   After a two-year delay, GM said it would commence the commercial  
operation of its plant in Rayong around the middle of 2000, but at 
only half of its previously-announced production size. 
</P>
<P>
		   According to Thai Rung, the new automotive tariffs -- set to  
begin from next Jan 1, at the same time as the lifting of the local 
content rule -- will result in a lower gap of import duty rates 
between completely knocked-down (CKD) kits and completely built-up 
(CBU) units. 
</P>
<P>
		   The CBU-CKD gap for pickup trucks will be narrowed to 41.15 per  
cent from 50.93 per cent, for multi-purpose vehicles to 88.22 per 
cent from 105.48 per cent, blind vans to 39.99 per cent from 48.46 
per cent, glass vans to 17.99 per cent from 26.46 per cent, 
passenger cars to 124.62 per cent from 149.24 per cent, and trucks 
(with cabs) to 17.99 per cent from 26.46 per cent. (See table.) 
Thai Rung, modifier of pickup trucks for Tri Petch Isuzu Sales Plc, 
has been hit hard by the entry of the Toyota Sport Rider, modified 
by rival Thai Auto Works Co from Toyota's pickup trucks, which has 
been selling like hot-cakes since its introduction last year. 
</P>
<P>
		   Due to the economic crisis, the market for modified pickup  
trucks has plunged from about 10,000 units in 1996 to just 4,000 
units in 1998. But Thai Auto Works, minority-owned by Toyota, has 
already sold more than 5,000 Sport Riders. 
</P>
<P>
		   Sompong called on the government to lower taxes on modified  
vehicles, as well as restricting the right to manufacture this type 
of vehicle only to Thai-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
		   ''If the government wants to open up the market, they must look  
at the consequences, too. Looking at the way it's going, Thailand 
will be losing the auto industry to foreign companies in no time,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
		   Ford said it did not make sense for the company to hire local  
companies to modify its pickup trucks, since it has its own factory 
which is already producing modified trucks for export. 
</P>
<P>
		   Sompong said that this was not the first time that the pickup  
modifiers have faced a problem. In the past, many manufacturers 
used loopholes to enjoy lower taxes, he said. They include the 
Mercedes-Benz 300 TD station wagon -- which enjoyed a public 
transportation tax-break by claiming it had seating capacity for 
over seven people -- the Suzuki Caribean, Daihatsu Mira, Mitsubishi 
Pajero and Isuzu Cameo.

<HEADLINE> Expectations High for N.J. Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- It's August, the temperature is  
high, and like last summer, so are expectations for the New Jersey 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, on paper, we have one of the most talented teams in  
the league, but that's just on paper. But now we have to go on the 
court and prove it,'' forward Keith Van Horn said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets owner Lewis Katz shared that sentiment at a news conference  
announcing Van Horn's six-year contract extension, announced 
Sunday, that should keep the team's leading scorer that past two 
seasons in New Jersey until at least 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is clearly a linchpin in our hopes for a championship team.  
Hopefully, this year, with everyone healthy, we'll live up to our 
potential,'' Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had similar hopes last year, but lost 17 of its first  
20 games, fired coach John Calipari and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets posted a 13-17 record under interim coach Don Casey,  
and were beset by injuries. All-Star Jayson Williams broke his leg, 
Van Horn broke his thumb and shooting guard Kerry Kittles battled a 
bad knee, which has since required surgery. The team also lost 
point guard Sam Cassell and centers Jim McIlvaine and Rony Seikaly 
to injuries for extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a disaster,'' Katz said. ``This year we should  
be very competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell was traded in a deal that brought Stephon Marbury to New  
Jersey during the season, and Seikaly was put on waivers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, 23, who lives in Franklin Lakes with his wife and two  
children, said he was eager to stay with the Nets -- ``Maybe I made 
it a little too obvious'' -- and that Casey's rehiring played an 
``important role'' in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that the team last season expected good results,  
but, ``This year, we have the attitude that we have to go out and 
prove ourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By all accounts, the negotiation to reach a new deal with Van  
Horn was not difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We actually tried to drag it out to make it last two  
minutes,'' Katz said. ``He is the cornerstone, certainly, of this 
franchise, along with Stephon and Jayson and Kerry, Jamie (Feick) 
and Kendall (Gill).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn got an NBA maximum-length, six-year extension, valued  
at roughly $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us should be optimistic for the future,'' Casey said.  
``This is one of the main tools that we have and we kept him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Rowe, Nets president, was also generous with praise:  
``In 10 or 15 years when Keith's time in the NBA may be up, we 
believe people will be talking about the next young kid that comes 
out as the next Keith Van Horn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-10 power forward with the moves of a small forward, Van  
Horn averaged 20.5 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first two 
seasons. He averaged 19.7 points as a rookie and 21.8 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn scored 20 or more points 28 times in the  
strike-shortened last season. He shot just under 43 percent from 
the field, including 30 percent from 3-point range, and was just 
under 86 percent from the free throw line, including a streak of 48 
in a row.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Mayan Artifact Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When archeologist Ian Graham heard that an art  
collector planned to sell a 1,000-year-old Mayan artifact, he 
thought of the limestone monument he discovered in Guatemala in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7 1/2-foot monument of a standing man was missing a rectangular  
section that had once decorated its chest. The one about to be sold 
sounded a lot like the stolen fragment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that that was the piece,'' said Graham, who works at  
the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately notified the Guatemalan consulate, which  
announced Wednesday in New York that the piece had been recovered 
and would be returned soon to its Central American homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it's an invaluable treasure because it is a part of  
our history,'' said Guatemalan Consul General Fabiola Fuentes 
Orellana. ``It's priceless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham discovered the damaged statue in 1971 in northern  
Guatemala. Where its carved stone chest ornamentation should have 
been, he found just the flat surface left by thieves' saws. The 
chest piece had probably been stolen about five years earlier, 
along with other items, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham heard about the planned sale last fall.  
</P>
<P>
	The Guatemalan consulate had its lawyers alert U.S. Customs.  
Howard Spiegler, a lawyer for the Guatemalan government, then spoke 
to the collector, who agreed to return the piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegler would not discuss how the American collector, whom he  
did not identify, had obtained the artifact. Neither he nor Graham 
could estimate the value of the recovered piece.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Discuss Mideast, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's foreign minister and U.S. Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright discussed the Mideast peace process, 
Kosovo and disarmament -- a busy agenda reflecting how ties have 
improved since the end of NATO's campaign in Yugoslavia, officials 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone conversation Wednesday, Igor Ivanov and Albright  
``pointed to the readiness of Russia and the U.S. to cooperate 
closely to give a new impetus to the Mideast settlement,'' Russian 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing Kosovo, they reiterated both nations' commitment to  
the current peace plan for the Yugoslav province. Ivanov called for 
faster disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Rakhmanin said, 
according to Russian news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov and Albright also set a date for Russian-U.S. talks on  
deeper nuclear weapons cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Russian experts will meet in Moscow from Aug. 17-19 to  
discuss the future START III arms reduction agreement along with 
possible modifications to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, 
Rakhmanin said. Talks were agreed upon during Russian Prime 
Minister Sergei Stepashin's visit to Washington last month. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-Russian relations grew tense over the NATO air campaign  
against Yugoslavia, which Moscow vehemently opposed. But Russia 
helped negotiate a peaceful settlement for Kosovo and contributed 
to the peacekeeping force deployed in the province under NATO 
command. Relations with the United States and other Western nations 
are now on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of peacekeeping activities in Yugoslavia,  
Russian relations with NATO have been suspended since the air 
campaign. Rakhmanin said Thursday that Russia may consider 
restoring relations on certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, NATO should never again launch a military action  
such as the one in Yugoslavia, and it should make sure its eastward 
expansion doesn't hurt Moscow's security interests, he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell early Friday as investors  
continued to worry about the Japanese currency's recent strength 
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average declined 76.33  
points, or 0.44 percent, to 17,281.86 in the first one hour of 
trading. On Thursday, the average slid 327.19 points, or 1.85 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.64 yen, up 0.02 yen from late Thursday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 114.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said market players are concerned that the strong yen  
will hurt Japan's fledging economic recovery and force 
export-oriented Japanese companies to revise down their earnings 
forecasts for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen hurts Japan's exporters as it makes their  
products more expensive abroad and reduces the value of repatriated 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's quite a bit of anxiety in Japan,'' said Robert Sasaki,  
head of the quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. ``It's pretty tough for Japanese exporters to make 
money, and Japan is an exporting country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have recently indicated that they would be  
satisfied with the dollar at around 120 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.74 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,427.28. 
The TOPIX closed down 28.65 points, or 1.96 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.24 yen, down  
from 123.40 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8400 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8250 percent, driving 
its price down to 99.65 yen from 99.78 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Drought Forces Water Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The drought is hitting home in Maryland:  
Watering the lawn or washing the car could mean a six-month jail 
term and $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will do the right thing,'' Gov. Paris Glendening said  
Wednesday while warning the state's 5 million residents. ``No one 
can look at the flow of the rivers and streams and know there's not 
a problem here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Maryland's unprecedented mandatory water restrictions were  
the first in the mid-Atlantic region, other states have sounded 
similar alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman has decided to declare a  
statewide drought emergency and planned to announce details later 
today, her office said. Restrictions would include bans on watering 
lawns and topping off swimming pools. Delaware and Pennsylvania 
have already declared drought emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	All of West Virginia has been declared a drought disaster, and  
Virginia is seeking the same designation for parts of the state. 
Meanwhile, Pennsylvania's governor has also imposed mandatory 
restrictions in most of the state's counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawns are wilting and leaves are falling in some of the nation's  
most celebrated urban oases, from the shady retreats of New York 
City's Central Park to the grassy expanse of Washington D.C.'s 
National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman on Wednesday announced  
his department would provide $20 million in grants to provide 
emergency services to low-income migrant and seasonal farmworkers 
in areas declared state or national disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman has been asked by Glendening to declare a drought  
disaster that would cover all but four of Maryland's 23 counties 
and allow farmers to apply for low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's dilemma can serve as a example for the plights facing  
other rain-starved areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall at Baltimore Washington International Airport was more  
than a foot and a half below normal over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Baltimore's reservoirs are running 41 billion  
gallons below capacity, and Glendening has instructed the city to 
begin withdrawing up to 137 million gallons each day from the 
Susquehanna River. The river itself is down by two-thirds, a 
historic low. 
</P>
<P>
	That means water will be served only upon request in Maryland  
restaurants, and municipal fountains will sit dry across the state 
until the crisis abates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under regulations imposed today in Delaware, residents will have  
to stop watering their lawns and washing their cars. The drought 
emergency declaration also obligates industry to reduce water use 
by 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The order applies to only the northern tip of Delaware, but  
two-thirds of its population of 724,000 live in that area.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Joins 500 Club, Hits No.501 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire became the 16th member of the  
500-home run club Thursday night, beating Tony Gwynn to his 
3,000-hit milestone with a third-inning shot to dead center field. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire became the fastest player ever to reach 500 homers,  
doing it in his 5,487th at-bat. Babe Ruth held the previous mark, 
having done it in 5,801 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, McGwire also hit No. 501, with both home runs coming off  
San Diego's Andy Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	The sellout crowd had come to Busch Stadium hoping to see  
history, and the St. Louis star did not make his fans wait long. 
McGwire hit a hanging, 1-1 breaking ball an estimated 451 feet over 
the wall for No. 500. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth, McGwire launched a 479-foot shot off the  
scoreboard in left-center field, his longest of the season at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The solo shots gave McGwire 44 homers this year, moving him two  
ahead of Sammy Sosa for the major league lead. McGwire tops the NL 
with 101 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Every player with 500 home runs eligible for the Hall of Fame  
has been elected to the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire connected in the same ballpark where he broke Roger  
Maris' 37-year-old homer record last Sept. 8 when he hit No. 62. 
McGwire went on to hit 70 homers, finishing ahead of Sosa in a race 
that captivated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting a fly ball that was caught on the center-field  
warning track in the first inning, McGwire came back to hit his 
16th home run in 21 games -- and his fourth-longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, however, remains slightly behind last year's pace. His  
44th homer this season came in the Cardinals' 109th game; last 
year, he hit 44 in the first 104 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500th ball cleared the wall and deflected off the base of an  
advertisement, then landed in an area of shrubbery beyond the wall 
as fans scrambled to come up with the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Shearer, a 28-year-old architect from St. Louis, wound up  
with the souvenir and was whisked away by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of joked about it before,'' said his wife, Jennifer.  
``He said if it comes this way, get out of here, and so I did. I 
said he should give it back. He said he's going to sell out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who needed two hits to reach the vaunted 3,000 mark, took  
off his glove in right field and applauded as McGwire rounded the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire jumped on home plate with both feet before being greeted  
by teammates, who exchanged his signature fake gut punches along 
with high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire then made his second curtain call in as many nights as  
Ashby stood off the mound, looking out towards center field. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit his 400th home run last season, couldn't have  
had a much better foil for his 500th. That homer made him 7-for-14 
against Ashby with three homers and four doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, St. Louis manager Tony La Russa compared the  
atmosphere to the Cubs-Cardinals series last September. That's 
when, with Sosa standing in right field, McGwire surpassed Maris' 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something happens, everybody will go nuts,'' he said. ``If  
it doesn't happen, it's going to be an event just to be here with 
the possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has reached his last four big milestones, starting with  
Nos. 61, 62 and 70 last year, in front of the home fans. He wanted 
to hit No. 500 in St. Louis, too, and did it just in time -- the 
Cardinals begin a road trip Friday with a doubleheader at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to reach 500 homers was Eddie Murray on Sept. 6,  
1996, at Baltimore against Detroit's Felipe Lira. Murray is 15th on 
the career list with 504. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has already passed five players on the list this season  
-- Lou Gehrig (493), Stan Musial and Willie Stargell (475) and Dave 
Winfield (465). 
</P>
<P>
	Musial was at Busch Stadium for the big night and sat next to  
fellow Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock, the last NL player to 
reach 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, McGwire is a year older than Ruth was when he reached  
500. He's had to make up for lost time after totaling 18 home runs 
in injury-plagued 1993 and '94 seasons for Oakland, and the homer 
put him on pace to hit 64 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn began the night close to his milestone, and was on edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared to death,'' he said before the game. ``I'm nervous.  
I've never been this nervous before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the national anthem singer seemed jittery, forgetting the  
words midway through the song.

<HEADLINE> Aaron Amazed As McGwire Hits HR 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Hank Aaron saw Mark McGwire's 500th home run  
on the video scoreboard at Three Rivers Stadium. And baseball's 
career homer leader thinks he one day might watch Big Mac break his 
own record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he's hitting home runs, he could break the record next  
year,'' Aaron, who hit 755, said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hitting them in bunches. Seventy home runs? He might hit  
80 some year. Whew! That's a lot of home runs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron threw out the first pitch before the Atlanta-Pittsburgh  
game. He was honored for breaking Babe Ruth's career mark 25 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit No. 500 in St. Louis, and the highlight was shown on  
the scoreboard in Pittsburgh. Later, McGwire connected for No. 501. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and the Cardinals begin a four-game series Friday in  
Pittsburgh and many fans had hoped to see him hit his 500th. The 
Pirates have a big advance sale for both Friday's doubleheader and 
Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, meanwhile, marveled at McGwire's power.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting on the side at the home run derby (at the  
All-Star game), and it's impossible to hit the ball that far and 
that distance. He was hitting the ball into the light towers. 
You've just never seen anybody hit the ball the way he does,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, 35, reached 500 homers in fewer at-bats than anyone in  
history. Shortly after the Cardinals' 10-3 loss to San Diego, he 
was asked about breaking Aaron's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, there's a chance,'' McGwire said. ``But it's a long  
way away.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Just as it did with his  
predecessor, the Saudi government is likely to turn to its new 
chief cleric when the conservative country ruled by Islamic law is 
confronted with troubling modern issues -- from women's rights to 
the appropriateness of Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Religion and politics have long been deeply entwined in Saudi  
Arabia. Religious leaders legitimize government decisions, and 
authorities allow them to hold sway on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Many would say the most important decree the late chief cleric  
Abdul-Aziz bin Abdullah Bin Baz ever made had more to do with 
politics than with God. He agreed, in 1990, to support a government 
decision to allow in more than 500,000 Western troops to oust Iraq 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was attacked by Islamic hard-liners. The government  
needed a religious thumbs up from Bin Baz, who was top cleric for 
three decades before his death at 92 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Having gotten Bin Baz's backing in the Gulf war, security forces  
rounded up scores of clerics who continued to argue it was a sin to 
allow an army of non-Muslims into the Arabian Peninsula, home of 
Islam's holiest shrines. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first acts of Bin Baz's successor, Abdul-Aziz  
Abdullah Al Sheik, was to help secure release of the dissident 
clerics. 
</P>
<P>
	Little is known about Al Sheik, who will have to rule on a  
number of contentious issues, analysts said, including whether or 
not to allow women to drive and to work alongside men. 
</P>
<P>
	The clergy, or ulema, has traditionally been against such moves.  
But economic pressure on the kingdom because of low prices for oil, 
its main source of revenue, has forced the country to consider both 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing women to drive would save billions of dollars in  
salaries paid to the expatriates who now chauffeur them. 
</P>
<P>
	The government turned to Bin Baz when confronted with new  
subjects, like cloning, which he deemed blasphemous, and Viagra, 
which he approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Sheik was a teacher at the Islamic Sharia College in the  
Saudi capital Riyadh, and had been Bin Baz's deputy since 1996. As 
a member of the council of senior Islamic clerics, or muftis, since 
1992, he signed on to Bin Baz's rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his predecessor, Al Sheik answers questions on a radio  
call-in program and dispenses religious advice over the phone. He 
has yet to issue any fatwas, or religious decrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The tradition of powerful clerics began with Mohammed  
Abdul-Wahab, an influential mufti who joined forces with the 
forefathers of King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. The king welded the 
disparate regions of the Arabian peninsula into a state in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Sheik, who is blind like Bin Baz, is a descendent of  
Abdul-Wahab. 
</P>
<P>
	The clergy's role in bolstering the government was evident when  
Saudi Arabia's first dissidents set up base in London in 1994. Bin 
Baz issued a fatwa, saying it was a sin to support, get in touch 
with, or distribute leaflets of groups opposing the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he never set foot outside Saudi Arabia, believing it was  
undesirable to travel, Bin Baz sent many clerics to Muslim nations 
in Africa, Asia and the former Soviet Union to distribute copies of 
the Koran, teach Islam and build mosques. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, the power of the extremely conservative ulema ensures  
that there are no public cinemas or theaters in Saudi Arabia, that 
women cover from head to toe, and that unmarried men and women do 
not mingle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee to Promote Virtue and Ban Vice enforces strict  
social codes and looks to the mufti for spiritual guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by armed policemen, cane-wielding clergy wearing the  
above-the-ankle white robes and long beards of the fundamentalists 
patrol the country's malls to make sure women are properly covered. 
</P>
<P>
	They also cruise the streets in four-wheel-drive vehicles to  
check that stores are closed during the five daily prayers and to 
admonish the faithful through loudspeakers to go to the mosques. 
The vice police, or ``mutaw'aa,'' stop couples they suspect are not 
wed and ask to see marriage certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	If it was up to conservative clerics, there would be no singers  
in Saudi Arabia and people would not listen to music or travel 
abroad or use the widely available satellite channels.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Deaths Decline in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans were killed in workplace  
injuries last year than any time since the Labor Department started 
keeping track in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Job-related deaths fell to 6,026 in 1998 -- about 17 fatal  
injuries each day -- down from 6,238 in 1997, according to 
statistics released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer workplace homicides -- the second leading cause of  
on-the-job deaths -- accounted for much of the overall decline. In 
1998, 709 people were murdered at work, compared with 860 in 1997. 
Overall homicide rates also declined nationally last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most workplace homicides were related to robberies and occurred  
at grocery stores, bars and restaurants and gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway crashes continued to be the leading cause of on-the-job  
deaths and the number of those fatalities rose slightly in 1998, to 
1,431. About two-fifths of the victims were truck drivers. An 
additional 413 workers were fatally struck by vehicles last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths from falls and electrocutions also increased in 1998, but  
the number of deaths from workers being struck by falling objects 
or getting caught in running machinery declined.

<HEADLINE> AOL To Feature After-Hours Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online will feature a new section  
devoted to after-hours stock trading, inviting the Web's biggest 
mainstream audience into a market dominated by elite investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service, scheduled for a November launch, will provide  
AOL's 17 million subscribers with stock quotes and related 
information on the often volatile dealings that take place outside 
the regular hours on traditional markets like the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL members will also be able to use participating Internet  
brokers to connect to an electronic trading system operated by Wit 
Capital, a pioneering online investment firm that's part-owned by 
Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wit, which also will provide the stock quotes and other  
information for the service, has an exclusive six-month arrangement 
with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by AOL follows the recent introduction of  
limited after-hours trading for regular investors by discount 
brokerages Datek and Muriel Siebert. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the after-hours market had been an exclusive  
affair, off-limits to anyone but major institutional players 
managing huge sums of money. Most of the trading is conducted on 
the Instinet electronic market, which is owned by Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
	Several rival systems have sprouted up recently with the  
intention of providing off-hours access for the common investor. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek's after-hours session runs only for about an hour after  
the regular close of trading, but most of the new systems plan to 
offer an evening session lasting two or three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The privilege of joining the after-hours club may come with  
pitfalls, however, since most of these new markets will be thinly 
traded at first. Without sufficient demand from buyers and sellers, 
only the most popular stocks will usually be available for trading, 
and even then, share prices may swing wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	As protection, most of the new after-hours systems require  
people to name a specific price they're willing to pay or receive 
for a given stock. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's announcement on Thursday could serve as a big first step  
toward helping resolve the problem of thin trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing nearly 10 million visitors per month, AOL's ``Personal  
Finance Channel'' is not only one of the most popular destinations 
within the AOL network, but possibly the most popular financial 
site on the entire Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL has this significant pool of people who are involved in  
personal finance and investing online,'' said Frank Lallos, an 
industry analyst at Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass., adding that 
``AOL consumers spend a lot of time transacting business,'' 
including online shopping and online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he cautioned, ``it's not clear that after hours trading is  
the panacea that everyone expects it to be. There are a lot of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a limited number of stocks that we're really talking  
about. And even companies like Intel, Microsoft and Dell that trade 
tens of millions of shares a day aren't likely to have same 
liquidity after hours. As a result, you're likely to see large 
price swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also may not get the best prices quoted on bigger  
markets like Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Wit Capital, several of the new after-hours systems boast  
major partners, all of them trying to get in on the ground floor of 
a new market they hope will be as explosive as online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman also owns a stake in a trading network named  
Archipelago, along with J.P. Morgan and ETrade. Last month, 
brokerages Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, and Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette formed a joint venture with Spear, Leeds &AMP; 
Kellogg to create a new electronic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek's after-hours trading is conducted by its Island ECN  
subsidiary, which is partly owned by Waterhouse Investor Services.	   All the impending competition has prompted the NYSE and the 
Nasdaq Stock Market to announce that they'll introduce their 
after-hours trading sessions sometime next year.

<HEADLINE> Kurd Rebels Agree To Leave Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebels agreed today to heed the  
call of their imprisoned leader to lay down their arms and withdraw 
to bases outside Turkey, a dramatic step in their 15-year-old-war. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah Ocalan, sentenced to death in June, had urged his  
followers Tuesday to unilaterally pull out of southeast Turkey by 
Sept. 1 in an attempt to open the way for dialogue with the 
government over the Kurdish question. 
</P>
<P>
	The separatist rebel group said today, ``Our party openly  
declares its full compliance with comrade president Ocalan's call 
and it will carry out its activities on this basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move ``is the new phase that our national liberation has  
reached and is the only way to solve the Kurdish question,'' said 
the statement, carried by a pro-Kurdish news agency DEM, based in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rebels stressed that the Turkish government must now  
``adopt a solution-seeking approach in the face of these historic 
steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey refused any compromise with the rebels after Ocalan's  
appeal. President Suleyman Demirel said today, ``The state needs no 
help in finishing this struggle.'' His prime minister, Bulent 
Ecevit, said Tuesday there could be no ``bargaining'' with the 
Kurdish group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, has fought for  
autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeastern region in a 
conflict that has cost 37,000 lives -- mostly Kurds. Since his 
capture in February, Ocalan has promised to seek peace if his life 
is spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the chief prosecutor asked an appeals court  
to uphold the death sentence for treason against Ocalan, despite 
opposition to the execution from several European countries and 
rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite pressure by foreign officials ... the approval of the  
verdict about defendant Abdullah Ocalan is being requested,'' Vural 
Savas told the appeals court in an assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Savas said Ocalan violated treason laws hundreds of times ``by  
leading the ``most bloodiest terror organization of the 20th 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every death sentence in Turkey undergoes automatic appeal.  
Ocalan's is expected to be heard in early September. If upheld, the 
verdict would have to be endorsed by both parliament and Demirel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European countries and human rights groups have objected  
to Ocalan's execution. However, there is widespread public pressure 
in Turkey to hang Ocalan.

<HEADLINE> House Sees HMO Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats and breakaway Republicans  
announced agreement Thursday on legislation that strengthens the 
rights of patients dealing with managed care plans and lowers their 
barriers to medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton praised the measure for providing ``meaningful  
patient protections to all Americans in all health plans, and it 
holds plans accountable when their actions cause harm to 
patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill includes a variety of provisions to ease access for the  
insured to medical care in emergency rooms, from specialists in 
clinical trials and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would establish an outside review process for patients  
who believe they unfairly were denied care. Companies obeying an 
independent panel's ruling still could be sued in state courts, but 
would not be liable for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The point man for Democrats during the negotiations, Rep. John  
Dingell of Michigan, said the legislation ``covers everyone. You 
can appeal if you are denied treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Added GOP Rep. Charles Norwood of Georgia, who has shuttled  
between Republicans and Democrats in recent weeks: ``We need a law 
that will protect patients, not a bill that will protect 
politicians at the November ballot box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, a dentist, is one of several Republicans who are health  
professionals and have been at odds with their party's leadership 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell and Norwood announced their agreement at a hastily  
announced news conference where they were joined by numerous 
lawmakers from both parties. They said the formal legislation would 
be introduced later Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As news of the deal spread, lobbyists for insurance companies  
and businesses mobilized against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation is built on the erroneous premise that trial  
lawyers are the sole guardians of medical care,'' said Karen 
Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, an 
HMO trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House, and the GOP  
leadership had been hoping to keep the issue off the floor until 
they had worked the differences among their rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan agreement is a setback for that strategy, and the  
leadership will come under increased pressure to allow the 
politically popular issue to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Senate passed HMO legislation earlier  
this year that is significantly more restrictive than Democrats and 
the White House favors. It covers only some of the nation's 
insured, for example, and does not permit HMOs to be sued for 
denying care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell, Norwood and others stressed that their measure would  
cover all those who have insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is designed to guarantee emergency room care  
coverage, without prior authorization by the insurance company, in 
any situation where a reasonable person would believe their health 
was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a fact sheet distributed by Democrats, the deal  
also would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Guarantee access to specialists.  
</P>
<P>
	--Permit patients to get referrals to doctors outside their  
networks if no in-network provider were available. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ease access to clinical trials for certain patients, according  
to a fact sheet distributed by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	--Give women direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists.  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow children to have a pediatrician as their primary care  
provider. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement followed a hectic few days of behind the scenes  
negotiating. Norwood met at length in reent weeks with Republicans 
in the search for a GOP compromise measure, and in recent days has 
been talking with Dingell. Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, a surgeon, met 
with House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt in recent days to 
discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, according to congressional officials who spoke  
on condition of anonymity, Republicans made a late, unsuccessful 
effort to court conservative Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Judge Sides With Pepsi in Jet Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge weighing the merits of a lawsuit  
by a national park ranger has agreed with Pepsi that the company 
was only joking when it implied in a commercial that it was giving 
away fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood found that ``no objective  
person could reasonably have concluded that the commercial actually 
offered consumers a Harrier jet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But John D.R. Leonard, a 24-year-old Seattle man working as a  
summer park ranger at Mount Ranier National Park, saw the 
commercial and concluded it was no laughing matter when Pepsi 
implied that 7 million points in its ``Pepsi Stuff'' merchandise 
campaign could be redeemed for one Harrier jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take it as a joke. I thought it was a great prize,''  
he said Thursday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard said he had planned to start a business with the fighter  
jet, perhaps letting it be used for short fantasy flights for the 
public or in movie productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the company allowed customers to purchase points for 10  
cents each, Leonard raised $700,000 amongst wealthy acquaintances 
intrigued by a business plan he drew up and ordered himself a jet 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi wrote back: ``The Harrier jet in the Pepsi commercial is  
fanciful and is simply included to create a humorous and 
entertaining ad. We apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion 
that you may have experienced and are enclosing some free coupons 
for your use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue landed in federal court in Manhattan after Leonard  
sued Pepsi. Pepsi responded by asking the court for a declaratory 
judgment saying it did not have to give Leonard a Harrier Jet, a 
McDonnell Douglas fighter jet that was used extensively during 
Operation Desert Storm in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In her 42-page opinion, Ms. Wood said each jet normally sells  
for $23 million so the possibility it could be bought for $700,000 
was the first clue it was ``a deal too good to be true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his legal claim, Leonard noted that Pepsi increased the  
number of points required to buy a jet to 700 million and implied 
that the change proved the soft drink maker knew people would 
believe they could buy a jet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge wrote: ``The increase in the number of points  
needed to acquirer a Harrier jet may have been prompted less by the 
fear that reasonable people would demand Harrier jets and more by 
the concern that unreasonable people would threaten frivolous 
litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David E. Nachman, Leonard's lawyer, said his client would  
consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're studying the decision. We're obviously disappointed,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Allen Seeks Hambletonian Win at 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Driving in the Hambletonian with three or four broken ribs is  
going to be quite a feat in itself for Carl Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	It's only half the story, though. In a world in which young,  
physically gifted, well-trained athletes compete for championships 
and titles, Allen will try to drive CR Commando to victory in 
trotting's most prestigious race at age 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen also trains the colt and CR Renegade, who will be driven  
on Saturday by his 43-year-old son, Rod. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean everything to win,'' Allen said Thursday in a  
telephone call from the Meadowlands Racetrack at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like winning the Kentucky Derby or the Indianapolis  
500,'' said Allen, who retired from the vacuum cleaner business in 
1967 to enter and develop one of the top barns in harness racing. 
``It's the ultimate in racing. It's a great accomplishment getting 
a couple of horses there, let alone winning it. If I could win it, 
it would great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 12 previous Hambletonians, Allen has finished in the money  
three times. The Ocala, Fla.-based horseman's best finish was a 
third with Olaf in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	After last year, most experts thought CR Commando was the colt  
to beat in the Hambletonian. The 3-year-old son of Royal Troubador 
led every step in winning last year's Breeders Crown final and won 
the Dan Patch Award as the top freshman trotting colt. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning two of his first three starts this year, CR  
Commando got sick and hasn't looked the same. The colt missed the 
Beacon Course Trot final -- won by CR Renegade -- on July 16 with a 
virus and then last weekend hung on to fifth to get a spot in the 
Hambletonian final. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen compounded the situation on July 22, breaking three or  
four ribs in a training accident while behind a pacer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring doctor's orders to rest, he drove in the Hambletonian  
eliminations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody thought he went a bad trip last week but he  
didn't,'' Allen said. ``I knew that I could sit parked the whole 
mile and qualify. I just was afraid I couldn't hold him in the 
hole, hurting the way I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While feeling a little better, Allen still will be only 80  
percent for the Hambletonian final, a race that most expect Self 
Possessed to win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ron Gurfein-trained son of Victory Dream scored a six-length  
victory over CR Renegade in winning his elimination in 1:53. Angus 
Hall won the other elimination in 1:54 3-5, with CR Commando fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, Angus Hall and Raffaello Ambrosio will race as  
an entry that was 3-5 in the morning line. CR Commando and CR 
Renegade were the 7-2 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen admits CR Renegade has a better shot at beating Self  
Possessed than CR Commando. But if Commando ever gets back to last 
year's form, the elder Allen has a shot at becoming the 
second-oldest driver to win the Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Bion Shively was 74 when he won with Sharp Note in 1952 at  
Goshen, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who used to race motorcycles, too, has no immediate plans  
to retire. He has told Rod to tell him if he ever becomes a hazard 
to other drivers or uncompetitive. He said he'll quit then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'll even drive next year,'' Carl Allen said.  
``I take each year as it comes. As long as I feel good and I'm not 
handicapped and I feel competitive, I'll continue driving. I have 
no fear whatever. If that comes, I'll quit, whether it's today, a 
year from today or five years from today.''

<HEADLINE> Hall Hopes for Redskins Kicker Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- Jeff Hall brought his homemade holder -- a  
contraption of one brick, duct tape, tomato cage wire and a brake 
hose -- to the Washington Redskins training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to buy a holder like that, you'd dish out about 35  
bucks,'' said Hall, whose father made the strange-looking object. 
``The thing I've got is cheap, homemade and fully adjustable. You 
can't beat that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Hall, he hasn't brought the same accuracy that  
helped win a national championship last year at Tennessee. In the 
three-way battle for the Redskins kicking spot, the sixth-round 
draft pick is just beginning to recover from a difficult first 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I have done. I won't sugarcoat it,'' said Hall,  
who had four wide-lefts in one day. ``I feel like I have 
struggled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, Cary Blanchard and Brett Conway have been taking turns  
trying to put a few between the uprights over the first days of 
camp. Trying is the key word, for no one exactly is running away 
with the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope to have it defined by now,'' special teams coach  
LeCharls McDaniel said. ``But it's not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins have lacked a consistent kicker with distance since  
Chip Lohmiller was cut before the 1995 season. Eddie Murray didn't 
have much range. Scott Blanton's kickoffs were short and he was 
injury-prone. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanton lasted two games last year, and David Akers played just  
one in an 0-for-2 performance. Blanchard finished the season, 
making only 11 of 17 field goals, and Conway was signed for six 
games just to handle kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Redskins desperately want to settle on one  
kicker. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the way I'm looking at it is we need to improve  
on our field goal percentage,'' McDaniel said. ``I'd like kickoffs 
to play a role in it, but first and foremost we need to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wild card in the competition is a new rule requiring a new  
ball to be used every time there's a kick or punt, an NFL response 
to allegations that some teams tampered with balls to make them go 
farther. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a stupid thing,'' Blanchard said. ``They don't throw in a  
loaded ball for Mark McGwire to hit the ball out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchard, McDaniel and punter Matt Turk said the rule could  
take as many as 10 yards off some kicks. Blanchard has heard 
stories of widespread tampering, but said he's never done much in 
his career 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do a lot with the balls,'' Blanchard said. ``We'd  
just over-press or over-pump them so we could break the seams in so 
when you kick the ball it would go a little further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Hall was able to put some kickoffs into the end zone,  
while Conway showed more punch on field goals. Both were 2-for-3 in 
a practice against Pittsburgh on Tuesday, and Saturday's scrimmage 
against the Steelers will probably determine which one gets cut 
this weekend and which one stays to challenge Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
	For Hall, the adjustment to competition is not easy. He made  
62-yard field goals in high school and was never challenged for the 
job in four years at Tennessee, where he made 19 of 24 attempts his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a path you get on and you see the end of that path,''  
Hall said. ``Well, I'm still trying to get to the path. It's been 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't like to lose. On game day I'm a high-strung,  
intense, ornery guy. At college, I had to be intense. I had to be 
nervous. I feel like when I'm intense and nervous, I'm focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall's competitive enthusiasm on the field contrasts with his  
mild locker-room manner. Chewing on the cross he wears around his 
neck, he spoke of joining Darrell Green's Bible study group and of 
becoming a stockbroker if he doesn't make it in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not as interested in being rich as I am seeing things done  
with the money that I make,'' said Hall, who recently passed a 
brokerage exam. 
</P>
<P>
	But kicking is Hall's first calling. His mother tells the story  
that, when Hall was a child, he pointed to the television set when 
someone kicked a field goal and said, ``Mom, I'm going to do that 
someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And if you look at me, I'm not going to do nothing else,''  
said Hall, who is 5-foot-11 and 190 pounds. ``Look at me. It's a 
wonder I'm even a kicker because I've got chicken legs.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Sign Former Heat Guard Porter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Terry Porter's uncertainty about the  
direction of the Miami Heat prompted him to sign with the NBA 
champion San Antonio Spurs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old guard agreed to a three-year, $6.6-million  
contract under the mid-level salary-cap exception. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the defending champions ask you to help them repeat,  
that's something you cannot pass up,'' Porter told the San Antonio 
Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year veteran spent last season with the Heat and decided  
to leave after at least two discussions with coach Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The finances really didn't play a part. The numbers were going  
to work out the same,'' Porter told the Sun-Sentinel of Fort 
Lauderdale. ``I just did not know who the players would be in 
Miami. I didn't know how the scenario would play out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter averaged 10.5 points, 2.9 assists and 2.8 rebounds for  
the Heat, who were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. 
His 41 percent shooting from 3-point territory ranked 12th in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio still has a $2.7 million medical exception for  
forward Sean Elliott, who needs a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 195-pound Porter can play either guard position.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Cop Charged in Suspect Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- A videotape mailed anonymously to City  
Hall has led to criminal charges against a police officer who was 
filmed beating a handcuffed suspect at least 16 times with a baton. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Stephen Danner, 33, was placed on paid leave Wednesday  
after he was charged with misdemeanor battery in the Dec. 7 
incident, police Chief William Smith said Thursday. The charge 
could bring a year of probation and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape shows Danner repeatedly swinging his baton with  
two hands, presumably at 19-year-old David Weiler, who was lying 
handcuffed. A hedge partially blocks the view, so Weiler's body is 
not seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first reaction was I was shocked,'' Smith said. ``And I  
recognized the use of force was inappropriate for the 
circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danner's attorney said his client's actions were justifiable.  
</P>
<P>
	``When all the facts are presented, we'll be able to show  
Officer Danner did not have any criminal intent do commit a crime 
but was simply doing what he needed to do to secure this 
individual,'' Scott Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danner and two other officers had been called to a residential  
neighborhood about a bothersome stranger. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape, which was mailed to City Hall two months after  
the incident, shows a shirtless Weiler wandering through yards and 
driveways. The chief said officers believed the teen-ager was 
experiencing a ``cocaine psychosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to an internal affairs report, Weiler was handcuffed  
but refused to get into the back of a patrol car and got into an 
altercation with Danner. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief said he could not tell from the tape if the other two  
officers tried to stop the beating. They have not been charged.

<HEADLINE> Gene Found That Causes Narcolepsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists believe they have discovered a genetic  
flaw deep within the brain that causes narcolepsy, the bizarre 
disorder that makes people fall asleep without warning. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 135,000 Americans have narcolepsy, and until now  
its cause has been a mystery. Experts say the latest discovery 
should offer solid clues for finding better treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups of scientists, working independently, found that  
narcoleptics' overwhelming urge to fall asleep may result from a 
glitch in signals sent between cells in the hypothalamus, a part of 
the brain that regulates appetite and other basic drives. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic foul-up was documented only in dogs and mice. But  
researchers say they are confident that a similar defect will be 
shown to be at fault in some human cases, although the origins of 
the disease are almost certainly far more complex in people than in 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, these two papers will revolutionize the field of  
sleep research,'' predicted Juliette Faraco of Stanford University, 
a geneticist who co-authored one of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford research, directed by Dr. Emmanuel Mignot, is being  
published in Friday's issue of the journal Cell. Another study 
reaching similar conclusions was conducted by Dr. Masashi 
Yanagisawa of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center 
in Dallas. It will be published in Cell on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers have found genes that control circadian  
rhythm, the daily cycle of sleeping and waking. But Faraco said the 
new research is the first discovery of a gene that directly 
regulates sleep itself. 
</P>
<P>
	For the latest discoveries, the Texas team bred mice that were  
missing one gene and would keel over asleep while racing on their 
running wheels. The Stanford team worked with Doberman pinschers 
and Labrador retrievers that have an inherited form of narcolepsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Like these animals, people with narcolepsy are overcome by  
uncontrollable urges to sleep, often at inconvenient times, such as 
when driving. Unlike folks taking ordinary naps, they fall 
immediately into the deepest stage of sleep, called REM. Some may 
suffer sleep paralysis, a terrifying inability to move shortly 
after awakening. Others have especially vivid dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	One common feature is called cataplexy, which is when people  
suddenly lose consciousness and fall down. Strong emotions, such as 
anger, surprise or laughter, often trigger this disconcerting 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Narcoleptic dogs get cataplexy, too, during moments of  
tail-wagging excitement. ``You show them a doggy biscuit and 
ker-flop, they go down on the ground,'' said Faraco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford team traced the condition in these dogs to a gene  
that makes a receptor -- a bit of material on the surface of brain 
cells that allow them to get signals from other cells. This 
particular receptor hears messages that are transmitted by a 
protein called hypocretin-2. 
</P>
<P>
	When the gene is broken -- either because it is missing some code  
or has extra bits -- it makes a receptor that fails to recognize 
hypocretin-2, so the signal never gets through. 
</P>
<P>
	``This work implicates hypocretin in sleep regulation, which  
gives us a wonderful new handle on how we might approach sleep 
control'' with new medicines, said Dr. Charlotte McCutchen of the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which 
financed the research. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of treating narcolepsy with stimulates such as  
amphetamines, which have unwanted side effects, she said, it soon 
may be possible to find drugs that work solely on the brain's 
hypocretin system. Medicines could be designed to both prevent 
sleep in narcoleptics and induce it in insomniacs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Yanagisawa discovered that a protein dubbed orexin-B  
stimulates the appetite. Now it turns out that orexin-B and 
hypocretin-2 are the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	To study the protein's effects on appetite, Yanagisawa produced  
gene-altered mice that cannot make orexin-B. The scientists hooked 
up infrared cameras to watch their eating habits at night, when 
they are most active. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw this very bizarre change in behavior,'' Yanagisawa  
said. ``The mice would be grooming, running and burrowing and then 
all of a sudden they would fall over and stay there for one or two 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first the scientists suspected epileptic seizures. But  
further testing showed the mice had fallen into deep REM sleep. 
Like the Stanford dogs, these mice had cataplexy, caused by their 
brains' inability to receive signals sent by a potent protein 
called hypocretin-2 or orexin-B.

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms Holbrooke to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke, a combative diplomatic  
troubleshooter who helped frame U.S. policy toward Bosnia and 
Kosovo, won Senate confirmation as U.N. ambassador today after a 
grueling 14-month battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-16 vote after only about 35 minutes of floor debate was  
anticlimactic, given the nomination's tortured path. The former 
ambassador to Germany and assistant secretary of state drew heavy 
praise for his negotiating skills from Democrats and Republicans 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, 58, pledged to work with Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright and the president's foreign policy team ``to advance our 
vital national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently a vice president at the investment firm Credit Suisse  
First Boston, Holbrooke was the architect of the 1995 accord that 
ended the war in Bosnia and has served as an unpaid White House 
envoy to the Balkans, often negotiating directly with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Few nominees have ``been more closely scrutinized,'' said Sen.  
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was confirmed for one simple reason: He is highly  
qualified,'' Biden said. ``In fact, there are few people who have 
the kind of diplomatic experience that Ambassador Holbrooke has 
had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's nomination, announced by President Clinton in June  
1998, was first stalled for eight months as the Justice and State 
departments conducted ethics investigations into his business 
contacts and dealings. In February, he paid $5,000 to settle civil 
charges that he had violated federal lobbying laws. He denied any 
wrongdoing, however. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, the nomination was held hostage by individual  
Republican senators over various unrelated issues. 
</P>
<P>
	With his forceful personality and often-blunt language,  
Holbrooke generated detractors as well as admirers. He has been a 
favorite target of Republicans unhappy with administration Balkans 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	When Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C. hinted at a  
confirmation hearing in June that the envoy might have been too 
cozy with Milosevic, Holbrooke retorted: ``This isn't fun. This 
isn't bridge or tennis. ... This is tough slogging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even though 15 Republicans and independent, Sen. Bob Smith  
of New Hampshire, voted against Holbrooke, only one, Sen. Kay 
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, spoke against him on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	While praising Holbrooke's ``dedication, his tenacity,''  
Hutchison blamed him for a Balkans policy she claimed put too many 
demands on the U.S. military and forced rival ethnic ``factions to 
live together in an American model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot in good conscience vote for someone who has taken our  
country in the wrong direction,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton thanked Holbrooke ``for his commitment to public service  
and especially for his willingness to persevere through the 
confirmation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart complained that some  
Republicans ``continually are using strong-arm tactics that have 
nothing to do with the nominees that we're putting up, in order to 
pursue a different agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said no plans had been made yet for a swearing-in  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Holbrooke was flying to Alaska for a two-week  
family vacation when the Senate voted. His statement expressing 
gratitude was read by an associate. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke faces a heavy workload at the Cabinet-level U.N. post  
in New York, vacant since September when Bill Richardson left to 
become energy secretary. The United Nations is involved in a 
massive effort to get an international peace force on the ground in 
Kosovo and set up a civilian administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke must also contend with hard international feelings  
over more than $1 billion in still-delinquent U.S. payments to the 
international organization. The money has been held up by 
conservatives in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke has backed cost-cutting changes sought by U.S.  
lawmakers, including a reduction in the U.S. share of the U.N. 
budget from 25 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright was ``extremely pleased'' that the Senate 
had acted on Holbrooke's nomination. A runner-up for Albright's 
post and widely viewed as a possible secretary of state in a Gore 
administration, Holbrooke has often been at odds with her. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement Thursday, however, he went out of his way to  
recognize Albright as his superior in foreign policy matters.

<HEADLINE> Group Promotes Welfare To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Eli Segal has spent the past two years prodding  
businesses to hire people off the welfare rolls, trying to convince 
them that welfare-to-work is good for the bottom line. But he 
doesn't like to be called a cheerleader for the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Segal and his Welfare to Work Partnership are hoping to  
shed that image for good as they move away from persuasion and 
toward the nuts and bolts of helping companies make their programs 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned we would be accused of being cheerleaders --  
of only being the good news boys,'' Segal said Wednesday as his 
group's national conference wrapped up a three-day meeting. ``We're 
sure that's behind us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 12,000 businesses have joined the partnership, pledging to  
hire at least one person off the rolls. But the group's internal 
polling finds that one-third of businesses haven't hired anyone 
yet. And focus groups conducted during the conference found 
lingering concerns about drug addition, child care, transportation 
problems and working with the nonprofit groups that train 
low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way we're going to help these businesses now isn't  
motivating them to join us -- that, we've done,'' said Segal, who 
formed the partnership at the urging of President Clinton, a 
longtime friend. ``We've got to move from recruitment to service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting more hires, Segal said, will require more practical  
advice. To that end, the group released guides to combating drug 
and transportation problems, and a new Internet site is meant to 
help people connect with groups that can help them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who addressed the conference  
Wednesday, suggested that the cheerleading was still important, 
particularly among small businesses who may not have tried to hire 
off the welfare rolls yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses have gotten the message, but I think you can't take  
that for granted,'' Herman said in an interview. ``This is an area 
where repetition is very, very important. This (welfare) is a 
60-year-old system. We're not going to change it in three or four 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, hoping to be more practical, the partnership plans to  
help businesses choose the right outside agency, sometimes called a 
service provider, to train and provide low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cities have dozens of these mostly nonprofit groups  
offering such services, but businesses -- particularly small 
businesses -- have trouble figuring out which to use. Some are 
focused heavily on work skills, such as how to show up on time, 
while others teach practical skills, such as using computers. Some 
follow their clients for a year; others only work with them until 
they are hired. 
</P>
<P>
	The need for such services was supported by preliminary results  
from focus groups convened Monday that included businesses, 
nonprofit groups and welfare recipients, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the perception that service providers and businesses  
often talk past each other, not to each other,'' said a summary of 
the results made available Wednesday. ``Businesses, particularly 
small ones, don't know where to go or even where to start looking 
for assistance ... with how to implement welfare to work 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One small business owner, participating in the focus group, put  
it this way: ``Business is being bombarded with 'what I can do for 
you' with no way of sorting through who can provide what and their 
success rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The focus groups, run by pollsters from Wirthlin Worldwide, also  
found that nearly three years after Clinton signed the federal 
welfare overhaul bill into law, businesses are concerned with child 
care, transportation and training -- the same things policy experts 
were concerned about when welfare reform began.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Groups Boycott Burger King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- A coalition of American Muslims called  
Thursday for a worldwide boycott against Burger King because of a 
restaurant the fast-food chain opened recently in a West Bank 
settlement. The company said it will try to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Bank has been at the center of the Middle East conflict  
ever since it was seized by Israel in the 1967 war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our community views Burger King's decision to become a party  
to illegal occupation with profound distaste,'' said Khalid 
Turaani, executive director of American Muslims for Jerusalem, told 
a news conference held across the street from a Burger King in this 
suburb of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to shutting down the West Bank restaurant, the  
coalition of about 10 Muslim advocacy and religious groups wants 
Burger King to make a donation to help Muslim refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Turaani said his organization tried to convey its concerns to  
Burger King officials but received only what they considered a form 
letter that ``reflects a lack of understanding of the current 
circumstances Palestinians face in the West Bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-based Burger King Corp. said in a statement that it is  
``sensitive to all nationalities, religions and cultures, and it is 
our policy to be respectful of the needs of each in providing 
access to our products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Kim Miller said company officials ``take the issue  
very seriously and we will try to resolve it.'' They also are 
trying to ``encourage a dialogue'' with those involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Turaani said he expects Burger King to take the boycott threat  
seriously since the company has restaurants in Malaysia, Kuwait and 
Saudi Arabia and other nations where Muslims and Arabs make up the 
majority of customers.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Corn Down; Wheat Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices dropped sharply and corn  
wheat futures also fell Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid 
forecasts for rain in the Midwest growing region. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say prices were also down due to profit-taking from big  
gains in the past week and fears that prices are too high for the 
world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices had rallied sharply in the past week on thoughts  
that hot, dry weather has taken its toll on crops in Illinois and 
points eastward. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, wheat futures prices were up. Analysts say they're  
anticipating an increased demand for winter wheat since the spring 
crops were relatively smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.94 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.35 a bushel; December oats fell 3/4 
cent to $1.17 1/2 a bushel; and November soybeans dropped 14 cents to 
$4.80 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, beef and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .07 cent to 64.42 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle were up .35 cent to 76.42 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .13 cent to 50.32 cents a pound; and August pork bellies 
fell 3 cents to 53.72 cents a pound.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said  
Thursday it is ``appropriate'' for Texas Gov. George W. Bush to 
refuse to answer questions about his personal life. He also said 
the news media should apply the same standards to all public 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that it is absolutely appropriate and acceptable for  
Governor Bush to refuse to answer questions about his past personal 
behavior,'' Daschle said in a statement. ``What's not so acceptable 
is for the media to arbitrarily hold one public figure to one 
standard of behavior and another public figure to a far higher or 
lower standard.''

	Daschle denied a report Thursday that he had challenged the news

	In a letter to USA Today published Thursday, Bush said that an  
article the previous day about Quayle's relationship with him was 
``factually and totally wrong and very unfair to the former vice 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The article alleges that ``Bush, never close to Quayle, almost  
dumped him from the ticket in 1992.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush defended his relationship with Quayle, saying ``not only  
have I always felt close to him, but I never even considered 
'dumping him from the ticket in 1992.''' Quayle is seeking the 
Republican presidential nomination in 2000.

	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The state Republican Party chairman wants  
to make sure Vice President Al Gore's recent canoe trip photo 
opportunity isn't just water over the dam. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest Republican attack on Gore, the front-runner for  
the Democratic nomination for president in 2000, state GOP Chairman 
Steve Duprey filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duprey said the water released through a hydropower dam on the  
Connecticut River by PG&AMP;E Generating to float Gore's canoe amounted 
to an illegal corporate campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign dismissed Duprey's complaint as a publicity  
stunt and said it did not ask for the water release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duprey's up a creek without a paddle,'' said Doug Hattaway, a  
spokesman for Gore's New Hampshire campaign. ``He should be ashamed 
of wasting taxpayers' money on a frivolous complaint that he knows 
is totally invalid.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a week to go before a crucial Iowa straw  
poll vote, GOP presidential hopeful Steve Forbes will begin airing 
a radio ad attacking Clinton administration farm policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ads, Forbes denounces both Clinton's policies and high  
interest rates, which he blames on the Federal Reserve and its 
chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interest rates are too high, and while Alan Greenspan and the  
Federal Reserve raise rates, commodities prices have plummeted,'' 
Forbes says in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also calls on the Clinton administration to ``tear down  
trade barriers, reduce taxes and regulations on farmers, 
investigate potential anti-competitive practices and encourage use 
of private crop insurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ad is part of a $10 million nationwide summer media  
campaign.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch challenged his fellow GOP  
presidential hopefuls to debate a few weeks ago to no avail. Now he

</P>
<P>
	Hatch said in a letter to his fellow candidates Wednesday that  
he has reserved a meeting hall at Iowa State University on Friday 
so they can debate before the crucial GOP straw poll on Saturday in 
Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you share my strong conviction that only when the  
electorate is well informed on our positions can they make the best 
possible choice for whom they will vote,'' Hatch said in the 
letters. ``I'm convinced this debate will help inform not only the 
voters of Iowa, but voters across America as well.''

<HEADLINE> Geena Davis May Make Archery Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Geena Davis is one of the nation's best with  
a bow and arrow, but she doesn't like to talk about it much. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress is a finalist to make the U.S. Olympic archery team  
after competing in the semifinals against 299 women last month in 
Ohio. 
</P>

	``Yes, Geena Davis is one of the top 32,'' National Archery  
Association spokeswoman Kathleen Frazier said Thursday. ``She just 
wants to keep a low profile.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar continued its slide against the yen  
after comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers dashed 
hopes for market intervention. Tokyo stocks closed lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.62 yen in late trading, down 0.48 yen from  
its level of 115.10 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late 
New York level of 114.29 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 327.19 points,  
or 1.85 percent, to close the day's trading at 17,358.19. On 
Wednesday, the average closed down 284.55 points, or 1.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar dropped after comments by U.S.  
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers failed to indicate that the 
United States and Japan would intervene in currency markets to prop 
up the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	Some overseas players, including U.S. funds, sold the U.S.  
currency to take profits after intervention hopes faded, dealers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously watch what happens in markets, (and keep) in  
touch with our G7 partners, but that's as it has always been and 
there's been no change in that policy,'' Summers said in an 
interview with British broadcasting company BBC late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zembei Mizoguchi, the International Bureau Chief in Japan's  
Finance Ministry, repeated today that Japan would take appropriate 
action against yen strengthening, but he declined to make any 
remarks on joint intervention with the United States. Traders said 
his comments were largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.40 yen, down  
from 124.12 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, a drop in the value of U.S. Internet and  
high technology shares on the U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index helped 
push down the Tokyo stock average, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology stocks, plunged  
47.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to close Wednesday at 2,540.00. The 
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.54 points to 10,674.77. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen, which makes the products of Japanese exporters  
more expensive and therefore less competitive overseas, also hurt 
share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difficulties New York shares are having and the  
persistently stronger yen are combining to show that the (Japanese) 
market's recent gains have been unfounded,'' said Ryoji Musha, 
chief strategist of Japan Equity Research at Deutsche Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 483.47 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 472.49 million shares 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners outnumbered advancers 1,036 to 195, while 80 issues  
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 28.65 points, or 1.96 percent, to 
1,431.02. The TOPIX closed down 22.32 points, or 1.51 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8300 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8850 
percent, driving its price up to 99.74 yen from 99.27 yen.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Group Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday gave  
Mario Lemieux's group a second extension to wrap up what is 
becoming the much-delayed purchase of the bankrupt Pittsburgh 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	While granting the order sought by Lemieux, who was not in  
court, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz urged the myriad 
parties involved to move with haste to complete a sale he approved 
June 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get this deal done,'' Markovitz said, directing his  
remarks to Lemieux lawyer David Salzman. ``It's time to get it 
together. I'll be pleased when this case is closed so we can start 
working on some other cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salzman explained the delays ``should not be read as there are  
any problems, and there are not,'' but result from the complexities 
in completing a deal involving numerous investors and more than $50 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The paperwork itself is expected to run into the thousands of  
pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are proceeding on track,'' Salzman said.  
</P>
<P>
	What has taken longer than expected is the completion of  
agreements with each of Lemieux's more than one dozen investors, 
including California supermarket millionaire Ronald Burkle, who is 
investing $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the team is to be run by a three-man board of directors  
composed of Lemieux and two of his top advisors, Anthony Liberati 
and Chuck Greenberg, some investors apparently have sought detailed 
agreements concerning control issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the sale was to have been completed July 16. When  
that date was not met, Markovitz granted a 20-day extension that 
expired Thursday. The latest extension is open-ended with no firm 
closing date. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the various parties involved in the case, the new  
target date for the closing is Friday, August 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays are holding up a ticket-selling campaign aimed at  
increasing the team's season ticket base from 8,500 to 12,000 and 
also has caused some unanticipated problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, when the NHL paid the Penguins nearly $3 million in  
expansion fees, the money was deposited into the team's account in 
Societe Generale, the French bank that loaned the team $13.5 
million to operate last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But rather than making the money available to the Penguins, the  
bank worked out an agreement with the Lemieux group in which it 
applied $1.9 million toward the team's debt and made approximately 
$800,000 available to the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the nearly $3 million originally was to go directly to  
the Penguins, Markovitz had to approve the change in distribution. 
The bank also charged the Penguins $25,000 to extend the agreement, 
which expired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for bankruptcy in October, citing $120  
million in debt. The largest unsecured creditor was Lemieux, who 
was owed $32.5 million in deferred salary and other payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux will not take any cash out of the transaction but  
instead will exchange his debt for $20 million in equity. 
</P>
<P>
	At the closing, Lemieux's group will pay off the $13.5 million  
owed Societe Generale, less the money already applied, and $27.5 
million owed former co-owner Roger Marino, the NHL and unsecured 
creditors, plus pay back taxes and the mounting legal and 
accounting fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's group also will take on $22 million in debt owed three  
insurance companies from a 1997 loan and will pay the unsecured 
creditors, including former Lemieux teammates Ron Francis, Luc 
Robitaille and Kevin Stevens, $8.5 million over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The total sale price is expected to be about $91 million, or  
about what the Pirates sold for in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL Board of Directors also must approve the Lemieux  
takeover, but that is considered a formality. The NHL already has 
stated its support of Lemieux, who would become the first former 
star player to buy a major U.S. pro sports franchise. He retired in 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Driver Waltrip To Retire in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Darrell Waltrip was always one of racing's  
great characters, spinning tires and tales with equal deftness and 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	Who could forget the good ol' boy from Kentucky doing the ``Icky  
Shuffle'' in victory lane in 1989 and wailing like a child, ``I won 
the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he still thinks he's a great driver, the 52-year-old  
Waltrip announced Thursday that, yes, it's true, he's retiring 
after next season. With a finale that he's calling ``Victory Tour 
2000,'' Waltrip will finish up one of the most remarkable, 
outspoken, fun-loving careers motorsports has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into this sport in 1972, and I've been a headliner ever  
since,'' Waltrip said in an emotional announcement at Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway before qualifying for the sixth Brickyard 400. 
``When I'd go to town, people would say, `Are you here with the 
show?' And I'd say, `No, I am the show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a glimpse of the arrogance that earned Waltrip the  
nickname ``Jaws'' in the early days, when he was viewed as stock 
car racing's outlaw. It's been quite a turnabout, because he will 
go out as the beloved ``old DW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting that the end is near left Waltrip momentarily  
speechless -- probably for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving this sport, hanging up my helmet, that's hard to talk  
about,'' Waltrip said, choking back sobs. ``I've done this for 40 
years. Ever since I was 12 years old, we'd get up, put on our 
racing gear and go to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought about the future. ... Well, I'm running  
out of next weeks. That's really the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who ran out of former champion's provisionals two weeks  
ago at Pocono, unveiled a new car he'll use for the rest of the 
season. He made the bold prediction that he'll qualify consistently 
in the top 25 from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Victory Tour got off to an ignominious start Thursday when  
Waltrip stalled just before attempting his qualifying run. With 
less than a minute before time would run out on the session, 
Waltrip fired up the car and was 32nd fastest on the first day of 
qualifying at 176.478 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sheepish grin, Waltrip explained the mishap.  
</P>
<P>
	``The battery cable was off the battery,'' Waltrip said. ``It's  
a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off during my run, 
I'd be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip has won three Winston Cup championships and leads active  
drivers with 84 victories, tied for third all-time with Bobby 
Allison. But ol' DW has been running on fumes for the past few 
years; he hasn't won a race since Darlington in September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who rarely misses a punchline, nailed the one  
pertaining to the name of his victory tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we call it  
a victory tour and we don't produce a victory,'' Waltrip said. 
``Winning a race now would be just as special as winning that first 
one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a native of Owensboro, Ky., who lives in Franklin,  
Tenn., sold his race team last year after owning it for eight 
years, citing sponsor disputes and financial reasons. At the time, 
he said 1999 would be his last season. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed when Travis Carter and Carl Haas approached him  
about driving the No. 66 KMart Ford Taurus, signing him to a 
two-year contract. But Waltrip has continued to struggle, finishing 
25th in the most recent race at Pocono Raceway and placing 38th in 
the season points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess in every sport your legs give our, your arm gives out,  
something gives out,'' Waltrip said. ``I think every athlete that's 
been successful like I have, one thing never gives out. Your heart 
never gives out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother, who also is a Winston Cup competitor, can  
attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the book is written about NASCAR racing, he will  
certainly have a chapter in it,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``One of 
the things that I most admire about him is that he's been able to 
do it on his own terms, and that hasn't always made everybody 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip got his first victory at his home track in Nashville,  
Tenn., in 1975. He won 22 races from 1975-79, then captured the 
Winston Cup championship in 1981, '82 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity soared once he learned to use his gift for gab  
wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in the 1980s, Waltrip was asked what he thought of  
Chevrolet's new Lumina. Without hesitation, Waltrip said he'd 
received letters from fans who wanted to know, ``Why are they 
switching to those 'luminum cars? What's wrong with steel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a future TV commentator who says he also might go into  
politics after racing, still has plenty of one-liners left in the 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just haven't decided what state I want to be governor of  
yet,'' Waltrip said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like racing, politics probably would never be the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``DW ain't told all the stories he knows,'' Waltrip said.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Player Remembered As Vibrant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSBORO, Ala. (AP) -- Tiffany Young, a member of Purdue's 1999  
national championship team killed in a car accident, was remembered 
Thursday by friends and family members as a vibrant young woman 
with strong religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 people, including Young's Purdue teammates, attended  
the funeral at Wheeler Chapel Full Gospel Baptist Church in her 
hometown of Hillsboro, a town of about 600 in north Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiffany is not dead,'' said her father, Billy Young, standing  
by her casket at the front of the church. ``I'm sure you're looking 
up here and can see she's not moving, but she's not dead. I remind 
you -- you're just looking at the house where she used to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 21, was killed last Saturday in a two-car collision in  
Gary, Ind., where she was visiting her boyfriend. Police said the 
car in which Young was riding was struck by a drunken driver. 
Arnold Eaton, 33, of Great Lakes, Ill., was charged with operating 
a vehicle while intoxicated, causing a death, and is free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue team members rode a chartered bus from West LaFayette,  
Ind., to Hillsboro for the funeral, and some former teammates of 
Young's also attended. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a teammate, friend and sister in Christ,'' Purdue  
teammate Camille Cooper said. ``Tiffany, I pray that you continue 
to pray for us because we will continue to pray for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young's boyfriend, Neil Sinclair, was still recuperating from  
injuries suffered in the wreck and could not attend the funeral. He 
was driving the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was buried in nearby Courtland.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Stick Together in Handball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- They fought, argued and tried to get  
the best of the other no matter what they did, which is the way 
brothers are, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the floor, playing team handball for the United States,  
Tom and Joe Fitzgerald stand together. Throw in the support they 
get from their parents and two sisters and the Fitzgeralds might be 
America's first family in their sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are playing in the Pan American Games and both played in  
the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. Tom, 33, has been on the U.S. 
national team since 1989. Joe, 27, the self-professed ``tagalong,'' 
has played on the team since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some success, but it was in different sports so it's  
hard to measure who's the better athlete or better player,'' Tom 
said. ``Obviously, I'm more experienced from a technical 
standpoint. But from a competitive standpoint, we compete for the 
last chicken cutlet in the refrigerator -- and have knocked over 
chairs and china to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the same time, we're as loyal as anybody can be. If  
somebody steps on his toes, I'm the one who pushes the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fitzgeralds and their teammates fell 38-20 to Cuba on  
Thursday night in the semifinals, losing their chance to go to the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers got into team handball because it combines skills  
from football, basketball and baseball, the sports they played as 
youngsters. It requires agility and endurance. Players must be 
skilled enough to dribble a ball the size of a large grapefruit and 
strong enough to fling it past a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom first played e sport as a teen-ager in the Empire State  
Games, an Olympic-style festival for New York residents. Naturally, 
Joe had to try it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in high school and went to a practice with him one time  
and they needed an extra guy,'' Joe said. ``So I went on the court 
and basically fell in love with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom had played a version of the sport in gym class in high  
school, but it was more a free-for-fall than an organized game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it was 15 against 15 and kill the guy with the  
ball,'' he said, laughing at the memory. ``We'd put a freshman in 
the goal and try to bean him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His game has come a long way since then. After playing point  
guard in basketball at St. Bonaventure, Tom took up team handball 
again, got back into it quickly and has played ever since while 
working as an accountant. He also played professionally for two 
years in Sweden and has just relocated in Atlanta, where the U.S. 
team trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe played football and baseball at Ithaca College and was a  
quarterback on the school's Division III national championship team 
in 1991. He was good enough to draw interest from the NFL, CFL and 
Arena Football League, but decided his future was in team handball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after graduating, Joe tried out for the national team  
and made it. The brothers were together again -- this time as 
equals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always the tagalong guy,'' said Joe, an eighth-grade  
history teacher in the Atlanta area. ``Whether it was baseball, 
basketball, football, hockey, if he did it, I tried to do it 
better. Sometimes I did. Most of the time he was bigger and pounded 
on me. I definitely took some beatings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Tom had any choice about Joe tagging along.  
</P>
<P>
	``We always made him the right fielder or official catcher,''  
Tom said. ``It was my responsibility to make sure he spent the day 
with us, if we went to the beach or played stickball or whatever. 
It didn't matter what I said or my friends said, it was the law of 
my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family has provided the brothers with all the support they  
could ask. Their older sister, Elizabeth, was 8 1/2 months pregnant in 
the summer of 1996 and wasn't supposed to fly, but she flew to 
Atlanta anyway to watch her brothers. She gave birth a week after 
the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Their younger sister, Graceanne, moved to Atlanta before the  
Olympics, hung around with her brothers, helped promote the team 
and took part in numerous activities with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was almost a member of the team,'' Tom said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mom (Graceanne) and Dad (Thomas) were there as well, just as  
they always had been when it was time to drive someone to practice 
or a game or a football film session. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can imagine how proud my parents were to have two children  
in the Olympics,'' Tom said. ``Dad was walking around with a smile 
for a long time. They're the two best ambassadors we have.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Quick To Offer Clean Slate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins' roster includes three  
convicted felons and a receiver under federal indictment, prompting 
critics to complain that Jimmy Johnson wants to win at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	There is, of course, no law against that.  
</P>
<P>
	Many Miami players are law-abiding, God-fearing, family oriented  
registered voters who have never even been guilty of illegal 
procedure. But Johnson's recent willingness to welcome players with 
criminal records has sparked wry speculation that the NFL will 
require the Dolphins to wear eight-digit numerals on the back of 
their uniforms this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has always put speed and strength ahead of citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Hurricanes were the bad boys of college football when  
Johnson led them to the national championship in 1987. With the 
Dallas Cowboys, he assembled back-to-back Super Bowl champions who 
subsequently embarrassed the NFL with a series of off-the-field 
transgressions. Talented but troubled running back Lawrence 
Phillips was signed by Johnson and the Dolphins in late 1997, then 
released last summer after he was charged with hitting a woman at a 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Felons can be found on the rosters of many teams, and most of  
the Miami players with police records committed their crimes before 
becoming Dolphins. Still, JJ has been a bit brazen this year in his 
eagerness to transform Miami into a tougher team. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson drafted rookie running back Cecil ``the Diesel''  
Collins, who avoided prison in April by pleading guilty to charges 
he fondled two coeds in their apartments. Then Johnson signed 
rookie receiver Robert Baker, who was released from jail in March 
after serving 10 months for drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The most notorious newcomer is veteran Tony Martin, who went on  
trial this week facing charges of laundering drug money. The 
Dolphins are counting on the speedy receiver to upgrade the 
offense, which means their Super Bowl chances may be in the hands 
of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson acquired Martin, Collins and Baker well aware of their  
legal problems. He has also stuck with veteran receiver Lamar 
Thomas, who was twice charged with attacking his fiancee and spent 
nearly three weeks in jail in 1997 for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our whole country and our lives are dealing with second  
chances,'' Johnson said after signing Baker. ``A lot of people get 
second chances, whether it's a husband or wife or president or what 
have you.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Gary Anderson, the first perfect kicker in NFL history, says the  
league's new kicking rules will make it next to impossible for him 
or anybody else to duplicate his impeccable season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic theory is they don't want us to do our jobs as well  
as we do them,'' said Anderson, who made all 35 of his field goals 
and all 59 of his extra points for the Minnesota Vikings in the 
regular season last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, whenever a kicker lines up for a field goal, an  
official will swap the game ball for a new one that hasn't been 
thrown, carried, or caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants to prevent any possible tampering with balls,  
especially by kickers and punters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very strange that you have two sets of balls.  
A quarterback throws one ball but as soon as it comes time to punt 
or kick a field goal, they're going to whip a different ball out 
there so we can't kick it as well,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like maybe telling a tennis player with a really good  
serve, `We're going to give you a soft ball so you can't serve as 
hard.' `` 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	Tim Dwight wants to contribute more to the Atlanta Falcons than  
he did as a rookie last season. 
</P>
<P>
	With last year's leading receiver, Tony Martin, no longer  
around, coach Dan Reeves could certainly use additional help from 
Dwight, who made a pretty good splash on special teams his rookie 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the ball more this year,'' said Dwight, a 5-foot-8,  
180-pound speedster who ran a leg on Iowa's 4x400 relay team that 
finished fourth in this year's NCAA track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main goal is to make some plays,'' Dwight said. ``I want to  
find a role in this offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight's 10.45-second speed in the 100 meters made him valuable  
in returning kickoffs and punts last season. He had 36 kickoff 
returns for 973 yards and one touchdown and returned 31 punts for 
263 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest moment came in the Super Bowl, when he returned a  
kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown -- fourth longest in Super Bowl 
history. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two weeks into his first stint as a starting quarterback  
in the NFL, Doug Pederson feels the Philadelphia Eagles offense is 
making progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have progressed for me and the offense,'' Pederson  
said. ``I feel real good about it now. Honestly, there have been 
some times when I could have been better. I'm always critical of 
myself and that's the only way you can get better. I look at the 
films from practices and see where I make mistakes and try to 
eliminate them when we practice again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson is starting because of his familiarity with the West  
Coast offense from his days as a backup quarterback in Green Bay, 
where new coach Andy Reid coached the quarterbacks for three 
seasons. While No. 1 pick Donovan McNabb matures, the 32-year-old 
Pederson, who has thrown just 32 passes in the NFL, gets his chance 
to be a first-string signal-caller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be content just being a starter,'' he said.  
``I want to go out there and do well. I'm very, very excited about 
this chance. I'm pumped. This is what I've worked for my entire 
career. I'm going to make the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                             	 *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' right cornerback slot was effectively decided Thursday  
when veteran Otis Smith broke his left collarbone during morning 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th-year player, who was being pushed by Ray Mickens for a  
starting role, will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after 
suffering the injury during a passing drill. Smith, 33, fell hard 
after getting tangled up with wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells said that Smith will not need surgery. He  
may not be available, however, until the season's fourth week when 
the Jets travel to Denver for a rematch of the AFC Championship 
Game with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our first big setback,'' Parcells said. ``Losing Otis  
hurts us. He's a good veteran player who knows what to do. He was 
also going to play special teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells admits to being nervous about the prospect of teaming  
Pro Bowl left cornerback Aaron Glenn, who is 5-9, with the 5-8 
Mickens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still want big guys,'' Parcells said. ``I don't care; I want  
big players instead of little players.''

<HEADLINE> Corning Consumer Products Buys Ekco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- In a marriage of pots and pans, the parent  
company of Corning Consumer Products Co. has agreed to buy Ekco 
Group Inc. for about $300 million, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	CCPC, based in Elmira, N.Y., said it would pay $7 per share for  
all outstanding shares of Nashua-based Ekco. The cash tender offer 
will open in about five business days and extend through Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The price represents a 56 percent premium over Ekco's closing  
price Wednesday of $4.50 per share on the American Stock Exchange. 
The deal has been approved by Ekco's board of directors, but 
closure is subject to a majority of shareholders accepting the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekco stock surged on the news Thursday, closing up 50 percent,  
or $2.25, at $6.75 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	CCPC will assume about $150 million in Ekco debt, said Ekco's  
chief financial officer, Don DeNovellis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekco, which has seen its stock price dip as low as $2.81 in the  
past year, began looking for ways to ``maximize shareholder value'' 
several months ago. The sale to CCPC was the result, DeNovellis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred questions about possible layoffs to Corning Consumer  
Products. CCPC officials did not return calls Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekco makes metal bakeware under the brand names Ekco, Baker's  
Secret and Farberware, and also makes kitchen tools. Its products 
are sold everywhere from supermarkets and hardware stores to 
department stores and kitchen specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Corning Consumer Products makes glass and ceramic bakeware under  
the Corningware, Pyrex and Visions brands. It also makes Revere 
pots and Corelle dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Campanella, president and chief executive of Corning  
Consumer Products, said the sale would bring together two leaders 
in cookware. He also said Ekco's line of kitchen tools would 
complement the higher-end Oxo brand made by General Housewares 
Corp., which Corning Consumer Products announced Monday it would 
acquire for about $143 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Corning Consumer Products is a privately owned affiliate of  
Borden Inc., which provides significant management and financial 
control. Corning Consumer Products had sales of $553 million in 
fiscal 1998 and employs about 3,000 people. Its largest shareholder 
is investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekco, which also makes cleaning tools and household pest control  
products, posted sales of $328 million in fiscal 1998 and employs 
about 1,150 people.

<HEADLINE> Bids May Hit $1M for Domain Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What's in a name? At least $270,000 so far,  
and maybe more than $1 million if the name is Drugs.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric MacIver, a 21-year-old Internet entrepreneur in Mesa,  
Ariz., stands to reap the windfall from drug companies' bidding for 
rights to the Internet domain name to which he owns the exclusive 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Intense bidding under way for the name highlights the  
competition among companies seeking the right name to lure 
customers in the increasingly crowded world of electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday afternoon the highest confirmed bid was $270,000,  
but several large drug companies and well-heeled speculators have 
expressed an interest in bidding before the auction closes Friday 
evening, MacIver said in a telephone interview from his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to spell Bausch &AMP; Lomb, but if they get  
Drugs.com, as I see it, it helps brand their name,'' he said, 
referring to the big eye care products company. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys make hundreds of millions of dollars a year in this  
industry. There's one chance to get it. If I were in that industry 
I'd consider $1 million a bargain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Greatdomains.com, one of two online brokers  
handling the auction, said confidentially agreements prevented them 
from releasing names of bidders, or saying whether Bausch &AMP; Lomb 
was among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Several major companies have verbally committed to bids well  
above $270,000, however. Greatdomains, based in Los Angeles, and 
Dotbroker.com, the other broker involved in the sale, were in the 
process of confirming the bids on Wednesday, said Jeff Tinsley, 
Greatdomains' chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies require bidders to back up verbal bids with a  
written contract. The agreement then must be reviewed by the 
seller's attorneys before the bid becomes official. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies had inquired, but appeared to be waiting for the  
last day to better gauge the market, said Tinsley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids were expected to exceed $1 million, he said. In May, the  
name Wallstreet.com was sold for $1 million to a Venezuelan 
company. And last year Compaq Computer Corp. paid $3.35 million for 
the name AltaVista.com for its AltaVista search engine. Since then, 
Compaq sold a controlling stake in the search engine to the 
Internet investment company CMGI Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anticipating a big frenzy because we have been  
contacted by quite a few companies that are interested in making an 
offer: big drug companies, big venture capital companies,'' said 
Tinsley. 
</P>
<P>
	The activity is not surprising. Companies seeking an Internet  
presence are scrambling to find domain names that are easy to 
remember and likely to appeal to customers, said Preston Dodd, an 
analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York. But a successful 
site requires more than just a name. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of building the brand itself, there obviously could  
be a huge head start. It's even easier to remember than 
1-800-Flowers,'' said Dodd. ``It's not a silver bullet. They have 
to build a brand around it and they have to build awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, MacIver purchased on option to buy the name from Bonnie  
Neubeck, owner of a Minneapolis Internet marketing company. That 
deal means MacIver will get the lion's share of the auction price 
for Drugs.com. Mrs. Neubeck is entitled only to the option price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I'm not going to get all that money. I had the  
purchase price negotiated in May,'' said Mrs. Neubeck, who has sold 
other domain names for six-figure amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	She put the name up for sale several months ago, after watching  
the online pharmaceuticals market grow. At the time, MacIver's 
company, Sandline Productions, was planning to launch an online 
drug sales business. He later scrapped the plan and decided to put 
Drugs.com up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither she nor MacIver would say how much he paid to buy the  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from the sale will be plowed back into Sandline, a  
five-person Web site design and programming company MacIver founded 
18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to retire,'' he said. ``With the sale of this  
name, I'm just going to put it into Sandline and help it grow 
more.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan May Cancel Boeing 777 order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- Taiwan's flagship airline apparently has  
been told by the Taiwanese government to cancel an order for 12 
Boeing 777s in protest against the Clinton administration's 
mainland China policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had been expecting the $2 billion deal to be formally  
announced at any time. It has been working on it since Taiwan's 
China Airlines signed a letter of intent to buy the jets in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing congressional and industry sources, the Tacoma News  
Tribune reported today that instead, China Airlines is expected to 
announce a major purchase of A-340 planes from the European 
consortium Airbus Industrie, perhaps as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines is still expected to announce the purchase of 13  
Boeing 747s. 
</P>
<P>
	A China Airlines spokesman, commenting under the customary  
condition of anonymity, said the company does not like government 
interference and that he was not aware of any government decision 
to intervene on in the Boeing deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman also said that he was not aware if China Airlines  
is switching from Boeing to Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials were not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines ceased being Taiwan's flag carrier three years  
ago and operates as a private company. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent decision by Taiwan to use Boeing as a political  
pawn stems from the Clinton administration's reaction to comments 
made by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui about the ever-strained 
relationship between the island nation and mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 9, Lee said Taiwan and China should regard each other on  
a ``state to state'' basis, a statement Beijing saw as a step 
toward a declaration of independence by what it still considers a 
renegade province. But the United States has stood by its ``one 
China'' policy with the Beijing government in control. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing was characteristically tightlipped about the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``All the major Asian airlines have chosen 777s,'' said Marta  
Newhart, a Boeing spokeswoman in Seattle. ``Twelve (Asian) airlines 
have them on order. We believe it is the right airplane for China 
Airlines, but it is up to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., will be Taiwan-bound on Saturday in  
an effort to salvage the Boeing order. He has requested a meeting 
with Lee. Gorton met Wednesday with Stephen Chen, Taiwan's 
unofficial ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has been in  
``government-to-government'' contact with Taiwan about the 
situation, said Helaine Klasky, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade 
Representative Charlene Barshefsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky has ``communicated the view that such a decision  
should be based on technical and commercial merits,'' Klasky said.

<HEADLINE> Ripken's Back May Need Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken is convinced his second stint on the  
disabled list this season will last no longer than the required 15 
days, but he admitted that offseason surgery might be an option if 
his ailing back continues to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken woke up Sunday morning full of energy, but by the time he  
reached the breakfast table he was bent over in pain. He skipped 
the Baltimore Orioles' game against Seattle that day and was placed 
on the disabled list Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-time All-Star has since received a cortisone shot to  
alleviate the pain caused by back spasms. He was walking gingerly 
in the Baltimore clubhouse Thursday afternoon, dressed in street 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have every reason to believe the smartest thing is to get  
the inflammation out of there, continue to do the exercises and 
then go back and play,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have every confidence that I'll be ready to step back in  
after that time is up with a better body and be able to swing the 
bat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returns, Ripken will resume his quest to become the 29th  
player in baseball history to hit 400 homers (he has 399). He is 
also just 32 hits short of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken went on the disabled list the first time in his career on  
April 20. He returned on May 14 and said he experienced no back 
when whatsoever until Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came back when I least expected it to,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Now he has no idea whether he's stuck with a chronic problem,  
one that can be remedied only by surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if surgery was the magical answer it would present  
itself. If (the spasms) continue to reoccur, then you have look 
seriously at a way to stop it, and surgery appears to be an 
option,'' he said. ``I'm not convinced that's it at this point. But 
that becomes an option if I'm not able to go out and play or keep 
it from being inflamed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, played in a major league record 2,632 games until  
voluntarily ending his streak last September. This year he has 
proven to be a mere mortal, missing several games after being hit 
on the wrist with a pitch in addition to his initial two stints on 
the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost seems like two separate careers,'' he said. ``I was  
lucky enough to pound my back and hit it all these years; maybe 
what you're seeing now is the accumulation of all that pounding.''

<HEADLINE> Heat, Humidity Tough on Chickens / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Heat and humidity in recent weeks have  
been especially cruel to the poultry industry, with losses 
experienced by Mississippi growers estimated at up to 400,000 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week was our worst week statewide for the summer,'' said  
state Board of Animal Health Poultry Epidemiologist Danny Thornton. 
``But with the number of birds we have in the field, that's really 
not too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi Department of Agriculture figures show the state  
produced nearly 603 million chickens in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornton said in some cases, cooling systems used in many modern  
chicken houses failed due to power outages and mechanical problems. 
He said this, combined with the high humidity and blistering 
temperatures, killed a number of the chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace Morgan, head of the Poultry Science Department at  
Mississippi State University, said chickens do not sweat and must 
get rid of excess heat through their respiratory systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when the atmospheric heat is higher than their internal  
heat, they can't get rid of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan said heat-related chicken deaths are common during the  
summer months but that last week's losses were larger than usual, 
primarily because of the high humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his office approved about 20 mass burials last week for  
chickens killed by the heat. He said the burials were needed 
because normal disposal devices used by farmers were unable to 
handle the numbers involved. He said each of the mass graves 
contained more than 1,000 chicken bodies, with the largest holding 
up to 60,000.

	MANDAN, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota's wheat fields are an annual  
tourist attraction for wheat industry officials, researchers and 
others looking at yield and quality. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Wheat Quality Council spring and durum tour, which  
ended Thursday, found the hard red spring wheat crop in 
southeastern and south-central North Dakota trailing last year's 
crop in yield, and average or a bit below average in quality. 
</P>
<P>
	The average calculated yield of unharvested fields was projected  
at 29.5 bushels per acre Tuesday, the first day of the annual tour. 
That compares with an average of 31 bushels in 1998 and 31.2 
bushels in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheat tour concluded in the Red River Valley. More than 60  
people participated, including wheat promotion council officials, 
researchers, grain buyers and marketers, millers and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's projected yield is lower than actual yields  
throughout the region for any year between 1992 and 1998. 
Projections vary widely, however, from field to field, and from 
county to county, because of factors such as moisture, weeds and 
signs of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, tour participants found disease problems more intense  
in the east. But they said projected yields are closer to average 
or above average in the east and fall off to below average in 
south-central areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the best-looking wheat was found in northeastern South  
Dakota, where projected yields were reported at 3.6 bushels to 2.5 
bushels above the 1998 crop. But in North Dakota, participants 
found little to get excited about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was average, very average,'' said Mike Hardy, of  
Spring Wheat Bakers in Fargo.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Shaw A True Throwback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He didn't play for money, because there wasn't much to be had.  
He didn't play for recognition, because offensive linemen seldom 
get much of that either. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Buffalo Bills offensive guard Billy Shaw played football  
because he loved the game and loved his team. That's all there was 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could go out there as old as I am and play the way I once  
could, I'd do it,'' said Shaw, who goes into the Hall of Fame 
Saturday after a career that spanned most of the American Football 
League's decade of existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the best offensive linemen we ever had,'' said  
Bills owner Ralph Wilson, one of the original AFL owners, a group 
dubbed ``The Foolish Club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw enters the Hall with Eric Dickerson, Ozzie Newsome,  
Lawrence Taylor and fellow offensive lineman Tom Mack. Shaw and 
O.J. Simpson are the only former Bills to be inducted into the 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 60, born in Natchez, Miss., and raised in Vicksburg,  
Miss., ranks among the greatest Georgia Tech linemen, playing both 
ways at tackle from 1957-61 and earning All-America and 
All-Southeastern Conference honors. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes the first Hall of Famer to have spent his entire  
career in the AFL, which merged into the NFL in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel humbled to represent all of those guys in the Hall,''  
Shaw said. ``I represent a lot of guys who made some sacrifices to 
play in a new league with some uncertainty in the beginning but 
with a faith that it was going to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 119 games over nine seasons, seven times captain and most  
valuable lineman, he helped lead Buffalo to AFL championships in 
1964-65. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Bills offense that emphasized the run, and playing before  
rules changes allowed offensive linemen to use their hands, Shaw 
was a proficient pass and run blocker. He was named to the All-AFL 
first team from 1962-1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw played only nine years, retiring after the 1969 season.  
``My family and I had an agreement back when we started first of 
all that I would never abuse football, a game that I dearly love, 
and that I would never let football abuse my family, which I love 
more,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being a second-team All-AFL selection in 1968 and '69,  
Shaw was disappointed in his play and decided to leave the game. 
``I felt that my play in 1968 and '69 didn't show the kind of 
improvement that I thought was necessary,'' he said. ``My family 
was growing. We had two children by that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Shaw's daughters had started school, and split time  
between Buffalo and the family's home in Louisiana. ``I was not 
going to hang around just for the sake of hanging around,'' Shaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The money wasn't worth hanging around for; Shaw made $11,000 in  
each of his first two seasons and never made as much as $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had I been single, my outlook might have been different,'' he  
said. ``Sometimes you just have to set some principles and live by 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Shaw retired after the 1969 season, the Houston Oilers, who  
had lost both of their starting guards, made him an offer of three 
years for more money than he had made in all previous nine years 
combined. But he turned it down for reasons having nothing to do 
with money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not envision myself putting on somebody else's  
uniform,'' he said. ``I was a Buffalo Bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest moments include lopsided wins over the San Diego  
Chargers in the title games in 1964 and '65 when he faced Ernie 
Ladd, 6-foot-10 and 330 pounds. ``Biggest player in football,'' 
Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw also loved the fans. ``They were as faithful as faithful  
can be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps his most uncomfortable moment was having to share a  
plane with the archrival Boston Patriots. ``Back in those days all 
the teams tried to save a little money,'' Shaw said. ``We flew with 
Boston to the West Coast one time. That was pretty tough. We didn't 
like Boston, and Boston didn't like us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was an average-sized guard at 255, a dwarf by today's  
behemoth standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the guys are 6-6 and well over 300 pounds,'' Shaw said.  
``We weren't nearly as big as guys are today mainly because we had 
to be extremely mobile because of the running game. Today, there's 
more passing and more drive blocking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus we had to use our heads. That's why my head is bald and  
has knots all over it.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Mulls Funds for Reservations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission proposed  
on Thursday spending more money to entice phone and wireless 
carriers to expand their services to underserved areas, 
particularly American Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, in its first comprehensive study of the problem,  
also considered ways to help the poor pay for phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners lamented what they called the agency's failure to  
fulfill its mandate by leaving Native Americans without phone 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shameful that we enter the 21st century when the basic  
telecommunications services of the 20th century are not enjoyed by 
the nation's oldest people,'' the FCC's chairman, Bill Kennard, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about half of American Indian homes have telephones,  
compared with nearly 95 percent of all American homes, Kennard 
said. A report in April by the Benton Foundation, a nonprofit 
public policy group, found that on some reservations, just 20 
percent of the homes had telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC held hearings on the matter earlier this year on Indian  
reservations and wants to look at the factors impeding efforts to 
improve phone service. Also, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo, 
chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, has urged the FCC 
to expedite action to bring services to American Indian 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Susan Ness said she was stunned by the great need  
for phone service. ``It's terrible that we've waited so long to do 
it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because some reservations lack phone lines, wireless and  
satellite services offer other ways to get telecommunication 
services to reservations, Kennard said. The commission is looking 
at incentives, such as discounted licenses, to encourage wireless 
carriers to expand their services. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials may also relax certain limits on the height and power  
of wireless transmission towers -- specifications that were designed 
for an urban environment, but may not provide effective service on 
a reservation or rural land. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications  
Industry Association, said action by the FCC to remove regulatory 
hurdles could help bring wireless services to reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the public, industry and others could comment on the  
proposals before they become final.

<HEADLINE> Life Expectancy at 76.5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans' life expectancy was 76.5 years in  
1997, up from 76.1 the year before as death rates from HIV, heart 
disease, cancer, stroke and homicide declined. 
</P>
<P>
	White women had the highest life expectancy at 79.9 years,  
followed by black women (74.7), white men (74.3), and black men 
(67.2), according to statistics released Thursday by the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap between whites and blacks was down from 6.6 years in  
1996 to 6 in 1997. Between men and women, the gap narrowed from 6 
years to 5.8 during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said 2,314,245 people died in the United States in 1997.  
That was 445 fewer than a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Report: Los Alamos Probe 'Flawed' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI's espionage case against a Los Alamos  
weapons scientist was ``flawed from the outset'' because 
authorities identified a number of other suspects, but failed to 
investigate them, a congressional report revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also disclosed for the first time that in a polygraph  
test in February when the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was asked if he 
had passed nuclear secrets ``to any unauthorized person,'' he 
failed the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the leaders of the Senate Governmental Affairs  
Committee outlined a string of missteps, communications lapses and 
misunderstandings over three years that prevented the FBI from 
establishing a strong case against the Taiwan-born scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings summarized information gathered during two  
closed-door hearings the committee held on the federal 
investigation into Lee. He was fired from his top-secret job last 
March after being the primary suspect since 1996 in the alleged 
theft by China of secrets involving the sophisticated W-88 nuclear 
warhead in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with a crime, although a federal grand  
jury was hearing evidence in the ongoing case. In his only public 
comments, Lee in a television interview last Sunday categorically 
denied providing nuclear secrets to China or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate report disclosed that last February, Lee was  
asked during an FBI polygraph test whether he had every given 
specific classified computer code related to weapons testing, or 
``passed W-88 information to any authorized person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wen Ho Lee failed this polygraph test,'' said the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked this morning if she had seen the report, Attorney General  
Janet Reno said she had not had time to examine the details. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-page report provided new details on the FBI's failed  
attempts to get Justice Department approval to search Lee's office 
computer. The effort, however, was made more difficult in part 
because of FBI bungling, the report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as 1996, a series of misunderstandings between an FBI  
field agent and Los Alamos officials failed to make clear that 
apparently Lee had agreed on his computer being searched and that 
his computer, in fact, carried a ``banner'' warning such searches 
could be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to provide accurate information to senior FBI and  
Justice officials had ``significiant implications for the course of 
the Lee espionage investigation,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, investigators finally searched Lee's computer and  
found he had transfered thousands of top-secret computer code files 
from the Los Alamos highly secured computer system to his 
unclassified office computer that was linked to the Internet. It 
has not been determined whether any of the data ever left the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Justice Department's office that reviewed  
requests for the Lee computer search described the case as ``flawed 
from the outset'' because the FBI had focused almost exclusively on 
Lee and his wife, also a Los Alamos employee, while other suspects 
were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DOE and Bureau had (multiple) suspects, and only two were  
investigated,'' Justice attorney Allan Kornblum told the Senate 
committee, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	These other suspects also had access to the secret information  
at Los Alamos, traveled to China, had contacts with Chinese 
scientists visiting the New Mexico lab, and fit the profile that 
made Lee a prime suspect, the report said. Still, they were not 
investigated in any detail, although the FBI questioned some of 
them earlier this year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Happy McGwire Drops Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark McGwire hit a home run for kids and parents by saying he's  
off androstenedione, doctors and the White House drug czar say. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they want to see baseball ban andro for good.  
</P>
<P>
	``The message Mark McGwire sends to our young people by walking  
away from this substance is a powerful one,'' Barry R. McCaffrey, 
the White House drug policy director, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all need to be aware that just because a superstar stops  
using andro, the problem doesn't just go away. Countless young 
people still take this potentially dangerous substance -- banned by 
the NFL, the Olympics, the NCAA and professional tennis -- in order 
to improve their athletic performance. We must continue to focus on 
the risks at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the year that has passed since The Associated Press reported  
that McGwire was using androstenedione during his 70-homer season, 
sales of the testosterone booster surged more than 1,000 percent to 
more than $50 million, according to industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy access to the over-the-counter supplement through the  
Internet and nutrition stores worried doctors that thousands of 
young people might be risking long-term illness. Andro 
manufacturers say more than 100 player in the majors and minors are 
using the supplement, which converts to testosterone in the body 
and is considered an anabolic steroid by most steroid specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he was unhappy being cast as the poster boy for  
andro, even though he wasn't breaking any baseball rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought long and hard about it, and I don't like the way it  
was portrayed, like I was the endorser of the product, which I 
wasn't,'' McGwire said as he disclosed before hitting his 499th 
career homer in St. Louis on Wednesday that he stopped taking andro 
four months ago. ``But young kids take it because of me. I don't 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discourage young people from taking it.''  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire addressed the subject again Thursday, saying he will  
never again take andro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe there's nothing wrong with it,'' he said.  
``But if I have a message for kids, it's that you don't necessarily 
have to follow what somebody who's in the public eye does. If 
you're an adult, you elect to choose your own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the fact that some young high school kids think  
they need to do something to follow in the steps of a professional 
athlete. But when you're an adult, you can make your own 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire didn't explain why he waited four months to say he was  
dropping andro if he wanted to send out the message to youngsters. 
When he arrived in spring training, he adamantly said he would 
continue using the supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's four months' worth of kids who took andro because of  
him,'' said Dr. Gary Wadler, a leading steroid specialist at NYU 
Medical School and a consultant to several professional sports. 
``I'm delighted he said it today, rather than never saying it at 
all, but I would have preferred he said it at the beginning of the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wade Exum, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee's drug control  
program, also applauded McGwire's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great,'' Exum said. ``I can't say it'll help  
tremendously because it's somewhat after the fact. But if he's not 
using the stuff, and he's still having a helluva season, then maybe 
the message will counterbalance some of the things that went on 
last year. The problem is after last year, the sales of that stuff 
jumped. All you can do now is follow the sales and see if they go 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's use of andro through the winter and spring training,  
though, may have given him a competitive edge that would help him 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the whole basis for year-round, out-of-competition  
testing,'' Wadler said. ``People in other sports were very savvy to 
announced drug testing, so what they did was take a lot of this 
stuff, bulk up, and when the season started they stopped. They 
continued to work out and derive much of the benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Iowa State study of andro published a few months ago showed  
that in small doses andro didn't increase strength, but still might 
lead to heart disease and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with that study is that is not how people tend to  
use these things,'' Wadler said. ``They usually take many multiples 
of the recommended daily dose, 10 to 100 times what's on the label. 
Anybody who thinks people taking andro with the eye toward 
improving performance or developing musculature are not taking 
multiples is kind of putting their head in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he took a lot, and he took it many times a day, and he did  
it for a long time, he could derive the benefits, which is 
increased muscle mass in conjunction with weightlifting, and he 
could have a carryover through the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger problem for baseball, Wadler said, is the issue of  
whether andro is just a tiny part of anabolic steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time now for baseball to step up to the plate. Baseball  
needs to get its act together and stop nipping around the edges. It 
has to get to the heart of the matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, Wadler said, involves banning andro and similar  
substances, and testing for the whole range of anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think baseball has steroid abuse in it? If it didn't, it  
would be the first sport that we know of at a high level where 
there was no steroid use,'' Wadler said. ``There may not be a whole 
lot of people, but to think they're immune from the behaviors that 
we see in all kinds of other sports is the ultimate of naivete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, neither baseball commissioner Bud Selig nor union  
officials have shown a willingness yet to ban andro or test for 
anabolic steroids. A Harvard study of andro, commissioned by 
baseball, is still months from release, and no decision is expected 
before that.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department announced this morning  
that new claims for unemployment insurance rose by 4,000 to 279,000 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department will announce second-quarter productivity  
numbers at 10 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday, the Commerce Department announced that orders to  
factories, bolstered by higher demand for autos and electronic 
equipment, rose 0.7 percent in June in a fresh sign of recovery for 
the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
	This 10th increase in the last 13 months followed a 1 percent  
gain in May, the Commerce Department said. Many analysts expected 
factory orders to rise by 0.4 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the factory sector continues to show signs of a  
jagged recovery, but it appears to be on an improving path,'' said 
economist Lynn Reaser with Bank of America Private Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in orders for autos and car parts more than offset a  
decrease in demand for airplane and aircraft parts and contributed 
to a 2.3 percent increase in orders for all transportation products 
in June. That was down from a hefty 9.9 percent gain the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders  
still would have risen a solid 0.5 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are surprisingly good,'' said National Association  
of Manufacturers economist Gordon Richards, adding that factory 
orders are running 4.1 percent higher than in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, the  
category that includes household appliances and communications 
equipment, rose 2.4 percent in June following a drop of 0.9 percent 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain in June factory orders came despite a steep,  
5.1 percent decrease in orders for industrial machinery and 
equipment, the sector that includes computers. It was the second 
straight monthly decline. In May, orders for industrial machinery 
fell 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the U.S. manufacturers are gradually recovering  
from a global financial crisis, which dampened overseas demand for 
U.S. goods and increased competition from a flood of cheaper 
imports. Since March 1998, about 488,000 manufacturing jobs have 
been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported  
Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the 
sixth straight month, but not as strongly as most analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's report also offered some positive signs for the  
steel industry. Orders for primary metals, the category that 
includes steel, rose 0.4 percent in June, following gains in April 
and May. The steel industry has been one of the hardest hit by the 
Asian crisis, suffering from a flood of cheaper imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at  
least three years -- also went up in June, rising 0.4 percent. It 
was the 10th increase in the last 13 months. And, orders for 
nondurable goods, such as food and fuel also increased, posting a 
1.2 percent gain, following a 0.9 percent gain in May.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Ala. Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A man allegedly shot two co-workers to death  
at their office Thursday, then killed a third person at a company 
where he used to work, a burst of workplace violence just one week 
after the Atlanta office massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Eugene Miller, 34, was arrested shortly after the shootings  
when police spotted him on nearby Interstate 65 and forced him to 
pull over. He briefly scuffled with officers, and a gun was found 
in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was charged with three counts of capital murder. The  
motive was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelham, a suburb of about 10,000 people in the wooded hills  
south of Birmingham, is a mix of upscale subdivisions, commercial 
districts and rural farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Allan Wade said Miller worked at Ferguson  
Enterprises, a heating and air conditioning company where the first 
two victims were shot to death. They were identified as Lee 
Holdbrooks, 32, and Christopher Yancy, 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived at Ferguson at 7:04 a.m. Officers were still  
securing the crime scene 13 minutes later when dispatchers got a 
second emergency call -- this time about a shooting at Post Airgas 
Inc., a company that sells helium, oxygen and other gases several 
miles from Ferguson Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The third victim, Terry Jarvis, 39, was found at Post Airgas.  
</P>
<P>
	Wade said the gunman at Post Airgas matched the description of  
the suspect who fled Ferguson Enterprises and whose car was seen 
entering I-65. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody around here is just regular working people,'' said  
Cathy McKay, owner of a carpet store across the street from Post 
Airgas. ``You feel safe coming out here at night. The shooting, she 
said, ``is just beyond my comprehension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is from Billingsley, a rural town 50 miles south of  
Pelham, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
	At his Billingsley home, Miller's mother, Barbara Miller, said  
he ``went off to work just as he always does this morning. He left 
here like he always does, with a 7-Up and a couple of things of 
biscuits and sausage. Alan didn't bother anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors had differing views of Miller; some said he was  
friendly, while others thought he was argumentative. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't strike you as a fellow who would do something like  
they say he has done,'' Ricky Williams said. Allen Shaffer said 
he'd had arguments with Miller about property lines. ``We didn't 
get along,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings came one week after frustrated investor Mark O.  
Barton killed nine people and wounded 13 others at two brokerage 
firms in Atlanta in one of the worst office massacres in United 
States history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Herder, a day trader who had worked with Barton and was  
wounded in his rampage, was released from the hospital Wednesday 
and found the Pelham shootings a troubling repeat of the Atlanta 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really frightening that all of a sudden that someone is  
copying this,'' he said. ``I can't believe some idiot has started 
to copy it.''

<HEADLINE> Ripken's Back May Need Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken is convinced his second stint on the  
disabled list this season will last no longer than the required 15 
days, but he admitted that offseason surgery might be an option if 
his ailing back continues to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken woke up Sunday morning full of energy, but by the time he  
reached the breakfast table he was bent over in pain. He skipped 
the Baltimore Orioles' game against Seattle that day and was placed 
on the disabled list Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-time All-Star has since received a cortisone shot to  
alleviate the pain caused by back spasms. He was walking gingerly 
in the Baltimore clubhouse Thursday afternoon, dressed in street 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have every reason to believe the smartest thing is to get  
the inflammation out of there, continue to do the exercises and 
then go back and play,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have every confidence that I'll be ready to step back in  
after that time is up with a better body and be able to swing the 
bat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returns, Ripken will resume his quest to become the 29th  
player in baseball history to hit 400 homers (he has 399). He is 
also just 32 hits short of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken went on the disabled list the first time in his career on  
April 20. He returned on May 14 and said he experienced no back 
when whatsoever until Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came back when I least expected it to,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Now he has no idea whether he's stuck with a chronic problem,  
one that can be remedied only by surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if surgery was the magical answer it would present  
itself. If (the spasms) continue to reoccur, then you have look 
seriously at a way to stop it, and surgery appears to be an 
option,'' he said. ``I'm not convinced that's it at this point. But 
that becomes an option if I'm not able to go out and play or keep 
it from being inflamed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, played in a major league record 2,632 games until  
voluntarily ending his streak last September. This year he has 
proven to be a mere mortal, missing several games after being hit 
on the wrist with a pitch in addition to his initial two stints on 
the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost seems like two separate careers,'' he said. ``I was  
lucky enough to pound my back and hit it all these years; maybe 
what you're seeing now is the accumulation of all that pounding.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban High Jumper Denies Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Saying he was the unwitting victim of a ``dirty  
trick,'' Cuban high jumper Javier Sotomayor angrily disputed the 
positive cocaine test that cost him his Pan American Games gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am innocent,'' the world record-holder told foreign  
reporters as he left his home Thursday in the fashionable Miramar 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published and broadcast by Cuba's state media,  
Sotomayor said he doesn't even take vitamins. He pointed out that 
countless previous drug tests at competitions and by Cuba's 
official sports doctors had all showed negative results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have only seen that substance in the movies,'' Sotomayor  
said about cocaine in an interview with the Communist Party daily 
Granma. ``I am the victim of a maneuver, a dirty trick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotomayor case is the biggest drug scandal in track and  
field since Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was suspended and 
stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for an anabolic 
steroid at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Sotomayor has talked only to Cuba's  
government-controlled media, which stand behind his claims of 
innocence. Cuban officials have charged that Sotomayor was framed, 
and that the cocaine must have been slipped into his food or drink 
before the competition as part of a plot by Cuba's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My conviction is that there are foreign interests set to harm  
us,'' Jose Ramon Fernandez, the president of the Cuban Olympic 
Committee, said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. 
``What is the hairy, ugly, powerful hand behind this? We do not 
know yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not suspect the doctors, but I do suspect that there is a  
manipulation,'' he added. ``I think it is a maneuver against Cuba 
through Sotomayor by enemies of Cuba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Pan Am medical officials, though, all that matters is that  
the drug was in Sotomayor's urine. They said they don't question 
how it got there. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor record-holder and the  
only high jumper to clear 8 feet, won his fourth Pan Am gold in the 
high jump Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the drug test results, he was stripped of the medal  
and suspended for two years. That makes him ineligible for this 
month's World Track and Field Championships and next year's 
Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are expected to appeal the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	Revered by athletes and fans throughout the world, the  
track-and-field hero is now pursued by a dark cloud of suspicion. 
His absence will leave the sport without one of its most 
recognizable names. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was the third athlete -- all gold medalists -- to test  
positive at the games. Canada's in-line roller hockey team lost its 
gold medal after goalie Steve Vezina's positive test. The Dominican 
Republic's Juana Rosario Arrendel, the women's high-jump winner, 
lost her prize as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's urine sample showed a reading consistent with a  
person who uses cocaine, Pan Am medical chief Eduardo de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recreational drug use remains rare in Cuba, and is frowned upon  
by Fidel Castro's government, which considers it a negative 
byproduct of capitalism. But drug use has grown in recent years 
with an increase of tourism to the island nation.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits inched up last week after hitting their 
lowest level in two years the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that 279,000 Americans filed  
new claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 31, up by 
4,000 from the previous week. Last week's level was the highest 
since July 17, when claims were at 315,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobless claims had plunged by 40,000 to 275,000, the lowest  
level in two years, for the week ending July 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out  
week-to-week volatility, was down a little to 295,000 last week. 
That was the lowest level since March 27 when claims were at 
293,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's increase was slightly less than some economists  
expected but still kept claims at a level indicating the nation's 
job market remains exceptionally healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists expect the nation's unemployment rate -- now at  
4.3 percent -- will return to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent when the 
government releases its July unemployment report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That results of that report are expected to offer an important  
clue as to whether the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates 
again when it meets later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists fear that as employers woo workers with higher wages  
and benefits, the higher labor costs could lead to higher prices. 
Thus far, that hasn't happened and inflation has remained low. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in productivity -- the output per hour of work -- and  
competition from overseas are credited with keeping prices in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said the central bank is keeping  
a watchful eye on all this and stands ready to raise interest rates 
at the first glimpse of inflation. The Fed nudged up rates on June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that for the week ending July  
24, six states and territories reported increases in jobless 
claims, while 47 had decreases. The state data lag a week behind 
the national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in applications for jobless  
benefits was Ohio, up 6,286, a gain officials blamed on layoffs in 
the transportation equipment industry. Other states reporting 
increases were: Maine, 224; Washington, 130; Colorado, 92; and 
Georgia, up 48. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan recorded the biggest decrease, 22,777, which was  
attributed to fewer layoffs in the automobile industry. Other 
states with large decreases were: New York, 6,864; South Carolina, 
6,169; Alabama, 5,470; and Illinois, down 4,948.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Coach Admits to Affair </HEADLINE>

	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama coach Mike DuBose on Thursday  
admitted to having an extramarital affair with a former secretary 
and apologized for misleading the public with earlier statements

<HEADLINE> Net Provider Targets Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Matt Hutchins thinks most businesses have  
apartment dwellers figured all wrong, which is why competitors in 
the high-speed Internet access market have overlooked a potential 
gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of homeownership to many companies signals lower income.  
But Hutchins is betting that assumption is off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who live in these apartments are young, urban  
professionals. They have a higher-than-average income and they're 
almost three times as likely to go online as the rest of the 
population,'' said Hutchins, president of I3S, which specializes in 
providing high-speed Internet access and content to apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irving company is looking for part of the emerging market  
that it hopes will be ignored by the two giants that dominate 
high-speed cable access to houses, Excite At Home, which is 
majority owned by AT&AMP;T, and Roadrunner, a joint venture between 
Time Warner and MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately held I3S has fewer than 1,000 subscribers, but like  
other Internet entrepreneurs, Hutchins is convinced the market and 
his company will grow exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say there may be some logic to I3S's strategy, but they  
also suspect the owners may be angling to attract an acquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is sort of a classic case of the 90-10 rule,  
where 90 percent of the market will be served by 10 percent of the 
players, or, in this case, the top two players,'' said Shaun 
Andrikopoulos, an analyst in San Francisco for Bankers Trust New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of opportunity for  
the smaller players,'' he said. ``And down the road, they become 
acquisition targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in the competition is access to homes. Roadrunner  
and At Home are owned by cable companies, giving them a powerful 
competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``They own the customers,'' Andrikopoulos said. ``It's not about  
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its own pursuit of customers, I3S has negotiated with real  
estate investment trusts and other companies that own large numbers 
of apartment complexes. Operating in several markets in Texas and 
California, the company hopes to reach 3 million apartments by year 
end, including expanding its cable-modem and digital subscriber 
line service into New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Cleland, an analyst for Legg Mason Precursor Group, said  
I3S's play for the apartment niche is intriguing -- but perhaps its 
only option. 
</P>
<P>
	``In their bread-and-butter market, At Home and Roadrunner are  
very formidable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Befitting a company that is filling an unusual niche in the  
Internet-service market, I3S itself is an unlikely product of a 
more traditional business. 
</P>
<P>
	It was started by brothers Jim and Bo Price, who bought the  
computer division of typewriter company Olympia USA from Daimler 
Benz in 1994 and rechristened it I3S, which originally stood for 
Innovative Integrated Information Services. They stripped away much 
of the company but kept its engineering group. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company began as an Internet service provider for  
business clients, but according to Jim Price, the chairman and 
chief executive, it hit on the idea that upscale apartment owners 
would gladly offer tenants high-speed Internet access as a valued 
new-age amenity. 
</P>
<P>
	They began selling their idea to property owners, including  
large real estate investment trusts, private cable operators and 
GTE Media Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our strategy has been to partner -- we partner with the owner  
of the property or, in some cases, a local utility,'' Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	I3S is is looking to expand into the office-building and hotel  
markets, although analysts warned that those markets are already 
very competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Price said the 80-employee company is well-financed and  
debt-free, but added, ``We may be looking at a public offering in 
the near future.''

	McGwire Joins 500, 501 Club  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire became the 16th member of the  
500-home run club tonight, beating Tony Gwynn to his 3,000-hit 
milestone with a third-inning shot to dead center field. Later, he 
hit No. 501, with both home runs coming off San Diego's Andy Ashby. 
McGwire became the fastest player ever to reach 500 homers, doing 
it in his 5,487th at-bat. Babe Ruth held the previous mark, having 
done it in 5,801 at-bats. The solo shots gave McGwire 44 homers 
this year, moving him two ahead of Sammy Sosa for the major league 
lead. McGwire tops the NL with 101 RBIs.

	Nev. Wildfires Burn 500 Square Miles  
</P>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters from across the country today  
attacked scores of lightning-sparked fires that have blackened 
nearly 500 square miles of Nevada range, threatening ranches and 
burning closer to homes. No injuries were reported and only one 
structure -- a storage shed -- was destroyed. The estimated 78 fires 
-- which have burned an area about a third the size of Rhode Island 
-- were sparked by more than 8,000 lightning strikes in Nevada 
during a 12-hour period yesterday.

	Congress Passes $792B Tax Cut Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton promises to veto the  
10-year, $792 billion tax cut that Republican narrowly won passage 
of today. The Senate voted 50-49 for the final package a few hours 
after the House passed it 221-206. With little chance of becoming 
law, the bill could serve mainly as a defining issue between 
Republicans and Democrats in the 2000 struggle for control of 
Congress and the race for the White House. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate OKs Cybersquatting Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed a bill tonight to limit  
``cybersquatting,'' a practice in which people register Internet 
domain names so they can later sell them. Domain names are the 
addresses to access Web sites. Some people have found a lucrative 
practice in registering Web addresses using the trademarks of 
famous companies in hopes of later forcing the companies to pay 
sizable amounts of money to buy the name rights. The bill would 
allow trademark owners to recover statutory damages when it is 
proven that a trademarked name was registered by a person who 
intended to unfairly profit from its sale.

	Man Charged in Alabama Shootings  
</P>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A man allegedly shot two co-workers to death  
at their office today, then killed a third person at a company 
where he used to work, in a burst of workplace violence just one 
week after the Atlanta office massacre. Alan Eugene Miller, 34, was 
arrested shortly after the shootings when police spotted him on 
nearby Interstate 65 and forced him to pull over. He briefly 
scuffled with officers, and a gun was found in his car. Miller was 
charged with three counts of capital murder. The motive was 
unclear.

	Heart Disease, Stroke Deaths Down  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Deaths from heart disease and stroke continue to  
decline because of greater awareness of causes and preventive 
measures, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 
today. However, heart disease and stroke remain leading causes of 
disability and death, and estimated costs including health 
expenditures and lost productivity are expected to be $286 billion 
in 1999, the CDC said. Death rates from coronary and hypertensive 
heart disease and rheumatic heart disease have decreased from a 
peak of 307.4 per 100,000 in 1950 to 134.6 in 1996, a decline of 56 
percent, the CDC said. Stroke deaths have decreased 70 percent in 
that time, from 88.8 per 100,000 in 1950 to 26.5 in 1996, the 
agency said.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks continued to slide Friday as the  
Nikkei fell 76.33 to 17,281.86 in early trading, this after 
shedding 327.19 points Thursday. In New York, stocks managed their 
strongest rally in more than a week as the Dow industrials closed

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Penny Hardaway was dealt to the Phoenix Suns,  
Dell Curry burned the Bucks by bolting to Toronto and Calbert 
Cheaney turned down a trade to Miami and signed with Boston 
instead. It was another busy day of player movement in the NBA, 
with no move bigger than the one sending Hardaway to the Suns for 
Danny Manning, Pat Garrity and two first-round draft picks.

<HEADLINE> Andretti Anticipating Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Michael Andretti would rather be in front. Still,  
he's comfortable coming up through the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why he could be a major factor in Sunday's Tenneco  
Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a fourth-place finish in the U.S. 500 on July 25 for  
the Newman/Haas team at Michigan Speedway, Andretti currently 
stands third in the CART FedEx Series championship race with 107 
points. He trails rookie Juan Montoya, who has four wins and 129 
points, and Dario Franchitti, who has 116 points. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the 14th time in his 16 years in the series that  
Andretti has topped 100 points. But that's not why he could be a 
force on the temporary road course around Belle Isle. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti has won more races (38), more poles (32) and led more  
laps (6.057) than any other active driver. He has earned 25 of his 
wins on street courses like the one on Belle Isle. 
</P>
<P>
	And, perhaps most important of all, Andretti has won this race  
twice, in 1990 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really looking forward to this race,'' Andretti said  
Thursday. ``It is always an important race for us because it is 
Kmart and Ford's hometown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guess who two of Andretti's biggest sponsors might be.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite Andretti's high hopes, Montoya is the likely favorite in  
this race. Montoya, the only driver with more than one victory this 
season -- he has four -- has won on the short oval at Nazareth, 
finished second in the U.S. 500 at Michigan, and won on street 
courses at Long Beach and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly he doesn't seem to matter what kind of course he runs  
on, which gives Andretti reason for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working hard to get our cars working well on street  
courses and we were competitive in the last race at Toronto,'' 
Andretti said. 
</P>
<P>
	His two wins in Detroit were as different as they could be.  
</P>
<P>
	``The 1990 race was like a dream race because we almost lapped  
second place,'' Andretti said. ``That was very different from 1996, 
when I really shouldn't have won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That year, he was running second behind Christian Fittipaldi.  
When Fittipaldi went wide on the last restart, Andretti got by him. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Detroit course is so tight, passing is difficult. As  
a result, qualifying could be vital. Montoya, for example, has 
started on the pole four times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Practice and qualifying Friday and Saturday are very important  
days,'' Andretti said. ``If you want to win here, you almost have 
to start near the front row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite changes to the course to try to make it easier for the  
competitors to pass, most of the 72-lap event on the 2.346-mile, 
14-turn circuit looked more like a parade than a race last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Zanardi, who led 50 of the 72 laps, won the Detroit race  
last season. But he won't be around to defend his title. Zanardi is 
racing the Formula One circuit this year.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Sharpe May Play in Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Denver Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe  
has no serious damage to his ankle and may play in Sunday's 
American Bowl against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who has fiercely criticized the game being played in  
Australia, strained the ankle during practice Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended Friday's light run but did not take part.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's much improved on yesterday and we'll have a better  
feeling about it after tomorrow's practice,'' Broncos coach Mike 
Shanahan said. ``We may not make a decision until game time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will contest the 33rd American Bowl in Sydney on  
Sunday morning, which will be Saturday night in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan tried to play down Sharpe's comments from Thursday,  
when the seven-time Pro Bowl player complained about the rudeness 
of Australians. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sharpe was roundly criticized on radio talk shows and in  
local newspapers -- he was called a 250-pound gorilla by one shock 
jock -- Shanahan said he had enjoyed a different experience Down 
Under. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are probably the friendliest group of people I've ever  
met,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said Sharpe was allowed his  
opinion. ``But to say Australia is deficient in hospitality is like 
saying there's not enough sand in the Sahara or enough snow on the 
Rockies,'' Saccomano said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sharpe's constant sniping has at least given him some  
profile in a city previously oblivious to his existence, he appears 
out of step with most other players on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're having a nice time and it's just the time change that's  
been a problem,'' San Diego cornerback Dwayne Harper said. ``The 
people have been good to us, no one here's been complaining and 
we're just trying to enjoy Sydney and the new experience. I think 
it's great to be able to come and experience another country.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Says He Hasn't Taken Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire is hitting home runs in bunches  
again, and without androstenedione giving him a controversial 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before he hit career home run No. 499 and his 42nd of the  
season to tie Sammy Sosa for the major league lead, the St. Louis 
Cardinals' slugger disclosed Wednesday that he hasn't taken the 
over-the-counter dietary supplement for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire revealed his decision about a year after his use of  
andro became public. That disclosure prompted widespread criticism 
and some speculation that his 70-homer season was tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's reasoning: He did it for the kids.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought long and hard about it and I don't like the way it  
was portrayed like I was the endorser of the product, which I 
wasn't,'' McGwire said. ``I don't like how it's portrayed, but 
young kids take it because of me. I don't like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire knows he's a role model, and that was perhaps the  
biggest reason for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discourage young people from taking it,'' he said. ``If  
you're old enough and you have your own mind, you can do whatever 
you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman praised McGwire's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mark's focus is on contributions to society,'' Coleman said.  
``He leads by example. The youth of the world are well served by 
Mark's value structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, McGwire refused to address the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not talk about that,'' he said. ``Come on, I said what I  
said before the game and that's all I'm going to comment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa and teammates felt a sense of validation  
to McGwire's 42 homers this season and to his 70-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is such a ridiculous part of the McGwire story,'' La  
Russa said angrily. ``He's at 499 and what's andro do with it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Injured outfielder Eric Davis said McGwire's performance should  
quiet the critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know too much about it, but if he says he's off it and  
he's got 42 homers, what's that say?'' Davis said. ``He hit 49 his 
rookie year, when testosterone probably wasn't even available. Give 
the man a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres didn't want to touch the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any reaction,'' manager Bruce Bochy said.  
``That's his personal business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closer Trevor Hoffman said he didn't know anything about the  
subject, and outfielder John Vander Wal said simply: ``It's up to 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione is metabolized into testosterone, which is  
considered a steroid. It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the 
NFL, and the men's and women's tennis tours, though it is permitted 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's admission that he used andro sparked a tenfold  
increase in sales of the supplement last fall, much of it through 
the Internet, and led many steroid experts to warn of serious 
health consequences for teen-agers who take it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has commissioned a study of andro by  
Harvard scientists. No decision is expected until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in process. They're working on it,'' commissioner Bud  
Selig said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, McGwire acknowledged to The Associated Press that  
he had used andro for more than a year. Colorado's Dante Bichette 
was among a group of other players who said they took it. 
</P>
<P>
	As spring training opened this year, McGwire said andro was  
legal and that it had ``absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said then he took it to get through late-season workouts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't endorse the product and I never did,'' he said then.  
``Someone stuck their nose in my locker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's recent statistics appear to show that he's fine  
without andro. Including Wednesday's shot, he has homered 15 times 
in 20 games.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves To Ease Cuban Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm groups are cheering a move by the Senate  
to allow sales of U.S. food and medical supplies to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration recently decided to allow sales of  
food and medicine to three other countries listed as terrorist 
states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- but was barred from including Cuba 
by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sales would be permitted under a provision tucked into an  
Agriculture Department passed Wednesday night by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think markets like Cuba show large potential, especially  
for wheat and rice. We don't see any reason why we shouldn't be 
allowed to sell to them,'' Wayne Hammon of the National Association 
of Wheat Growers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has no such provision in its version of the USDA bill  
and would have to agree with lifting the restrictions on Cuba 
trade. Similar measures have been rejected in House committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has not taken a position on the Cuba  
measure. But President Clinton has said he has no intention of 
lifting the trade embargo, which has been in place since shortly 
after Castro took over in 1959. Congress strengthened the embargo 
in 1996 with the Helms-Burton law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate provision allows the government to issues licenses  
for up to one year for food and medicine sales to public 
institutions in Cuba but bars the sales from being subsidized. The 
legislation also prohibits the president from including food and 
medicine in future embargoes without congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a triumph for the American farmer, the people of Cuba,  
and common sense, and restores U.S. policy to the moral high 
ground,'' said Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.

<HEADLINE> Via Technologies Aiming at Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In another move to take on Intel Corp. in the  
chip-set-making industry, Via Technologies Inc. said it has agreed 
to buy the microprocessing unit of Integrated Device Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei-based Via said in a statement Thursday that it will  
acquire the WinChip microprocessor unit and x86-architecture 
microprocessing design team from Integrated Device Technology, 
based in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Via and Integrated also agreed to a patent cross-license  
agreement for each company's chip technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Merritt, an analyst with Semico Research Corp., based in  
Phoenix, said the move ``substantially strengthens Via's position 
in the chip set market,'' where Via currently is the No. 2 
supplier, behind Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Via announced a $167 million agreement with  
Santa Clara, Calif.-based National Semiconductor Corp. to buy 
National's Cyrix unit, which makes low-priced PC computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, in response to falling processor prices, Integrated  
Device Technology announced it was exiting the x86-chip market, 
chips designed to be clones of Intel's popular x86 chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Via's action this week should increase pressure on manufacturers  
to lower prices in the market for chip-sets, components designed to 
perform and manage one or more related functions, such as those of 
a modem, in a PC.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Fans See History Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- In a frenzy rivaling last year's march toward  
70 home runs, Mark McGwire gave St. Louis fans even more than they 
expected Thursday -- not just his 500th homer, but his 501st, too. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's third-inning blast set off three minutes of fireworks,  
streamers and well-behaved chaos among the sellout crowd of 45,106 
at Busch Stadium. As an encore, he hit No. 501 in the eighth 
inning, setting off another round of hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never even saw the ball leave his bat because there were so  
many cameras going off,'' Marshall Gralnick said after No. 500. 
``It took me a minute to tell that he got a home run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The atmosphere was reminiscent of last September, when McGwire  
pursued, equaled and then toppled Roger Maris' single-season home 
run record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's history in the making, and I love it,'' said Ron  
Hallowell, who drove to the game from St. Joseph, Mo., with his 
7-year-old son Kyle. ``I told my son that we're going to keep his 
ticket to tonight's game. We'll probably still be talking about 
this in 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans also hoped to see San Diego star Tony Gwynn get two hits  
become the 22nd member of the 3,000-hit club. Instead, he went 
1-for-4 with a two-run double in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave Gwynn a standing ovation as he goes to Montreal  
with 2,999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being here tonight was exciting because of McGwire, but I am  
rooting for Gwynn, too,'' Gralnick said. ``I was glad to see 
everybody stand up every time he came up to bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen of Gwynn's relatives and NL president Len Coleman were  
part of the standing-room-only crowd which included a few who paid 
scalpers $150 or more for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it would happen tonight,'' said Linda Mahfood. ``I was  
here to see McGwire hit his first and 70th home runs last season. I 
just knew tonight was the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the game, a variety of collectibles went on sale  
at venues throughout Busch Stadium. Pro Player and Joy Athletic 
preprinted T-shirts marking McGwire's milestone. Rawlings Sporting 
Goods Co. made 500 hand-numbered commemorative baseballs and 1,999 
mini bats, while Fotoball had 5,000 baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who got me in here told me I owed them one big, and  
I'm here to buy them shirts,'' said Joe Reid of St. Louis. Sadly 
for Reid, all the shirts and other 500 memorabilia were gone by the 
time he got to the front of the line. 
</P>
<P>
	But 9-year-old Andrew Walker and his 8-year-old brother, Joshua,  
packed their gloves into the stadium in hopes of catching the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought our tickets back in April,'' said the boys' father,  
Don Walker. ``It wasn't until last week that I realized we might 
have a chance to see history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family from Broken Arrow, Okla., picked the game because it  
featured players favored by Andrew and Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew wears Gwynn's No. 19 on his Little League uniform, while  
Joshua sports McGwire's No. 25 on his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we walked up to the stadium, they kept saying, 'This is so  
cool. This is so cool,''' said their mother, Wendy Walker.

<HEADLINE> Magic Look to Post-Penny Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Four years after they looked like the NBA's team of the future,  
the Orlando Magic are starting all over. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's trade sending Penny Hardaway to the Phoenix Suns  
completed the dismantling of a once-dominant club that made it to 
the NBA Finals in 1995, then was unable to build on that success. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal fled for the Los Angeles Lakers, Dennis Scott  
wore out his welcome, and Nick Anderson and Horace Grant were 
traded away this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Hardaway, he'll be remembered as the player who begged to  
be united with Shaq and then whined his way out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the goal for this franchise is to still win a world  
championship, even though that may not come just next year,'' 
general manager John Gabriel said. ``The trade of Penny Hardaway 
sets the foundation for us for the relaunching of this franchise 
and this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel also pulled off trades the past six weeks to unload the  
other starters from the team that that was swept by Houston in the 
'95 Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant was sent to Seattle in a draft-night deal that brought  
Corey Maggette, a flashy 19-year-old swingman who left Duke after 
his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the lone remaining player from Orlando's inaugural  
season 10 years ago, was sent to Sacramento for Tariq Abdul-Wahad 
and a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Hardaway, Orlando received 32-year-old Danny  
Manning, second-year pro Pat Garrity and two future first-round 
picks. Despite Manning's age, the deal followed a plan to put 
together a younger, more athletic team under first-year coach Doc 
Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel lauded owner Rich DeVos' courage to give his blessings  
to part with Hardaway, who did not handle the role of team leader 
well after O'Neal's departure in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star orchestrated the firing of former coach  
Brian Hill in 1997 and bickered the past two seasons with Chuck 
Daly, who retired in May after Orlando lost to Philadelphia in the 
first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway also infuriated fans, who grew tired of excuses for  
disappearing at crunch time and what was perceived as his 
unwillingness to forgive them for booing him when a draft-night 
trade brought him to the Magic in exchange for Chris Webber in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the Magic bowed out of the playoffs, he said he felt  
unappreciated in Orlando and that a change of scenery might be best 
for him and the team. He apologized the next day, but the damage 
had been done. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers to talk radio shows in Orlando were overwhelmingly in  
favor of getting rid of the 28-year-old guard, although few felt 
the Magic got enough in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans thought Tom Gugliotta should have been obtained in any  
deal with the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel, noting that the team had explored the prospect of  
trading Hardaway more than once, suggested he didn't have many 
options. The deal sat on the table for several days, and there 
wasn't a flood of last-minute offers from other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it fits our goal and our plan, maybe more than one  
that would perceive that he had to get a superstar for a 
superstar,'' the general manager said, adding that he talked to 
Hardaway twice in the 24 hours before the trade was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make sure that we spoke to him and that this was  
the road he wanted to go. ... He said, `Gabe, I can tell you right 
now, it's not about not loving Orlando. It's about wanting to be in 
Phoenix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal adds to an impressive stash of first-round draft picks  
Gabriel will have to help rebuild the franchise. The Magic will 
have three first-rounders next year, including picks from Golden 
State and Denver, and seven more in the following four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving Hardaway, Grant and Anderson also has positioned them to  
be active in the free-agent market in coming years. Gabriel expects 
to drop more than $10 million below the salary cap by 2001.

<HEADLINE> Japanese-American Memorial Gets OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A small memorial park near the Capitol to  
recall the 115,000 Japanese-Americans the U.S. government interned 
in World War II got unanimously approval Thursday from the National 
Capital Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground-breaking is scheduled for October, with work to be  
completed a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-foot statue of two winged cranes struggling through barbed  
wire will dominate the site. The three-quarter acre park will also 
commemorate the Japanese-Americans who fought in the U.S. armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The walls around the plaza are intended to evoke a sense of  
confinement, commemorating the experience of internment,'' the 
commission's staff said in evaluating the project. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a row of Japanese cherry trees, a shallow pool  
with boulders to recall the islands of Japan and an 18-foot bell 
like those in Japanese temples. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry Tsutsumida, who has been directing the project, said $8.6  
million has been collected for the work, with an additional $2 
million sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's Fine Arts Commission has yet to approve a final  
model of the statue, and the inscriptions along the 7-foot tall, 
3-inch thick granite wall around the central plaza. Approval could 
come at a meeting in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some wonderful quotes, but too many of them,''  
Chairman J. Carter Brown of the Fine Arts Commission said after a 
meeting last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the names of Japanese-American veterans, the wall  
is expected to carry statements from postwar presidents repudiating 
the internment. The Supreme Court had upheld it as a war measure 
but Congress has voted compensation to those interned. 
</P>
<P>
	The planning commission also approved without discussion another  
small park with a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, whose campaign of 
nonviolence helped bring independence to India. The government of 
India is donating an 8-foot-8-inch statue of Gandhi, to face the 
Indian Embassy on Massachusetts Avenue.

<HEADLINE> 2 Americans set Pan Am Swim Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Record performances by Staciana Stitts  
and Karen Campbell finally gave the beleaguered United States 
women's swimming team a major boost at the Pan American Games on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old Stitts, who has the disease alopecia, which  
causes hair to fall out, smashed the Pan Ams record in the 
100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1 minute, 9.16 seconds in 
leading a 1-2 American finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, 22, a black belt in taekwondo, shattered the record in  
the 100 butterfly in the preliminaries in 59.70, then won the final 
in 1:00.05, the first time in this competition the final was slower 
than the heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which has dominated the men's races, added two more  
golds for a total of five, and Canada won the other men's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's 400 freestyle relay team of 100 freestyle champion  
Fernando Scherer, Cesar Quintaes, Andre Cordeiro and 200 freestyle 
gold medalist Gustavo Borges set a Pan Ams record of 3:17.18, after 
teammate Luiz Lima won the 400 freestyle in 3:52.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Another games record was broken in the men's 200 breaststroke as  
Canada's Morgan Knabe won in 2:14.73. Americans Steven West, 27, 
the oldest member of the team, and 16-year-old Mark Gangloff 
finished 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The victories by Stitts and Campbell stopped the Canadians' gold  
rush in the women's events. Before Thursday, the Canadians had won 
seven of eight finals, with the Americans winning the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Stitts said her baldness, which she has had for five years,  
works in her favor in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally awesome,'' said Stitts, who will be a freshman at  
California in the fall. ``It's beneficial to swimming when I'm 
shaved down. I'm so glad I'm in swimming. I don't know where I'd be 
without it. The sport is a big ego-booster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stitts, of Carlsbad, Calif., said she doesn't know whether the  
disease is genetic or an immune disorder; no one in her family that 
she knows has had it. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hair grows back in the summer ... it sprouts,'' she said.  
``I shave it off because it looks silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the hair began falling out, Stitts tried hiding her head  
with hats for a year, then stopped wearing the caps because she 
felt comfortable with her look. 
</P>
<P>
	Her winning time broke the Pan Ams record of 1:10.30 by American  
Tierney Dorsay in 1991. The next two finishers also went under the 
previous record. Kristen Woodring of Sinking Springs, Pa., was 
second in 1:09.65 and 200 breaststroke champion Lauren Van Ooosten 
of Canada finished third in 1:10.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell's performance in the prelims broke the record of  
1:00.53 set in 1979 by Jill Sterkel, an assistant coach on the U.S. 
swim team. Sterkel watched in surprise as her record fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel old,'' she said. ``I didn't even remember  
that I had the record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Campbell nor Sterkel thought the fifth-year senior at  
Southern California would go out so fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out faster than I had planned,'' the co-captain of the  
U.S. women's swim team said after clocking 27.39 for the first 50 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was looking to go out in the high 27s,'' Sterkel, an  
Olympic relay gold medalist in 1976, said. ``It was neat to see 
that kind of speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The door is open for her to go as far as she likes. People  
used to think that when you reached a certain age, you were washed 
up. Not now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell's first 50 meters in the final weren't as quick as in  
the prelims. Still, she had the lead with 27.55 and wound up 
beating two Canadians. Jessica Deglau, already a gold medalist in 
the 200 freestyle and two relays, got the silver, followed by 
Karine Chevrier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's races, the United States also picked up silvers in  
the 400 freestyle, with Austin Ramirez finishing with a 
personal-best 3:53.64 behind Lima, and in the relay.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fair and dry weather was the norm on Thursday across the eastern  
third of the nation. Scattered showers were seen across the Plains, 
while parts of the West also saw rain. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure across the Ohio Valley south into the Mid-Atlantic  
region, the Tennessee Valley and the Southeast brought mostly fair 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered afternoon and evening showers were seen across  
portions of central and southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	A weakening frontal boundary across the nation's mid-section  
continued to bring some scattered showers and thunderstorms across 
portions of the central and southern Plains. These showers and 
thunderstorms were located across portions of western Kansas, 
southwestern Nebraska, western Oklahoma, New Mexico and northwest 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsoonal flow continued to pump moisture into the  
Desert-Southwest and the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were seen across  
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming and Montana. A 
weak storm system also brought scattered showers to the Pacific 
Northwest in Oregon and Washington. Fair and dry weather continues 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of 43 in  
Eagle River, Wis. The early-afternoon high was 99 in Fort Hood, 
Texas. With the heat index, it felt like 109 in New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Lifts Boy Scout Ban on Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Boy Scouts of America plan to ask the  
U.S. Supreme Court to uphold its ban on homosexuals, claiming 
constitutional rights of free association and speech includes a 
right to exclude gays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll argue the First Amendment,'' attorney George Davidson  
said after New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled the ban on homosexuals 
is illegal under the state's anti-discrimination laws -- the first 
time a state high court has invalidated the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Wednesday that the private organization is  
subject to state laws because it is a ``place of public 
accommodation'' and so cannot deny any person ``advantages, 
facilities and privileges'' on account of of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a victory for James Dale, an assistant  
scoutmaster who was kicked out of the Boy Scouts nine years ago 
when leaders found out he is gay. He sued seeking reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court of New Jersey is wonderful,'' Dale said.  
``This is exactly what scouting has taught me: to believe in the 
system and that goodness will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale, who turned 29 on Monday, called the unanimous decision  
``the best birthday present I could have asked for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, however, called it a ``a sad day when the state  
dictates to parents what role models they must provide for their 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, the silver lining is it gives Boy Scouts the first  
opportunity to go the U.S. Supreme Court and get a definitive 
ruling to put an end to these lawsuits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling contrasted with a March 1998 decision by the  
California Supreme Court in the Boy Scouts' favor. That ruling, 
also unanimous, said the organization was not a business and was 
therefore free to exclude gays, as well as atheists and agnostics. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of that  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey court said the Boy Scouts organization  
constitutes a ``place of public accommodation'' because it has a 
broad-based membership and forms partnerships with public entities 
like police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Written by Chief Justice Deborah Poritz, the ruling dismissed  
assertions by the Boy Scouts that the words ``morally straight'' 
and ``clean'' in the Boy Scout Oath constitute a statement against 
homosexuality and allow it to keep gays out. 
</P>
<P>
	The court doubted young boys ``ascribe any meaning to these  
terms other than a commitment to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing before us ... suggests that one of Boy Scouts'  
purposes is to promote the view that homosexuality is immoral,'' 
the decision reads. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also said Dale's presence in the group would not  
symbolize an endorsement of homosexuality, and it rejected the Boy 
Scouts' contention that striking down their ban violates the 
group's First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale earned 30 merit badges, seven achievement honors and other  
awards, and was an Eagle Scout during his 12 years in the 
organization. He was expelled by the Monmouth Council in 1990 after 
the group learned from a newspaper article that he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale said he would like to return to the Boy Scouts, but the  
promised appeals will likely stall that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, I didn't know I was gay, but the Boy  
Scouts made me feel good about who I was,'' Dale said. ``Whether or 
not they know it, the Boy Scouts do wonderful things for gay kids 
across the country.''

<HEADLINE> IMF: Fed Needs To Raise Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should consider further  
increases in interest rates to keep its economic expansion from 
falling victim to rising inflation, the International Monetary Fund 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, releasing for the first time a summary of the  
discussions its 24-member executive board as part of its annual 
review of the U.S. economy, said directors were worried that unless 
the Federal Reserve acted soon, it could require even larger rate 
hikes down the road to combat inflation, raising the risks of a 
sharp stock market correction and possible recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Directors cautioned that the economy still faced resource  
constraints, and the recent very strong growth in domestic demand 
could not be sustained for much longer without having inflationary 
consequences,'' the IMF summary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF report noted that the Federal Reserve had raised a key  
interest rate by a quarter point on June 30. That was the first 
increase in two years in the federal funds rate, the interest that 
banks charge each other. There is growing concern in U.S. financial 
markets that the Fed will boost rates a second time when officials 
meet Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF summary said that members of its executive board were  
worried that a single rate rise would not be enough to slow the 
U.S. economy to a more sustainable pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many directors considered that, unless there was evidence soon  
that the strength of demand was abating, the authorities should 
tighten monetary policy further to ensure that the expansion 
remained on a sustainable noninflationary path,'' the IMF summary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They emphasized that waiting too long to act would risk having  
to raise interest rates more sharply later to stem a pickup in 
inflation, which would increase the likelihood of a sharp stock 
market correction,'' the IMF said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation IMF, which took the lead in handling the global  
currency crisis, noted its executive board was not unanimous about 
the need for further U.S. rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some other directors, however, were less inclined to think  
that an increase in interest rates would be called for in the near 
future,'' the summary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the summary of the board's discussions on the  
U.S. economy was part of a pilot program adopted in April under 
which the agency will release greater detail on its annual economic 
reviews if authorized to do so by the member country. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics charged that IMF secrecy was one of the contributing  
factors that triggered the Asian currency crisis because it allowed 
investors to be caught by surprise at the severity of economic 
conditions in a number of crisis countries.

<HEADLINE> Three Dead in Alabama Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Three people were shot to death this morning  
at two businesses and a man who had worked at both companies was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in this Birmingham suburb said the 34-year-old suspect  
was arrested after a brief scuffle when officers approached after 
forcing his car to a shoulder of Interstate 65 in nearby Chilton 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelham Police Chief Allan Wade said the suspect worked at  
Ferguson Enterprises, where two of the victims were shot inside the 
company, and was a former employee of Post Airgas, where another 
victim was shot to death a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings happened around 7 a.m, and authorities began  
pursuing the suspect as he drove south from the scene on the 
interstate. 
</P>
<P>
	A gun was recovered from the man's car, Wade said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wade identified the victims as Lee Hall Brooks, 32, of Pelham,  
Christopher Yancey, 28, of Alabaster, and Harry Jarvis, 39, of 
Montevallo. Brooks and Yancey were employees at Ferguson 
Enterprises and Jarvis worked at Post Airgas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the suspect was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	The shootings came one week after frustrated investor Mark O.  
Barton fatally shot nine people and injured 13 others at two 
brokerage firms in Atlanta in one of the worst office massacres 
ever. Pelham is 145 miles west of Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Details on Skinhead in Death Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ala. (AP) -- A skinhead who testified he beat a gay man  
to death out of hatred for homosexuals was described in court today 
as having had oral sex himself with a man at a party. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Eric Mullins, an unemployed former convict, had testified  
Wednesday that he invited Charles Butler Jr. to join him in killing 
Billy Jack Gaither because Butler also hated homosexuals. Mullins 
said he was angry that Gaither had propositioned him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the testimony of Mullins, a prosecution witness in the  
capital murder trial of Butler, was challenged in court this 
morning, with the defense trying to disprove Mullins' claim of 
hating homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Dean, who described himself as a homosexual from  
Sylacauga, testified that he had oral sex with Mullins during a 
party of homosexuals last fall in a neighboring county. 
</P>
<P>
	Two gay women also testified they saw Dean and Mullins dancing  
together. The women said Mullins was concerned whether anyone else 
from Sylacauga would see him at the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaither's brother, William Gaither, has contended that Mullins  
killed his brother to keep the gay man from telling anyone they had 
a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins testified Wednesday that he lured Gaither to his death  
by promising him sex with Butler, a boyish-looking sixth-grade 
dropout. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury deliberations were expected to begin later today in  
Butler's in this central Alabama town so small it doesn't have a 
motel, restaurant or traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins, 25, has pleaded guilty to capital murder in the Feb. 19  
beating death of Gaither, 39. In return, District Attorney Fred 
Thompson promised to recommend a sentence of life without parole 
rather than the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, 21, admitted in a statement to police that he helped  
Mullins burn Gaither's body atop a pile of old tires and set 
Gaither's car on fire to destroy evidence. But Butler blamed 
Mullins for cutting the victim's throat and beating him to death 
with an ax handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Rochester told Butler twice Wednesday that he could  
have the same plea deal that Mullins accepted, but Butler refused. 
Defense attorney Billy Hill said his client may have helped destroy 
evidence, but is not a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins has the shaved head of a skinhead and ``SS'' tattooed on  
his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a racial tattoo. It's a skinhead tattoo,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mullins said he had been unemployed after serving 2 1/2 years in  
prison for burglary and forgery and that Gaither became a drinking 
friend who sometimes gave him rides to bars. He said their 
friendship turned sour in mid-February when Gaither propositioned 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he began making plans to kill Gaither and invited  
Butler, a construction worker and longtime friend, to join him 
because he ``didn't like queers either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Mullins' testimony, he acknowledged he killed Gaither,  
but he said Butler suggested the boat ramp where the victim's 
throat was cut and offered him a pocketknife in case he wanted to 
cut Gaither's throat a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors looked at their feet as Mullins described how he refused  
the offer and instead used an ax handle to beat Gaither until his 
skull was fractured in three places and his face collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Bear Stearns Settles for $38.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors defrauded by a small brokerage will  
get $30 million from Bear Stearns &AMP; Cos. Inc., a big Wall Street 
firm that processed their transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement announced Thursday, which totals $38.5 million  
and was accompanied by the resignation of a top Bear Stearns 
executive, closes a two-year investigation by federal and New York 
City authorities into Bear Stearns' relationship with the smaller 
brokerage, A.R. Baron &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bear Stearns neither admitted nor denied  
wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns processed trades, a lucrative financial function  
known as clearing, for A.R. Baron from mid-1995 through mid-1996. 
The now-defunct A.R. Baron, which also was based in New York, 
failed in 1997 and is in bankruptcy proceedings. Customers, some of 
whom have sued, have contended they lost a total of $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Walker, enforcement director of the Securities and  
Exchange Commission, said at a news conference in New York that 
Bear Stearns ignored repeated signs that A.R. Baron was cheating 
its customers. Walker said the sanctions are meant to punish Bear 
Stearns and send a message to other financial firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope the responsible people in the industry will see  
this and realize that you cannot turn a blind eye to fraudulent 
conduct,'' said Walker. He was accompanied by Manhattan District 
Attorney Robert Morgenthau. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, the SEC filed fraud charges against Richard  
Harriton, the president of Bear Stearns Securities Corp., a 
subsidiary that clears transactions for other brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Harriton resigned from the firm and said he would fight the  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement with Bear Stearns includes a $5 million civil  
fine, one of the largest levied by the SEC on a single company in 
recent months but far from record. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement headed off a civil lawsuit by the SEC, which was  
believed to be imminent, as well as criminal prosecution by 
Morgenthau's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns is not required to plead guilty to any criminal  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will pay $30 million to establish a fund for  
compensating defrauded investors. Bear Stearns also will pay fines 
of $1 million to New York state, $1 million to New York City and an 
additional $1.5 million to Morgenthau's office to cover costs of 
its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bear Stearns agreed to hire an independent  
consultant named by the SEC who will review the company's 
operations and make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Bear Stearns said its agreement to settle the  
case ``was a prudent business decision undertaken to end what has 
become a distraction for the company, its shareholders, its 
employees and its customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the settlement would not materially hurt its  
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	An official at a securities industry trade group said the  
stepped up regulation on the profitable sideline to trading may 
have a bigger impact on regulators than clearing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firms, in terms of tracking some of this information, may  
have more work,'' said Mike Udoff, a staff advisor for the 
Securities Industry Association. ``I think they can handle that 
without it having a major economic impact on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real stress, he said, would fall on the exchanges and  
regulators themselves, which will have to process more information 
from all of the clearing houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenthau won securities fraud convictions in 1997 and 1998  
against 13 former A.R. Baron executives and brokers for using the 
firm to defraud investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling A.R. Baron ``a corrupt criminal enterprise,'' he said  
Thursday that its victims included ``some people who invested their 
life savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late June, Bear Stearns disclosed a $25 million tentative  
settlement with the SEC, comprised of a $5 million fine and $20 
million to settle claims of A.R. Baron customers. Negotiations had 
been continuing since then.

<P>
	Bear Stearns is one of the two largest clearing operations in  
the country, along with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc.'s

their accounts with one another. 
</P>
<P>
	All the clearing firms are facing stiff new compliance  
requirements from the National Association of Securities Dealers, a

<HEADLINE> Young Campers Allege Marine Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several black Washington area youths were  
subjected to racial taunts during a week-long military camp 
sponsored by the Marine Corps, according to The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen Washington area youths attended the Young Marines  
summer camp two weeks ago at Camp Lejeune, N.C. While there, one 
youth's mattress was ripped, his military boots were stolen and his 
wooden locker was covered with racial epithets scribbled in 
toothpaste, the newspaper said in its Thursday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another camper returned to his barracks and found a picture of  
his deceased parents torn and scattered on the floor, money and 
uniforms taken and the smell of stale urine in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never go back (to Camp Lejeune) for an encampment,''  
Leonard McFerson, commander of the Nation's Capitol Young Marines, 
told the Post. ``I try to get (youths) out of the city and show 
them something different, and if that's what they're going to see, 
I might as well let them run around the street and be gang 
members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Dave Lapan, a spokesman for the U.S. Marine Corps -- which  
provides financial and logistical support to Young Marines but does 
not oversee the nonprofit group -- said, ``Incidents like that are 
certainly contrary to everything we believe in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We support the Young Marines' taking disciplinary action  
against those found accountable,'' Lapan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-week military camp features obstacles courses, drills  
and other activities aimed at fostering discipline, honesty and 
self-esteem in boys and girls ages 8 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Hall, a 15-year-old from Oxon Hill, Md., said the  
incidents made him feel ``violated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kessler, the incoming national executive director of  
Young Marines, has launched an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I saw wasn't teasing, and that bothers me a lot,''  
Kessler said.

<HEADLINE> Drought Takes Its Toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In parched public parks and private backyards across the East,  
the record-breaking drought is ruining some of summer's most basic 
pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished gardeners battle to save their plants, golf course  
fairways turn brown and picnickers spread their blankets over 
straw-colored grass under trees that are losing leaves seven weeks 
before the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like a fire or flood, where you see the damage right  
away,'' said New York City's parks commissioner, Henry Stern. 
``It's a gradually tightening noose, cutting off the water supply 
to our trees and flowers until they wither and die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Grubb, a manager at Village Nurseries in Hightstown, N.J.,  
said: ``Every day we lose some plants ... It's like sea captains on 
their ships -- when someone dies on your watch, you feel bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is devastating crops and ruining lawns from Virginia  
to New England. Parts of the worst-hit Middle Atlantic States are 
seeing the driest 12-month period ever recorded. Experts say it 
could take a massive tropical storm to reverse the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland, where the rainfall deficit is about 10 inches, on  
Wednesday became the first of the stricken states to impose 
mandatory water-use restrictions backed by the threat of fines of 
up to $1,000. The governor prohibited lawn-watering and home car 
washing and ordered people to turn off fountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the drought region, farmers have taken the hardest  
economic blow. Also hard hit: the traditional refuges of summer -- 
parks, gardens and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already lost most of our lawns,'' Stern said of New  
York's parks. ``Now the trees have begun to shed as a defensive 
measure -- the leaves are falling and the trees are going brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawn at the National Mall in Washington D.C. is burnt brown  
with an occasional patch of green grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass and trees on the White House grounds are faring better.  
Once a week, the grounds are soaked for an hour or longer. But if 
the city decides on a water ban, even the presidential trees and 
shrubs have to do without. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just doing enough to keep the garden from totally  
dying,'' said Irwin Williams, superintendent of the White House 
gardens and grounds. ``The crucial time is August, because of the 
heat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey authorities have banned all outdoor fires in state  
parks and forests, and some hiking and walking trails in the 
northern part of the state have been closed. On New York's Long 
Island, 140,000 acres of parks and nature preserves are off limits 
until the drought eases. 
</P>
<P>
	At Longwood Gardens, a 1,050-acre botanic gardens near  
Philadelphia, water consumption is being cut back by 50,000 gallons 
a day. Flower beds are being hand-watered, lawns not watered at 
all, and a popular fountain display is operating 90 minutes per 
week instead of the usual nine hours per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Longwood spokesman Colvin Randall says the drought's scars may  
be long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ultimate problem would be trees under stress,'' he said.  
``We have trees that are up to 200 years old. They could be 
severely weakened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Central Park, the drought has had a patchwork  
effect. While employees hose down flower beds, and sprinklers 
target the biggest lawns, swaths of dead grass cover the space 
between. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a pool back home,'' said Lisa Mohn of Columbia, S.C.,  
who brought her son Jason to the park for some baseball practice 
Wednesday. ``What we're doing up here in the drought, I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In central New Jersey, Grubb said customers were pleading for  
advice about drought-related woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are desperate -- they want to know how to keep their  
plants alive,'' he said. ``We suggest they use drip irrigation 
instead of a regular sprinkler because it uses less water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Svoboda of the National Drought Mitigation Center in  
Lincoln, Neb., said the only plausible scenario for reversing the 
drought this year would be a couple of tropical storms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it's not a full-blown hurricane,'' he said. ``But what  
it's going to take to break this drought is rain from something 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of West Virginia has been declared a drought disaster and  
Virginia is seeking the same designation for parts of the state. 
Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey either have declared drought 
emergencies or are in the process of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania's governor imposed mandatory restrictions in 55 of  
the state's counties, but compliance remains voluntary in the 
remaining 12. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, Gov. Parris Glendening said the new conservation  
measures would be necessary to stave off worse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge everyone to work with us,'' he said. ``This is a time  
to pull together and head off what could be a serious crisis.''

<HEADLINE> Sullivan, Maple Leafs in 2-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Forward Steve Sullivan, who had career highs in  
both goals scored and points last season, re-signed with the 
Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan signed a two-year deal worth $1.9 million. He will earn  
$825,000 this season and $1.07 million in 2000-2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan played in 63 games last season with Toronto, scoring 20  
and 40 points. He was one of six Maple Leafs to score 20 or more 
goals this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan has been in the NHL for five season. The Leafs acquired  
him in February, 1997 as part of a five-player deal with New Jersey 
in which the Devils acquired former Toronto captain Doug Gilmour.

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks To Aid Tobacco Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They grow a crop the government doesn't want  
people to buy, yet the Senate wants to give tobacco farmers $328 
million to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers say they need the cash that's tucked in a $7.4  
billion package of farm aid to compensate for the money they're 
losing from declining cigarette sales and lagging exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco farmers have their backs against the wall in terms of  
this agricultural crisis as much as any other farmers,'' said Larry 
Wooten, a North Carolina grower. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say tobacco isn't just any crop.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was a step backwards,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.  
``It certainly is inconsistent for us to be subsidizing tobacco 
while we tell people how dangerous it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders put the money in the farm assistance package  
at the request of senators from tobacco growing states. Most of the 
money in the legislation, about $6 billion, would go to grain and 
soybean growers. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought that has parched much of the East Coast this summer  
has largely spared tobacco crops. But the government, which 
stabilizes tobacco prices by regulating production, cut back 
sharply on how much tobacco farmers could grow this year because of 
declining domestic and foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotas were reduced by 29 percent for burley tobacco and 17  
percent for flue-cured. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is putting a lot of farmers in a financial bind,'' said  
Blake Brown, an agricultural economist at North Carolina State 
University. ``They can't grow or sell tobacco without a quota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco growers will share in a $5.2 billion trust fund that's  
being set up by cigarette companies to compensate them for 
declining cigarette sales, and growers also are likely to get a 
share of the industry's $206 billion settlement with state 
governments.	   But money from the trust fund won't start flowing before next 
year, and farmers say they need help now. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the emergency aid package, other farmers are getting  
compensated for lost income, and I felt that tobacco farmers 
should, too,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ``While prices for 
other commodities will rise in the future, the income lost due to 
the cut in tobacco quota will not return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate bill, the $328 million would be distributed  
according to the same formula as the trust funds, which has yet to 
be finalized. That money is likely to go to quota owners, who don't 
necessarily farm themselves, as well as growers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version of the agriculture spending bill for fiscal  
2000, which starts Oct. 1, has no money for tobacco farmers. A 
House-Senate conference committee will work out the final version 
of the farm-assistance package after lawmakers return in September 
from a monthlong recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will survive,'' Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.,  
said of the tobacco money. ``I don't think the United States as a 
policy wants to be supporting tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antismoking groups have been trying to persuade tobacco farmers  
to plant other crops. The Senate aid won't help that cause, ``but 
the farm economy is in such a bad state that telling them to switch 
to something else like corn or soybeans doesn't make sense,'' said 
Scott Ballin of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to see this money to go to other uses, like buying  
out quotas or economic development funds,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> BMW Plans Thailand Output Mext Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- German luxury car maker BMW AG will  
start rolling sedans off the production lines at a new plant in 
Thailand early next year, hoping to capitalize on a nascent 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Cordoba, president of BMW (Thailand), told The Associated  
Press in an interview that production targets of 10,000 vehicles 
per year should be reached by 2004 and will initially be aimed at 
the Thai market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Afterward, we will study the possibilities of expanding our  
market to cover all the countries around Thailand, the Southeast 
Asian markets, and expand production to 20,000 to 30,000 units a 
year,'' Cordoba said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $32 million plant in the eastern auto production center of  
Rayong, where U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors 
Corp. also have facilities, is viewed by BMW as getting a bigger 
foot in the Asian market. Until now, the firm has relied on a local 
partner to assemble the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand has become the primary offshore Southeast Asian  
manufacturing center for many of the world's big carmakers, 
particularly the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic market shrunk when the Asian economic crisis struck  
in 1997, but manufacturers are increasingly tooling Thai plants to 
export vehicles to other parts of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordoba said location, availability of suppliers, trained  
workers and infrastructure were key factors in locating a plant in 
Thailand. It will join BMW's non-German factories in South 
Carolina, South Africa, Austria and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come to Thailand as long-term investors,'' Cordoba  
said. ``You have to look at the possibilities of the country. The 
Thai market has huge potential.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Talks With Hispanic Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George Bush stepped up  
his courtship of Hispanic voters Thursday, telling community 
leaders, ``You are part of the dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week after angering Hispanics by skipping a high-profile  
advocacy group convention, Bush rejected English-only proposals, 
called for ``more humane'' border enforcement and backed trade 
deals aimed at bolstering relations with Mexico. ``A healthy Mexico 
is good for America,'' Bush told about 50 leaders of the Hispanic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no doubt that Bush was making his meeting with  
Hispanic leaders the centerpiece of his latest campaign swing. It's 
long been a part of his effort, but there have been a couple of 
high-profile meetings he's skipped that angered some Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
	During this swing, Bush sought to ease those worries.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want Republicans to see that I am willing to make an active  
effort to reach out to the Hispanic community,'' said Bush. ``This 
is a concerted effort to broaden the base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with the activists, Bush slid back and forth between  
English and Spanish, taking occasionally pointed questions in both 
languages. Speaking in Spanish at one point he apologized for 
switching to English. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to destroy a beautiful language.'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush routinely include snippets of Spanish in his stump  
speeches, and did well among Hispanic voters in his last election. 
</P>
<P>
	But he angered some in the Hispanic community recently when he  
declined to speak to the National Council of La Raza, a Latino 
advocacy group. Bush was vacationing in Maine at the time and cited 
that conflict in declining. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bush declined to speak at a meeting of minority  
journalists in Seattle, though he was campaigning in that city at 
the time. He did make a brief appearance at that event. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore -- who, like Bush, routinely speaks  
Spanish on the campaign trail -- addressed both groups, and Bush 
sought to repair any damaged relations. He invited reporters and 
photographers into a session where he courted Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things this campaign is going to do is bring new  
faces and new voices into the Republican Party,'' said Bush. ``We 
must have a bigger base if we hope to capture the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He faced a broad range of questions on immigration issues, and  
he firmly rejected volatile issues like English-only which have 
caused problems for Republicans among Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support English-plus, not English-only,'' said Bush.  
``English-only says to me that if Hispanic happens to be your 
heritage, you're not part of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush pledged to revisit guest worker programs and other ways for  
immigrants to come into the country, but said he would insist on 
immigration controls and a waiting period before citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Some argued that Bush has ground to make up, and said many  
Hispanics noticed his skipping of important meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a start for us to start to repair the damage,'' said  
Paula Plasencia. ``He needs to have a Hispanic agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanic voters have been heading to Democrats, some  
argued that there was an opportunity for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time both parties have taken the minorities for  
granted,'' said Mike Murillo. ``We have been a pawn and we need to 
have our needs addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's comments could bring some tensions to the GOP race.  
Conservative Republicans generally take an anti-immigration line, 
with some like commentator Pat Buchanan calling for construction of 
a fence along the southern border. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my fellow Republicans think it's a good idea,'' Bush  
said of his appeal to Hispanics. ``I hope they understand how 
important the Hispanic community is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others made it clear Bush has some ground to make up before  
Hispanics will move into the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Sanchez said many Hispanics remain deeply offended by  
ballot issues in California and elsewhere widely viewed as 
anti-immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to listen to people talking in our own language,  
we want to hear them talk about our issues,'' Ms. Sanchez said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Suit Seeks Checkups, Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Healthy but still worried, thousands of  
people who took the fen-phen diet drug combination are seeking 
millions to pay for years of medical checkups in case they develop 
heart or lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence linking the ``fen'' half of the drug duo with sometimes  
deadly disorders forced two versions of fenfluramine off the market 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began this week in a class-action lawsuit against  
American Home Products, which made fenfluramine. If American Home 
loses the civil trial, it could be forced to pay more than $1 
billion over the next decade, one economist estimated in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implications are huge,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug industry  
analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, N.J. ``You're talking about as 
much as $1,000 per year per patient. Then if you take the national 
implications ... you're looking at some serious problems for the 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit by New Jersey residents is the first class-action case  
against American Home to come to trial and the only one seeking 
payment for medical checkups rather than financial awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home already has settled several of  
about 3,100 individual suits, but those settlements are estimated 
to total only around $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments of a fen-phen trial in Canton, Texas,  
on Wednesday, attorneys for Debbie Stone Lovett said American Home 
hid evidence that its diet drugs caused heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovett, a 36-year-old manicurist, said she developed leaky heart  
valves after taking fenfluramine. She is seeking unspecified 
damages in the case, now before the jury, which deliberated today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, about 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine,  
which was sold under the brand name Pondimin, or its chemical 
look-alike, dexfenfluramine, sold under the name Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home pulled both drugs off pharmacy shelves in  
September 1997, several months after the first reports from the 
Mayo Clinic linking the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve 
damage in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The company insists there's no scientific proof that patients  
who stopped taking the drugs about two years ago and have no 
disease now will be injured in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe that routine echocardiograms are not  
medically warranted for patients who have taken these drugs,'' said 
company lawyer Anita Hotchkiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies since the drugs were recalled generally indicate a  
slightly elevated risk of valve disorders, but that it appears to 
fade after patients stop taking them. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.

<HEADLINE>  Race Car Driver Waltrip To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Darrell Waltrip said today it's true -- he is  
retiring after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotion-choked announcement at Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway, one of stock car racing's legendary drivers confirmed 
what has been widely reported for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old three-time Winston Cup champion is calling his  
final season a ``victory tour.'' Waltrip, who hasn't won since 1992 
and rarely misses a punchline, nailed this one on the nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we didn't  
get at least one victory,'' Waltrip said. ``Winning a race now 
would be just as special as winning that first one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making his announcement before qualifying for the sixth  
Brickyard 400 at Indy, Waltrip broke down in tears and summoned his 
wife to the podium for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving this sport, hanging up my helmet, that's hard to talk  
about,'' said Waltrip, the man who stormed into racing and earned 
the nickname ``Jaws'' for his loud mouth now choking back sobs. 
``I've done this for 40 years. Ever since I was 12 years old, we'd 
get up, put on our racing gear and go to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought about the future. What am I going to do  
next year? If I don't win this week, I'll get 'em next week. Well, 
I'm running out of next weeks. That's really the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a Kentucky native who lives in Franklin, Tenn., leads  
all active Winston Cup drivers with 84 career victories but has not 
won a race since Darlington in September 1992. He finished 25th in 
the most recent series race, the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono 
Raceway, and is 38th in the season points. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Race Car Driver Waltrip To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Darrell Waltrip said today it's true -- he is  
retiring after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotion-choked announcement at Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway, one of stock car racing's legendary drivers confirmed 
what has been widely reported for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old three-time Winston Cup champion is calling his  
final season a ``victory tour.'' Waltrip, who hasn't won since 1992 
and rarely misses a punchline, nailed this one on the nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we didn't  
get at least one victory,'' Waltrip said. ``Winning a race now 
would be just as special as winning that first one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making his announcement before qualifying for the sixth  
Brickyard 400 at Indy, Waltrip broke down in tears and summoned his 
wife to the podium for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving this sport, hanging up my helmet, that's hard to talk  
about,'' said Waltrip, the man who stormed into racing and earned 
the nickname ``Jaws'' for his loud mouth now choking back sobs. 
``I've done this for 40 years. Ever since I was 12 years old, we'd 
get up, put on our racing gear and go to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought about the future. What am I going to do  
next year? If I don't win this week, I'll get 'em next week. Well, 
I'm running out of next weeks. That's really the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a Kentucky native who lives in Franklin, Tenn., leads  
all active Winston Cup drivers with 84 career victories but has not 
won a race since Darlington in September 1992. He finished 25th in 
the most recent series race, the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono 
Raceway, and is 38th in the season points. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip sold his team last year after owning it for eight years,  
citing sponsor disputes and other financial reasons. At the time, 
he said the 1999 season would be his last. He changed his mind when 
asked by Travis Carter and Carl Haas to drive the No. 66 KMart Ford 
Taurus for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who has frequently used the former champion's  
provisional to keep his career going, vowed to qualify consistently 
in the top 25 with a new car -- trimmed with flames instead of 
Waltrip's favorite chrome look -- that was unveiled today.

Waltrip said. ``This car should not need a provisional.''

<HEADLINE> Atomic Museum Defends Bomb Earrings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Tiny silver replicas of the first  
atomic bombs that are being sold as earrings at the Atomic National 
Museum are stirring emotions in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very angry,'' council spokesman Naomki Kishimoto said in  
Hiroshima, one of the two Japanese cities hit with atomic blasts in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the sort of thing you should be hanging from your  
ears or using to decorate your desk,'' he said. ``It's unforgivable 
that (the) museum would sell through the Internet something that 
praises the unit that dropped the atomic bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Japanese anti-nuclear group Gensuikyo found the  
earrings and other items, including medallions that commemorate the 
bombing missions over Japan, on the museum's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The earrings are shaped like the ``Little Boy'' and ``Fat Man''  
atomic bombs developed during the war at the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory north of Albuquerque. They sell for $20 a pair at the 
Energy Department museum on Kirtland Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb dubbed ``Little Boy'' was dropped on Hiroshima on Aug.  
6, 1945. Nagasaki was leveled by Fat Man three days later. As many 
as 175,000 people were killed in the two attacks. The Japanese 
surrendered five days after the second bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Jim Walther said Thursday the museum does not  
plan to stop selling the earrings. He said items sold in the museum 
store reflect history and present the work of dedicated scientists 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This museum does not advocate war or the use of nuclear  
weapons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum store manager Tony Sparks said the shop advances the  
argument that the bombings saved the lives of U.S. troops as well 
as pointing out the immorality of war. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to a book with black and white photos of vast areas  
in the Japanese cities where buildings were flattened, but 
acknowledged that the earrings, especially a matched set with one 
of each bomb, are the most popular item in the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware that it's sensitive,'' Sparks said. ``We have such  
a high contingency of Japanese visitors, most of whom are 
interested in hearing our side. We are careful not to glorify it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors on Thursday had a wide range of reactions.  
</P>
<P>
	Lois Dove of South Fork, Colo., said the didn't blame the  
Japanese for objecting to the earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate,'' Dove said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ben Parks of Amarillo, Texas, said he understands the Japanese  
reaction, but thinks the earrings should stay on the shelf since 
the bombs ended the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes back to a few people -- their military leaders. The  
population of Japan didn't have input into what was going on. There 
were innocent casualties and victims,'' Parks said.

<HEADLINE> Penny, Cheaney, Curry On the Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Penny Hardaway was dealt to the Phoenix Suns, Dell Curry burned  
the Bucks by bolting to Toronto and Calbert Cheaney turned down a 
trade to Miami and signed with Boston instead. 
</P>
<P>
	It was another busy day of player movement in the NBA, with no  
move bigger than the one sending Hardaway to the Suns for Danny 
Manning, Pat Garrity and two future first-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's the best thing for (Penny) to get a fresh  
start,'' Orlando general manager John Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway also gets a seven-year, $86 million contract, the  
largest allowed under the league's collective bargaining agreement, 
and will team with Jason Kidd in a star-studded backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	It was bitter day for the Magic, who parted with the last member  
of the 1995 team that went to the NBA Finals. It also was a bitter 
day for the Bucks, who thought they had reached an agreement to 
keep Curry, the league's most accurate 3-point shooter last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave his word two times, than changed his mind,'' Bucks'  
general manager Bob Weinhauer said. ``I don't want to talk about 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaney also left someone fuming, turning down a sign-and-trade  
deal that would have sent him from Washington to Miami. He opted 
instead to sign with Boston, where he figures to be the replacement 
for the traded Ron Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a nice talk with Coach Riley, told him you're a great  
coach, but it just didn't work out,'' Cheaney said. ``It was just a 
gut instinct I had. It's tough to explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Seattle apparently dropped out of the bidding for free agent  
Mitch Richmond and started scrambling to make other moves, even 
trying to acquire the much maligned Donyell Marshall from Golden 
State for Hersey Hawkins. That offer was turned down, and the 
Sonics also got no commitment from free agent forward Gary Trent 
after making another offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Miami emerged as the leading candidate to acquire Richmond but  
needed to find a third team to broker a sign-and-trade deal with 
the Wizards. The Heat were believed to be willing to part with P.J. 
Brown in a Richmond deal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Toronto increased its offer to Charles Oakley, offering him  
about $18 million for three years, while Oakley lowered his asking 
price to $24 million for three years. The Raptors and Lakers were 
discussing a sign-and-trade deal that would send the veteran power 
forward to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rick Fox signed a six-year deal with the Lakers believed to be  
worth $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terry Porter left the Heat and signed with the Spurs, saying  
he didn't want to commit to Miami because of all the uncertainty 
over what the roster will look like next season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shandon Anderson and Jazz remained apart in their contract  
negotiations, although Utah felt its chances of keeping the 
shooting guard had improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Hardaway was a major coup for the Suns, who  
had no room under the salary cap to go after free agents, let alone 
one with his stature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic had tried to work out a deal with the Lakers, Raptors  
and a few other teams, but all of them had dropped out of the 
bidding by the middle of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway opted out of the final three years of his contract and  
became a free agent this summer, but only Chicago, the Los Angeles 
Clippers and Toronto had anywhere near the money available to land 
him. He made it clear to Magic officials over the past few days 
that he did not want to return as Orlando -- especially new coach 
Doc Rivers -- tried in vain to get him to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Magic, it marked the end of an era. Just a few years  
ago, the team looked like it would be an enduring Eastern 
Conference powerhouse when its roster included Hardaway and 
Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the goal for the franchise is to win a world  
championship, even though this might not happen next year,'' 
Gabriel said. ``The trade of Penny Hardaway sets us for the launch 
of a new era and a new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic have traded three starters this offseason, also  
sending Horace Grant to Seattle and Nick Anderson to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry got a three-year, $6 million contract. He led the NBA in  
3-point accuracy last season, shooting 47.6 percent, and will be 
teamed in Toronto with Dee Brown, who led the NBA with 135 
3-pointers and 349 3-point attempts last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a player of great character,'' Toronto general  
manager Glen Grunwald said. ``He'll provide firepower off the 
bench, we're looking forward to having his veteran presence and his 
shooting ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics coach Rick Pitino didn't commit to inserting Cheaney in  
his starting lineup, but said the six-year veteran, who played 
forward and guard for the Wizards last season, would help fill the 
hole left by Mercer at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaney, 28, averaged 7.7 points per game while shooting 41.4  
percent from the field. His best season as a pro was in 1994-1995, 
when he averaged 16.6 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was time for a change,'' he said. ``The last two or  
three seasons were disappointing for me. It was time for a fresh 
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SuperSonics negotiated Thursday with free agent guard Vernon  
Maxwell but did not reach an agreement. Two sources, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that Seattle also 
offered Hawkins to the Warriors for Marshall. The Sonics also made 
an offer to Trent, who played for Dallas last season, that was not 
immediately accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	With Seattle, Golden State and Sacramento out of the Richmond  
sweepstakes, it appeared Miami was the only team left trying to 
make a sign-and-trade deal with Washington. The Wizards have 
already offered Richmond a three-year, $30 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors increased their offer to Oakley by $500,000  
annually, but the sides remained $2 million apart per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had his way, he'd sign with Toronto and be traded to Los  
Angeles both for the desirable location and the team's closeness to 
being able to compete for a championship,'' said Oakley's agent, 
Charles Grantham. ``But he still has no problem staying in 
Toronto.''

<HEADLINE> Workers' Productivity Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American workers' productivity slowed  
significantly in the spring while a key gauge of wage pressures 
jumped sharply, the Labor Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity, defined as the amount of output for each hour of  
work, increased at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent in the 
April-June quarter, far below the 3.6 percent rate of productivity 
growth in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, unit labor costs, considered a key measure of wage  
pressures, surged at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the second 
quarter, the worst showing for this measurement since the end of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jump in unit labor costs far exceeded analysts'  
expectations. Many were looking for a gain around 2.2 percent, 
which would have been a pickup from the modest gains of 0.8 percent 
in the first quarter and an outright decline of 0.4 percent in the 
fourth quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been jittery over the prospects that the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again later this month. 
Those fears were heightened two weeks ago when Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan told Congress that recent strong gains in productivity 
were likely to moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and many other economists believe the good showing on  
productivity has helped keep inflation low. With productivity 
rising sharply, employers are able to boost wages and pay the 
higher salaries through increased output, rather than raising the 
prices of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan warned two weeks ago that if productivity slows,  
wage pressures are likely to quickly surface, given that labor 
markets are the tightest in nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report today, the number of Americans filing new  
claims for unemployment benefits inched up last week after hitting 
their lowest level in two years the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that 279,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 31, up by 
4,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists consider any claims level below 300,000 an indication  
of an extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will release the latest unemployment report on  
Friday and many economists expect the rate -- now at 4.3 percent -- 
will return to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3 percent increase in productivity was the slowest  
quarterly increase since second quarter of last year when 
productivity only rose at a 0.4 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown in productivity reflected the fact that the gross  
domestic product, the total output of good and services, also 
slowed sharply to an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second 
quarter of this year, compared to 4.3 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, productivity rose by 2.2 percent, which was  
almost double the 1.2 percent increase of 1997. Greenspan has noted 
this sharp improvement as evidence to support his view that the 
nation's heavy investment in computers and other 
productivity-enhancing technology is beginning to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.8 percent rate of increase in unit labor costs, compared  
to modest increases of just 2 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had already begun to worry about wage pressures  
following a report last Thursday that the Employment Cost Index, 
which includes both wages and benefits paid to workers, rose at an 
annual rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter of this year, the 
biggest gain in eight years.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe May Miss Game in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Shannon Sharpe is having a bad week.  
</P>
<P>
	Already unhappy about traveling to Australia and dealing with  
its ``rude'' people, the Broncos tight end sprained his ankle 
during today's practice in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury threatens to keep him out of Saturday night's game in  
Sydney against the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether I play or not, I'm still going to be  
hurt,'' Sharpe said as he walked off the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos doctors examined both his knee and ankle and concluded  
Sharpe only had a sprained ankle. Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said 
he didn't think the injury was serious and would not require a 
magnetic resonance imaging test. 
</P>
<P>
	During his stay down under, Sharpe complained that people bumped  
into him and that he had to wait 20 minutes to get a cab. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a bad week, not just a bad day. I think today was  
really the icing on the cake,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Daschle: Jerry Springer Is a Joke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Maybe refereeing all the brawling and bawling  
guests was just training for the real fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Springer, the TV talk show host reviled by many as a pox  
on American culture, is contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate as 
a Democrat. The prospect is drawing condemnation from editorialists 
and office holders across the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want him to run. I think he is a joke,'' Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told The Columbus Dispatch for 
a story today. 
</P>
<P>
	But observers warned against underestimating Springer's  
political skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known Jerry Springer for many years, and I consider him  
the most dangerous man in Ohio politics,'' said Bill Cunningham, a 
conservative talk show host on WLW radio in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he runs, I think he would bring thousands and thousands of  
his fans to the polls just as Jesse `the Body' Ventura brought his 
fans to the polls. Jerry is a fabulous politician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, 55, has said he'll consider running for the seat of  
Republican Sen. Mike DeWine, who is seeking re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would spring on the back of Mike DeWine like a  
jaguar on a ledge springing on the back of a passing water 
buffalo,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer is a former two-term mayor of Cincinnati who ran for  
governor in 1982, then embarked on a TV career, working as an 
anchor and commentator before discovering that foul-mouthed, 
chair-throwing guests could make him the nation's No. 2-rated 
daytime talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine is a former prosecutor whose low-key earnestness led  
colleagues to choose him to preside over Monica Lewinsky's 
deposition in President Clinton's impeachment trial. Messy affairs 
like that are mainstays of ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine has not commented on Springer, but the state's Republican  
chairman, Bob Bennett, has quipped: ``Was Howard Stern busy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents of Springer's hometown say they'd be embarrassed  
to send him to Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a joke,'' said Alvin Bell, 37, of Cincinnati. ``If people  
are dumb enough to vote for him, they deserve what they get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Carol Batis, 43, thinks Springer would make a great senator.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a real good person. He tries to help people on  
his show and help solve their problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a Senate run surfaced July 20 in The Plain Dealer of  
Cleveland. Hamilton County Democratic Party Chairman Tim Burke, a 
friend of Springer, told the newspaper the talk-show host would be 
a ``viable, fascinating, interesting candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrong, wrong and wrong,'' the Plain Dealer editorialized the  
next day. A spasm of righteousness rippled across the state. An 
editorial in The Vindicator of Youngstown called Springer 
``ringmaster of the nation's sleaziest circus.'' Toledo Mayor Carty 
Finkbeiner said Springer would get in the way of his party's 
emphasis on ``family values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer put out a statement saying: ``I'm obviously flattered  
and honored by the interest. It's just that at this time I don't 
know whether it's practical or possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer said he'll decide by Labor Day.  
</P>
<P>
	Springer left the country for a vacation late last month after  
his show went on hiatus and was not available to comment further, 
his publicist Linda Shaffron said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Democratic Chairman David Leland said party officials would  
decide later this year whether to endorse a candidate. Columbus 
lawyer Richard Cordray, the party's unsuccessful candidate for 
state attorney general last year, is seeking that backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leland said he hadn't heard from Springer, but if he does he'll  
tell him that people across the state have strong feelings about a 
possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who are incensed about the fact that he would  
do this,'' Leland said. ``They think it would not be a good 
thing,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Leland said, some people are volunteering to help  
Springer, others think he has no chance and yet a third group is 
scared he'd win.

<HEADLINE> Drought Plagues Mid-Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- In drought-ravaged Maryland, retired  
teacher Starr Myklebust takes water from her kitchen sink and 
bathtub to tend to the potted hibiscus and geraniums on her 
backyard deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I rinse a real soapy pan, I put that to the side because  
I don't want to kill my plants,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walkersville woman was coping with water use restrictions  
along with the rest of Maryland, facing its worse drought in 70 
years. Maryland was the first state to impose statewide 
restrictions, but others in the parched Mid-Atlantic region were 
moving toward at least partial mandatory measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In Delaware, Gov. Thomas Carper on Thursday declared a drought  
emergency and mandatory water restrictions for two-thirds of the 
state's estimated 724,000 residents who live in the northern tip. 
Violators will be subject to fines from $50 to $500; Carper said 
residents failed to heed voluntary restrictions.

	In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman declared a drought  
emergency Thursday that allows the state to impose mandatory water 
restrictions and fines up to $1,000. The state's 13 reservoirs are 
at nearly 9 percent below normal capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's statewide emergency restrictions, announced by Gov.  
Parris Glendening on Wednesday and enforceable by a $1,000 fine or 
six months in jail, shut down car washes and fountains.

	Baltimore City officials prepared to tap the Susquehanna River  
to bolster dwindling water reserves while ordinary citizens tried 
to cope with a ban on most outdoor watering.

	Competitor Wade Manning doesn't recycle water at his car wash.  
His eight self-service bays were closed on Thursday while Manning

<HEADLINE> Study: Fish Oil Reduces Heart Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- People who have suffered heart attacks can reduce  
their risk of heart-related death by 30 percent by taking a fish 
oil capsule every day, a new study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are looking for more than circumstantial evidence  
of a benefit of fish oil will find reassurance from this,'' Dr. 
Morris Brown, a Cambridge University researcher, said of the 
Italian study -- the most rigorous to date investigating the oil's 
potential heart-healthy properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a  
British medical journal, also looked at the benefits of vitamin E 
pills. But, unlike other studies, it did not find they offer heart 
attack survivors protection from further heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``For both of these dietary components, there is a wealth of  
circumstantial evidence for benefit,'' wrote Brown, who was not 
connected with the study, in a commentary published separately in 
the journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, both fish oil and vitamin E were found to offer  
benefits in studies examining past eating habits. However, in 
studies where the nutrients were introduced into the diet, the 
results have been conflicting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian study involved 11,324 men and women who had suffered  
a heart attack no more than three months before. 
</P>
<P>
	They were divided into four groups and followed for 3 1/2 years.  
</P>
<P>
	One group was given a 1-gram capsule of omega-3 fish oil a day,  
about the amount found in most commercial supplements. The second 
group was given a 300-mg vitamin E pill each day, again an average 
amount. The third group was given both, and the rest were given 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	All the subjects had similar eating habits both before and  
during the study and were taking similar prescription drugs for 
their heart troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that a capsule of omega-3 fish oil each  
day reduced the combined risk of death, stroke and heart attack by 
15 percent. Most of the benefit was due to a 30 percent drop in the 
risk of heart-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe fish oil may help the heart by lessening the  
inflammation involved in hardening of the artery walls. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all building a case. The case is considerably stronger  
now than it was before,'' said Dr. Michael Burr, a University of 
Wales researcher whose own work found a similar result among people 
eating lots of fatty fish, such as mackerel, salmon and fresh tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, led by Dr. Roberto Marchioli, a heart disease expert  
at the Consorzio Mario Negri Sud research institute in southern 
Italy, showed no clear benefit of vitamin E or of combining the 
vitamin with fish oil capsules. 
</P>
<P>
	That conflicts with a 1996 American study, which showed that  
women who eat lots of vitamin E-rich food cut their chances of 
heart disease by almost two-thirds. A British study the same year 
indicated that taking vitamin E pills daily seems to reduce heart 
attacks by 75 percent among people with bad hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin E is one of a group of nutrients known as antioxidants  
for their ability to offset the damage done by oxygen to the body. 
It is used to prevent heart attacks and treat Alzheimer's in some 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's authors speculated that the disappointing vitamin E  
finding may have been because their Italian subjects were eating a 
heart-healthy Mediterranean diet already rich in vitamin E, leaving 
little room for improvement by adding pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Or perhaps people need to take vitamin E for a longer period  
before they start to reap the benefits, they said. The dose also 
was lower than has been used in other studies, even though it was 
still 10 times higher than the recommended daily allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other ongoing studies of vitamin E on different  
populations that will better show the effect of vitamin E and we 
should wait to see what those say,'' Marchioli said.

<HEADLINE> Plant Evolution Theories Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The plant and animal kingdoms actually  
represent five distinct groups, according to scientists who 
announced discoveries that fundamentally alter long-standing 
theories about the evolution of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers presented data showing that green plants, red plants  
and brown plants (mostly algae and seaweeds), evolved from three 
different one-celled plants, and so deserve to be considered 
individual kingdoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers are among 200 scientists from 12 countries  
involved in the ``Deep Green'' project, a five-year effort to 
reconstruct the evolutionary tree of life for green plants. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that the many families of green plants living on land  
today descended from a single, green freshwater ``Eve,'' a relative 
of which still lives in pristine lakes as it did more than a 
billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	New data indicate that the ``Eve'' was something similar to  
today's coleochaetes, tiny green plants about the size of a pinhead 
and just one cell thick, which require fresh water that is 
completely free of pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This overturns traditional thinking among scientists and what  
is taught in every textbook in America,'' said Brent Mishler, a 
biologist at the University of California at Berkeley and one of 
the team leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Current texts say land plants evolved from saltwater plants.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists involved in the study presented their work Wednesday  
in St. Louis at the 16th International Botanical Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has produced the most complete tree of life of any  
group of living things on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings are important because evolutionary relationships  
among plants are crucial in knowing how plants work. Understanding 
this allows researchers to examine chemicals in plants for their 
medicinal value. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Deep Green's other key findings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The members of what has traditionally been called the plant  
kingdom should actually be divided into four separate kingdoms. 
</P>
<P>
	-- One of those kingdoms, fungi, is more closely related to  
animals than to plants. That means a mushroom is more closely 
related to a human being than the tree it grows on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't really think of life on Earth in terms of only the  
`animal kingdom' and the `plant kingdom' anymore,'' Mishler said. 
``In fact, there are five kingdoms of complex organisms on Earth 
today.''

<HEADLINE> German Jobless Rate Rises in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's unemployment rose above the politically  
charged 4 million mark in July as job growth continued to lag 
behind the recovery developing in Europe's largest economy, the 
Labor Office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unadjusted number of jobless rose to 4.027 million, or 10.3  
percent, up from 10.1 percent a month earlier, the Labor Office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Office president Bernhard Jagoda blamed the increase on  
summer vacations and the end of the school year, when companies are 
hesitant to hire people who they know will be taking their 
traditional lengthy summer holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The German central bank, which releases seasonally adjusted  
numbers, said the jobless rate was unchanged at 10.5 percent in 
July, with only 1,000 more people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was not as bad as some expectations. But analysts  
said real improvement would likely not be seen until the end of the 
year, when recent positive indicators for the German economy -- such 
as rising orders and exports -- begin to make a dent in the jobless 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no bad number, but it's also not a good number,'' said  
Ulrich Beckmann, an analyst with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ``The 
only thing which you can see is that it's not deteriorating 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagoda, though, said even an improvement in the economy won't  
help the job market much. He said structural reforms to Germany's 
notoriously rigid, expensive labor market are the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're waiting for the warm rain of the economy, then  
you'll be disappointed,'' Jagoda said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of unemployed Germans topped 4 million in 1997 and  
has remained stubbornly stuck around that level. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate contributed to last year's defeat of  
long-serving conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder's government has pledged to reduce the level by 
at least 1 million by 2002, but has had little success so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagoda said economic conditions were improving most markedly in  
the former West Germany, where most industry is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Germany's unadjusted unemployment rate was 8.6 percent  
in July, up from 8.4 percent in June. That compared with 17.4 
percent, up from 16.8 percent, in former communist eastern Germany.
